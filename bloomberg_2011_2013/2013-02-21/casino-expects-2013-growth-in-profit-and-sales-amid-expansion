Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA said it
aims to post growth in sales and profit in 2013 as the company
cuts prices in French hypermarkets and expands internationally.  The grocer aims for “strong growth in reported sales”
while advancing trading profit, the St. Etienne, France-based
company said in a statement on its website today.  “Casino will pursue its strategy of back-to-basics in
 France  and organic growth internationally, while working to
maintain its financial structure,” Jean-Charles Naouri, the
company’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  The retailer today posted 2012 sales growth of 22 percent
and said trading profit rose 29 percent to 2 billion euros.
Analysts had estimated profit on that measure of 1.94 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
