Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) , a maker
cancer drugs, reported a fourth-quarter loss that was less than
analysts’ estimates as sales of newly approved therapies rose
faster than expected.  Onyx reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $42.9 million,
or 64 cents a share, compared with net income of $216.7 million,
or $3.16, a year earlier, the South  San Francisco , California-
based company said today in a statement. The loss excluding one-
time items of 36 cents topped by 38 cents the average of 14
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Onyx won approval for two therapies last year, Kyprolis,
for the blood cancer multiple myeloma, and Stivarga, for
advanced-colorectal cancer. The company’s third medicine,
Nexavar, a treatment for kidney and liver cancer developed with
 Bayer AG (BAYN) , reached $1 billion in sales in 2011.  Onyx said 2012 revenue was $362.2 million. Analysts had
expected $347.6 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales of Kyprolis reached $64 million for the year,
while analysts estimated $48 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
