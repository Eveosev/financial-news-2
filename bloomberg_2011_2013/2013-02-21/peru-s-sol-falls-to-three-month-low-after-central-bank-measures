Peru ’s sol closed at its weakest
level in three months after dollar purchases by the central bank
and pension funds diminished local supply of the greenback.  The sol fell 0.3 percent to 2.5890 per  U.S. dollar , the
lowest close since Nov. 23, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  Peru has bought $3.3 billion this year to stem gains in the
local currency, which according to the country’s financial
regulator touched a 16-year high of 2.5390 on Jan. 14. Policy
makers relaxed the limit on private pension fund investments
overseas Feb. 15 and have raised banks’ dollar  reserve
requirements  twice this year to cool sol appreciation.  “The central bank has made significant purchases so the
market has been left with relatively few dollars,” said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru SA in Lima. “There’s
a need for dollars because banks have to meet the reserve
requirements and pension funds have a greater space to invest
overseas.”  The monetary authority said on its website it didn’t  buy
dollars  today.  Policy makers will probably continue to raise reserve
requirements and ease the pensions limit this year to tame the
sol,  BBVA Banco Continental  said in an e-mailed report to
clients yesterday.  Dollar inflows will increase on mining investment and
demand from Peruvian companies for dollar-based financing from
abroad, spurring a 4.7 percent advance in the sol to 2.45 per
dollar in 2013, the Lima-based lender said.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.76 percent at 3:22 p.m. in  Lima , according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.13 centimo to 126.21
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
