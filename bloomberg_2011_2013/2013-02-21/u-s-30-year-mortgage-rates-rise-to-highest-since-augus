U.S.  mortgage rates  for 30-year
fixed loans rose, increasing long-term borrowing costs after
construction of single-family homes climbed to a four-year high.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.56
percent in the week ended today, up from 3.53 percent and the
highest level since Aug. 30, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac 
said in a statement. The average 15-year rate held at 2.77
percent.  Interest rates  at near-record lows and a shrinking  supply 
of existing homes on the market are supporting demand for new
houses. Builders  broke ground  in January on the most U.S.
single-family homes since July 2008 and  permits  for future
construction climbed, figures from the Commerce Department
showed yesterday.  “Mortgage rates are still very, very low,” Celia Chen, a
housing economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in  West Chester ,
 Pennsylvania , said yesterday in a telephone interview. “They’re
likely to stay low at least another year.”  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to  Freddie Mac. (FMCC)  The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent, also the lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
