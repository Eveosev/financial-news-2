The euro may weaken to its lowest
level in six weeks versus the dollar after reaching a “new
corrective low” today, according to  UBS AG (UBSN) , citing technical
indicators.  If the shared currency breaches support levels at $1.3219
and then $1.3187, it could decline to $1.3063,  Richard Adcock ,
head of fixed-income technical strategy at UBS in  London , wrote
today in a note to clients. It last touched $1.3063 on Jan. 10.
UBS canceled its recommendation the euro will gain amid a recent
decline in the currency, which has fallen 1.7 percent versus the
greenback since touching yesterday’s high.  “The concern is now that we have more bearish trading
conditions in place,” Adcock said in a telephone interview.
“It’s not an outright bearish picture just yet, but we’ll need
to see how markets will defend support levels.”  The 17-nation currency declined 0.7 percent to $1.3197 at
12:42 p.m. in New York after slipping to $1.3168. The euro
reached $1.3711 on Feb. 1, its strongest level since November
2011.  A break above a resistance level at $1.3434 may result in a
move higher to $1.3520, Adcock said. That would match the euro’s
high from last week. UBS has a year-end forecast of $1.20,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The euro has increased 6.1 percent in the last six months,
the best performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen fell
17 percent, while the dollar has declined 0.5 percent.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
