Safeway Inc. (SWY)  advanced the most ever
after the second-largest U.S. grocery chain reported fourth-
quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates on higher
stores sales.  The  shares  climbed 14 percent to $22.97 at the close in New
York for the biggest gain since the company’s 1990 initial
public offering.  Safeway is working to compete with big-box retailers such
as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  with its grocery and fuel loyalty
programs. Last month, Safeway announced Chief Executive Officer
Steven Burd will retire in May after 20 years at the company. A
replacement hasn’t been announced.  Net income  in the quarter ended Dec. 29 rose 13 percent to
$244 million, or $1.02 a share, from $215.6 million, or 67
cents, a year earlier, the Pleasanton, California-based  company
said in a statement today. Excluding gains from legal
settlements profit was 94 cents a share. Analysts estimated 76
cents, the average of 19 projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue increased 1.2 percent to $13.8 billion, helped by
higher gift and prepaid card sales and an 0.8 percent gain in
identical-store sales, excluding fuel.  Safeway has advanced 27 percent this year, compared with a
gain of 4.4 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Food Retail
Index.  The company has about 1,640 stores in the U.S. and  Canada .
 Kroger Co. (KR)  is the biggest U.S. grocery-store chain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
