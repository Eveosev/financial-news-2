Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC) , a water
purification, activated carbon and ultraviolet light
disinfection specialist, reported fourth-quarter results that
beat analysts’ estimates.  Sales rose 2.6 percent to $141.8 million as earnings of 16
cents per share on a profit of $9.1 million topped six analysts’
median estimate of 14 cents a share, Pittburgh-based Calgon said
today in a statement.  The shares climbed as much as 4.1 percent, the most in two
weeks, in  New York  trading. They’ve now gained 18 percent this
year. “The company’s performance for the quarter was solid
despite a challenging business environment,’’ Chief Executive
Officer Randy Dearth said in the earnings statement.  “We continue to believe that emerging environmental
markets, including mercury removal from coal-fired power plants,
ballast water treatment and control of disinfection byproducts
in drinking water, will provide opportunities for significant
growth throughout this decade,” Dearth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
