Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  said it added
4.9 trillion yen ($52.5 billion) of retail assets in January,
the biggest monthly gain in at least a decade, as individual
investors purchased more stocks and mutual funds.  Japan ’s biggest brokerage boosted total assets under
management by 6.7 percent to 78.5 trillion yen as of Jan. 31
from a month earlier, Kenji Yamashita, a spokesman at Nomura in
Tokyo, said in a phone interview. Retail assets are the highest
since December 2007, when it managed 81.3 trillion yen, he said.  Nomura’s domestic retail business, accounting for almost
half of its pretax securities profit, is benefiting from a stock
rally spurred by investors’ expectations that Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe’s stimulus plans will revive the world’s third-
largest economy. The jump in assets may boost the Tokyo-based
company’s brokerage commissions, which climbed 13 percent to
83.7 billion yen in the quarter ended Dec. 31.  The firm earned 43.4 billion yen in pretax profit from the
domestic retail operations in the nine months ended Dec. 31,
accounting for 45 percent of its total securities income.  Shares of Nomura fell 2 percent to 533 yen at the close of
trading in  Tokyo . They jumped 66 percent in the past three
months, outpacing the Nikkei 225 Stock Average’s 23 percent
gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
