Bovespa stock-index futures fell,
signaling the stock gauge may retreat for a seventh day, as
commodities declined on concern  China ’s property curb and
contraction in the euro region will sap global growth.  Iron-ore mining company  Vale SA (VALE3)  slid in Frankfurt trading.
Steelmaker  Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  may be active after reporting profit in the
fourth quarter missed analysts’ estimate.  Bovespa-index  futures  slipped 0.6 percent to 56,165 at 9:21
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.9664 per
dollar, depreciating for a second day. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI index of 24 raw materials fell 1 percent after the Chinese
government demanded that local authorities restrain real estate
speculation and euro-area services and manufacturing sectors
contracted at a faster pace than economists forecast in
February.  As almost all main commodities prices are declining today,
“we expect the Brazilian exchange to retract today,”  Banco
Bradesco (BBDC4)  economists led by Octavio de Barros wrote in a note to
clients. Materials producers account for 43 percent of the
Bovespa gauge.  The Bovespa trades at 10.6 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for the next four quarters, compared with 10.5 for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 8.2 billion reais
($4.2 billion) yesterday, which compares with a daily average of
7.5 billion reais this year, according to data compiled by the
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
