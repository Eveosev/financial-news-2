U.S. farmers will plant 56 million
acres with wheat in the year starting June 1, up 0.5 percent
from the previous year, according to  Joe Glauber , the chief
economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg
News  was 56.27 million.  The plantings will produce a crop of 2.1 billion bushels,
down 7.4 percent, as dry soils from the worst drought since the
1930s hurts yields, Glauber said today at the USDAâ€™s annual
outlook forum in Arlington, Virginia.  Prices will average $7 a bushel during the crop year, down
11 percent from the previous year, the USDA forecast. The May
futures contract fell 1.1 percent to $7.35 at 9:09 a.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
