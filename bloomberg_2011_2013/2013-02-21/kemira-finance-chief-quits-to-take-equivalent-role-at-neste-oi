Kemira Oyj (KRA1V) , Europe’s largest
supplier of water-treatment chemicals, said Jyrki Maeki-Kala has
stepped down as finance chief to take on a similar role at  Neste
Oil Oyj. (NES1V)   Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Buechele will take over
Maeki-Kala’s position on a temporary basis until a successor is
found, spokeswoman Leena Lie said. A recruitment process is
under way, extending to both external and internal candidates.  Maeki-Kala is ending a seven-year spell at Kemira that’s
seen the Helsinki-based company transform from a diversified
chemical supplier to a niche supplier of treatments for
industrial waste water and municipal drinking supplies. He
officially steps down on May 5.  A successor will be hired “as soon as possible,” Lie said
by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
