Light distillate  inventories in
Singapore, Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
rebounded 13 percent in the last week, the most since September,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate rose 1.19 million barrels to 10.7 million in the seven
days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest percentage gain
since the week ended Sept. 26.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene climbed 1.17 million barrels, or 12
percent, to 10.6 million, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the
first increase in three weeks.  Residual-fuel inventories including fuel oil and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen climbed 1.79 million barrels,
or 9.5 percent, to 20.6 million, according to the data.
Stockpiles advanced to a three-week high.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
