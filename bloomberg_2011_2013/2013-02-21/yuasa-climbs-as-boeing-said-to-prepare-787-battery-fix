GS Yuasa Corp. (6674) , the battery maker
for  Boeing (BA)  Co.’s grounded 787s, rose the most in more than a
year as the planemaker is said to ready proposed fixes to ensure
the jet’s batteries won’t damage the aircraft or emit smoke.  Yuasa  rose  8 percent, the most since November 2011, to 352
yen at the close of trading in  Tokyo . Today’s gain erased the
Kyoto-based battery maker’s share-price drop this year.  A Boeing team is scheduled to meet in  Washington  with the
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration Feb. 22, said the people,
who weren’t authorized to discuss the session and asked not to
be identified. The plan includes a harder battery case and a
venting mechanism for fumes, one person said.  U.S. and Japanese authorities are investigating the cause
of a battery fire on a  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  plane last month,
followed by smoke that caused the emergency landing of an  All
Nippon Airways Co. (9202)  flight and led to Boeing 787 Dreamliners
being grounded globally from Jan. 16.  Tsutomu Nishijima, a Kyoto-based spokesman for GS Yuasa,
which makes  lithium-ion batteries  for the 787, declined to
comment on the battery fixes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
