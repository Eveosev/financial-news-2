EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  shareholders re-elected
Chairman Mike Rake and approved Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall’s 1.99 million-pound ($3 million) 2012 pay package,
overruling objections from founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou.  Just under 56 percent of shareholders voted to retain Rake,
who plans to step down in mid-2013 once a replacement is
appointed, the Luton, England-based company said in a statement
today. Directors’ remuneration for the year was approved by a
margin of 11 percentage points, EasyJet said.  McCall and her team have taken advantage of “flexibility”
offered by a decision in 2002 to shift the fleet to Airbus SAS
A320 aircraft, including turning 15 options for the plane into
firm orders in January 2011, Rake said in the statement. The
decisions “have contributed to the strong performance of the
company.”  Stelios, who goes by his first name, has questioned Rake’s
re-appointment, arguing that the chairman lacked the
accountability to make long-term decisions because of his plan
to step down. The entrepreneur has conducted a four-year
campaign against EasyJet’s growth strategy, arguing that the
airline should focus more on boosting profit margins and
dividends and opposing the move to A320s, which he says
represent poor value versus the  Boeing Co. (BA)  737s originally in
the fleet.  EasyJet  fell  as much as 2 percent to 995 pence and was
trading down 1.8 percent at 2:06 p.m. in  London . That pared the
stock’s gain this year to 30 percent, valuing the airline at
3.95 billion pounds.  The carrier said in January that it’s evaluating new
aircraft and may exercise options to buy three A320s to ensure
it has capacity for summer 2014. Newer, more fuel-efficient
aircraft will improve cost advantages over competitors and help
retain better positions at airports, the carrier has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
