Copper slumped to a seven-week low
and nickel tumbled to the lowest level in 12 weeks after  China 
moved to curb property speculation and Federal Reserve minutes
showed a debate over the stimulus. Aluminum, lead, zinc, and tin
also declined.  Copper for delivery in three months lost as much as 0.8
percent to $7,900 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the
lowest since Dec. 31, before trading at $7,935 at 10:11 a.m.
Shanghai time. Nickel dropped as much as 1.9 percent to $16,840
a ton, the lowest since Nov. 28.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao called on local authorities to
“decisively” curb real estate speculation and take steps to
rein in the property market after data showed prices surged the
most in two years last month. Several Federal Reserve policy
makers said the U.S. central bank should be ready to vary the
pace of bond purchases amid a debate over the risks and benefits
of further quantitative easing.  “The Fed minutes and concerns over China’s property sector
hurt market sentiment, weighing down China’s stocks market and
commodities,” said Peng Guoliang, an analyst at Dadi Futures
Co. The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost as much as 2
percent to 2,349.518, the lowest since Jan. 30.  Copper for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
declined 1.6 percent to 57,700  yuan  ($9,239) a ton, while the
May contract on the Comex in New York fell 0.4 percent to
$3.6105 per pound.  On the LME, aluminum dropped for a fourth day as analysts
estimated stockpiles in China may have climbed to a record
level. Lead fell to a four-week low, zinc to the lowest level in
three weeks and tin was at the lowest level since Jan. 2.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
