Anglo American Plc. (AAL)  opened an office
in Mongolia headed by Graeme Hancock, the former operating chief
of the country’s biggest state miner, to expand its business in
the coal- and copper-rich nation.  Hancock, who stepped down last month as COO of coal miner
Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, becomes Anglo American’s chief
representative and president in Mongolia, the London-based
company said in an e-mailed statement. Anglo, the third-largest
mining company, opened the office in the capital Ulan Bator to
develop “preferred” commodities, according to the statement,
which didn’t elaborate.  Mongolia is tightening regulation on overseas investment
amid public criticism that the cash pouring in from mining
projects is benefiting an elite not the broader society. Anglo
rival  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , Mongolia’s biggest investor, is locked in
a dispute with the government over control of the $6.6 billion
Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project.  “I look forward to building strong working relationships
with the government, the business community, civil society and
the local communities,” Hancock said. “These relationships,
built upon dignity and respect, are essential for the company to
become a valued development partner for Mongolia.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
