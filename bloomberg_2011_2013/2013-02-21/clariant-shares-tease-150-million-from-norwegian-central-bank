Clariant AG (CLN)  attracted a $150 million
investment from  Norway ’s central bank, which has become one of
the Swiss chemical company’s top 10 shareholders.  “I would assume they are quite long term and hence
stable,” Patrick Rafaisz, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG in
Zurich, said by e-mail.  Clariant is undergoing its biggest transformation since its
spinoff from drugmaker Sandoz in 1995 as it builds out catalyst
and consumer-chemical units and sells lower-performing leather-
treatment, detergents, and intermediates businesses. The
potential earnings drivers of cost savings and high-margin
products are not fully factored in by analysts, according to
Markus Mayer, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets.  A group of former shareholders of Sued-Chemie, bought by
Clariant for about $2.2 billion in 2011, hold the largest stake.  Shares of Clariant traded 2.8 percent lower at 13.88 francs
as of 9:44 a.m. in Zurich. The wider Swiss market was 0.9
percent lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
