Investment AB Latour (LATOB) , which owns
stakes in Swedish companies such as  Assa Abloy AB (ASSAB)  and  Securitas
AB (SECUB) , fell the most in over nine months after Swedbank cut its
estimates on the value of the group’s unlisted assets and
downgraded the shares to reduce.  The share declined as much as 3.7 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since May 14. Latour fell 2.8 percent to 141
kronor as of 2:10 p.m. in Stockholm, giving the company a market
value of 24.4 billion kronor ($3.8 billion). Swedbank cut the
stock from neutral and reduced the price estimate to 138 kronor
a share from 140 kronor.  Order intake and sales in Gothenburg-based Latour’s wholly
owned industrial operations declined 8 percent in the fourth
quarter and earnings before interest and taxes declined 15
percent to 153 million kronor. The company’s unlisted holdings
include Hultafors AB, Specma AB and Swegon AB.  Swedbank analyst Niclas Hoglund downgraded his value
estimate for Latour’s non-listed holdings and said in a note to
clients that the company trades at a net asset value discount of
14 percent, well below the 12-month trend.  “Our neutral portfolio view does not balance downside
risks related to the discount,” Hoglund said. It will be “a
key negative value driver short-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
