Apple Inc. and  Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930)  must narrow their patent-infringement lawsuit case scheduled
for trial in 2014, a judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh in San Jose,  California ,
today told lawyers from both companies that they must “focus
and streamline” their cases to 25 patent claims, or elements of
the patents at issue, and 25 accused products.  Koh made the request from the bench today in the latest of
two related patent cases. The lawsuit was filed last year and
covers technology in newer smartphones made by both companies,
including Samsung’s Galaxy S III and Apple’s iPhone 5.  “We’ll keep narrowing and narrowing,” Koh said. “You’ve
already been litigating this thing for a year; you must know
something about what’s your best case.”  In a filing last week, Cupertino, California-based Apple
included Samsung’s Galaxy Note smartphones and tablet computer
in the case. Samsung claimed “all generations” of Apple’s
iPhone and iPads infringe at least three of its patents,
according to its filing.  Koh last month rejected Apple’s request to add additional
damages to the first patent-infringement case between the two
companies in San Jose. In that case, a jury awarded Apple $1.05
billion, finding the Suwon, South Korea-based company infringed
six of the iPhone maker’s mobile-device patents.  Last year’s case is  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  v. Samsung Electronics Co.
Ltd., 11-cv-1846, the case scheduled for trial next year is
Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-630, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
