The  World Bank ’s  International
Finance Corp . will lend $75 million to  Serbia ’s Victoria Group
AD to improve finances and expand business ranging from oilseeds
to food products.  The Belgrade-based company, consisting of 10 units that
trade grains and oilseeds, process oil crops, make food, fodder,
fertilizers and other related chemicals, will use the six-year
loan “for short-term and long-term refinancing,” and to
upgrade its business.  The loan agreement, signed today, should help Serbia, where
agriculture accounts for about a fifth of economic output,
expand food and oilseeds production, the IFC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
