Japanese shares slid, with the Topix
Index falling the first time in four days, amid concern the U.S.
Federal Reserve may scale back stimulus and  China  may step up
tightening. Resource stocks fell after commodity prices dropped.  Inpex Corp. lost 2.8 percent to lead declines among oil
producers. Fanuc Corp., which supplies robotics used in Chinese
factories, declined 2.2 percent. GS Yuasa Corp., which makes
batteries for Boeing Co., jumped 8 percent on optimism the
planemaker is preparing fixes for battery problems that grounded
the 787 Dreamliner. Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. gained
0.8 percent on a report its unit will cut a fifth of its
workforce.  The Topix lost 1.1 percent to 962.86 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, with about two shares falling for each that
gained and all but two of the gauge’s 33 industry groups
declining. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 1.4 percent to
11,309.13.  “ Oil prices , much like other financial markets, are being
hit by the negative news about a possible decline in stimulus,”
said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which oversees about 1.79 trillion yen ($19
billion). “The Fed needs to discuss how it will eventually end
its stimulus program, but at this stage a roll back will be
taken negatively by investors,”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The equity gauge fell 1.2 percent in  New York  yesterday,
the biggest drop since November, as minutes of the  Federal Open
Market Committee ’s Jan. 29-30 meeting showed policy makers were
divided about the strategy behind Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s
program of buying bonds until there is “substantial”
improvement in a U.S. labor market.  Commodities Drop  West Texas Intermediate oil dropped for a second day,
extending the biggest decline in three months, the  London Metals
Exchange Index (LMEX)  of six industrial commodities fell for a fourth
day, retreating 0.9 percent. Copper for delivery in three months
lost as much as 0.8 percent to $7,900 a metric ton.  Inpex,  Japan ’s biggest energy explorer, fell 2.8 percent to
497,500 yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. slipped 2.6 percent
to 3,530 yen. Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Japan’s second-biggest
copper smelter, slumped 5.6 percent to 1,427 yen.  Stocks linked to China fell today after the nation’s State
Council told local authorities to “decisively” curb real
estate speculation and take steps to rein in the  property
market , stopping short of imposing fresh measures after prices
rose the most in two years last month.  Fanuc declined 2.2 percent to 14,260 yen. Komatsu Ltd., a
machinery maker which counts on China for 14 percent of its
sales, dropped 4.1 percent to 2,311 yen.  Daikin Industries Ltd. (6367) ,
a maker of air conditioners which gets about 18 percent of its
revenue from China, slid 2.9 percent to 3,390 yen.  GS Yuasa Jumps  Among stocks that rose, GS Yuasa jumped 8 percent to 352
yen, the  biggest increase  on the Nikkei 225 and its steepest
advance since November 2011. Boeing officials tomorrow will
present regulators with a redesign of the 787 Dreamliner’s
battery that they believe will satisfy long-term safety concerns
and allow the jet back into the air within weeks, people with
knowledge of the proposal said.  Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, also known as NTT, increased
0.8 percent to 4,330 yen, the  biggest support  to the  Topix
Index. (TPX)  NTT East, a unit of the telephone operator, plans to cut
6,000 people, or 20 percent of its workforce, in five years, the
Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported.  The Topix surged 33 percent since Nov. 14, when national
elections were announced, amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe and the central bank will lead the country out of deflation.
The measure is trading at 1.1 times book value, compared with
2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index slid 0.4 percent
to 27.06 indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.8 percent
of the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on the
measure was about 25 percent lower than its 30-day intraday
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
