Facebook Inc. (FB) , the operator of a
social network with 1.1 billion users, may struggle to keep pace
with the need to educate customers and governments on privacy
issues, according to billionaire co-founder Eduardo Saverin.  While the company’s growth is a “huge asset,” it may also
create misunderstandings, he said at a conference organized by
The Wall Street Journal in Singapore today.  “The biggest risk is growing too fast,” Saverin said.
“When you grow too fast, it’s hard to iterate, educate.”
Saverin helped form the company with Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg . He later pursued a legal
dispute over his stake in the  company , which was ultimately
settled for an undisclosed amount.  Saverin, who renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2011, also
said Facebook was threatened by other companies trying to break
its grip on the social-network market. Zuckerberg has said he
plans to boost spending 50 percent this year to add staff and
roll out new tools for advertisers to help fend off competition.  “There’s always multiple threats to Facebook,” Saverin
said. “There’s a lot of technology companies out there with
tremendous resources and engineering and very experienced talent
that are trying to enter this space,” he said.  Saverin has a net worth of about $1.6 billion, according to
Bloomberg Billionaires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
