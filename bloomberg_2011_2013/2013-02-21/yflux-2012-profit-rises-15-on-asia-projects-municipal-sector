Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , Singapore’s biggest
publicly-traded water company, reported a 15 percent gain in
full-year 2012 profit on increased revenue from municipal
contracts and projects in  Asia  outside of China.  Profit rose to S$61 million ($49.1 million) from $53
million a year earlier, the company said today in a statement.
Revenue for the year climbed 42 percent to S$682.4 million.  Hyflux, which built Singapore’s first water-recycling
plant, said expanding operations and maintenance works boosted
its order book to S$1.9 billion, almost double from 2011.
Contracts from the municipal sector accounted for 92 percent of
total revenue, with projects from Asia outside of China
contributing 73 percent, up from a 47 percent share in 2011.  “This reflected the shift in geographical mix of projects
as major desalination projects in  Middle East  and North Africa
were completed during the year,” according to the statement.  Hyflux shares have  gained  5.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
