U.S. farmers will plant 77.5 million
acres with soybeans this year, up 0.4 percent from 2012, as
growers seek to take advantage of prices driven higher by
drought, according to  Joe Glauber , the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s chief economist.  The average estimate of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey was for 78.111 million acres.  The plantings may produce a record crop of 3.405 billion
bushels, up 13 percent from 2012, Glauber said today at the
USDA’s annual outlook forum in Arlington, Virginia. The bigger
crop will drive prices down 27 percent from 2012, with a bushel
averaging $10.50 for the year, according to the USDA.  Futures reached a record $17.89 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade in September. The May contract fell 0.4 percent
to $14.625 at 8:53 a.m. in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
