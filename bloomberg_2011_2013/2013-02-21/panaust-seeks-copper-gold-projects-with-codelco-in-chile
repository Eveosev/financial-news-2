PanAust Ltd. (PNA) , an Australian operator
of copper and gold mines in Laos and  Thailand , is seeking to
acquire assets in  Chile  with partner Corp Nacional del Cobre de
Chile to add to their Inca de Oro project.  PanAust wants to form ventures with Codelco, as the world’s
largest copper producer is known, for projects that have an
annual output capacity of 50,000 metric tons to 150,000 tons,
Managing Director Gary Stafford said in an interview yesterday.
The partners are studying ways to boost the reserves of Inca de
Oro, 34 percent owned by Codelco, and a decision is expected
next year, he said.  PanAust is boosting investments as it expects copper to
stay between $3.50 and $3.80 a pound this year on sustained
demand and limited supply, he said. Codelco, which invested a
record $4.2 billion in 2012, plans to spend more than $5 billion
this year as it begins to dig underneath its century-old
Chuquicamata mine to access new deposits.  “They’ve got such a massive capital investment program
focused on their core assets” that PanAust has the opportunity
to develop Codelco’s smaller deposits, Stafford said by phone
from  Brisbane , where the PanAust is based. PanAust is seeking
partnerships “with Codelco for projects that aren’t receiving
focus from them at the moment,” he said.  PanAust shares fell 6.8 percent to A$2.62 at the close of
trading in Sydney yesterday, giving the miner a market value of
A$1.6 billion ($1.64 billion). Ten analysts rate the stock a buy,
seven a hold and three a sell, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Copper, which rose 6.3 percent in 2012, has fallen 1.6
percent this year and traded at $3.59 a pound on Comex in New
York as of 4:13 p.m. in Melbourne yesterday. Gold may trade in a
range of $1,500 to $1,800 an ounce on continued central bank
purchases, Stafford said. The metal rose 7.1 percent last year,
the 12th consecutive year of annual gains.  PanAust aims to produce as much as 65,000 tons of copper
and as much as 175,000 ounces of gold this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
