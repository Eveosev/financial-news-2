U.K. natural gas rose for a third
day as temperatures fell below freezing, boosting demand for the
heating fuel to its highest in more than a week.  Within-day gas advanced 2.5 percent, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. The average temperature in the U.K.
through tomorrow will be zero degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit),
down from a previous forecast of 0.1 degree, MetraWeather data
using the GFS model showed at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Gas for today climbed 1.7 pence to 68.9 pence a therm at
4:39 p.m. The  next-month  contract climbed 0.8 percent to 66.9
pence a therm. Thatâ€™s equivalent to $10.20 per million British
thermal units and compares with $3.28 per million Btu of front-
month U.S. gas.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 357
million cubic meters, the most since Feb. 13,  National Grid Plc (NG/) 
data show. The  delivery network  will contain 354 million cubic
meters of gas at the end of the period, up from 349 million at
the beginning, grid data show.  Gas accounted for 32 percent of U.K. power production at
4:25 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 40 percent, nuclear 17
percent and wind 4.3 percent.  Wind power  output will peak at 1,696 megawatts tomorrow
after touching 2,880 megawatts today, according to Bloomberg
calculations. It reached a record 5,082 megawatts Feb. 3, grid
data show.  Electricity for tomorrow dropped 1 percent to 51.25 pounds
a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
