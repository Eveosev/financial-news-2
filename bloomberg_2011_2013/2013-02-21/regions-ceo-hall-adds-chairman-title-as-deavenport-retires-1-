Regions Financial Corp. (RF)  Chief
Executive Officer Grayson Hall will add chairman to his title
after Earnest W. Deavenport retires in May.  Deavenport, 74, has been a director since 1999 and became
non-executive chairman in 2010, the Birmingham, Alabama-based
lender said today in a statement. At the 2011 and 2012
shareholder meetings, he received exemptions to serve beyond the
bank’s retirement age of 72, according to the statement and
 Evelyn Mitchell , a Regions spokeswoman.  Deavenport helped Regions recover after  reporting  six
consecutive quarters of losses starting in 2009. The bank’s
former CEO,  Dowd Ritter , almost doubled its real-estate
construction-loan portfolio, and mortgage loans climbed 59
percent from the end of 2005 through 2007. Soured loans surged
as home prices began to drop, with Regions writing off $3.8
billion in 2008 and 2009. Hall became CEO in March 2010.  Deavenport “helped guide us through a tremendously
difficult environment, and his vision has been integral to
revitalizing our company” Hall, 55, said today in the
statement.  Regions fell 1.6 percent to close at $7.59 today in New
York. The  shares have gained  27 percent in the past 12 months,
compared with an 18 percent increase in the 24-company KBW Bank
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
