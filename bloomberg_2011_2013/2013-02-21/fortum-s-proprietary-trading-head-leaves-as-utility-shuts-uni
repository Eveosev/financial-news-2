Dan Lindstroem,  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V) ’s head of
proprietary trading, left  Finland ’s biggest utility after cost
cuts prompted staff reductions in energy trading.  Lindstroem left the  company  last month, before Fortum
merged its asset-backed trading and proprietary trading units
into a trading and portfolio optimization business on Feb. 15,
Toni Kekkinen, head of the new unit, said today by telephone.  “This will not affect trading itself, and we will continue
to buy and sell energy commodities to the same extent as
before,” Kekkinen said. Fortum will “focus on asset-backed
trading, resulting in an unspecified number of cuts to trading
staff in Stockholm and Finland.”  Fortum started a cost-cutting program that seeks to improve
 cash flow  by more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) over the
next two years after “unacceptable” earnings that missed
analyst estimates for a third consecutive quarter, Chief
Executive Officer Tapio Kuula said when presenting third-quarter
earnings in October. Fourth-quarter sales rose 10 percent to
1.83 billion euros, beating a mean forecast for 1.72 billion
euros, according to 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
