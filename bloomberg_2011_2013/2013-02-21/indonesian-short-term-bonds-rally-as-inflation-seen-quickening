Indonesia ’s short-term bonds rallied,
pushing the two-year yield to a one-year low, on speculation
investors are favoring the notes to guard against accelerating
inflation. Rupiah forwards declined.  Consumer prices will increase 5.2 percent this year from
4.3 percent in 2012, according to the median estimate of 22
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, as the government raises
electricity tariffs by 15 percent.  Global funds  added 2.07
trillion rupiah ($213 million) to their local-currency sovereign
debt holdings in the first two days of this week, finance
ministry data show.  “Price swings on the shorter end are more manageable when
inflation quickens,” said Herdi Wibowo, Jakarta-based head of
debt capital markets at PT BCA Sekuritas, a unit of the nation’s
largest bank by market value. “It is likely that the two-year
yield can set a new record low as foreign holdings continue to
rise.”  The yield on the government’s 11 percent bonds due October
2014 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.32
percent, the lowest level since Feb. 22, 2012, according to
closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.
Benchmark two-year securities reached a record-low of 4.18
percent on Feb. 15, 2012. The yield on the 6.125 percent notes
due May 2028 was steady at 5.96 percent.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards weakened
0.5 percent to 9,740 per dollar as of 4:15 p.m. in Jakarta, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. They traded at a 0.4 percent
discount to the spot rate, which declined 0.2 percent to 9,702,
according to prices from local banks. A daily  fixing  used to
settle the derivative contracts was set at 9,703 today, compared
with 9,704 yesterday, according to the Association of Banks in
 Singapore .  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
