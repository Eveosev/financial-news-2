Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC)  rose to the highest
in three weeks after  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  said it’s in talks
to resolve a U.S. government lawsuit that sought to block a
takeover of the Mexican brewer.  Modelo rose 0.8 percent to 114.45 pesos at 10:33 a.m. in
Mexico City trading, to the highest price on a closing basis
since Jan. 30. Trading volume was more than double the three-
month average. It was the third-biggest advance on the benchmark
Mexican  IPC index , which fell 0.8 percent.  AB InBev,  Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ) , Crown Imports LLC and
the  U.S. Department of Justice  said they will ask the court to
suspend litigation proceedings until March 19, according to an
AB InBev statement issued yesterday. Leuven, Belgium-based AB
InBev agreed in June to buy the 50 percent of Mexico City-based
Modelo it didn’t own, seeking to increase its penetration of
emerging markets.  “There can be no assurance that the discussions will be
successful,” AB InBev said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
