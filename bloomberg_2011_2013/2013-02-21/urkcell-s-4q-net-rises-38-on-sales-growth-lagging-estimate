Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,
Turkey’s biggest mobile phone operator, said its fourth-quarter
profit rose 38 percent from a year earlier as revenue from units
and mobile data services increased.  Net income rose to 459.2 million liras ($256 million),
compared with 331.7 million liras a year earlier, the company
said in a PR Newswire statement. Turkcell was expected to earn
477.3 million liras, according to the average of 14 analysts
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Turkcell, owned by Teliasonera AB, Altimo of  Russia  and
Istanbul-based Cukurova Holding AS, is seeking to boost revenue
as it faces more competition in its home market from  Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD)  and Avea Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, majority owned by
 Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) , in  Turkey .  Turkcell revenue rose to 2.81 billion liras in the fourth
quarter from 2.45 billion liras. It had 35.1 million subscribers
at the end of the fourth quarter, down from 35.2 million in the
previous quarter.  Average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, rose to $12.20
in the fourth quarter from $10.80 a year earlier.  Turkcell expects 2013 consolidated sales to be between 11.2
billion liras and 11.4 billion liras, the statement said. The
operator forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization, or Ebitda, of between 3.3 billion liras and
3.5 billion liras for 2013 and plans investment at 15 percent of
its sales for this year, according to the statement.  Dividends Blocked  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , Altimo of Russia, which is controlled by
billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Alfa Group, and Cukurova Holding
AS of Turkey have been fighting a three-cornered battle for
control of the company for almost a decade. While TeliaSonera is
the largest shareholder with 38 percent, Cukurova has sought to
retain control via a complex ownership structure even as its
stake has declined to 13.8 percent.  TeliaSonera and Altimo blocked a decision on dividend
payments for 2010 and 2011, after failing to oust Chairman Colin Williams from the board, claiming he hampered Turkcell’s growth
by favoring Cukurova chairman and Turkcell founder Mehmet Emin Karamehmet, Turkey’s second-richest man. Williams denied the
allegations.  Cukurova Holding is in talks to raise as much as $2 billion
in loans to repay debt owed to Alfa Group and recover a 13.8
percent share pledged to Alfa as collateral for a $1.7 billion
loan received in 2005, two people with knowledge of the matter
said Feb. 4. A London court ruled on Jan. 30 that Cukurova
should be given an opportunity to repay its debt to Alfa.  “We expect the resumption of dividends in the fourth
quarter of this year, especially as Cukurova will need money to
refinance and service debt,” Ivan Kim, an analyst at VTB
Capital, said in an e-mailed note. VTB has a ’Buy’ rating on the
shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
