Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said he expects the European Union will reach a
compromise over limits on bankers’ bonuses that won’t hurt
London’s financial industry.  Ireland, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU
until the end of June, will seek an accord after talks to
implement the latest round of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision’s rules broke down this week, Noonan said in a
Bloomberg Television interview in London today. The European
Parliament added the bonus caps into the legislation, he said.  “It seems to be the one large issue of substance that’s
left in the negotiations,” he said in the interview with
Francine Lacqua and  Guy Johnson . “We think a via media, a
settlement, can be reached without upsetting the cost base in
the  City of London  or without depriving people of rightfully-
earned bonuses.”  The U.K. is opposed to a draft deal that would cap banker
bonuses at twice fixed pay. Bonuses exceeding fixed salary would
also be subject to vote by shareholders. Such a proposal would
undermine companies’ ability to  reduce  compensation expenses in
a downturn, according to the Confederation of British Industry,
the country’s largest business lobby group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
