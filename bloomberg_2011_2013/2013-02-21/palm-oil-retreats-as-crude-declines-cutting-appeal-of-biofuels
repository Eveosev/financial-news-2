Palm oil  tumbled by the most in a
week on concern that demand for use in biofuels may drop after
crude  oil prices  slumped.  The contract for delivery in May lost 1.1 percent to close
at 2,536 ringgit ($815) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the biggest fall since Feb. 13. That pared gains to 4
percent this year.  Crude oil lost as much as 1.8 percent in New York as an
estimate showed that U.S. stockpiles gained and the U.S. Federal
Reserve signaled it may pare back stimulus. The contract for
April delivery was last at $93.92 a barrel.  “Demand for biodiesel may be lower” after the decline in
crude prices, Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga
Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone. “The selling price of
biodiesel may be lower.”  Several participants at the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s
Jan. 29-30 meeting “emphasized that the committee should be
prepared to vary the pace of asset purchases,” according to
minutes released yesterday. Commodities as tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index fell as much as 1.1 percent today.  Demand for palm oil may also be lower during the winter
season, according to Lim, who expects exports from Malaysia to
drop about 3 percent this month from 1.62 million tons in
January. The tropical oil clouds in cooler temperatures.  Exports from Malaysia, the largest producer after
Indonesia, rose 0.6 percent to 835,612 tons in first 20 days of
February from the same period a month earlier, Intertek said
yesterday. Shipments rose 18 percent in the first 15 days, it
said Feb. 15.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September lost 1.4 percent
to close at 7,024  yuan  ($1,126) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange .  Soybean oil  for delivery in the same month retreated
1.4 percent to end at 8,630 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for May delivery dropped 0.4 percent to $14.62 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for May
delivery declined 0.7 percent to 52.06 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
