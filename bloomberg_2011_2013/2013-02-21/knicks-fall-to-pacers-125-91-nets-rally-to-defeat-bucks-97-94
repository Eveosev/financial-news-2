Paul George  scored 27 points to lead
the Indiana Pacers to a 125-91 victory against the visiting New
York Knicks, who have lost three straight, in a National
Basketball Association game.  The loss dropped the Knicks’ (32-19) lead atop the Eastern
Conference’s Atlantic Division to one game over the Brooklyn
Nets (33-22), who rallied to beat the host Milwaukee Bucks 97-94
last night. The Pacers (33-21) lead the Central Division and now
are within a half-game of the Knicks for the second-best record
in the conference.  David West  had 18 points and Lance Stephenson added 14 for
the Pacers, who had a 74-44 halftime lead at Bankers Life
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.  The Pacers hit 53 percent of their shots and went 11-for-24
on 3-pointers, while holding the Knicks to 34 percent shooting
and 5-of-28 on 3-pointers.  Indiana  had its season high in points
and its largest margin of victory this season.  Tyson Chandler  had 19 points and 11 rebounds for New York.
Carmelo Anthony added 15 points on 7-for-21 shooting and reserve
Chris Copeland contributed 13 for the Knicks, who suffered their
most lopsided loss of the season.  Nets guard Deron Williams scored 23 points to help Brooklyn
overcome a 54-42 halftime deficit and earn its fourth straight
victory. The visitors started the fourth quarter with an 11-0
run and outscored the Bucks 29-18 in that period.  Reserve C.J. Watson added 17 points and Andray Blatche had
12 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets at BMO Harris Bradley
Center in Milwaukee.  Brandon Jennings  had 31 points and Monta Ellis scored 14 for the Bucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
