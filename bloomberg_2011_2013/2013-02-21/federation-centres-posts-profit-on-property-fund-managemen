Federation Centres, the shopping
mall operator formerly known as Centro Retail  Australia ,
reported a profit in the first half driven by growth in property
and fund management income.  Net income  was A$115.9 million ($119 million) in the six
months ended Dec. 31 from a loss of A$100.1 million a year
earlier, the Melbourne-based shopping mall operator said in a
statement today. The company  began trading  on Dec. 1, 2011.  Federation’s shareholders last month approved a plan to
change its name from Centro Retail Australia, which it took on
temporarily when it was formed from the restructure of Centro
Properties Group. The company has sold interests in its malls to
capital partners, including the sale this month of 50 percent
stakes in five shopping centers to fund management firm Industry
Superannuation Property Trust.  “We’re now on a clear path to deliver our strategic
agenda,” Steven Sewell, chief executive officer of  Federation
Centres (FDC) , said in the statement today. “We are progressing with
the strategic objective to take advantage of redevelopment
opportunities.”  The company reported underlying earnings, which excludes
items including property revaluations, of A$106.2 million in the
half. It will pay a  dividend  of 6.6 Australian cents for the
half, it said today.  Federation  shares  have climbed 4 percent this year,
 compared  with a 7.1 percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
