Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the Canadian
company 70 percent owned by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , announced that
Richard M. Kruger will become chairman, president and chief
executive officer effective March 1.  Kruger has worked at Exxon for 32 years and is currently
president of its production company, Calgary-based Imperial said
in a statement today. He replaces Bruce H. March, who will
become senior vice president of global operations for Exxon’s
chemical company after almost five years as CEO of Imperial.  Imperial Oil is  Canada ’s second-largest oil producer by
market value. The company owns and operates refineries, oil-
sands assets and a chain of gasoline retail stations across the
country.  Imperial on Feb. 1 raised the estimate for initial costs at
its delayed Kearl oil-sands project to C$12.9 billion ($12.7
billion) because of issues related to transporting heavy
equipment to the site in  Alberta  and “harsh weather” as
startup began.  Kruger began his career with Exxon in 1981 and has worked
for the company in Russia, Malaysia and Africa. He was vice
president of production for the Asia Pacific and Middle Eastern
region before becoming president of the production company,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
