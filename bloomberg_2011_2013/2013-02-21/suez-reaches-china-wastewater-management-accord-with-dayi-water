Suez Environnement (SEV) , Europe’s second-
biggest water company, is entering the Sichuan market in China
by teaming up with Dayi Water to manage wastewater treatment
plants in Shuangliu County.  Suez subsidiary Sino French Water Development Co. and
Sichuan Dayi Water Co. formed the new Shuangliu Dayi venture,
the Paris-based company that’s 34 percent-owned by  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA
said today in a statement.  The partnership will manage and operate eight water
treatment plants and involves the construction, management and
operation of the Shuangliu Maojiawan wastewater facility. The
projects are expected to generate about 156 million euros ($206
million) in revenue for the venture over 25 years, Suez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
