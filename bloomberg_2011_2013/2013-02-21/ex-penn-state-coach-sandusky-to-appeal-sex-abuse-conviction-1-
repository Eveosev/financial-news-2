Jerry Sandusky, the former
 Pennsylvania  State University assistant football coach found
guilty of sexually abusing boys, filed a notice with an
intermediate state court saying he will appeal his conviction.  Joseph Amendola, an attorney for Sandusky, filed the notice
with the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, one of two statewide
intermediate appellate courts. The filing follows the trial
judge’s rejection of Sandusky’s request to vacate the conviction
or alter his sentence.  Sandusky, 69, was found guilty in June of 45 counts of
abusing boys over a 15-year period. He was sentenced to at least
30 years in prison and is serving time in a maximum-security
facility in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania.  Lawyers for the former coach didn’t detail the grounds for
appeal in the documents. They argued in a Jan. 10 hearing before
Judge John Cleland that Sandusky had insufficient time to
prepare a defense and that prosecutors didn’t produce enough
evidence to support the charges against him. Cleland rejected
those arguments in a Jan. 30 written decision.  The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Sandusky, CP-
14-2422-CR-2011, Court of Common Pleas, Centre County,
Pennsylvania (Bellefonte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
