  Vivus Inc. (VVUS) ’s obesity drug, approved
in July in the U.S., failed for a second time to gain the
backing of European regulators because of its potential side
effects.  The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use recommended against approving Vivus’s
pill in October because of concern about the long-term effects
on the heart and nervous system. Vivus appealed, and the
Mountain View, California-based company said today in a
statement that its request was rejected.  The agency, called CHMP, said Vivus must conduct a
cardiovascular trial to show the drug, which would be called
Qsiva in  Europe , is safe before it could be approved.  “We are disappointed with the CHMP decision regarding
Qsiva and the position the committee adopted with respect to the
need for a pre-approval cardiovascular outcomes trial,” Peter Tam, president of Vivus, said in the statement. “A majority of
CHMP members have failed to recognize the importance of making
this treatment option available, particularly for patients whose
only effective intervention is surgery.”  The drug, called Qsymia in the U.S., was the second weight-
loss drug to be cleared last year by the Food and Drug
Administration. The therapy is a combination of the appetite
suppressant phentermine and the anti-seizure drug topiramate.  Vivus declined 1.9 percent to $12.88 in trading today
before the statement was released. The shares have gained 22
percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
