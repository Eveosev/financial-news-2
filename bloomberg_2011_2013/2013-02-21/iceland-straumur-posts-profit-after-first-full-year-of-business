Straumur Investment Bank hf , the
restructured successor to Straumur Burdaras hf that received a
banking license in August, made a profit in its first full year.  Net income was 203 million kronur ($1.6 million) in 2012,
compared with a loss of 121 million kronur during the final four
months of 2011, the Reykjavik-based lender said today. Operating
income reached 1.33 billion kronur, compared with 402 million
kronur in the final months of last year.  “The bank is well-funded with equity of roughly 1.3
billion kronur,” Chief Executive Officer Petur Einarsson said
in a statement. Straumur delivered an 18 percent return on
equity to its shareholders, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
