Russia  plans to ship 17 cargoes of
East Siberia-Pacific Ocean crude, or ESPO, from the Pacific port
of Kozmino in April, according to a final loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Kozmino, in the country’s  Far East , will load 1.7 million
metric tons of ESPO blend in 100,000 ton lots, or about 415,367
barrels a day, one cargo less than planned for March. Two of the
cargoes will be transported by rail and the rest through the
ESPO pipeline.  The ESPO pipeline, Russia’s most expensive infrastructure
project, starts at fields in east Siberia. A second phase of the
venture was completed in December that expanded the pipeline’s
capacity and also extended the link to the Pacific coast, at
Kozmino, thereby lessening the need for rail trucks.  The April program also includes one 100,000 ton rail cargo
for loading at Kozmino April 30 to May 3 and a partial rail
cargo of 32,000 tons that will be topped up at Kozmino in May.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
