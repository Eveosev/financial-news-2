U.K. miners, led by  Ferrexpo Plc (FXPO) ,
 New World Resources Plc (NWR)  and  Evraz (EVR)  Plc, fell on concern that
Chinese calls for curbs on property development will crimp
demand for commodities.  Ferrexpo, an iron-ore processor in Ukraine, dropped 9.2
percent to 251.4 pence, the biggest decline in nine months and
the worst performance on the  FTSE 350 Index. (NMX)   Miners accounted for five of the 10 biggest declines among
companies in the  FTSE 100 Index. (UKX)  Evraz, the Russian steelmaker
part-owned by billionaire  Roman Abramovich , was the biggest
loser among the top companies trading in Britain, slumping 5
percent to the lowest price this year.  Iron-ore swaps dropped the most in five months alongside
declines in steel futures and equities as investors bet that a
call by Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  for local authorities to
“decisively” curb property speculation may restrain demand for
the commodity used in construction materials.  Copper and nickel slumped to their lowest prices this year
in  London  on concern the  Federal Reserve  will slow the pace of
economic stimulus in the U.S. A stronger dollar reduces the
appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  BHP Billiton Plc (BLT) , the world’s largest miner, fell 4 percent
in London, while New World Resources dropped 6.9 percent.  Rio
Tinto , the world’s No. 2 mining company, declined 3.5 percent,
the biggest fall in more than six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
