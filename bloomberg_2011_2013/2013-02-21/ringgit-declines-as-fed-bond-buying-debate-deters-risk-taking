time this week after several officials said the Fed should be
ready to vary the pace of the $85 billion a month of debt buying,

29-30 meeting released yesterday. Malaysia’s  gross domestic
product  increased 6.4 percent last quarter from a year earlier,

a report showed yesterday.  “Concerns over U.S. quantitative easing are reducing
demand for emerging-market assets,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a
strategist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “The Malaysian
currency could recover from the weak open given yesterday’s
strong economic data.”  The ringgit declined 0.4 percent to 3.1084 per dollar as of
4:15 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.1110, the weakest since Feb. 4.
