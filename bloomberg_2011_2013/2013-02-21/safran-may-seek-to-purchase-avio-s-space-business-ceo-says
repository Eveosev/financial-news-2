Safran SA (SAF) , Europe’s second-biggest
maker of  aircraft engines , is looking at bidding for Avio SpA’s
space propulsion-unit as growth at its main business slows.  Safran, based in Paris, has begun exploratory discussions
with Turin-based Avio before any formal negotiations, Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Paul Herteman said on a conference call.  “The businesses complement each other well, and this could
be an opportunity,” Herteman said, adding that Safran’s Snecma
unit has been partnered with Avio for years through their work
on engines for Arianespace SA rocket launchers.  General Electric Co. (GE) , Safran’s ally on the CFM56 engine
used on  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 and  Airbus SAS (EAD)  A320 planes, agreed in
December to buy Avio’s aircraft-engine business for $4.3 billion
from Cinven Ltd. The French company had been among potential
suitors, together CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and Clessidra SGR
SpA, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations.  Safran said today in a statement that its sales growth will
probably slow to 5 percent this year from 16 percent in 2012. An
increase in operating profit may also be limited to a percentage
in the “mid-teens,” compared with a 24 percent jump last year.  “We expect growth to gradually slow as volume increases
level off,” said  Nick Cunningham , a London-based analyst at
Agency Partners with a hold recommendation on the stock.  Safran  dropped  as much as 5.3 percent, the biggest slump
since Dec. 13, 2011, and was trading 3.1 percent lower at 33.97
euros as of 11:32 a.m. in the French capital. The share price
has declined 3.1 percent this year.  Net income jumped 55 percent to 999 billion euros last year
as revenue increased 16 percent to 13.6 billion, Safran said
today. The company posted a record backlog of 48.5 billion
euros, up from 43 billion euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
