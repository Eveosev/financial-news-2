Treasury 10-year yields fell below 2
percent as inflation last month trailed the  Federal Reserve ’s 2
percent long-term objective, giving the central bank scope to
continue bond buying to bolster the economy.  The benchmark yield  reached  a one-week low as the consumer
price index was unchanged in January and was up 1.6 percent from
a year earlier. The 10-year note has erased its decline this
month after posting the biggest jump in yield in January since
March 2012 even as central-bank policy makers appear divided
about how long the Fed should keep purchasing debt securities.  “Over time, the information isn’t strong enough to keep
the Fed out of the game,” said  Thomas Tucci , managing director
and head of Treasury trading in  New York  at CIBC World Markets
Corp. “I’m looking for a range-bound market.”  The 10-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.98 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due in February 2023 rose 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face amount,
to 100 7/32.  The yield reached the lowest since Feb. 12 and is at the
1.98 percent closing level on Jan. 31.  Price Swings  Treasury market volatility, as measured by the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch MOVE index,  declined  to 57.9 yesterday,
the lowest since Jan. 24 and down from the 59.74 average since
the Fed announced $40 billion a month in mortgage purchases.  The Treasury announced plans to sell $99 billion of notes
next week. It will auction $35 billion of two-year securities on
Feb. 25, the same amount of five-year debt the following day and
$29 billion of seven-year notes on Feb. 27.  The central bank bought $3.6 billion of Treasuries maturing
from November 2018 to February 2020 today, according to the Fed
Bank of New York’s website.  Several policy makers said the Fed should be ready to vary
the pace of its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, according
to the minutes of the central bank’s Jan. 29-30 meeting released
yesterday in  Washington .  The central bank my halt its bond buying in January 2014,
depending on the pace of the economy  Bill Gross , co-chief
investment officer and founder of  Newport Beach , California-
based Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in a Twitter
post.  Fed Watch  Primary dealers expect the Fed to reduce the pace of asset
purchases by the beginning of 2014, with a majority anticipating
an end to mortgage-bond purchases by January, a survey showed.
The median respondent in the survey by the Fed Bank of New York
saw the central bank buying $20 billion in Treasuries per month
and no mortgage securities in January 2014, according to the
survey conducted before the FOMC meeting.  Stocks declined around the world on concern that the Fed
could reduce its monetary accommodation. The euro fell below
$1.32 for the first time since Jan. 10 as a composite index of
factory and services output in the 17-nation currency bloc fell
to 47.3 from 48.6 in January, London-based Markit Economics
said. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  “As soon as you have two or three arguments from whatever
source that argue against taking on more risk, the markets are
all going to pull back,” said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt
research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee .  Debt Sale  The U.S. sold $9 billion of 30-year inflation-protected
securities at a yield of 0.639 percent, compared with an average
forecast of 0.625 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of
the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities sale’s bid-to-
cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid
with the amount offered, was 2.47, versus an average of 2.72 at
the eight auctions since 2010.  The yield on current 30-year TIPS has increased to 0.57
percent from 0.39 percent at the end of 2012. Inflation-indexed
debt pays interest at lower rates than nominal Treasuries on a
principal amount that’s linked to the Labor Department’s
 consumer price index .  TIPS maturing in 15 years or more have lost 4.3 percent
this year, compared with a decline of 4.4 percent for regular
Treasuries with comparable maturities and a drop of 5.2 percent
for 30-year U.S. government bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes show.  Yield Difference  The difference in yield between 30-year TIPS and regular
Treasuries of 2.56 percentage points is 0.05 percentage point
higher than at the end of the year. The gap, which serves as a
gauge of expectations for consumer prices during the life of the
debt, reached 2.63 percentage points on Feb. 5, the highest
since Sept. 14, the day after the Fed announced it would begin
purchasing $40 billion per month of mortgage securities.  The 0.3 percent rise last month in  core inflation , which
excludes more volatile food and energy prices, was higher than
the 0.2 percent rise forecast by 82 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  “Inflation is the critical cog to the timing of  interest
rates  rising,” said Tom Graff, who manages $3.6 billion of
fixed-income assets at Brown Advisory Inc. in Baltimore. “It
looks to be flat to mildly accelerating, which tells me a real
change in Fed policy is quite a ways away.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
