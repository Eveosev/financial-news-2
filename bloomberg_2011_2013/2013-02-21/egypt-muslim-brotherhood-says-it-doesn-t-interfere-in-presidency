Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood said it
doesn’t interfere in the affairs of the presidency or any other
executive bodies.  The group’s Guidance Office, its main decision-making body,
and its supreme guide “have not interfered in any way” in
President Mohamed Mursi’s office, spokesman Mahmoud Ghozlan said
on the group’s website today.  His statement came in response to a report in independent
daily Al-Shorouk yesterday of contacts between Mursi and Supreme
Guide Mohamed Badie to resolve Egypt’s economic and political
crisis.  Mursi’s critics say the president, who became the country’s
first democratically elected civilian leader in June, has sought
to advance the interests of the Brotherhood while failing to
revive the economy or address social problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
