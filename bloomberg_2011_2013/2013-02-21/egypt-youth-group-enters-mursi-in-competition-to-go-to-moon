Mohamed Mursi, Islamist president of
the moon?  That’s what the April 6 youth activist group, which ranks
among the Egyptian leader’s fiercest critics, is hoping. The
group said it had signed Mursi up to the AXE Apollo Space
Academy’s  website , giving the U.S.-trained engineer a chance to
win a trip to space.  “Certainly, there’s no one in the universe who would put
up with the lies that are evident and the broken promises other
than the dear youths of the moon,” the group said on its
 Facebook  page, while calling on its supporters to cast their
votes for Mursi.  April 6, along with secular parties and other youth
activist movements, contends Mursi has steamrolled over rights,
focusing on cementing the Muslim Brotherhood’s strength in
government at the expense of broader national interests and
reviving the economy.  There was no immediate response from Mursi’s office to an
e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
