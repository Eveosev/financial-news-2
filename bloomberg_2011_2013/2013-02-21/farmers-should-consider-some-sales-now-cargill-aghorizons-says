U.S. farmers should consider making
some crop sales now, with pre-planting prices near record highs
and with the government predicting record corn and soybean
production, said David Baudler, the president of Cargill
AgHorizons.  Growers should contract to sell at least enough of their
anticipated output to cover production costs, Baudler said today
at a U.S. Department of Agriculture forum in Arlington,
Virginia. Cargill AgHorizons helps farmers manage risk and is
one of 70 business units at Cargill Inc.  The USDA today predicted a corn crop of 14.53 billion
bushels and soybean output of 3.405 billion bushels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
