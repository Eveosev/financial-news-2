Mondi Ltd. (MND) , the largest maker of
office paper in Europe and  South Africa , said its 2013
performance will benefit from new acquisitions running at full
capacity after profit fell almost 9 percent last year.  “The year has started off well,” Chief Executive Officer
David Hathorn said on a conference call today. The company will
focus on integrating newly acquired companies and improving
their performance, he said.  Mondi, listed in Johannesburg and London after a 2007
spinoff from  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , posted an 8.7 percent decline
in 2012 underlying operating profit to 568 million euros ($749
million). Sales rose 1.2 percent to 5.8 billion euros, while a
better pricing environment in the fourth quarter helped offset a
weak start to the year, the company said in a statement today.  It is expanding in  emerging markets  to help drive growth
and bought Greven, Germany-based Nordenia from  Oaktree Capital
Group LLC (OAK)  in July to strengthen its position in eastern European
markets that are growing faster than its African base.  Mondi also bought two corrugated-box plants and a recycled-
containerboard mill in Germany and the Czech Republic from
Austria’s Duropack AG for 125 million euros in September.  Challenging Environment  Mondi’s 20 million-euro investment in China will be
completed by the end of this year, creating potential revenue of
as much as 200 million euros, Hathorn said. Mondi, which
operates 102 plants across 30 countries, is “encouraged” by
the “opportunity to extract value from acquisitions” he said.
There will be “some rationalization,” resulting in no more
than 200 job losses, he said.  A challenging business environment in southern and western
Europe is being offset by “positive” sentiment in central and
eastern Europe, Hathorn said.  Mondi shares declined as much as 4.9 percent in
Johannesburg before recovering to close little changed at 113.53
rand. Almost 700,000 shares, or double the three-month daily
average, were traded.  The Johannesburg-listed stock has gained 23 percent this
year, making it the third-best performer of the 165-member
 FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index. (JALSH)   Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , a producer of
coated fine paper, has retreated 7.8 percent during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
