Nigeria ’s Treasury bill yields fell
to the lowest in 17 months at an auction as bids were almost
four times the amount on sale, boosted by offshore demand for
the country’s debt.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold 135.65 billion naira
($862.4 million) of treasury bills yesterday, including 25.65
billion naira of 91-day bills at a yield of 9.416 percent, it
said today in an e-mailed statement, the lowest since Sept. 29,
2011. Bids amounted to 529.94 billion naira, it said.  “Single-digit inflation rate and offshore investors
pushing for attractive yield are causing the rally in treasury
securities,” Kunle Ezun, a Lagos-based analyst at  Ecobank
Transnational Inc. (ETI) , said in a telephone interview today.  The nation’s  inflation  rate fell to 9 percent in January
from 12 percent in December, the lowest level since April 2008,
as the effect of a year-earlier reduction in fuel subsidies
dropped out of the calculation, the Abuja-based  National Bureau
of Statistics  said Feb. 18.  The  central bank  also sold 30 billion naira of 182-day
bills at 9.917 percent and 80 billion naira of 364-day
securities at 10.54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
