U.K. stocks  declined the most in
almost seven months, as commodity shares fell amid concern the
U.S. Federal Reserve will scale back its bond-buying program.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group, the world’s largest
mining companies, fell at least 3.5 percent.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
Europe’s biggest lender, led banking shares lower.  BAE Systems
Plc (BA/)  advanced the most in five months after saying it plans to
buy back shares.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 103.83 points, or 1.6 percent,
to 6,291.54 at the close in London. That was the biggest retreat
since July 23. The equity benchmark has still rallied 6.7
percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a
compromise budget. The broader FTSE All-Share Index lost 1.6
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 1.5 percent.  “Over the last several weeks, equity markets have been
losing touch with reality and the news out of the Fed has been a
trigger point for a selloff,” said Stewart Richardson, who
helps oversee $100 million as partner and chief investment
officer at RMG Wealth Management LLP in  London . “Equity markets
are being propped up by the Fed printing money, and they will
come under pressure if this stops. In the big picture, this will
be seen as a major development for markets.”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 15 percent higher than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed Minutes  Fed officials yesterday expressed concern over whether
record monetary easing will drive inflation higher or create
asset-price bubbles, according to the minutes of the Federal
Open Market Committee’s Jan. 29-30 meeting released yesterday.  Several participants “emphasized that the committee should
be prepared to vary the pace of asset purchases, either in
response to changes in the economic outlook or as its evaluation
of the efficacy and costs of such purchases evolved,” the
minutes showed.  A  gauge of mining stocks  in the FTSE 350 Index fell 3
percent, the biggest retreat since July 23, as copper prices
erased their gains for this year.  BHP Billiton, the  world’s biggest mining company , slipped 4
percent to 2,097 pence and Rio Tinto, the second-largest, lost
3.5 percent to 3,518.5 pence.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  slid 3.2 percent to
1,112 pence.  HSBC retreated 2.3 percent to 716.4 pence. A gauge of
banking shares tumbled the most since Sept. 26.  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
declined 4.2 percent to 306.45 pence and  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY)  dropped 3.1 percent to 53.97 pence.  BAE Climbs  BAE rallied 4.1 percent to 345.9 pence, the most since
Sept. 12, after saying it will buy back 1 billion pounds ($1.5
billion) of shares over the next three years. Europe’s largest
arms maker reported 2012 profit that beat analyst estimates.  CSR Plc (CSR)  surged 12 percent to 432.7 pence, the most since
July 17, as the U.K. mobile-chip maker said it sees first-
quarter sales in the range of $215 million to $235 million,
beating the average analyst forecast for $204.5 million.  Bumi Plc (BUMI)  climbed 3.2 percent to 391.3 pence. Shareholders
voted today on co-founder  Nathaniel Rothschild ’s plan to replace
12 of its 14 directors in his bid to gain control of the company
