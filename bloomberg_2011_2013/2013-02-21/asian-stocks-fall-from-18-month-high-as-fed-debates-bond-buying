Asian  stocks  plunged, with a gauge
of Chinese companies listed in  Hong Kong  erasing the year’s
gains, amid concern the  Federal Reserve  may scale back U.S.
economic stimulus and as China ordered increased property curbs.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.4 percent to 133.31
as of 7:59 p.m. in Tokyo, at one point heading for its biggest
single-day decline since July. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index tumbled 2.2 percent, erasing the year’s advance, and the
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  of mainland-listed shares plummeted by the most in
more than 18 months after China ordered local authorities to do
more to rein in property speculation. More than three stocks
fell for each that rose on the Asia-Pacific measure, which
closed yesterday at the highest level since August 2011.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. (2777)  lost 1.6 percent in Hong Kong,
pacing declines among Chinese developers.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s biggest mining company, dropped 3.8 percent, the most
since May, on concern that global demand will decrease if policy
makers reduce stimulus.  “Overseas markets didn’t do well overnight and there are
rumors China may tighten the property market, and the central
bank has withdrawn liquidity from the capital market the last
couple of weeks in China -- all these are negative,” said
Benjamin Tam, a  fund manager  who helps oversee about $1.5
billion at IG Investment in Hong Kong. “Many people may take
money off the table, and everyone doing the same thing at the
same time could trigger some selling pressure.”  The People’s Bank of China drained 910 billion yuan ($146
billion) from the financial system this week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That was the biggest withdrawal since
Bloomberg started compiling the data in 2008.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 11 percent from the
start of November through yesterday, led by Japanese shares as
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to beat deflation and pressed
the central bank to ease monetary policy. Asia’s benchmark
traded at 14.9 times estimated earnings as of yesterday compared
with 13.7 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and 12.5 for the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 1.7 percent, while
China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 3 percent, the biggest
drop since November 2011.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 1.4 percent. South
Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index lost 0.5 percent after yesterday rising the
most since September. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 2.3
percent, its biggest loss since May.  Fed Minutes  Taiwan’s Taiex Index (TWSE)  slid 0.9 percent and Singapore’s
Straits Times Index dropped 0.6 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index fell 1 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPXL1)  slipped 0.4 percent today. The
equity gauge fell 1.2 percent in New York yesterday, the biggest
drop since November, as minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s Jan. 29-30 meeting showed policy makers were divided
about the strategy behind Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s program of
buying bonds, known as quantitative easing, until there is
“substantial” improvement in a U.S. labor market.  Some said an earlier end to purchases might be needed, and
others warned against a premature withdrawal of stimulus.
Several policy makers said the central bank should be ready to
vary the pace of its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  Mainland developers fell after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
called for local authorities to “decisively” curb real-estate
speculation and take steps to rein in the property market.  Guangzhou R&F Properties slid 1.6 percent to HK$12.48.
 Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007)  lost 3.3 percent to HK$3.76.  BHP, Cnooc  “They are trying to control the  property market  and that
is not a good thing for the short term, but it’s something China
has to go through,” said Mikio Kumada, a Hong Kong-based global
strategist for LGT Capital Partners, which oversees more than
$20 billion.  Raw material producers and energy companies posted the
 biggest decline  among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index after the S&P GSCI Index of commodities retreated
a fourth straight day, the longest such streak since December.  BHP dropped 3.8 percent to A$37.17 in Sydney.  Jiangxi
Copper Co. (358) , China’s biggest supplier of the metal, sank 3.2
percent to HK$18.74 in Hong Kong. Cnooc Ltd., the nation’s
largest offshore oil producer, slipped 1.2 percent to HK$15.54.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. plunged 17 percent to
HK$15.28, the biggest  decliner  on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.
The seller of women’s footwear said its 2012 profit will be at
the lower end of analysts’ estimates ranging from 4.29 billion
 yuan  to 4.85 billion yuan. The stock’s rating was downgraded to
fully-valued from hold at DBS Vickers Hong Kong Ltd.  Of the 353 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have reported quarterly earnings and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 49 percent exceeded profit expectations.  Origin Energy Drops  Origin Energy Ltd. slumped 8.5 percent to A$11.33 in Sydney
after Australia’s biggest electricity retailer cut its profit
forecast and reported a cost increase at its A$25 billion ($26
billion) gas project.  Among stocks that gained, GS Yuasa Corp., which makes
batteries for Boeing Co., jumped 8 percent to 352 yen in Tokyo
on optimism the plane manufacturer is preparing fixes for
battery problems that grounded the 787 Dreamliner. The stock
posted the biggest gain on the MSCI measure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
