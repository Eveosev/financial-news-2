The  European Central Bank  posted a
net profit of 998 million euros ($1.32 billion) for 2012, up
from 728 million euros in 2011.  The Frankfurt-based ECB earned a surplus of 2.164 billion
euros last year, up from 1.894 billion euros, its annual
accounts showed today. The Governing Council decided to transfer
1.166 billion euros to the risk-provision account, which now
totals 7.529 billion euros, the ECB said.  Interest income from bonds purchased under the now-defunct
Securities Markets Program amounted to 1.1 billion euros, the
ECB said, adding that 555 million euros was earned from interest
on Greek  government bonds . That sum is only part of the interest
earned on Greek bonds held by all euro-area central banks under
the SMP. Governments agreed to return to  Greece  an amount
equivalent to the interest earned on Greek bonds in the SMP as
part of a second bailout package negotiated last year.  The ECB today published a breakdown of the SMP holdings for
the first time. Of the 208.7 billion-euro book value of the
bonds in the program, 99 billion euros are Italian and 43.7
billion euros are Spanish. Greek bonds amount to 30.8 billion
euros. The SMP also contains 13.6 billion euros of Irish debt
and 21.6 billion euros of Portuguese assets.  The average remaining maturity on the bonds in the SMP is
4.3 years, the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
