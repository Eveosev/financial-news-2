Sugar and coffee fell in  London  and
New York as producers may boost sales after yesterday’s price
rally just as a stronger dollar reduces the appeal of raw
materials. Cocoa rose in London and declined in New York.  Sugar climbed as much as 1.5 percent on ICE Futures U.S.
yesterday, while coffee gained as much as 2.9 percent. Investors
sought to buy futures after U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data compiled by Bloomberg showed bets on lower
coffee and  sugar  prices reached a record in the week ended Feb.
12. The U.S. currency rose to the highest level in more than
five months against a basket of six currencies, reducing the
appeal of dollar-denominated commodities.  “The big day in coffee and sugar yesterday has prompted
some producer selling, with Brazil,  Thailand , and others having
sugar to sell, and Brazil and others having coffee to sell,”
Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank International in London,
said by e-mail today. “The higher dollar and general red across
the board also means some investor profit-taking.”  White, or refined sugar, for May delivery fell 0.7 percent
to $497.60 a metric ton by 10:45 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London,
after gaining as much as 1.3 percent yesterday. Robusta coffee
for delivery in May fell 0.8 percent to $2,046 a ton. It gained
as much as 1.4 percent yesterday.  In New York, raw sugar for delivery in May declined 1.2
percent to 17.92 cents a pound on ICE, while arabica coffee for
May delivery was down 1.4 percent to $1.397 a pound.  Brazilian Millers  Sugar millers in  Brazil , the world’s top producer, have
sold less than 50 percent of their 2013-14 crop that starts in
April in the futures market, a slower pace than the usual, Flury
said. Producers in Thailand, the second-biggest sugar exporter,
have also sold less than usual, he said. The Southeast Asian
nation is harvesting the 2012-13 crop that started in November.  Coffee stockpiles in top grower Brazil were about 20
percent higher than a year earlier, according to Terra Forte
Exportacao e Importacao de Cafe Ltda. Inventories stood at 28.4
million bags as of Jan. 1, up from 23.75 million bags in the
same period a year earlier, said Jayme Leme Neto, an export
manager at the Sao Joao da Boa Vista-based company. A bag of
coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Cocoa for delivery in March was 0.2 percent higher at 1,407
pounds ($2,140) a ton in London. Cocoa for delivery in May was
0.2 percent down to $2,108 a ton in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
