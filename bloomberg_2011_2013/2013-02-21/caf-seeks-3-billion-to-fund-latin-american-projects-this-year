Corporacion Andina de Fomento, the
Latin American development lender known as CAF, plans to raise
$3 billion this year to finance energy and infrastructure
projects, according to Chief Financial Officer Hugo Sarmiento.  About $2.5 billion will come from international bond sales
and the remainder will come from loans, Sarmiento said today in
an interview at Bloomberg’s offices in  London . The Caracas-based
lender plans to boost its credit portfolio by 10 percent this
year from $16.5 billion at the end of 2012, Sarmiento said.  Proceeds will be used to finance projects across the
region, which may include part of  Rio de Janeiro ’s Maracana
soccer stadium, according to Sarmiento. CAF is also studying
mass transit system projects in  Sao Paulo  and Rio in
anticipation of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, he said.  “We’ve seen an increase in demand for Latin American
assets” such as the bonds CAF will sell, he said. “When you
look at the macroeconomic environment, which is very stable, and
you compare that to the developed world, which is in crisis, it
makes sense to park your funds there.”  Stronger economic growth than in the developed world helped
attract $131 billion of private financial flows to  Latin America 
and the Caribbean in 2012, up from $85.8 billion in 2007,
according to  IMF  data. Gross domestic product in eight Latin
American countries rose by an estimated 2.66 percent on average
in 2012, compared with an estimated contraction of 0.4 percent
for the euro region and growth of 2.2 percent in the U.S., data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  CAF expects its next  bond issue  to be a U.S. dollar-
denominated sale in the second quarter, Sarmiento said. The
lender also intends to sell about 500 million  yuan  ($80 million)
of bonds later in the year to tap growing demand from Asian
investors, he said.  The lender’s 4.375 percent dollar bonds due 2022 have
returned 10 percent since they were issued in June. The yield
was little changed today at 3.4 percent.  CAF is rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, the third-
highest investment grade, and AA- at  Standard & Poor’s , the
company’s fourth-highest ranking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
