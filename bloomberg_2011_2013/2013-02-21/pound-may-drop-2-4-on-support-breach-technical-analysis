The pound may drop 2.4 percent
against the dollar after breaking through a key level of so-
called support, Credit Suisse Group AG said, citing technical
indicators.  The British currency is headed toward $1.4856, the 61.8
percent Fibonacci retracement of the currency’s advance between
January and August 2009, after breaching $1.5274, the 50 percent
retracement of that move, Cilline Bain, a London-based technical
analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote today in a client note.  “We will continue to slide lower,” he said, confirming
the report. “The next significant target is $1.4856.”  The currency tested the $1.5274 support level three times
in 2011 and 2012, before rallying again, Bain said.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.5224 at 10:17 a.m. London
time after sliding to $1.5132, the lowest since July 21, 2010.  Support refers to an area on a chart where buy orders may
be clustered. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that
prices rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high
or low.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
