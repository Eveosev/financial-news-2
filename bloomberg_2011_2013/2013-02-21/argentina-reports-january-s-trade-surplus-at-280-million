Argentina’s trade surplus was $280
million in January, compared with $550 million a year earlier,
the national statistics institute said.  The surplus was less than a $450 million median estimate of
seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Exports fell 4 percent from the same month a year earlier
to $5.7 billion, while imports rose 1 percent to $5.4 billion
over the same period, the agency said in  Buenos Aires  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
