World wheat production is forecast
to climb about 4 percent in the 2013-14 crop year, with most of
the increase absorbed by rising demand, the International Grains
Council said.  The outlook for this season’s corn crop was raised from a
month ago on an improved outlook for Brazil, which is expected
to overtake the U.S. as the world’s biggest shipper of the
grain, the London-based IGC wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Wheat prices in  Chicago  are up 16 percent from a year ago,
while corn has gained 9.2 percent. U.S. farmers may plant corn
on 96.5 million acres, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
today. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey expected 97.73 million,
the highest since 1936.  For corn, “planting of the 2013-14 crop will soon commence
in the Northern Hemisphere and the global area is tentatively
forecast up 0.6 percent year-on-year led by an anticipated
further expansion in the U.S.,” the IGC wrote.  World corn output may total 850.2 million metric tons in
the 2012-13 season, from a Jan. 17 estimate of 844.7 million
tons, the IGC wrote. The harvest is still forecast to drop from
876.9 million tons a year earlier.  The outlook for  Brazil ’s corn production was lifted by 3
million tons to 74 million tons, while predictions for the
country’s exports were lifted by a similar amount to 26 million
tons. The forecast for U.S. shipments was cut to 23.5 million
tons, 1.5 tons less than predicted in January.  Global corn inventories may drop to 114 million tons by the
end of the season, up 1 million tons from last month’s
expectation. Ending stocks for major exporters are forecast to
be at a 16-year low, the IGC said.  Ending Stocks  World production of wheat may be 656 million tons, little
changed from the council’s previous forecast. Ending stocks are
predicted to be 176 million tons, 2 million tons more than the
January outlook.  For 2013-14, wheat ending stocks are expected to climb by 2
million tons, according to the council. Supplies from Black Sea
producers will probably be capped by below-average beginning
stocks, it said.  Soybean production in 2012-13 may be 269 million tons, 2
million tons less than previously expected, the IGC said. The
global rice harvest may amount to 466 million tons, compared
with a January prediction of 464 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
