Japanese  stock   futures  fell,
signaling Asian equities may extend yesterday’s slump, as data
out of  Europe  added to concern the region’s recession is
weighing on the global economy. Australian shares opened higher.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that gets 30 percent of its revenue in Europe, slid 0.8 percent

Ltd., a global surfwear maker, fell 3.9 percent in Sydney after

oil producer, dropped 0.6 percent as crude fell to the lowest
level this year. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation’s

Stevens said recent interest-rate cuts should be given time to
do their work.  Futures on  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 11,270 in  Chicago  yesterday, down from 11,320 in

anyone thought it was starting to grow,” said Shane Oliver,
Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has $126 billion under management. “In
Asia, it’s one of those days when investors sit on the sidelines
and alternatively, if they missed out on a rally, this is an
opportunity to buy stocks at better prices in a pullback in the
market.”  Fed Stimulus  Global stocks tumbled yesterday by the most since November
and commodities fell as a report signaled the euro-area’s
economy contracted more than forecast and concern grew that the

percent today. The index declined 0.6 percent in New York

biggest tumble since Feb. 4, as euro-area services and
manufacturing shrank in February by more than economists had
forecast.  Relative Value  Asian stocks plunged yesterday, with the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index losing 1.5 percent, amid concern the Fed may scale back
U.S. stimulus and as  China  ordered increased property curbs.
