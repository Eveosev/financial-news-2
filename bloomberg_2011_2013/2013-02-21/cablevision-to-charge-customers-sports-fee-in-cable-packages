Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , the
fifth-largest U.S. cable operator, will charge its customers an
additional $2.98-a-month fee to pay for the rising cost of
sports.  The surcharge will begin April 1, the company said in an e-
mailed statement. Cablevision has about 3 million TV customers
in New York, New Jersey,  Connecticut  and parts of Pennsylvania.  Pay-TV providers are increasing customers’ bills as costs
climb for sports programming.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) ’s FiOS
and  DirecTV (DTV) , which both compete with Cablevision, also began
charging sports fees for New York subscribers in recent months.
The FiOS fee is $2.42 a month. DirecTV’s is $2 for current New 
York subscribers and $3 for new users in the area.  “The rising cost of programming has resulted in this
sports surcharge,” Bradley Feldman, Cablevision’s vice
president of video product management, said in the statement.
“We are very focused on the price our customers pay for our
services.”  Cablevision hasn’t increased cable-TV prices for
subscribers since late 2010. The Bethpage, New York-based
company announced in December it would increase high-speed
Internet prices this year by $5 a month.  The sports fee affects all Cablevision packages except
Optimum Economy, a $39.95-a-month plan that doesn’t include most
sports channels, and Broadcast Basic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
