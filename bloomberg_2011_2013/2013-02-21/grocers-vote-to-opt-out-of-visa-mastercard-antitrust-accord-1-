The National Grocers Association
said its board voted to opt out of a multibillion-dollar
antitrust settlement with  Visa Inc. (V)  and  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  over
merchant fees.  The association, based in Arlington,  Virginia , said today
in a statement that its board made the unanimous decision this
month to drop out of the deal, which would settle a lawsuit on
behalf of retailers nationwide.  The accord, totaling as much as $7.25 billion, was
announced in July. Some large retailers and trade associations
have said the settlement is too generous to card companies.  “The NGA Board carefully considered not only what is in
the best interests of the retailers and wholesalers it serves
but also all other merchants who will be adversely affected by
the proposed settlement,” NGA President and Chief Executive
Officer Peter J. Larkin said in the statement.  The association said it will formally object to the deal
and will urge its 1,200 member companies to opt out and object.  Visa, based  Foster City , California, and Purchase, New
York-based MasterCard agreed to settle the case to resolve the
almost eight-year-long legal battle over interchange fees, which
are charged to merchants when customers pay with credit cards.
The settlement received tentative approval from a federal judge
in Brooklyn,  New York  in November. A hearing on final approval
is set for Sept. 12.  The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
