Ford Motor Co. (F)  said it will invest
$200 million to make four-cylinder engines at an  Ohio  plant
starting in late 2014 as the second-largest U.S. automaker
equips an increasing number of models with smaller, more fuel-
efficient powertrains.  Ford will add 450 jobs at the factory in Brook Park, Ohio,
to build the 2-liter engine there, the company said in a
statement. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has been
building the engine in  Valencia ,  Spain . That factory will
continue to build the engine for Ford European-built vehicles.  Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  has revived Ford by
overhauling its lineup to boost the fuel economy of models
including the Taurus sedan and Explorer sport-utility vehicle.
Adding U.S. output of smaller engines reduces Ford’s exposure to
currency swings and helps it meet stricter emission standards.
The United Auto Workers union also allows automakers to hire
entry-level workers for less than more senior employees.  “It definitely makes sense to have local production,
especially now with the lower UAW wages,” Mike Omotoso, an
analyst for LMC Automotive, said in a telephone interview
yesterday before Ford issued its statement. “The 2-liter turbo
is close to the power of a V-6 with much better fuel economy.”
Ford’s EcoBoost line of engines uses turbochargers to generate
power similar to larger engines.  Automakers by 2016 will have to raise the average fuel
economy of vehicle fleets sold in the U.S. to 35.5 miles (57.1
kilometers) per gallon. By 2025, carmakers will have to reach
corporate average fuel economy, known as CAFE, of 54.5 mpg.  Meeting Standards  Ford produced about 215,000 vehicles in  North America  last
year that were equipped with four-cylinder EcoBoost engines,
according to LMC Automotive estimates. Output of those vehicles
may surge 81 percent to 390,000 units in 2015, with the bulk the
engines coming from the Ohio factory and some still coming from
the Valencia plant, Omotoso said.  “Putting a four-cylinder engine in big cars like the Ford
Taurus and even in SUVs like the Explorer helps both of those
vehicles meet the standards,” said Omotoso, who is based in
Troy,  Michigan .  The company said today it expects to sell more than 500,000
U.S. vehicles this year with EcoBoost engines, up from 334,364
last year.  Ford’s decision to hire the hourly workers for its Ohio
plant, about 14 miles southwest of  Cleveland , combines with the
company’s plan to add 2,200 salaried employees in the U.S. this
year, the most in more than a decade.  Ford’s North American automotive employment increased to
80,000 at the end of 2012 from 75,000 a year earlier, according
to a Feb. 19 regulatory filing. U.S. sales of cars and light
trucks rose by 13 percent last year, the biggest annual increase
since 1984, according to researcher Autodata Corp.  Europe Retrenching  In  Europe , Ford is retrenching to match production with
slumping demand. Ford’s filing showed that automotive employment
in that region slipped to 46,000 from 47,000. The company said
in October that it planned to shutter three factories in Europe
by the end of next year and cut 6,200 jobs in an effort to break
even in the region by mid-decade.  Ford’s 2-liter EcoBoost engines are used in the company’s
 Ford Focus , Fusion, Escape, Explorer, Edge and Taurus as well as
the new Lincoln MKZ sedan, according to the company. The
automaker’s Ohio engine plant already produces the 3.5-liter V-6
EcoBoost used in the top-selling Ford F-150 pickup, the
company’s  website  shows.  Ford shares fell 1.7 percent to $12.39 at the close in  New
York . They have slid 4.3 percent this year compared with a 5.3
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
