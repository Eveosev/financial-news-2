Brazil ’s government is weighing
changes in its proposed regulatory framework for ports to avert
a dock workers’ strike that could hurt trade in  Latin America ’s
largest economy.  Government officials and union leaders will meet tomorrow
in Brasilia, Ports Minister Leonidas Cristino said in an
interview in Brasilia today. Dock workers will hold a six-hour
stoppage tomorrow to protest a proposed regulation allowing
privately owned terminals to hire workers who are not members of
OGMO, the organization that currently manages the workforce at
all public ports.  “I’m not saying that we will accept, but we can change the
measure to a degree to provide greater legal certainty,”
Cristino said. “The essence of the measure will not be
altered.”  Expiring terminal concessions with Cargill Inc., Cosan SA
Industria & Comercio,  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  and Libra
Terminais SA will probably be renewed if the companies boost
investments, Cristino said, without elaborating on the measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
