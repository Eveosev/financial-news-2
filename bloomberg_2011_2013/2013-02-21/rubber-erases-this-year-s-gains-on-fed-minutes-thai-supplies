Rubber futures declined for a third
day, wiping out this year’s advance, as U.S.  Federal Reserve 
minutes showed a debate over stimulus and on concern that
 Thailand  will increase supplies.  The contract for July delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell as much as 2.8 percent to 296.7 yen a kilogram
($3,169 a metric ton), the lowest level since Dec. 27, and was
at 297.6 yen at 11:58 a.m. Futures have retreated 1.6 percent
this year.  An index of leading indicators in the U.S. may show the
recovery is on track, fanning speculation that the Federal
Reserve may scale back stimulus, after minutes from its January
meeting released yesterday showed debate over the pace of asset
purchases. The Thai government will review a program to support
prices by purchasing the commodity from farmers when it expires
at the end of March, raising concerns supplies from the largest
exporter will increase.  “Rubber tracked losses in oil and other industrial metals
amid speculation the Federal Reserve may curtail monetary
stimulus,” said Takaki Shigemoto, analyst at research company
JSC Corp. “Concerns that Thailand will end price-support
measures also put pressure on the commodity.”  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 3.4 percent to 24,935  yuan  ($3,994) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 1.8 percent to 94.70 baht ($3.17) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
