Arkansas, Maine and Oregon are among
25 states that will split as much as $300 million from the
federal government to test new ways to pay for medical care in
an experiment funded by the 2010 health-care law.  The three states, plus  Massachusetts ,  Minnesota , and
 Vermont  will get most of the money, or about $250 million, the
 U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services said today in a
 statement . The six are testing programs intended to lower
health-care costs “while maintaining or improving quality of
care” in government programs including Medicaid and Medicare,
according to a website for the project.  The grants come from the Innovation Center at the U.S.
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which has $10
billion to spend on health-care experiments under the Affordable
Care Act. The center in the past has funded an effort to cut
medical errors as well as a plan that paid doctors and hospitals
flat fees for treating patients, instead of separate payments
for specific services.  “As a former governor, I understand the real sense of
urgency that states feel to improve the health of their
populations while also reducing total health care costs,”
 Kathleen Sebelius , the U.S. health secretary and a former Kansas
governor, said in the statement. “It’s critical that the many
elements of health care in each state -- including Medicaid,
public health, and workforce training -- work together.”  Medicare is the federal health program for the elderly and
disabled, and Medicaid is the state-run insurance program for
the poor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
