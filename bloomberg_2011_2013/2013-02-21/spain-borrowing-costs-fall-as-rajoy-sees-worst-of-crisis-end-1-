  Spain ’s borrowing costs fell at a
debt sale today after Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the
nation weathered the worst of its crisis, pushing the yield on
Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond down on  secondary markets .  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 4.2 billion euros of debt
($5.5 billion), more than its maximum target of 4 billion euros.
The sale included Spain’s two-year benchmark, which yielded 2.54
percent, down from 2.823 percent the last time it was offered on
Feb. 7.  The country also reopened its 10-year benchmark, which
matures on Jan. 31, 2023. The yield on the security, which
became the benchmark on Jan. 25, was 5.202 percent, compared
with 5.290 percent when the previous one was last tapped in
December. A 2019 note that hadn’t been sold for one year yielded
4.275 percent.  The European Commission will assess Spain’s economy
tomorrow after Rajoy said the  public deficit  was less than 7
percent of gross domestic product in 2012, excluding European
aid for banks. The government has lobbied for easing budget
goals after the country escaped a full bailout last year.  Little Dispersion  “The Spanish auction went really well as the Treasury
issued more than the maximum announced size,” Aditya Chordia, a
strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in  London , wrote in a research
note. The sale showed “little dispersion in bidding behavior,”
he said.  Spanish bonds rose after the auction, pushing the yield on
the 10-year benchmark as low as 5.17 percent at 11:15 a.m. in
 Madrid . That compares with a euro-era record of 7.75 percent in
July, before the  European Central Bank  pledged to backstop the
euro. The spread with similar German maturities was little
changed at 359 basis points.  Demand for the 2015 note was 3.69 times the amount sold, up
from 2.21 on Feb. 7, while the bid-to-cover ratio was 1.6 for
the 2023 security, down from 2.29 in December. It was 2.54 for
the 2019 bond.  “Overall this is a strong auction result, with higher
allocation to the 10-year versus both the two-year and six-year
bonds,”  Ioannis Sokos , a fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas
SA in London, said in an e-mailed comment.  Spain’s deficit target for 2012 set by euro-region finance
chiefs was 6.3 percent of GDP, after it registered a shortfall
of 9.4 percent in 2011. Economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
forecast a deficit of 8 percent. That’s in line with the
commission’s last projection, which also saw Spain’s public debt
load rising above the euro-area average next year for the first
time since the start of the euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
