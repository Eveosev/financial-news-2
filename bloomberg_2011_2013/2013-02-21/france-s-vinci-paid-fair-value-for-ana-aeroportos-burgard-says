Vinci SA (SU) ,  Europe ’s biggest builder,
paid a “fair” price of 3.1 billion euros ($4.1 billion) for
Portuguese airport manager ANA-Aeroportos de  Portugal  SA, said
Louis-Roch Burgard chief executive officer of Vinci Concessions.  The French company, whose offer was more than 600 million
euros higher than three other bidders in a government tender,
completed the purchase of the airport operator at a signing
ceremony in Lisbon today.  “We valued the present value and future value of ANA,
which we see as a strategic tool for our development,” Burgard
told reporters in Lisbon after signing the contract. “I think
we paid the fair value.”  Vinci, which also operates regional airports in France and
Cambodia, is betting on ANA to further expand its business
managing airports and other transport assets, Burgard said.
Portugal opted to sell ANA as part of conditions for receiving a
bailout from the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union in 2011.  Frankfurt airport owner Fraport AG bid 2.44 billion euros
for ANA, Argentina’s Corporacion America offered 2.41 billion
euros and requested to pay part of that within 10 years, while
Flughafen Zurich bid 2 billion euros, Sergio Monteiro,
Portugal’s secretary of state for public works, transport and
communications said on Dec. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
