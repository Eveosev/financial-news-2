Sri Lanka ’s  stock  exchange is
considering a rule ensuring companies have a minimum amount of
stock available for trade to lure foreign investors.  The bourse is discussing the minimum free-float requirement
with regulators, investors and companies and plans to introduce
the rule by the end of the year, Krishan Balendra, chairman of
the  Colombo Stock Exchange , said in an interview in Mumbai
yesterday. The exchange is also talking to the government about
listing state-owned enterprises, he said.  “We need more companies and more liquidity to attract
foreign participation in the markets,” Balendra said.  The bourse is seeking to lure more international investors
to a market valued at $17.5 billion, making it the smallest of
16 Asian-Pacific stock markets tracked by Bloomberg. Overseas
investors have sold a net $3.9 million of Sri Lankan shares this
year, after  buying  $300.4 million last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
