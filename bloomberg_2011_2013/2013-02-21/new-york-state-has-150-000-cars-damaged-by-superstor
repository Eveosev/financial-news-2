New York’s tally of vehicles damaged
in superstorm Sandy has increased to 150,000, the most of any
U.S. state, as the total number of cars battered in the October
disaster rose to 250,000, an  insurance-industry  group said.  New Jersey  followed with 60,000 damaged vehicles and
 Connecticut  came in third with an estimated 8,000, the National
Insurance Crime Bureau said today in a statement.  Sandy damaged 20,000 more vehicles in New York than earlier
estimated as insurers received additional claims, according to
the report. The storm struck the East Coast, killing more than
100 people and causing about $50 billion in damages.  “Sometimes weeks and weeks, months after an event, claims
will continue to trickle in from areas that were really at the
center of the storm,” Frank Scafidi, a spokesman at the
National Insurance Crime Bureau, said in a phone interview.  Sandy may cost the insurance industry as much as $25
billion, according to an estimate from catastrophe modeling firm
Risk Management Solutions Inc. Companies including Travelers
Cos. and Chubb Corp. posted lower fourth-quarter profit because
of the storm.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s Geico unit, New York’s leading
automobile insurer, is set to announce results for the fourth
quarter next week.  Warren Buffett , the firm’s 82-year-old
billionaire chairman and chief executive officer, addressed
Sandy’s impact in a Feb. 14 interview with Fox Business Network.  “We love being number one in the metropolitan New York
area,” Buffett said on Fox. “There was a day or two there when
we may not have felt so good about it but we love being number
one in New York.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
