Gold prices, already heading for the
biggest monthly loss since May, may extend declines to a 13-
month low, according to technical analysis by Matt McKinney at
Zaner Group LLC.  The metal’s nine-day moving average has been below the 20-
day average since Feb. 1, and both measures are declining on
“sharp angles,” forming a so-called “super-trend down,”
McKinney said. The bearish pattern signals that gold may drop to
as low as $1,526 an ounce by the end of the month, he said. That
would be the lowest since Dec. 29, 2011.  “There is so much momentum on the down side,” McKinney
said in a telephone interview from  Chicago . “The charts show
that the drop is not over.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1,580
at 10:14 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The metal has dropped
4.9 percent in February. Earlier, the price touched $1,554.30,
the lowest since June 29.  The nine-day moving average is near $1,624, and the 20-day
measure is near $1,649.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts use charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
