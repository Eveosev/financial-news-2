Hong Kong   stocks  dropped, with the
city’s benchmark index heading for its lowest close this year,

streak since July 2009, after the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked

optimism China’s recovery will continue.  “Once  interest rates  start going up, it will have a
negative effect on the market,” said Ng Soo Nam, chief
investment officer of Nikko Asset Management Asia Ltd. in

oversees about $165 billion globally. “In the near-term,
interest rates will still be pretty supportive. China is trying
to avoid runaway property prices. The policies are meant to
create a steady market rather than crash the market.”  Shares on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  traded at 11.1 times
