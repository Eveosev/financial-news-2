  BWT AG (BWT) , an Austrian maker of water-
purification equipment, said yearly sales reached a record,
surpassing a half-billion euros for the first time in 2012.  BWT shares rose as much as 7 percent to 15.635 euros, a
one-week high in Vienna, on more than three times the average
three-month volume after the Mondsee-based company reported
today in a statement that full-year sales rose 4.9 percent to
502.3 million euros ($662 million).    BWT, which stands for “best water technology,” has been
listed on the Vienna Exchange since 1992. The company’s water
equipment, primarily for homes and hotels, treats everything
from drinking to swimming pool water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
