Brazil â€™s central bank reduced
interest rates it charges banks that tap its rediscount credit
line after cutting borrowing costs to a record low.  Financial institutions will be charged the  benchmark rate ,
which is at 7.25 percent, plus 1 percent a year for one-day
loans, the central bank said in a statement posted on its
website. Previously, they were charged the Selic rate plus 6
percent a year. For loans of as much as 15 days, the rate will
be Selic plus 2 percent, instead of 4 percent.  Brazil has reduced its benchmark interest rate by 525 basis
points since August 2010, more than any other Group of 20
nation. The decision to reduce rediscount rates seeks to reflect
the drop in borrowing costs, the central bank said.  Policy makers also reduced the fine banks that fail to meet
their reserve requirements must pay on overdue deposits to Selic
plus 4 percent, down from Selic plus 14 percent, the central
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
