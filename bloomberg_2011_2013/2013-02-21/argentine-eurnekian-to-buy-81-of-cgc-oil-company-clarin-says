Argentine businessman Eduardo Eurnekian will pay $200 million to Southern Cross Group for a 81
percent stake in the local oil producer Compania General de
Combustible, newspaper Clarin reported.  The energy company has 16 fields in the provinces of Santa
Cruz, Neuquen, Rio Negro, Salta, Formosa and in  Venezuela , the
Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  Officials at CGC and Southern Cross Group in Buenos Aires,
who asked not to be identified in accordance with company
policy, declined to comment on the report. Eurnekian didnâ€™t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The agreement may accelerate plans to work with state-run
 YPF SA (YPFD)  and make progress on a memorandum of understanding signed
last year, the paper said. Eurnekian is also head of  Aeropuertos
Argentina 2000  which operates 33 airports in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
