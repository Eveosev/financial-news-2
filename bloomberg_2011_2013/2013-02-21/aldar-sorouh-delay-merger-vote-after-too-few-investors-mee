Shareholders of  Aldar Properties
PJSC (ALDAR)  and  Sorouh (SOROUH)  Real Estate Co. will convene for a second time
to vote on a planned merger after an insufficient number of
investors attended two separate meetings today.  Voters representing 50 percent of the stock will be
sufficient to constitute a quorum at the second round of
extraordinary general meetings on March 3. The level was 75
percent in the first round. Abu Dhabi’s largest developers
expect their shareholders to approve the transaction, according
to spokesmen of the companies. They asked not to be identified,
citing company policy.  Aldar’s board last month approved a plan to offer 1.288
shares for each Sorouh stock in a government-backed acquisition
to create the  Middle East ’s third-largest publicly traded
developer. Sorouh stock has gained 9.4 percent since the
announcement as investors deemed the deal’s terms to favor the
smaller of the two developers. Aldar gained 4.1 percent during
that period. Shares of both companies closed unchanged today.  Abu Dhabi ’s government has taken an increasingly direct
role in supporting builders and development projects after the
credit crisis kicked off a real estate slump that caused values
to drop by more than 50 percent. The oil-rich state spent $9.8
billion to bail out Aldar in 2011 and last year it backed the
revival of halted projects including branches of the Louvre and
Guggenheim museums.  To contact the reporter on this story:
