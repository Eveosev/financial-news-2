Hungarian banks expect corporate
lending conditions to improve for the first time in three years
because of ample liquidity and deeper competition for “good”
customers, the central bank said.  “A turnaround in corporate lending will require
significant and continued softening in lending conditions,” the
bank said in a quarterly lending  survey  published today. “The
negative” economic and financial sector outlook is prompting
banks to keep cautious lending activities, it said.  Hungary’s  economy  is battling its second recession in four
years as the euro-area crisis hurts exports and government
policies undermine investor confidence and banks’ willingness to
lend. Investments in the economy have plunged, threatening the
Cabinet’s efforts to lead the country out of recession.  Demand for short-term corporate loans is on the rise, while
long-term credit demand is falling, according to the survey,
which was conducted in January.  In the household segment, demand for credit remains
subdued, even with banks easing lending conditions, the survey
said.  The government wants an agreement with commercial lenders
to help ease the burden of foreign-currency mortgage holders in
exchange for lowering the bank tax, the highest in  Europe , Gyula Pleschinger, state secretary at the  Economy Ministry , said on
Feb. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
