  Mexico ’s phone regulator must study
whether to force phone companies to lease the parts of their
network that connect directly to the homes and businesses of
customers, a concept known as “local-loop unbundling,” the
nation’s regulatory review agency said.  The Federal Regulatory Improvement Commission rejected a
proposal from the Federal Telecommunications Commission to
regulate the way phone companies connect to each other, a
document known as the Interconnection Framework Accord. The
phone regulator must provide an analysis of costs and benefits
of local-loop unbundling to win approval for the regulation, the
regulatory review agency said in a  letter  on its website.  The phone regulator had said last month it aimed to publish
the regulation in early February, assuming it got approval from
the regulatory improvement commission. The government has said
America Movil SAB must sign the document to win approval for its
Telmex unit to offer pay-TV service in Mexico.  To contact the reporter on this story:
