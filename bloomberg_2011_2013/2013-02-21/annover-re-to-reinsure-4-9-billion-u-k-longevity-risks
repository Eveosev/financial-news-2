Hannover Re  will re-insure the
majority of 3.2 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) in U.K. pension
liabilities of  Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  against the risk of
retirees living longer than expected, in the German company’s
biggest such deal.  Hannover Re will get about 2.2 billion pounds in premium
income, including 100 million pounds for 2013, from helping
Legal & General bear risks for the policies, the Hanover,
Germany-based reinsurer said today in a statement.  Hannover Re will bear the “biometric risk” of retirees
drawing pension payments for more years than anticipated rather
than investment performance risks, it said. Such swaps diversify
the company’s portfolio because they are “negatively correlated
with mortality risks,” Chief Executive Officer  Ulrich Wallin 
said in the statement.  In 2010, Hannover Re and other reinsurers helped Deutsche
Bank AG’s Abbey Life buy almost 3 billion pounds in U.K. pension
liabilities covering about 60,000 policy-holders working for
carmaker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. Hannover Re assumed almost
half of the transaction’s longevity risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
