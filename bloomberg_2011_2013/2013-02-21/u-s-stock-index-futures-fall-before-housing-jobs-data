U.S.  stocks  fell, following the biggest drop since November for the Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (CYC) , as concern grew that the U.S. Federal Reserve may slow the pace of stimulus and investors weighed corporate earnings.  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  lost 43 percent after the maker of credit-card terminals forecast second-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates because of weak economic conditions in  Europe . Wal-Mart Stores Inc. rose 1.5 percent as the world’s biggest retailer reported earnings that topped forecasts.  Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)  Co. rallied 6.7 percent after regular trading as its outlook exceeded estimates.  The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent, or 9.53 points, to 1,502.42 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The benchmark index lost 1.2 percent yesterday amid concern that the Fed will scale back economic stimulus. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 46.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,880.62 today. About 7.7 billion shares exchanged hands on U.S. exchanges today, 25 percent above the three-month average.  “The timeliness of the Fed’s comments coming out took a little bit of the excess out of the stock market,”  Tim Hartzell , who helps manage about $400 million as chief investment officer at Sequent Asset Management in Houston, said in a phone interview. “Equities really had gotten ahead of itself with just the belief that there’s always going to be $85 billion come into the market from the Fed.”  Fed Debate  Several participants at the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Jan. 29-30 meeting said the central bank should be ready to vary the pace of its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, minutes from the meeting showed yesterday, spurring concern stimulus will be curtailed.  The S&P 500 has  gained 5.4 percent  this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget and companies reported better-than-estimated earnings. The benchmark gauge is 4 percent below its 2007 all-time high of 1,565.15, while the Dow is 2 percent from its record high of 14,164.53.  About 72 percent of the 433 companies in the  S&P 500  that have released quarterly results since Jan. 8 have exceeded profit estimates, and 65 percent beat sales estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “People are taking some profits and watching to see what the next catalyst is,” Neil Massa, senior equity trader at Boston-based John Hancock Asset Management, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $233 billion. “It’s a healthy sell off. We’ve gone up so much, it’s a good opportunity to take a breather. I don’t think it’s a sign of a continuing trend.”  Budget Cuts  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX,  climbed  3.7 percent to 15.22. That followed a jump of 19 percent yesterday, the biggest advance since November 2011.  Volatility will likely increase with the March 1 deadline for automatic  federal budget  cuts approaching, said New York- based Russ Koesterich, the chief investment strategist at BlackRock. Republicans and President  Barack Obama  are seeking to assign blame for who would be at fault if the cuts, known as sequestration, take effect.  Investors holding more U.S. equities than the benchmark they track should reduce exposure, Koesterich said at a briefing in Sydney. “Part of what we’d suggest again is lowering the allocation a bit to the U.S. and second of all, being cautious of the parts of the market that are dependent upon U.S. consumption.”  Philadelphia Manufacturing  Stocks extended losses today as the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index dropped to minus 12.5, the lowest reading since June, from minus 5.8 in January. Readings lower than zero signal contraction in the area covering eastern  Pennsylvania , southern  New Jersey  and  Delaware .

Carlyle Group LP, the second-largest U.S. private-equity company, tumbled 7.8 percent to $33.80, the most since going public in May. Washington-based Carlyle, the most active U.S. private-equity buyer in 2012, reported fourth-quarter profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates as the firm’s fund holdings appreciated at a slower pace.  Wal-Mart rose $1.05 to $70.26. The retailer rose as fourth- quarter profit topped analysts’ estimates and the company raised its dividend, overcoming concerns that tax increases would hurt earnings this year.
