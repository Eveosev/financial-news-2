Power for 2014 delivery in  Germany 
and  France , Europe’s biggest markets, rose as European Union
emissions permits advanced.  Baseload German year-ahead electricity, for supplies
delivered around the clock, advanced as much as 1.3 percent
while the French contract added 0.6 percent.  Emissions climbed as much as 8 percent after Claude Turmes,
a member of European Parliament, said Germany may vote to
introduce a carbon floor price if an EU proposal to temporarily
curb a glut of permits isn’t approved. Power can track
emissions, which affect production costs.  “Since February started, the link between European Union
Allowance price movements and German power price ones has been
strong,” Paolo Coghe, a Paris-based analyst at  Societe Generale
SA (GLE)  said in a report today. “Little price improvements are
possible, but do not get carried away.”  German next-year power, a benchmark contract in  Europe ,
climbed as much as 54 cents to 42.74 euros ($56.54) a megawatt-
hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contract traded at 42.65 euros as of 4:40 p.m. Berlin time.
French power advanced 25 cents to 45.10 euros.  EU carbon permits for December traded at 5.33 euros a
metric ton, up 7 percent, after rising as high as 5.38 euros on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  French day-ahead electricity lost 1.7 percent to 58 euros a
megawatt-hour in broker trading and settled at 53.93 on  EPEX
Spot . The German next-day contract dropped 3.9 percent to 49
euros a megawatt-hour. The price settled at 47.95 euros in a
daily auction on EPEX Spot SE.  EON SE’s 1,140-megawatt Brokdorf nuclear power plant in
Germany returned to full capacity after halting yesterday, Almut
Zyweck, a company spokesman, said by phone today from Hannover.
 RWE AG (RWE)  started its Niederaussem-G lignite-fed power plant after
an unplanned halt on Feb. 17, according to the company’s
website.  Wind output in Germany is predicted at about 5 gigawatts
tomorrow, Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather forecaster,
said on its website. That compares with an  average  level of 4.9
gigawatts, according to data from European Energy Exchange AG on
Bloomberg.  Temperatures in France may fall to minus 1 degree Celsius
(30 Fahrenheit) at 6 p.m. tomorrow compared with a previous
forecast of minus 0.7, according to a GFS model supplied by
MetraWeather to Bloomberg. In Germany, minimum temperatures will
reach minus 4.7 degrees at 6 p.m. tomorrow, compared with a
previous prediction of minus 4.5 degrees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
