Mace Group Ltd., the company that
built London’s Shard skyscraper, was chosen to manage the
development of the kilometer-high Kingdom Tower in Jeddah,  Saudi
Arabia .  Mace and real estate consultant EC Harris Group Ltd. will
jointly manage the $1.2 billion project, EC Harris’s parent
company  Arcadis NV (ARCAD) , said today in a statement. Construction on
the tower, set to be the world’s tallest, will begin later this
year and is expected to be completed within 5 1/2 years,
according to the statement.  “The Kingdom Tower is a landmark building that will
clearly demonstrate Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to the world,”
Keith Brooks, EC Harris’ head of property and social
infrastructure, said in the statement.  The Kingdom Tower will eclipse today’s highest skyscraper,
the 828-meter (2,700-foot) Burj Khalifa in Dubai, when completed
in 2018. The skyscraper, about 50 floors higher than Burj
Khalifa, will include a Four Seasons hotel, apartments, offices,
three lobbies on the upper floors and the world’s highest
observation deck on the 157th level.  The  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , the  investment company  95 percent
controlled by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, holds a
third of Jeddah Economic Co. which owns the tower project.  The Shard, western Europe’s tallest building at 1,016 feet,
was inaugurated in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
