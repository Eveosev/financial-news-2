Italian President Giorgio Napolitano
will meet with  Chancellor Angela Merkel  in Germany next week
after Italy votes in a parliamentary election permeated by
concerns about Germany’s influence in Europe.  Napolitano will be in Germany from Feb. 26 to March 1 on
the invitation of German President  Joachim Gauck , the office of
the Italian head of state said today in a statement posted on
its website. Beyond Merkel and Gauck, Napolitano will see
Bundestag President Norbert Lammert and Bavarian Prime Minister
 Horst Seehofer  and give a speech at a Berlin university.  Italian voters are sizing up Germany’s influence in their
country and the wider European Union as they prepare to cast
ballots Feb. 24-25. Germany’s push for fiscal austerity in the
EU has been criticized by candidates including  Silvio Berlusconi 
and Beppe Grillo, who say Italy needs stimulus to end the
country’s recession. Napolitano’s visit to Germany will be made
before the head of state appoints Italy’s next prime minister.  “Looking at things through the eyes of the common person,
I would say, ‘My god, why is he doing this?’” said Giovanni
Orsina, a professor at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome.
“It can give Italians even more the impression that this is a
country with limited sovereignty. And of course, the reaction to
this is anger and frustration, with anger and frustration
playing into the hands of Berlusconi and Grillo.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
