Egypt  is in an economic “crisis”
from which it can’t recover without reaching a final accord with
the International Monetary Fund for a $4.8 billion loan,
Planning and Investment Minister Ashraf El-Arabi told reporters
today.  The country’s foreign currency reserves are enough for less
than three months of import needs, a level that reflects the
challenges confronting the economy and which “disturbs”
officials, he said.  Egypt’s net international reserves dropped to $13.6 billion
by the end of January, according to central bank data. That’s
more than 60 percent below their pre-2011 uprising levels.  The government will invite the IMF back to Egypt within
days, or no more than a week, El-Arabi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
