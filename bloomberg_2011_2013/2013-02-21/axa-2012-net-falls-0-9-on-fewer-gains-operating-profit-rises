Axa SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
insurer, said profit fell 0.9 percent in 2012 as year-earlier
gains from selling businesses weren’t repeated.  Net income fell to 4.15 billion euros ($5.5 billion) from
4.19 billion euros in 2011, the Paris-based insurer said in a
statement today. That missed the 4.47 billion-euro average
 estimate  of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue increased
5 percent to 90.1 billion euros.  Axa, led by Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries, is
expanding in  Asia  and has shifted 6 billion euros of capital to
faster-growing markets since 2010. Annual operating profit,
which excludes  capital gains , one-time charges and variations in
asset valuations, rose 13 percent to 4.25 billion euros, above
analysts’ estimates, driven by earnings from life and savings.  “ Life insurance  is globally good,” said Benoit Valleaux,
a Paris-based analyst at Natixis SA who has a buy rating on the
stock. “The group is reinforcing its financial solidity, and
that’s good too.”  Axa plans a  dividend  of 72 cents a share for 2012, up from
69 cents a year earlier. The stock fell 1.5 percent to 13.50
euros by 9:07 a.m. in Paris trading, trimming the  gain  this year
to 1.1 percent. The 28-member Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance
Index  advanced  3.5 percent this year.  Allianz Results  Allianz SE (ALV) , based in Munich, reported a more than doubling
in fourth-quarter net income today to 1.22 billion euros on
reduced claims from natural disasters. Allianz said it sees 2013
operating profit at 9.2 billion euros, plus or minus 500 million
euros, after posting full-year operating profit of 9.5 billion
euros last year, meeting its goal of more than 9 billion euros.  At Axa, operating profit from property and casualty
insurance rose 3 percent to 1.9 billion euros, while profit from
the life-and-savings business, its biggest division, rose 23
percent to 2.64 billion euros, beating analysts’ 2.54 billion-
euro estimate.  “Their life business is resisting” difficult market
conditions, Jacques-Pascal Porta, who helps manage 600 million
euros at Ofi Gestion Privee in Paris, including Axa shares, said
before the results were published. “You also see the first
fruits of their quite important push in Asia and especially  Hong
Kong .”  The company increased its planned cost reductions by 200
million euros to 1.7 billion euros by 2015.  “We have continued to relentlessly pursue efficiencies and
product innovations, as well as benefit from sweet spots in
high-growth markets,” de Castries, 58, said in the statement.  Profit Targets  Deputy CEO Denis Duverne said in an interview with Mark
Baron on Bloomberg Television’s Countdown show that he expects
P&C earnings will improve further in 2013 and that the company’s
life business is “well positioned.” He said the company should
be able to meet its targets for 2015.  Adjusted return on equity, a measure of profitability,
reached 13.3 percent last year, bringing it into line with a
goal of 13 percent to 15 percent in 2015.  In November, Axa lowered its earnings targets through 2015
as “unfavorable” financial markets weighed on its life-
insurance and asset-management units. Axa said on Nov. 7 it
expects operating earnings per share to grow 5 percent to 10
percent annually until 2015, compared with a previous target of
10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
