U.K. government bonds advanced, with
10-year yields dropping the most this year, amid speculation the
 Bank of England  will increase its asset-purchase  program  as the
economy stalls.  The pound climbed from a 15-month low against the euro and
German bunds advanced after a report showed services and
manufacturing in the 17-nation region shrank in February,
boosting demand for safer assets. Sterling earlier fell to the
weakest since July 2010 against the dollar after the  Federal
Reserve  signaled it may slow the pace of its bond-buying
program, while more Bank of England policy makers voted this
month to boost stimulus. The U.K. auctioned 10-year gilts.  “The risk of price-insensitive central-bank buying is more
of a factor than it was before the minutes,” said  Sam Hill , a
fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “A
lot of the move is to do with bunds being up as well, which are
catching up on the risk-off tone.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 2.11 percent as of 4:14 p.m. London time,
after dropping as much as 10 basis points, the most since Nov.
28. The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 rose 0.72, or 7.20
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,526) face amount, to 96.925.  The rate on similar-maturity German  bunds  dropped seven
basis points to 1.58 percent.  BOE Minutes  Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  and  Paul Fisher  joined
 David Miles  in voting to increase the target for bond purchases
by 25 billion pounds to 400 billion pounds, minutes of the
central bank’s Feb. 7 meeting released yesterday showed. They
were outvoted by the remaining six members of the Monetary
Policy Committee.  The Debt Management Office sold an additional 2.25 billion
pounds of benchmark 10-year gilts at an average yield of 2.147
percent, the highest since May. The U.K. last sold 10-year bonds
on Jan. 22 at an average yield of 1.897 percent.  The pound slumped 1.2 percent against the dollar yesterday
as minutes of the Fed’s January meeting released showed several
participants said the central bank should be “prepared to vary
the pace of asset purchases,” known as quantitative easing.  “The pound was underperforming anyway due to the recent
BOE alarm bells,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund
sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “There are
pound-specific sell forces in play in the form of verbal
intervention, potential rate cuts and further QE, and the Fed
added fuel to the fire. A move to $1.50 is our current target.”  Pound’s Slide  The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.5261 after sliding to
$1.5132, the lowest since July 21, 2010. The U.K. currency
strengthened 0.6 percent to 86.68 pence per euro. It weakened to
87.65 pence yesterday, the weakest since October 2011.  The pound may extend its decline against the dollar after
breaking through a key level of so-called support, Credit Suisse
AG said, citing trading patterns.  The U.K. currency may fall toward $1.4856, the 61.8 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its advance between January and August
2009, after breaching $1.5274, the 50 percent retracement,
Cilline Bain, a technical analyst at Credit Suisse in  London ,
wrote in an e-mailed report to clients.  “We will continue to slide lower,” Bain said in a
telephone interview, confirming the contents of the report.
“The next significant target is $1.4856.” Support refers to an
area where buy orders may be clustered.  The pound has slumped 5.1 percent this year, the second-
worst performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Only the yen has
weakened more, losing 5.7 percent.  U.K. government bonds handed investors a loss of 2.8
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German bonds dropped 1.7 percent and
Treasuries fell 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
