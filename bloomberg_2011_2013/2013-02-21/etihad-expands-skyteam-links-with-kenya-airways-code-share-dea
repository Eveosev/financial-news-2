Etihad Airways PJSC, the third-
largest Gulf carrier, struck a partnership with  Kenya Airways (KNAL) 
that opens up destinations across  Africa  while bringing it
closer to the Air France-KLM Group-led Skyteam alliance.  Etihad will place its flight code on Kenya Airways services
to 27 cities beyond Nairobi, while the African carrier will gain
access to 32 locations via its new ally’s base in  Abu Dhabi . It
will also add three weekly flights between the two hubs.  Etihad has built a network of 42 code-share agreements and
what Chief Executive Officer  James Hogan  calls an “equity
alliance” that’s seen it take stakes in Air Berlin Plc, Aer
Lingus Group Plc, Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. and Air
Seychelles Ltd. Kenya Air, sub-Saharan Africa’s third-biggest
carrier, is a member of Skyteam and almost 27 percent owned by
Air France-KLM, with which Etihad secured an alliance on Oct. 8.  “As part of the agreement we are looking for greater
collaboration and coordination on cargo operations, training and
procurement opportunities which will make us more cost efficient
and customer responsive,” Kenya Air Chief Executive Officer
Titus Naikuni said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
