Suning Appliance Co. (002004) , China’s
biggest electronics retailer by market value, plans to expand
its offerings to include daily products such as baby-care items
and cosmetics.  The company wants to move to a model similar to  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ,  Chairman Zhang Jindong told
reporters today. The company has brick-and-mortar stores and an
e-commerce business.  The retailer and competitor  Gome Electrical Appliances
Holding Ltd. (493)  have been investing in e-commerce in China. The
country’s online-retail transactions are projected to more than
double to 2.57 trillion yuan ($412 billion) by 2015 from 1.22
trillion yuan last year, according to Analysys International, a
Beijing-based researcher.  Suning will also go into service-based products such as
customer financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
