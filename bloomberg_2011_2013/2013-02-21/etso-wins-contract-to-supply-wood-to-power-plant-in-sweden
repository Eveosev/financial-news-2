Metso Oyj (MEO1V) , a Finnish engineering
company, won a 25 million-euro ($33 million) contract to supply
a plant to Vimmerby Energi & Miljo AB in  Sweden  that will use
bark and wood chips to produce heat and power.  The facility in Vimmerby in the countryâ€™s south will have a
7-megawatt power and 26-megawatt heat capacity, Helsinki-based
Metso said today in a  statement  on its website. It will supply a
heating network and local industries with hot water, while power
will be sent to the grid. It should begin work by end-2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
