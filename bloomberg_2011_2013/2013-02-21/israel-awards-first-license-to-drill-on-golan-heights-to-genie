Israel ’s Ministry of Energy and
Water Resources has awarded the first energy exploration license
in the disputed Golan Heights to a local subsidiary of U.S.-
based  Genie Energy Corp. (GNE)   “The company believes, based on its preliminary analysis
and interpretation of existing geological data, that the newly
issued license area may contain significant quantities of
conventional oil and gas in relatively tight formations,” Genie
Energy said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Golan was captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967
war, and again served as a battlefield when the Syrians
unsuccessfully tried to retake it in the 1973 conflict. Israeli
claims to the territory aren’t recognized by the international
community. Former prime minister  Ehud Barak  offered to return
most of the occupied Golan to Syria in unsuccessful negotiations
to reach a peace agreement in 1999-2000.  Israeli Energy Minister Uzi Landau decided last year to
open the Golan to energy exploration, after significant gas
fields were discovered off the country’s Mediterranean shore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
