Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  is set
for its longest stretch of monthly declines since 2008 as
analysts estimate revenue for the best performing Israeli
company in New York last year will decline.  Shares of the maker of software used to transfer and store
data have declined 3 percent in February and are set for a sixth
 monthly retreat , the longest rout since the end of November
2008. The stock’s average 50-day volatility was at 74.6 in the
12 months to yesterday, up from 47.6 the previous year. The
 Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the biggest Israeli stocks
in the U.S. fell the most in seven weeks, led by MagicJack
VocalTech Ltd. and  Nova Measuring (NVMI)  Instruments Ltd.  Mellanox slumped after management delivered two quarterly
sales forecasts that missed estimates. The Yokneam Elit, Israel-
based company, whose shares  rallied  83 percent in 2012 on
surging demand for its Infiniband technology, is facing
increased competition as  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
chipmaker, develops a similar product. Analysts have  cut  their
2013 sales estimates to $447.6 million from $659.3 million in
September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Their story has changed, and there’s been a pretty big
speed bump,”  Rajesh Ghai , an analyst at Craig-Hallum Capital
Group LLC who rates Mellanox hold, said by phone from  Dallas 
yesterday. “The long-term prospects are pretty good, but with
the stock being so volatile in the last six months, the market
is still trying to make up its mind.”  Intel’s Acquisitions  Santa Clara , California-based Intel acquired on Feb. 29
QLogic Corp.’s InfiniBand business for $125 million, competing
with Mellanox’s technology. Three months later, Intel bought
Cray Inc.’s technology to connect server chips for $140 million.  Mellanox’s prospects depend on how aggressively Intel
decides to enter the market in 2014, Jonathan Kreizman, an
analyst at Clal Finance Batucha Brokerage Ltd., said by phone
from  Tel Aviv  yesterday.  Mellanox  forecast  on Jan. 23 first-quarter sales that
trailed estimates by as much as 48 percent amid a build-up in
inventory by one of its customers. Sales for the three months
ended March will reach $78 million to $83 million, the company
said. Earlier that month, Mellanox cut its fourth-quarter
revenue forecast on weaker demand and a product glitch.  Class Action  Palisade Capital Management LLC, which manages about $3.6
billion of assets, sold its Mellanox holding last year after
Dennison Veru, the firm’s chief investment officer, said by
phone from  Fort Lee ,  New Jersey  on Feb. 12.  The stock had “a huge run in a very compressed period of
time,” he said. “The company put up some very strong quarters
but then started missing on some of these issues.”  Mellanox is currently the target of class action complaints
and law firm investigations in Tel Aviv and  New York , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. A class action complaint filed by
Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP on Feb. 7 alleges Mellanox
issued “false and misleading statements” about its financial
performance and outlook.  “That’s quite a few to be honest,” Craig-Hallum’s Ghai
said. “But this is par for the course in the tech industry. As
long as the SEC doesn’t file an investigation, I don’t see cause
for concern.”  Mellanox fell 1.8 percent to $51.64 in New York, the lowest
price since Jan. 30. Shares traded in Tel Aviv dropped 3.8
percent to 192.2 shekels, or the equivalent of $51.97.  Index Drops  The Bloomberg Israel-US index slid 1.3 percent to 87.05
yesterday, its biggest slump since Jan. 3.  Israel ’s benchmark
 TA-25 (TA-25)  Index declined 1.9 percent to 1,218.  MagicJack, based in Netanya, Israel, sank 8.1 percent to
$11.52, the lowest price in 14 months. The stock’s 10-day
 volatility  of 62.7 is the highest since Jan. 22.  Nova Measuring declined 4.4 percent to $9.04 as shares in
Tel Aviv fell 1 percent to 33.4 shekels, or the equivalent of
$9.03. The New York-traded shares’  premium  rose to 27 cents on
Feb. 20, the highest in a month.  Syneron Medical Ltd. lost 0.9 percent to $10.43. The maker
of aesthetic medical products settled its U.S. patent
infringement lawsuit against EndyMed Ltd. and Eclipse
Aesthetics. The parties agreed to immediately stop selling
Caesarea, Israel-based Endymed’s fractional skin resurfacing
products in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
