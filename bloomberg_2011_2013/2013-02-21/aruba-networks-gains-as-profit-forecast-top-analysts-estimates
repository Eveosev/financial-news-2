Aruba Networks Inc. (ARUN) , which makes
wireless-network equipment for the U.S. military, schools and
retailers, gained the most in more than three years after
beating estimates for profit and sales.  Earnings in the fiscal second quarter, leaving out some
items, were 22 cents a share, beating the 19-cent average
estimate of analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Aruba, based in Sunnyvale,  California , forecast third-quarter
sales of at least $159 million, topping the $158.2 million
estimate.  Aruba is taking advantage of demand for equipment as more
companies provide wireless access to customers and employees.
The company said in a statement yesterday it installed its
technology for Rex Healthcare Inc. and Connecticut’s Quinnipiac
University during the quarter.  Aruba  climbed  22 percent to $25.40 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since May 2009. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, by comparison, rose 0.9 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
