A case of Chateau Latour 2010 traded
for 10,994 pounds ($16,700) on the London-based Liv-ex wine
market this week, its highest level for 16 months and part of a
broader recovery by top Bordeaux wines, while Chateau Mouton-
Rothschild 1998 reached an eight-month high.  The Latour, a first-growth Pauillac, was 22 percent above
the record low of 8,991 pounds paid for the vintage last July,
while still below the 12,500 pounds at which it traded soon
after release in the wine futures market in July 2011.  Prices for top Bordeaux wines have rallied as broader
investor interest resumed after a decline during the financial
crisis, and buying from  China  ahead of this month’s New Year
festivities spurred demand. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of
leading clarets climbed 3.5 percent in January, its biggest
monthly gain for two years, after a drop of 9.7 percent in 2012.
The index rose further this month, taking it 8 percent up from a
two-and-a-half year low in November.  “This year started with a great flurry of activity,”
Peter Lunzer, founder of Lunzer Wine Investments in London, said
in an e-mailed report this month. “Many buyers sought wines
which last year were ignored, and which for some time we have
been saying were undervalued.” Lunzer helps manage investment
and trading accounts worth $34 million.  The 2010 vintage of Chateau Latour, in common with much of
the Medoc, is the third-most expensive of the past 30 years,
trailing only the 2009 and the 1982. The rally in its price
reflects buying interest across a wider group of Bordeaux wines.  Mouton-Rothschild  Mouton-Rothschild 1998, another first-growth Pauillac,
climbed to 3,240 pounds on Liv-ex on Feb. 19, up more than 20
percent from last November’s 32-month low. A case of the same
vintage sold at a  Sotheby’s  auction in London in January for
3,290 pounds. Mouton, restored by Baron Philippe de Rothschild
in the last century, is now run by his daughter Baroness
Philippine de Rothschild and grandson Julien de Beaumarchais.  The 2000 vintage of Chateau Pichon-Longueville, a second-
growth Pauillac owned by Axa Millesimes and run by its managing
director Christian Seely, and the 2008 wine of Chateau Lynch-
Bages, a neighboring fifth-growth vineyard, both rose to their
highest level for five months on Liv-ex this week.  Pichon-Longueville 2000 advanced to 1,430 pounds a case
while Lynch-Bages 2008 rose to 750 pounds, according to data on
Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  Other winemakers whose prices rallied included Chateau
Grand Puy Lacoste 2010, climbing to a 14-month high of 577
pounds and Chateau Clerc Milon 2009, touching an 18-month high
of 410 pounds.  A case of Pavillon Rouge 2009, the second wine of Chateau
Margaux, traded at 900 pounds this week, its highest level on
the exchange since June.  Latour 2004 is the biggest gainer in the Fine Wine 50 over
the past year, ahead of three vintages of Mouton-Rothschild,
according to Liv-ex data, based on merchant list prices in
 Europe , while Mouton 2008 leads declines.  To contact the reporter on the story:
