Axiata Group Bhd. (AXIATA) , Malaysia’s
largest mobile-phone operator, almost doubled its proposed
annual  dividend  payout to 3 billion ringgit ($966 million) after
boosting profits.  The carrier, based in  Kuala Lumpur , declared a final
dividend of 27 sen per share, including a special dividend of 12
sen, according to a stock exchange filing today. That brought
its total planned 2012 payout to 35 sen per share, compared with
19 sen a year earlier.  Axiata, which has operations in countries including India,
Indonesia and Singapore, began paying dividends in 2011 after
previously retaining earnings to fund growth and  acquisitions  in
emerging Asian markets. It increased its payout ratio to 70
percent of earnings in 2012 from 60 percent a year earlier.
That’s excluding the special dividend.  Net income  climbed 4.9 percent to 571.1 million ringgit, or
7 sen per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from 544.6
million ringgit, or 6 sen, a year earlier, it said. Revenue
gained 4.7 percent to 4.45 billion ringgit.  “I’m very pleased with the group’s excellent growth in
revenue and profitability despite competition,” Jamaludin Ibrahim, Axiata’s chief executive officer, said in a separate
statement.  Full-year profit rose 7.1 percent to 2.51 billion ringgit,
or 30 sen per share, the filing showed. That missed the 32.2 sen
average of 34 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Value Creation’  “In 2012 Axiata’s share price grew 28 percent, with total
shareholders’ return at 32.7 percent, outperforming” the  FTSE
Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI)  for the third consecutive year, Azman
Mokhtar, chairman of Axiata and managing director of its biggest
 shareholder  Khazanah Nasional Bhd., said in the statement.
“This, alongside the increased dividends, goes a long way
toward value creation for shareholders.”  Axiata rose 1.9 percent to 6.33 ringgit at the close in
Kuala Lumpur. It’s dropped 4 percent this year, while the
benchmark index has lost 4.4 percent amid investor concern over
the outcome of Malaysia’s general election this year.  The group also owns stakes in mobile operators in  Sri
Lanka , Bangladesh and Cambodia. Axiata has expressed interest in
a license in Myanmar, the company said Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
