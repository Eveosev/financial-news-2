Myanmar asylum seekers rescued by
the Sri Lankan navy earlier this week told police that 98 people
died during the voyage that began two months ago.  Sri Lanka ’s navy rescued 32 Myanmar asylum seekers and
placed them in the custody of immigration officials, according
to Sri Lankan police spokesman Prishantha Jayakody. The group
was heading to  Australia , Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor
told Australia’s 2UE Radio today.  “According to their version, they said 98 died,” Jayakody
said by phone, referring to the asylum seekers. “But we don’t
know. We don’t have any evidence for that.”  Thousands of asylum seekers and illegal migrants, searching
for a better life, leave Myanmar on boats each year, according
to the  United Nations . The UN refugee agency has processed about
440,000 refugees and asylum seekers originating from Myanmar as
of last year.  Sri Lanka’s navy rescued the group from a sinking wooden
ship on Feb. 16, according to a  statement  on its website.
Officers found no dead bodies around the boat, Commander Kosala
Warnakulasuriya, a navy spokesman, said by phone.  The 31 adult males and one boy went without food for 21
days, according to the statement. Earlier this month, Sri
Lanka’s navy said it rescued 138 people from Bangladesh and
Myanmar from an overcrowded wooden vessel that had begun to
sink.  Muslim Rohingya fleeing violence in Myanmar were among
about 200 people missing after two boats sank in the  Bay of
Bengal  in November, according to the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
