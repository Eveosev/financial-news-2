German bunds led gains among the
euro area’s so-called core  government securities  after an
industry report showed services and manufacturing in the region
shrank this month at a faster pace than analysts forecast.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  dropped by the most since November
as the Purchasing Managers’ Index added to signs  Europe ’s
economy remained in recession at the start of the year. Dutch,
Austrian and French bonds also advanced as investors sought out
safer assets. Italian  two-year notes  fell for a fifth day before
elections this month that may result in a hung parliament.
Spanish borrowing costs declined as the nation sold 4.2 billion
euros ($5.55 billion) of debt.  “There’s a lot of demand for the core that’s been driven
by the macro data,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates
strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “The PMI in the euro-
region was worse than expected. It indicates that growth is
under pressure. That’s fueled a rally in bunds.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.58 percent at 4:38 p.m. London time, the
biggest decline since Nov. 28. The 1.5 percent bund maturing in
February 2023 rose 0.685, or 6.85 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 99.28.  Dutch 10-year yields declined six basis points to 1.83
percent. Those in  France  fell five basis points to 2.23 percent,
and  Austria ’s dropped six basis points to 1.92 percent.  Composite Gauge  Markit Economics said its  composite index  based on a survey
of  purchasing managers  in euro-area services and manufacturing
industries fell to 47.3 for February from 48.6 the previous
month. Economists forecast a reading of 49, according to a
Bloomberg survey. A number below 50 indicates contraction.  The economy will shrink 0.1 percent this quarter, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of economists on Feb. 15. The
European Central Bank forecasts gross domestic product will
contract 0.3 percent this year.  Italian two-year yields climbed the most in two weeks as
candidates intensified campaigning before the Feb. 24-25
parliamentary elections.  Democratic Party candidate Pier Luigi Bersani has covered
the length of the Italian peninsula this week to rally voters in
the three must-win regions of Lombardy, Sicily and Campania.
Bersani had 33.8 percent support in an SWG Institute survey
published Feb. 8. That compares with 27.8 percent for
former Premier  Silvio Berlusconi  and 18.8 percent for populist
rival Beppe Grillo.  Italy’s two-year yield rose eight basis points to 1.70
percent after increasing as much as 12 basis points, the most
since Feb. 4.  Spanish Sale  The Spanish Treasury sold securities maturing in March
2015, October 2019 and January 2023, surpassing its maximum
target of 4 billion euros.  The two-year notes were sold at a yield of 2.54 percent,
compared with 2.823 percent at the previous auction of the
securities on Feb. 7. The 10-year benchmark yielded 5.202
percent, versus 5.29 percent in December.  “This is a strong set of results and continues the theme
of decent demand for Spanish debt,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in  London .
“We still believe this to be driven by the large amount of
central bank liquidity in the system rather than an improvement
in the fundamentals of  Spain .”  Spanish 10-year yields were little changed at 5.20 percent
after climbing as much as six basis points before the results
were announced.  Prefer Spain  Investors should buy Spanish 10-year bonds while selling
similar-maturity Italian securities before Italy’s election,
betting the yield difference will narrow, said Simon Peck and
Giles Gale, fixed-income strategists at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in London. The so-called spread will shrink to 50
basis points from 71 basis points, they predicted.  France sold 7.98 billion euros of notes maturing between
2015 and 2018, as well as 2.3 billion euros of inflation-linked
bonds due in 2024.  Volatility on France bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of Germany and Austria, according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-year and 10-
year securities and credit-default swaps.  German government securities handed investors a loss of 1.7
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. French debt also dropped 1.7 percent, while
Spanish securities returned 2.3 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
