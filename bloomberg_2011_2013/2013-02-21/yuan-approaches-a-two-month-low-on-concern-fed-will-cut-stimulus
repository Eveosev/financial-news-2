China ’s yuan dropped toward a two-
month low on concern the U.S. will scale back an asset-buying
program that has been fueling fund flows into  emerging markets .  Several Federal Reserve policy makers said the central bank
should be ready to vary the pace of its $85 billion of monthly
bond purchases, minutes of a Jan. 29-30 meeting released
yesterday showed. The Dollar Index rose 0.75 percent yesterday,
the most since July. The People’s Bank of China cut the daily
yuan  fixing  by 0.07 percent to 6.2846 per dollar today.  The yuan is responding to a weaker fixing as investor
sentiment in Asia turned negative, said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in  Singapore .
“We’ll still be looking to a rally as price pressure in China
has started to pick up. It’s an environment for the Chinese
currency to strengthen to fight inflation.”  The yuan weakened 0.09 percent to 6.2433 per dollar as of
10:04 a.m. in  Shanghai , prices from the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System show. It touched 6.2454 on Feb. 19, the lowest
level since Dec. 14. Spot prices are allowed to diverge a
maximum 1 percent from the reference rate. Westpac expects the
currency to appreciate to 6.15 by the end of June.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency fell 0.1
percent to 6.2400 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.09
percent to 6.3240, a 1.3 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate. One-month implied volatility in the  yuan , a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, was
at 1.28 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
