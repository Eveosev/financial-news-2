Wheat fell for the second time in
three sessions as snowfall expected in  Kansas , the biggest U.S.
grower of winter varieties, eased concern that drought in the
Great Plains will damage crops. Corn fell, and soybeans rose.  About 20 inches (51 centimeters) of snow is expected in
Dodge City, Kansas, from a storm that started yesterday,
according to the  National Weather Service . Nine inches has
already fallen in Plainville, in the north-central part of the
state, government data show. Parts of Kansas are in an
exceptional drought, meaning deficient soil moisture and likely
crop losses, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.  “There’s some moisture to the snow, and as much as we got,
it’s going to be beneficial,” Larry Glenn, an analyst at
Frontier Ag in Quinter, Kansas, said by telephone. “People were
so excited about it -- the wheat farmers and those who raise
cattle. It’s not like we had two days of rain, but the snow is
definitely going to help.”  Wheat futures for delivery in May fell 1.6 percent to
$7.3325 a bushel at 9:50 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,

after the worst drought in more than 70 years left crop
conditions in the Plains at their worst since at least 1985.
