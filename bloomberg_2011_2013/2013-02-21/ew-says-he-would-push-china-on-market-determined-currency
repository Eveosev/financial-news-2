Jack Lew, President  Barack Obama ’s
nominee for U.S. Treasury secretary, said he would press China
to adopt a “market-determined” exchange rate.  Lew, in written answers to questions from members of the
Senate Finance Committee obtained today by  Bloomberg News , said
if he’s confirmed, “addressing China’s exchange rate would be a
top priority.”  He also said, in response to questions from Republican
Senator  Orrin Hatch  of Utah, that he would push China to “level
the playing field for our workers and firms, and support a
sustained shift to domestic consumption-led growth in China.”  Lew cited “progress” in China, including a 15 percent
gain in the yuan against the dollar in real terms since June
2010 and a decline in the current-account surplus from a peak of
more than 10 percent of gross domestic product to less than 3
percent. Still, he said, “more progress is needed.”  Lew, Obama’s former chief of staff and former director of
the White House Office of Management and Budget, was questioned
by the committee at a confirmation hearing on Feb. 13. He will
replace former Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  if
confirmed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
