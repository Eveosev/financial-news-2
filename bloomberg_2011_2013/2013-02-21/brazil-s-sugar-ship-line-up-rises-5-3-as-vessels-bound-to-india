The amount of sugar awaiting loading
at ports in top producer  Brazil  rose 5.3 percent over the past
week, with vessels bound for  India  and Bangladesh, according to
shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  As many as 1.48 million metric tons of sugar were waiting
to be loaded onto ships at the ports of Maceio, Paranagua and
Santos, the country’s biggest, figures e-mailed yesterday from
the Recife, Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That compares
with 1.4 million tons a week earlier.  About 16 percent of all the sugar awaiting loading was
headed to Bangladesh or India, the world’s second-biggest sugar
producer and largest consumer. Vessels scheduled to go to India
were set to take 132,700 tons of raw sugar, according to
Williams Brasil, while ships bound for  Bangladesh  were to carry
another 100,000 tons of the variety, the data showed.  Indian refiners are importing the raw sweetener to process
and re-export, according to the New Delhi-based Indian Sugar
Mills Association. Some of the sugar has been imported for
domestic consumption even though the country will have a surplus
this season, according to ISMA. Bangladesh has six refiners with
the capacity to process 3.58 million tons of the sweetener,
according the Bangladesh Sugar Refiners Association.  Raw sugar for delivery in May declined 0.8 percent to 17.99
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York by 9:16 a.m.
