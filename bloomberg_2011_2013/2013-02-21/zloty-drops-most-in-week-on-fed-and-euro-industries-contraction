Poland ’s zloty weakened the most in
a week after Federal Reserve meeting minutes sparked concern the
U.S. may curtail stimulus and as services and manufacturing in
the euro region shrank more than forecast.  The zloty trailed only Hungarian forint among emerging-
market currencies as several Fed policy makers said the central
bank should be ready to vary the pace of their $85 billion in
monthly debt purchases, according to minutes of a meeting
released yesterday. Separately, a report showed euro-area
services and manufacturing contracted at a faster pace than
economists predicted in February, according to Markit Economics.  “The Fed minutes sparked fears that the quantitative
easing may end sooner than expected,”  Rafal Benecki , the chief
economist for Poland at ING Groep NV in Warsaw, said in e-mailed
report today.  The zloty lost as much as 0.6 percent, its steepest drop on
an intraday basis since Feb. 14, and traded 0.5 percent lower at
4.1821 per euro at 10:10 a.m. in Warsaw. The currency is the
second-worst performing among more than 20 peers tracked by
Bloomberg.  Yields on Polish 10-year bonds slid 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.04 percent, declining for the first time
in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
