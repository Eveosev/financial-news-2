German stocks  declined the most in
two weeks on concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will scale back
its asset-purchase program in the world’s largest economy.  Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG, the country’s biggest
lenders, dropped at least 2.9 percent.  Allianz SE (ALV)  retreated even
after saying profit more than doubled in the fourth quarter.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  slipped 1.6 percent to 7,609.33 at 10:21 a.m.
in  Frankfurt . The benchmark gauge is little changed so far this
year, among the worst performers of 24 developed-market indexes
tracked by Bloomberg. The broader HDAX Index also fell 1.5
percent today.  Fed officials continued to debate whether monetary easing
risks unleashing inflation or fueling asset-price bubbles.  Several participants at the Federal Open Market Committee’s
Jan. 29-30 meeting “emphasized that the committee should be
prepared to vary the pace of asset purchases, either in response
to changes in the economic outlook or as its evaluation of the
efficacy and costs of such purchases evolved,” according to
minutes released after the close of European markets yesterday.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 82 percent higher than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German services  output expanded less than forecast this
month, according to a report from London-based Markit Economics.
An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
industry retreated to 54.1 from 55.7 in January, compared with
the median forecast for a 55.5 level in a Bloomberg survey. The
measure for factory output rose to 50.1 in February from 49.8
last month. A reading above 50 signals expansion.  European PMI  Euro-area  services and manufacturing  contracted at a faster
pace than economists forecast in February, according to a
separate survey from Markit.  A composite index of both industries in the 17-nation
currency bloc fell to 47.3 from 48.6 in January. Economists had
forecast a reading of 49, according to the median of 22
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank fell 3.4 percent to 34.97
euros and 2.9 percent to 1.43 euros, respectively.  Allianz,  Europe ’s biggest insurer, lost 1.2 percent to
103.10 euros. Net income rose to 1.22 billion euros ($1.61
billion) in the fourth quarter of 2012 from 492 million euros
the previous year, the Munich-based company said. That beat the
1.15 billion-euro median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Bilfinger SE retreated 2.3 percent to 79.56 euros, its
biggest drop in more than two weeks. UBS AG cut its
recommendation on the German builder to neutral from buy, with
analyst Gregor Kuglitsch saying the company’s transformation
into services from a construction-dominated business is already
reflected in the share price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
