European coal for next year fell for
the second day as equities in the region declined the most in
more than two weeks after a report showed euro-area services and
factory output contracted.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp dropped 50 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $98.50 a metric
ton at 2:23 p.m. London time, according to broker data compiled
by Bloomberg.  A composite gauge of euro-area services and manufacturing
output dropped to 47.3 from 48.6 in January, London-based Markit
economics said today. The Stoxx 600 sank as much as 1.6 percent,
its biggest tumble since Feb. 4.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
