Growthpoint Properties Ltd. (GRT) , South
Africa’s biggest real-estate company by market value, raised its
bid for  Fountainhead Property Trust (FPT)  as exclusive talks with a
rival bidder end tomorrow.  The revised offer is 5.7 percent, or 605 million rand ($68
million), higher than its previous bid, the Johannesburg-based
company said in a statement today. The offer of 37 Growthpoint
linked units for every 100 Fountainhead units is 8.6 percent
higher than a bid by  Redefine Properties Ltd. (RDF) , Growthpoint said.  Fountainhead and Redefine started exclusive talks in
December. Growthpoint submitted a bid for Fountainhead in
October. Fountainhead said in a separate statement there isn’t a
written sale agreement with Redefine and it will review the
Growthpoint offer.  Growthpoint shares declined for a second day, losing 1.7
percent to 25.45 rand by the close in Johannesburg. They have
risen 3.9 percent this year, while Redefine has climbed 4.6
percent and Fountainhead 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
