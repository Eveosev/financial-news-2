Schneider Electric SA (SU) , the world’s
biggest maker of low- and medium-voltage equipment, forecast a
recovery in organic revenue in 2013, adding to the higher prices
and cost cuts that lifted earnings to a record last year.  Net income rose 3 percent to 1.84 billion euros ($2.44
billion) last year, the company, based in the Paris suburb of
Rueil-Malmaison, said in a statement today. Analysts had
expected profit of 1.83 billion euros, according to the average
of eight  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding a one-time
impairment charge, net income rose 12 percent.  “For 2013, in an economic environment that remains mixed,
we target a low-single digit organic growth in sales and a
stable to slightly up adjusted” earnings before interest, taxes
and amortization margin, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Pascal Tricoire said in the statement.  Schneider expects continued challenges in western  Europe ,
opportunities for acceleration in emerging economies and a slow
recovery in  North America  this year. The company has speeded up
cost cuts by regrouping sites and redesigning products to adapt
to a construction slump and government austerity measures in
Europe, and weaker demand from Chinese manufacturers.  Dividend Increase  The company proposed a  dividend  of 1.87 euros a share, up
10 percent from 1.70 euros a year earlier. The shares rose as
much as 4.6 percent in Paris trading to the highest level since
July 2011. They were up 3.1 percent at 57.10 euros at 2:20 p.m.,
giving the company a market value of 31.7 billion euros.  Schneider reported an increase in the adjusted Ebita margin
to 14.7 percent of sales in 2012 from 14.3 percent in 2011.  Fourth-quarter sales rose 2 percent from a year earlier,
pushing full-year revenue up 7.2 percent to 23.9 billion euros,
in line with estimates. Organic sales, or revenue excluding
acquisitions and exchange-rate fluctuations, declined 1.2
percent in the quarter amid lower demand for video security
systems, data centers and substation equipments.  Schneider spent 242 million euros on acquisitions in 2012
compared with 2.87 billion euros a year earlier as it didn’t
find many opportunities “at the right price” after freezing
purchases in the first half, the CEO said. It may buy “pockets
of software and know-how” if needed, and still favors “bolt-
on” deals, Tricoire said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
