Crude oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures fell to the lowest level this year after a
government report that supplies climbed to the highest level
since July.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.77 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 4 p.m., compared with 21.88 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery declined
$2.38, or 2.5 percent, to end the session at $92.84 a barrel on
the Nymex.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts, which rose 96 cents to $3.11 a barrel on volume
of 5,463 contracts at 4:15 p.m. in  New York . April $90 puts were
the second-most active with 4,029 lots. They advanced 62 cents
to $1.29 a barrel.  Puts accounted for 65 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the previous session, bearish bets made up 64 percent of the
191,852 contracts traded.  April $105 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 8,793 contracts changing hands. They were down 4
cents to 6 cents a barrel. December $80 puts rose 37 cents to
$2.66 on 7,011 lots.  Open interest was highest for April $110 calls with 35,041
contracts. Next were December $105 calls at 33,628 and June $90
puts at 31,353.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic

outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
