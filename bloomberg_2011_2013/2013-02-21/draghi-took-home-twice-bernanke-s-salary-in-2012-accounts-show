European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  was paid 374,124 euros ($493,694) last year, more
than twice Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s $199,700
salary.  The Frankfurt-based ECB published details of Draghi’s
remuneration in its 2012 annual accounts today. Draghi, who
succeeded Jean-Claude Trichet in November 2011, helped to dispel
fears that the euro could fail last year by pledging to buy
government bonds if needed.  While his pay tops Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King ’s
305,368 pounds ($465,869), it will be dwarfed by King’s
successor  Mark Carney . Carney, who currently heads the Bank of
Canada, will earn a basic salary of 480,000 pounds when he takes
over from King in July. That’s more than three times Bernanke’s
pay.  The ECB’s accounts also showed that two former Executive
Board members, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi and Jose Manuel Gonzalez- Paramo, opted to forego their pensions in return for lump-sum
payments totalling a combined 2.46 million euros when they
departed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
