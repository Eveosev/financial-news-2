U.K. stocks declined for the first
time in three days as commodity shares fell amid concern the
U.S. Federal Reserve will scale back its bond-buying program.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group, the world’s largest
mining companies, dropped at least 2.5 percent.  HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA)  led banking shares lower as it slid 1.6 percent.  BAE Systems
Plc (BA/)  jumped 4.7 percent after reporting better-than-estimated
earnings and saying it will buy back 1 billion pounds ($1.5
billion) of shares.  The FTSE 100 lost 85.2 points, or 1.3 percent, to 6,310.17
at 9:05 a.m. in  London . The equity benchmark has still rallied
6.9 percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a
compromise budget and postponed a decision on spending cuts to
March. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also retreated 1.3
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 1.1 percent.  Fed officials yesterday expressed concern over whether
record monetary easing will drive inflation higher or create
asset-price bubbles, according to the minutes of the  Federal
Open Market Committee ’s Jan. 29-30 meeting released yesterday.  Some participants “emphasized that the committee should be
prepared to vary the pace of asset purchases, either in response
to changes in the economic outlook or as its evaluation of the
efficacy and costs of such purchases evolved,” the minutes
showed.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 55 percent greater than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
