Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY) ,  Malaysia ’s
biggest lender, said fourth-quarter profit jumped 16 percent as
the Southeast Asian nation’s economy expanded at its fastest
pace since 2010.
      Net income  climbed to 1.46 billion ringgit ($469 million),
or 17.29 sen per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 from
1.26 billion ringgit, or 16.72 sen during the same period a year
earlier, according to a stock exchange filing today. It declared
a lower dividend of 33 sen per share.  Gross domestic product  increased 6.4 percent in the ;last
quarter as Prime Minister Najib Razak boosted spending ahead of
an election that must be held by late June, extending cash
handouts to low-income families and raising civil servants’
pensions. Earnings of Malayan Banking, or Maybank as the Kuala
Lumpur-based lender is known, and rivals including  Public Bank
Bhd. (PBK)  have benefited from higher domestic demand and investment.  “We are fortunate that we are based in a region of very
robust growth,” Chief Executive Officer Abdul Wahid Omar told
reporters in Kuala Lumpur today. “We are well placed to further
grow international operations and will raise the tempo in our
regionalization agenda.”  The stock rose 0.1 percent to 8.91 ringgit as of 12:35 p.m.
after earnings were announced during the midday break. Maybank,
which has operations in countries including Indonesia and
 Singapore , has fallen 3.3 percent this year, while the FTSE
Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index slid 5 percent amid investor concern
over the outcome of the election.  Net interest income, or revenue from borrowers after
deducting interest paid to depositors, gained 2 percent to 2.19
billion ringgit in the quarter, and income from Islamic banking
increased 7.1 percent to 526.5 million ringgit, Maybank said.
Allowances for losses on loans and financing declined 30 percent
to 160 million ringgit, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
