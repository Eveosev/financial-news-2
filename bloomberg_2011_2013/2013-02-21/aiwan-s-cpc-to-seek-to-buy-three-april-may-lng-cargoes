CPC Corp., Taiwan’s state-run energy
company, said it will seek to buy as many as three cargoes of
liquefied natural gas for delivery in April and May,  Taiwan’s sole LNG importer is buying the cargoes to prepare
for peak-summer power demand driven by air conditioning needs,
according to a company official who asked not to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media. CPC’s price
target for the LNG is $17.50 per million British thermal units,
he said.  Spot cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks cost $19
per million Btu yesterday in northeast Asia, according to World
Gas Intelligence, an energy research company. That was down from
a record high of $19.40 per million Btu a week earlier, WGI
said.  CPC has a 3 million metric-ton-a-year receiving facility at
Taichung in central Taiwan and a 7.4 million terminal at Yongan
in the country’s south, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
