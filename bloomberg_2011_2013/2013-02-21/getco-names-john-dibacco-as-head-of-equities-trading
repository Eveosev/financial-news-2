Getco LLC, the closely held high-
frequency trading company that’s acquiring  Knight Capital Group
Inc. (KCG) , named former  UBS (UBSN)  AG manager John DiBacco as global head of
equities trading.  DiBacco is among executives retained for the new management
team of the combined firm, Getco and  Knight Capital  said in a
statement yesterday. DiBacco was a manager of Kweku Adoboli, the
former UBS trader sentenced by a London court in November to
seven years in jail after a $2.3 billion loss from unauthorized
trading.  “We are fortunate to have a strong team of senior managers
at both Knight and Getco,”  Daniel Coleman , chief executive
officer of Getco, said in the statement. “We appreciate the
significant leadership contributions from both organizations.”
Coleman is a former UBS global head of equities, who left the
firm after about 24 years in 2010.  DiBacco, who was based in New York for UBS, said last year
in a testimony at Adoboli’s criminal trial that he was
“surprised” at the large positions traders in the British
capital were taking. DiBacco, who ran the exchange-traded funds
desk and departed after about 13 years at UBS, said at the time
that he had no idea that Adoboli had been faking transactions
for as long as three years.  A spokeswoman for Getco in  Chicago  wasn’t immediately
available for comment. DiBacco didn’t immediately respond to an
e-mail and a telephone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
