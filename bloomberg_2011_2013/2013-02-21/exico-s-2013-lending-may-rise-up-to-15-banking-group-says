Mexico ’s net outstanding loans may
rise 12 percent to 15 percent this year, according to an
official of the country’s banking association.  The forecast is based on what the “majority” of
commercial banks are estimating, Roberto Galarza, the banking
industry group’s coordinator of credit to small and mid-size
businesses said in an interview in Mexico City.  Mexican commercial banks’ net outstanding loans to the
private sector rose 11.5 percent in 2012, according to central
bank data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 2013 forecast from the banking association takes into
account the continuation of lending policies and new measures
banks will take up this year that could favor the sector,
Galarza said, without providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
