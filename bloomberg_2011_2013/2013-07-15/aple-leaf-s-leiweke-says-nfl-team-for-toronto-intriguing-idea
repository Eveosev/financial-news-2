Tim Leiweke , chief executive officer
of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd., said the Toronto-based sports-team owner plans to be involved in any effort to
bring a National Football League team to Canada.  “We’d go out of our way to make it work here,” Leiweke
said in an interview today with Bloomberg TV’s  Erik Schatzker .
“The support the NFL has in Canada is fantastic. If there is an
opportunity to have a team that is like the Jays, that is
Canada’s team, that is very intriguing.”  NFL ownership rules prevent corporations such as MLSE from
owning teams, Leiweke said from Toronto.  “There is a lot of work to do and it has to be led by
Roger Goodell and the NFL,” Leiweke said, referring to the
league’s commissioner.  BCE Inc. (BCE)  and  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) , the two largest
telecommunications companies in Canada, hold a controlling stake
in MLSE, which owns the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club, Toronto
Raptors of the National Basketball Association, Toronto FC
soccer club, as well as the Air Canada Centre arena and other
real estate properties.  The Toronto Blue Jays, the only Major League Baseball club
in Canada, is separately owned by Rogers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
