Industrias CH SAB (ICHB) , Mexico’s largest
steelmaker, surged the most on the nation’s benchmark index
after President Enrique Pena Nieto announced a $315 billion plan
to build railways, bridges and other infrastructure.  The shares surged 4.2 percent to 84.9 pesos at 1:13 p.m. in
Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the
biggest gainer on the country’s IPC index, which advanced 0.2
percent.  The federal government seeks public and private investment
of at least 4 trillion pesos ($315 billion) on public works
through 2018, including three passenger rail lines and two urban
commuter rail lines, Pena Nieto said at an event today in Mexico
City. Industrias CH’s shares had lost 17 percent this year
through July 12 amid reports showing declines in domestic steel
demand.  “The national infrastructure plan means a lot for ports,
highways, electricity plants, oil platforms,” Raul Ochoa, an
analyst at Interacciones Casa de Bolsa, said in a telephone
interview from  Mexico  City. “All of this needs steel.” The
brokerage firm has a hold recommendation on Industrias CH’s
shares.  Empresas ICA SAB, the nation’s biggest construction
company, advanced 2.7 percent to 25.36 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
