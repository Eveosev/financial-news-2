Serbia will offer investors new
power purchase agreements beginning next week, unlocking
potential for investments in renewable energy generation units.  The Balkan nation expects investments of about 2 billion
euros ($2.6 billion) in wind farms, biomass, waste, solar, gas
and geothermal energy as it plans to add 1,092 megawatts of
energy from renewable sources by 2020, Energy Minister Zorana
Mihajlovic told reporters in Belgrade today.  The power purchase agreements, defined with international
financial institutions to make sure they qualify for bank loans,
will mark “a big step in opening the market to independent
producers,” Mihajlovic said.  Serbia aims to increase the share of renewables in its
energy mix to 27 percent by the end of the decade from 21.2
percent, under an agreement with the Vienna-based  Energy
Community .  The government adopted in February new incentives to
purchase electricity from renewable sources at higher rates,
pledging to subsidize 500 megawatts of electricity from wind
farms, 440 megawatts from most hydro plants and 100 megawatts
from biomass-fuelled facilities.  The new regulations will allow the  Serbian Wind Energy
Association , grouping companies interested in wind farms, to
start several projects they prepared, worth “more than 500
million euros,” said Ana Brnabic, project director at the
Continental Wind Serbia, which is member of the association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
