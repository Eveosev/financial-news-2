The Maloof family’s NBA record-breaking  sale of the Sacramento Kings for $534 million  is a done deal. But Gavin Maloof, who operated the franchise with his brothers, is hoping to rake in $12 million more. For the fifth time in four years, he’s listed his 13,789-square-foot country club estate located at  27 Eagles Landing Ln, Las Vegas, NV 89141 . After purchasing the property for $10 million in 2007, he first attempted a flip in 2009 for $14.9 million. Now with a slightly lower asking price, the home is still 8,404.6 percent more expensive than the median Las Vegas home and 923.5 percent more per square foot. It’s also more than the Maloof family spent on the entire Fiesta Hotel in ’94, when they reportedly bought it for $8 million before investing in The Palms casino resort. But  as real estate agent and blogger Samantha DeBianchi  has pointed out, with luxury properties “getting the ‘best deal’ doesn’t necessarily play a big role in a buyer’s decision-making process.” Rather, it’s about finding a “showpiece to add to a buyer’s valuable portfolio of possessions.” Minutes from The Strip, Maloof’s home is located on a golf course and boasts a large swimming pool and covered patio. Disappearing walls create a seamless flow between the outdoor and indoor entertaining spaces. An elevator, bar, game room, movie theater and jetted tub are a few stand-out features. If Maloof’s home doesn’t sell itself, he might have to ask his sister for a few tips. Adrienne Maloof, who’s known for her role on “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,”  recently sold her $26 million Beverly Glen mansion in a month . The Maloofs’ success began with distributing rights to Coors Beer in 1937. From there, the family built an empire in real estate, sports and entertainment.
