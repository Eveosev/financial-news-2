Gold gained for the fifth time in
six sessions in New York as U.S. retail sales rose less than
expected in June, boosting speculation the Federal Reserve will
maintain stimulus measures to shore up economic growth.  Retail sales climbed 0.4 percent, half the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of economists, government figures showed
today. Sales were unchanged excluding the biggest jump in
automobile purchases since November. Bullion futures rose 5.4
percent last week, the most since October 2011, after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said highly accommodative monetary
policy is still required for the foreseeable future.  “Since Bernanke’s speech, there’s been more of a question
mark as to when the Fed begins tapering stimulus,”  David Meger ,
the director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “We’re back to a data-dependent mentality, and anything that shows a weaker economy is
going to be supportive.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.5 percent to settle
at $1,283.50 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  Prices have fallen 23 percent this year, wiping $59.8
billion from the value of gold  exchange-traded products , after
some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value as
the Fed indicated it may slow the stimulus.  Gold ETP holdings were at 1,986.2 metric tons on July 12
and reached 1,983.6 tons last week, the lowest since May 2010,
according to Bloomberg data. The Fed buys $85 billion of
Treasuries and mortgage debt each month as part of its
quantitative-easing program.  Silver futures for September delivery added 0.2 percent to
$19.839 an ounce in New York. Trading was 55 percent below the
average in the past 100 days for this time of day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery rose 1 percent to $1,421.40 an ounce. Palladium
futures for September delivery gained 1.3 percent to $732.15 an
ounce, the sixth straight advance and the longest rally since
October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
