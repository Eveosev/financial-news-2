who has a buy rating on Given Imaging, said in a telephone
interview from New York. “This will probably enable them to hit
the ground running in 2014 pretty effectively, and you should
get a nice, steady ramp in sales.”  PillCam Colon is estimated to be approved in the U.S. by
the  Food and Drug Administration  between the end of the third
quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter, Chief Executive
Officer Homi Shamir said by telephone yesterday.  Given, Blue Square  The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge rose 0.9 percent to 94.70,
