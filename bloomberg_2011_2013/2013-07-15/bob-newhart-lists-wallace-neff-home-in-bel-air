You may picture him as Papa Elf living in a miniature home in the North Pole, but off-screen Bob Newhart owns a recently expanded estate on  Amapola Lane in Los Angeles . For the first time in 23 years, the actor and comedian has listed the 5-bedroom, 7-bath home for $15.5 million. Built in 1941 by architect Wallace Neff, the home is one of several mansions designed in his famous “California style,” which drew heavily from Spanish and Mediterranean architecture. Neff’s designs grew in popularity among Old Hollywood stars and remain in high demand by celebrities today — Bill and Melinda Gates, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston,  Diane Keaton and Madonna have paid top dollar to live in a “California style” home . Newhart’s French-country estate is located in Old Bel-Air, an affluent suburban pocket outside L.A. The remodeled main house features spacious living rooms, a formal dining room, maid’s quarters, cook’s kitchen and a sunny breakfast nook. The second floor includes a master suite with a sitting area, his-and-hers baths and walk-in closets, as well as two additional bedroom suites. A poolside cabana — complete with a kitchen, 2 baths and a second-floor guest apartment — provides outdoor entertainment space. Property records show Newhart purchased the home under a family trust in 1990. The Chicago native reportedly launched his acting career in 1958 as a copywriter for a major independent film and television producer. He went on to record a best-selling album of comedic monologues, “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart” and star on “The Bob Newhart Show.” More recently, Newhart has played film roles in “Catch-22,”"Elf” and “The Librarian.” The for-sale listing is held by  Coldwell Banker’s Michael Sahakian.
