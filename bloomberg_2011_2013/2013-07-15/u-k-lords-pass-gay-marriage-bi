The U.K. House of Lords passed Prime
Minister David Cameron’s bill to allow same-sex marriage,
sending it back to the lower House of Commons for final
agreement.  The upper, unelected chamber approved the  Marriage (Same
Sex Couples) Bill  without a vote in London today. Some members
of the house wore pink carnations to mark the occasion.  The legislation has already been passed by the Commons amid
opposition from more than 100 lawmakers from Cameron’s
Conservative Party. The bill will now return to the Commons,
where amendments introduced by the Lords will be considered. If
they’re accepted, the bill will be sent to Queen Elizabeth II
for her signature before becoming law.  The plan to introduce gay marriage has pitted Cameron
against many in his own party. Activists say it is driving
Conservative voters toward the U.K. Independence Party, which
made gains in local elections in May at the expense of the
Tories and their Liberal Democrat coalition partners.  The prime minister was only able to get the legislation
through the Commons with the support of the opposition Labour
Party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
