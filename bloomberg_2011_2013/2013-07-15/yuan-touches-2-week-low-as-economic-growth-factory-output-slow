China ’s  yuan  touched a two-week low
after data showed growth and factory output slowed, adding to
signs Asia’s biggest economy is cooling.  Gross domestic product  rose 7.5 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, compared with a 7.7 percent gain in
the previous period and matching the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey, according to official figures today. A
report last week showed  exports  unexpectedly contracted 3.1
percent in June, the largest decline since 2009. The U.S. and
China ended two days of strategic and economic talks last week.  “Yuan appreciation has come to an end as the export growth
outlook remains grim,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia
economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “The
window for depreciation from current levels has been opened
given the U.S.-China talks are over. It’s time to shift focus
back to fundamentals.”  The yuan closed at 6.1378 per dollar in  Shanghai , little
changed from 6.1375 at the end of last week, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. That’s the lowest level
since June 27. The People’s Bank of China weakened the daily
reference rate 0.05 percent to 6.1663. The currency is allowed
to trade a maximum 1 percent either side of the fixing.  More Reforms  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.02
percent to 6.1389 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.07 percent to
6.2849, a 2.3 percent  discount  to the onshore spot rate.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
increased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.72
percent.  The yuan is the sole gainer among Asia’s 11 most-traded
currencies this year, advancing 1.5 percent, and putting the
nation’s exporters at a disadvantage over regional counterparts.
Data today showed factory output increased 8.9 percent in June
from a year earlier, compared with 9.2 percent in May.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said China is
committed to more reform of its exchange rate and to opening its
economy to more foreign investment, speaking at the closing
press conference of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic
Dialogue, in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
