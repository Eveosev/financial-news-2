Tankers hauling gasoline and diesel
are poised to earn more than crude carriers six times their size
for the first time on record as the U.S. exports the most
refined-oil products in at least two decades.  Rates for Medium Range vessels averaged $15,325 a day this
year, while those for very large crude carriers were $6,838,
according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the biggest shipbroker. The smaller
ships haven’t earned more over a full year since at least 1997.
Shares of  Scorpio Tankers Inc. (STNG) , the largest publicly traded
owner of product vessels, will rise 12 percent in a year as
those of Frontline Ltd., which operates supertankers, drop 29
percent, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. oil production rose to the highest level since July
1992 in the week ended July 5, boosted by fracking that unlocks
deposits trapped in shale rocks. The nation’s crude imports, the
second-largest source of demand for VLCCs after  China , will fall
the most since at least 1991, according to Clarkson. The U.S.
prohibits exports of most of its crude while allowing shipments
of refined products.  “This is the first time that the U.S. is able to export
energy,” Robert Bugbee, the president of Scorpio said in an 
interview. “That’s transformational. We’ve been 
bullish, and yet we’ve been surprised by the rates we’ve got now.”  MR tankers hauling about 37,000 metric tons of refined
products are the type most commonly used for U.S. exports. Rates
surged 73 percent in the past year to $13,315 a day, data from
London-based Clarkson show. Earnings will average $15,000 this
year, 15 percent more than in 2012, according to RS Platou
Markets AS, an investment bank in Oslo.  2 Million Barrels  Scorpio’s 42 ships, including 17 MRs, need an average of
about $13,000 a day to break even, Bugbee said in the July 3
interview. Shares of the Monaco-based company jumped 42 percent to
$10.13 this year in  New York  and will reach $11.39 in 12 months,
according to the average of 10 analyst estimates. Scorpio will
report net income of $31.7 million for this year, from a loss of
$26.5 million in 2012, the mean of five estimates shows.  Rates for VLCCs carrying 2 million barrels of crude, or
about 260,000 tons, went negative in February, March and April,
implying that owners paid clients to hire their ships. The
charterers still pay for some of the fuel, cutting costs for
owners moving vessels into regions with better returns.
Frontline, based in Hamilton,  Bermuda , says it needs daily rates
of $25,500 to break even.  Loss Widens  Shares of the company fell 35 percent to 12.10 kroner
($1.99) this year in Oslo and will decline to 8.54 kroner in 12
months, according to the average of 14 analyst estimates.
Frontline’s net loss will widen to $115.5 million this year from
$82.8 million in 2012, the mean of 14  estimates  shows.  U.S. seaborne crude imports will decline 11 percent to 5.4
million barrels a day this year, the largest drop since at least
1991, Clarkson estimates. Total imports in February were the
lowest since 1996, Energy Department data show.  Exports of refined products averaged 2.9 million barrels a
day this year, heading for the highest annual average in Energy
Department data that begins in 1993. About 21 percent of cargoes
went to  South America  and 31 percent to  Canada  and  Mexico .  U.S. crude imports may rebound as the world’s biggest
economy accelerates. Growth of 2.3 percent this quarter will
advance to 3 percent a year from now, according to the median of
as many as 86 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
nation is the second-largest source of demand for VLCCs once
cargo volumes are multiplied by distances, according to ICAP
Shipping International Ltd., a London-based shipbroker.  Crude Imports  China’s crude imports will advance 9 percent to 5.4 million
barrels a day this year, matching the U.S. for the first time,
Clarkson estimates. Global seaborne trade will expand 1 percent
to 38.3 million barrels a day. Trade in refined products will
gain 4 percent to a record 20.2 million barrels a day.  Surging product-tanker rates are spurring orders for new
ships and the extra capacity may curb the rally, according to
Banchero Costa & Co., a Genoa, Italy-based shipbroker. Fleet
growth will accelerate to 3 percent in 2013 from 2 percent last
year. Outstanding orders at shipyards are equal to 12 percent of
existing capacity, from 9.7 percent in November, according to
IHS Fairplay, a Redhill, England-based research company.  The VLCC market has orders equal to 5.9 percent of the
fleet, compared with 47 percent five years ago. Owners are
contending with the biggest surplus since 1985, according to
Fearnley Consultants A/S, an Oslo-based research company. The
supertanker fleet expanded 30 percent since the start of 2008 as
trade in seaborne oil grew by less than 1 percent, Clarkson data
show.  Dry Index  Overcapacity extends across most of the industry because
shipping companies ordered too many vessels before the global
recession. The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of the cost of
hauling coal and iron ore, averaged the lowest ever this year.
The ClarkSea Index, a gauge of industrywide earnings, is heading
for its worst year since at least 1990.  VLCC rates trailed Frontline’s break-even level in 51 of
the past 52 weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. MRs
need about $11,500 to make a profit, Arctic Securities ASA in
Oslo estimates, and earnings exceeded that threshold since
October, Clarkson data show.  “We’re getting a double-whammy effect of declining need
for crude imports and a surplus of refined products in the
U.S.,” said Nigel Prentis, the head of consultancy at Hartland
Shipping Services Ltd., a London-based shipbroker. “Product
tankers are finally showing signs of coming good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
