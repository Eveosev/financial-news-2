Crude-steel production  in  China , the
world’s biggest consumer of the alloy, fell to a four-month low
in June after prices plunged.  Steel output was 64.7 million metric tons last month, the
lowest since February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
using figures from the National Bureau of Statistics. Production
rose 4.6 percent in June from a year ago, the bureau said today.  Chinese prices  for hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel
product, have declined 15 percent from a nine-month high reached
on Feb. 18, according to Beijing Antaike Information Industry
Co., amid industry overcapacity, slowing demand and high
inventories. The nation’s 86 largest mills posted an aggregate
profit of 149 million yuan (24.3 million) in May, the lowest
level this year, researcher Custeel.com said on its website
citing the China Iron & Steel Association.  Hebei Iron & Steel Co., the publicly traded unit of China’s
biggest mill, estimated its first-half profit would fall between
70 percent and 90 percent from a year ago, in an exchange filing
late on July 12.  Chinese steel prices, which reached an eight-month low of
3,436  yuan  a metric ton on May 31, increased 0.6 percent to
3,568 yuan as of July 12, according to Antaike.  Iron ore  with 62
percent iron content arriving at Tianjin port gained 1.3 percent
to $126.80 a dry ton, according to a benchmark gauge compiled by
the Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
