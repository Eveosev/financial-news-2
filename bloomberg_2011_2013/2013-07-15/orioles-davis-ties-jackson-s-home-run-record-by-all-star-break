Chris Davis of the  Baltimore Orioles 
hit his Major League Baseball-leading 37th home run of the
season to tie  Reggie Jackson ’s American League record for the
most by the All-Star break.  Davis hit homers in his past four games to finish two shy
of  Barry Bonds ’s major-league record of 39 homers at the break
in 2001. Jackson had 37 for the Oakland Athletics during the
first half of the 1969 season.  Davis, a 27-year-old first baseman, already eclipsed his
career high of 33 homers set last season and extended his tally
yesterday in the Orioles’ 7-4 win over the Toronto Blue Jays.  Baseball’s All-Star Game is scheduled for tomorrow at New
York’s Citi Field. The Home Run Derby is scheduled for tonight
and Davis is one of the four participants on the AL team that’s
captained by  Robinson Cano  of the  New York Yankees .  Defending individual champion Prince Fielder of the Detroit
Tigers and Yoenis Cespedes of the Athletics are also on the AL
squad, while the National League’s Home Run Derby team features
 David Wright  of the New York Mets, Bryce Harper of the
Washington Nationals, Michael Cuddyer of the Colorado Rockies
and Pedro Alvarez of the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The Pirates, at 56-37, have baseball’s second-best winning
percentage at the All-Star break behind the St. Louis Cardinals
as they seek their first winning season since 1992.  The Boston Red Sox have the best record in the American
League at 58-39 and lead the Tampa Bay Rays (55-41) by 2 1/2
games in the  American League  Eastern Division. The Orioles are 4
1/2 games back at 53-43, followed by the Yankees at 51-44.  The Yankees lost to Minnesota 10-4 yesterday as the Twins
took two of three games between the teams for their first series
win in New York since 2001.  Oakland sits atop the AL West at 56-39, while the Tigers
have a 1 1/2-game lead in the AL Central with a 52-42 record.  The Atlanta Braves lead the NL East by six games at 54-41
and the NL West-leading Arizona Diamondbacks are 50-45.  The Cardinals improved their major league-leading record to
57-36 by scoring four runs in the top of the ninth inning last
night to beat the Chicago Cubs 10-6 in the final game before
baseball’s All-Star break.  To contact the reporter on this story:
