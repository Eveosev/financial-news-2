Zambia, the third-biggest emerald
producer, will decide this week if it will allow stones mined in
the country to be auctioned abroad, said Christopher Yaluma, the
minister of mines, energy and water development.  The government will base its decision on the success of an
auction under way in the capital, Lusaka, by  Gemfields Plc (GEM) ’s
local unit, he said in an interview today at the sale.  “We haven’t banned external auctions, it’s all dependent
on how this thing performs,” Yaluma said of the auction. “The
test of the pudding is in the eating.”  Gemfields, which operates the world’s biggest emerald mine,
shifted an auction of the stones it planned to hold in  Singapore 
last month to Lusaka at the request of the government, the
London-based company said July 1. Selling the gems in Zambia
leads to lower prices as Gemfields competes with illegal
dealers, according to the company.  The Government is “very open” to having Zambia as one
destination on an international circuit of auctions, Yaluma
said.  Talks with the government over the possibility of again
holding emerald auctions abroad continued to be positive, Ian Harebottle, Gemfields chief executive officer, told reporters at
the Lusaka auction today.  “The idea is to look at all options and say what works
best for Zambia -- what gives Zambia the best revenue and what
brings Zambia the best taxes and royalties back,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
