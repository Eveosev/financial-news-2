GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL)  plans to import a
spot cargo of liquefied natural gas in October for its Dabhol
terminal south of  Mumbai , according to a company official.  Separately,  India ’s state-run LNG importer, may award a
tender for a shipment delivered in September to its Dahej
terminal on the country’s west coast later this week, said the
official, who asked not to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak to the media. The tender closed July 8 for a
cargo delivered in August or September.  New Delhi-based GAIL may buy as many as eight spot cargoes
for Dahej and Dabhol after India’s monsoon season ends in
August, the official said in May.  The 10 million ton-a-year Dahej LNG facility in Gujarat
state is owned by  Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG) , according to the company’s
 website . Petronet’s investors include GAIL, Oil & Natural Gas
Corp., Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. The Dabhol
terminal in Maharashtra state, owned by GAIL, has a capacity of
5 million tons a year, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
