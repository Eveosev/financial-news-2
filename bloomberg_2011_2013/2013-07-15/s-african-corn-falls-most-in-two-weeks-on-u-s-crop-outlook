South African corn futures declined
the most in two weeks as prices fell in the U.S. after favorable
weather conditions expected for the rest of July improved crop
prospects for 2013.  Yellow corn for delivery in September, the most active
contract, closed down for the first time in five days, falling
2.8 percent to 2,197.80 rand ($221) a metric ton, on the South
African Futures Exchange. The white variety, for delivery in
December, declined 2.2 percent to 2,335 rand a ton. Both dropped
the most since July 1.  Heavy showers are expected in areas of the western and
central Midwest this week, QT Weather said in a report
yesterday. U.S. farmers may harvest a record 354.35 million
tons, 29 percent more than the past year, when crops were hurt
by drought, according to the Department of Agriculture.  Corn for delivery in December slid 1.4 percent to $5.02 a
bushel by 7:35 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.  “American maize in  Iowa  and the south western part of
 Illinois  was damaged by drought in the past season but better
weather forecasted for the next two weeks is expected to improve
crop harvests,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp,
South Africa-based Senwes, said by phone today. “The prospect
of increased supply drove local prices down.”  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from the white variety is a staple food, while yellow
corn is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December declined 1.4 percent to
3,355 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
