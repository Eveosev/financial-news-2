Boston police arrested a man for
having an open alcohol container today after members of the
State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service spotted him
taking a picture of a window in the Boston home of Secretary of
State John Kerry, according to Kerry’s spokesman.  A pellet gun was found when police searched the man’s
vehicle, Glen Johnson, Kerry’s spokesman said in an e-mailed
statement. Kerry was visiting his wife, who is being treated at
a rehabilitation hospital, at the time, Johnson said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
