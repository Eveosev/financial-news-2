Corn retreated for a second day,
extending the biggest one-day drop this month, as favorable crop
conditions in the U.S. reduced the risk that the world’s largest
grower may miss a forecast for a record harvest.  The contract for delivery in December lost as much as 1.1
percent to $5.035 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after a
3.4 percent slump on July 12, the most at close since June 28.
Futures traded at $5.0675 by 10:55 a.m. in  Singapore . The grain
rose 3.7 percent last week, the first weekly gain in three, on
speculation that warmer, drier weather in the U.S. Midwest will
increase stress on the crop.  Parts of the Midwest may have near to below-normal rainfall
later this week, and hot weather may cease for several days, DTN
said July 12. The U.S. harvest will rise to 354.35 million
metric tons, more than doubling inventories to 49.77 million
tons from this year. The forecast for stockpiles was 0.5 percent
higher than predicted last month, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said July 11.  “The better weather forecast meant traders focused on
Thursday’s modestly bearish USDA WASDE report which included a
surprise upward revision to U.S. corn inventories,”   Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , wrote in a report today, referring to the World
Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report by its initials.
Prices may be supported by increasing demand from  China , he said.  China bought 960,000 tons from U.S. exporters for delivery
in the year beginning Sept. 1, the USDA said June 12. Earlier
that week, the world’s second-largest user, also bought 240,000
tons, according to the USDA.  Soybeans for delivery in November rose 0.2 percent to
$12.60 a bushel, after falling as much as 0.6 percent earlier.
Futures fell 2.6 percent on July 12, the most since June 7.
Wheat for September delivery declined as much as 1.1 percent to
$6.735 a bushel before trading at $6.755.  To contact the reporter on this story:
