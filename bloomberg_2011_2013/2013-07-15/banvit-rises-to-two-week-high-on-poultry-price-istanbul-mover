Banvit Bandirma Vitaminli Yem
Sanayii AS (BANVT)  advanced to a two-week high after Hurriyet newspaper
reported poultry prices rose amid increased demand during the
Muslim month of Ramadan.  The  shares  climbed 3.4 percent to 3.62 liras at 2:26 p.m.
in Istanbul, the highest level since July 2. More than 355,000
shares changed hands, 93 percent of the stock’s three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 Borsa Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  index jumped 2.2 percent.  Poultry prices rose to 6.5 liras ($3.4) per kilogram, up 35
percent from 4.8 liras last month, Hurriyet newspaper reported
today, citing Osman Yardimci, the deputy chairman of an industry
group. Ramadan started July 9 in  Turkey . Muslims break day-long
fasts with communal meals at sunset during the month, with food
prices typically rising due to higher spending.  “Poultry demand increases during Ramadan,” Bertug Tuzun,
an analyst at Ak Investment in Istanbul, said in a phone
interview. “Summer has also traditionally been the high season
for consumption.”  Banvit shares declined 6.2 percent this year, compared with
a 3.4 percent retreat in the benchmark index. Banvit has been
underperforming due to its foreign-currency exposure, Tuzun
said.  Balikesir, Turkey-based Banvit has short-term debt of $85.7
million and 50.4 million euros as of the end of March, according
to company filings to the stock exchange. The lira depreciated
8.2 percent against the dollar and 7 percent against the euro
this year. The company reported a first quarter loss of 5.8
million liras ($3 million), compared with net income of 14.5
million liras in the same period last year, according to Banvit
filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
