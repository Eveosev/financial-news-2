Stocks in Switzerland  climbed,
continuing last week’s advance, as data showed Chinese quarterly
economic growth matched forecasts.  Kuehne & Nagel International AG (KNIN) , the world’s biggest sea-freight forwarder, jumped 3.4 percent after reporting an
increase in second-quarter profit.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  gained 1
percent as Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of the shares with an
equal-weight rating.  Swisslog Holding AG (SLOG)  slid 4.7 percent after
it predicted a drop of as much as 5 percent in 2013 net sales.  The  SMI (SMI)  rose 0.5 percent to 8,024.19 at 10:01 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark advanced 2.6 percent last week as
Alcoa Inc. started the U.S. earnings season with better-than-estimated results and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said the economy still needs stimulus. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also added 0.5 percent today.  China ’s  gross domestic product  rose 7.5 percent in the
April-to-June quarter from a year earlier, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing. That equaled the
 median forecast  in a Bloomberg News survey. The economy expanded
at a 7.7 percent pace in the first quarter.  Finance Minister  Lou Jiwei  signaled last week that the
world’s second-biggest economy may expand less than the
government has targeted this year and that growth as low as 6.5
percent may be tolerable in the future.  Kuehne & Nagel climbed 3.4 percent to 113.80 Swiss francs.
Net income rose 6.3 percent to 153 million francs ($161
million), meeting analyst estimates collected by Bloomberg, as
the market for shipments by sea expanded and a reorganization
helped the company reduce costs.  Transocean Ltd., an offshore drilling contractor, added 1
percent to 47.51 francs as Morgan Stanley rated the stock equal
weight.  Flughafen Zuerich AG (FHZN) , the operator of the Zurich airport,
gained 0.7 percent to 496.75 francs after Kepler Cheuvreux
upgraded its recommendation on the shares to buy from reduce.  Swisslog slid 4.7 percent to 1.02 francs. The supply-chain
contractor said its traditionally stronger second half won’t
compensate for order arrears.  To contact the reporter on this story:
