The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in  Asia  outside  Japan  and
Australia rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 2 basis points to
127 as of 10:46 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The index has ranged from 128 basis points and 139.8 basis
points this month, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan increased 2 basis points to 147 as of
8:54 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Westpac prices show. The gauge is on
track to fall 5.4 basis points this month, according to Westpac
and CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Markets in Japan are closed today for a national holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
