It’s a summer weekend and you’re wondering where to go. Well, grab a friend and head out to a classical music festival. It’s the perfect excuse to ditch the city -- you have a purpose and a place to go. Best of all, you can see some great performances. Here are my picks for the top five Northeast festivals. Tanglewood , the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra since 1937, is the grande dame, with programs ranging from Bach to Barenaked Ladies. Tickets in the shed sell out fast, so it’s best to buy in advance. You can always picnic on the lawn. Located in Lenox, Massachusetts, the festival runs through Sept. 1.  +1-888-266-1200 ;  http://www.bso.org .  Bard Summerscape , the brainchild of Leon Botstein, music director of the American Symphony Orchestra and president of Bard College, offers opera, music, theater, dance, film and cabaret. Embedded is the 24th annual Bard Music Festival, which focuses on one composer; this year it’s Igor Stravinsky. Runs through Aug. 18 in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.  +1-845-758-7900 ;  http://fishercenter.bard.edu/bmf/2013 .  The  Marlboro Music Festival  is best known as the pet project of Mitsuko Uchida and Richard Goode, who invite great musicians to come and play chamber music in the bucolic foothills of southern Vermont. Each week, they pick the best chamber groups to perform, so you never know who’s playing, or the program. Runs mainly on weekends through Aug. 11. +1-802-258- 9331;  http://www.marlboromusic.org .  The  Yellow Barn Music Festival , in Putney, Vermont, was founded as an informal summer retreat for Manhattan School of Music students. It combines a by-the-bootstraps feel with powerhouse musicians such as pianist Peter Frankl. Runs through Aug. 3.  +1-892-387-6637;  http://www.yellowbarn.org .  The  Norfolk Chamber Music Festival , under the auspices of the Yale School of Music, is thought to be the oldest in New England. Dedicated in 1906, the Music Shed has seen performances by such luminaries as Fritz Kreisler, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Jean Sibelius. This year, string quartets abound. Runs through Aug. 17 on the grounds of the Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, in Norfolk, Connecticut. Ellen married Carl Stoeckel, son of the Yale Music School’s first professor.  +1-860-542-3000 ;  http://music.yale.edu/Norfolk .
