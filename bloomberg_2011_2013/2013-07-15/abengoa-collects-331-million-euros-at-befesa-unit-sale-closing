Abengoa SA (ABG) , a solar-thermal power
and desalination plant developer, said the company collected 331
million euros ($432 million) today at closing of the sale of its
Befesa industrial waste unit to Triton funds, which allows it to
focus on its water and solar businesses.  The Seville, Spain-based company said after debt
adjustments that the total equity consideration from the sale
announced on April 18 amounted to 620 million euros.  That comprised 348 million euros in cash, including today’s
payment, the remainder to be held in escrow “until resolution
of certain items, a vendor note of 48 million euros with a five-year maturity and deferred consideration for 225 million euros
in the form of a convertible instrument exchangeable into 14
percent of Befesa” on the exit of Triton from Befesa, Abengoa
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
