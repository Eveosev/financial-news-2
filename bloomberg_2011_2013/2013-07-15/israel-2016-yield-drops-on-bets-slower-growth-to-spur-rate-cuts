Israel ’s 2016 government bonds rose,
pushing the yield to lowest level in almost a month, on bets
slower economic growth will prompt the Bank of Israel to cut
interest rates in the coming months.  The yield on the 2.5 percent notes due May 2016 dropped
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.66 percent,
the lowest since June 19, at the close in Tel Aviv. The yield on
the government’s benchmark 4.25 percent bond maturing in March
2023 declined three basis points to 3.76 percent. The Israeli
market is closed tomorrow for a holiday.  Demand for the 2016 securities increased at a government
debt sale today, with investors seeking 7.2 times the 200
million shekels ($56 million), up from 3.6 times at a similar
auction on July 1. Economic data in June point to a “further
slowdown” in economic growth, the central bank, which kept its
benchmark rate at 1.25 percent last month, said on July 8.
Israel’s purchasing managers index contracted in June for a
second month to 46, Bank Hapoalim said today.  “More data are pointing to a slowing economy, which today
pushed demand for non-linked government bonds at the auction,”
Shuki Arditi, a bond trader at Tel Aviv-based  Leader Capital
Markets (LDRC)  Ltd., said by phone. Expectations that June’s inflation
rate may be lower than forecast also contributed to “raising
the likelihood that the central bank will cut rates as early as
the end of this month,” Arditi said.  Rate Cuts  Economic growth will probably slow to 3.2 percent in 2014
from 3.8 percent this year, the Bank of Israel said last month.
 Annual inflation  probably accelerated to 1.9 percent in June
from 0.9 percent a month earlier, the  median estimate  of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg shows. The Central Bureau of
Statistics will release the data at 6:30 p.m. local time.  June inflation was linked to some one-time increases after
the government raised taxes, according to Alex Zabezhinsky,
chief economist at  Meitav DS Investments Ltd. (MTDS)  in Tel Aviv.
Israel last month increased the value-added tax to 18 percent
from 17 percent amid steps by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s government to lower the budget deficit.  “Looking ahead, inflation won’t be an issue and is
expected to moderate as the economy slows leaving room for more
rate cuts,” Zabezhinsky said.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, declined one basis
points to 1.17 percent. The shekel strengthened 0.3 percent to
3.5905 a dollar at 5:27 p.m. in Tel Aviv, taking this year’s
gain to 4 percent, the best performer among 31 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
