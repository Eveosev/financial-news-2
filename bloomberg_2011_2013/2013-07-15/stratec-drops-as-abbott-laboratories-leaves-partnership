Stratec Biomedical AG (SBS)  fell to almost
a two-year low after analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux said the
medical-analysis equipment maker may miss growth opportunities
after  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  ended a partnership.  Stratec dropped as much as 7.4 percent to 26.40 euros, the
lowest intraday price since September 2011, and was trading down
6 percent at 1:42 p.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the German company
at 314.6 million euros ($410 million). The daily trading volume
was more than five times the three-month average.  The end of the development program with U.S. drugmaker
Abbott is “a meaningful setback of a kind we so far considered
highly unlikely,” Fabian Wenner and Maja Pataki, Zurich-based
analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux, said today in a research note.
“We see higher instrument demand, and Abbott was supposed to be
a key driver for 2014 and 2015.”  Stratec and Abbott’s diagnostics unit reached an agreement
in December 2010 to cooperate on developing an analyzer system.
Birkenfeld, Germany-based Stratec said on July 12 that Abbott
decided against proceeding because of strategy changes. The
German company cut its forecasts for 2013 to a range of 127
million euros to 138 million euros and earnings before interest
and taxes at 14 percent to 15.5 percent of sales because of
Abbott’s withdrawal.  The Kepler Cheuvreux analysts said Stratec’s earlier
projections were for revenue of 145 million euros to 150 million
euros, with an Ebit margin range of 15.5 percent to 16 percent.
They downgraded Stratec’s  recommendation  to hold from buy and
reduced their stock-price estimate to 28.50 euros from 41 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
