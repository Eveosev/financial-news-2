Russian shares climbed for a third
day as OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, rose after
the central bank eased borrowing costs.  The benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  advanced 0.2 percent to 1,401.40
by 4:46 p.m. in Moscow. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  added
0.2 percent to 1,351.51. Sberbank jumped 1.1 percent to 99.64
rubles.  While Bank Rossii kept its main rates unchanged on July 12
it introduced a one-year floating-rate facility with a starting
cost of 5.75 percent, compared with its 7.5 percent fixed-rate
for similar-maturity loans. Sberbank slumped 5.3 percent last
month, the steepest monthly drop since March, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Russia ’s economy grew 1.6 percent in the first
three months, spurring calls for easing.  “Russia’s banking sector and Sberbank specifically will
naturally be attractive to investors expecting a rate cut,”
Natalia Berezina, an analyst at UralSib Capital, said by phone
from Moscow. “If rates are cut next month, it’ll send a
positive signal for the entire sector.”  OAO Gazprom, the nation’s biggest company, increased 0.5
percent to 122.14 rubles. The stock rose 0.5 percent to $7.435
in London. Barclays Plc lifted the stock to the equivalent of
buy from sell on the expectations of a higher dividend payout
ratio and stability of near-term earnings, according to the e-mailed note.  OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , the country’s biggest mining
company, sank 1.4 percent to 4,676 rubles. The stock fell after
the world’s largest nickel and palladium producer was cut to
neutral at Citigroup Inc., which cited lower price forecasts for
the company’s main products. The shares have the 10th biggest
weighting in the Micex at 3.6 percent.  ‘Little Upside’  Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, dropped 0.5 percent
to $108.23 a barrel in London trading, after  China ’s growth
slowed to 7.5 percent in the second quarter from 7.7 percent in
the first.  Citigroup analysts said they see “little upside” for
Norilsk shares, according to today’s e-mailed note.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg. The volume of shares
traded on the benchmark today was 12 percent below the 30-day
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while the 10-day price swings rose to 15.81. Thirty-four stocks increased,
while 16 declined, the data show.  The 50-member Micex’s 5 percent decline in 2013 compares
with a 3.1 percent increase for  India ’s benchmark Sensex Index
and  Brazil ’s  Ibovespa Index (IBOV) ’s 25 percent retreat.  Pharmstandard Rally  The Micex surged 4.1 percent last week, the most since
December 2011, as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
July 10 that the world’s biggest economy will continue to need
stimulus. The gauge slid 2 percent on June 20 after comments by
Bernanke that signaled the central bank may wind down its bond
buying if the  U.S. economy  performs in line with projections.  OAO Pharmstandard, Russia’s biggest drugmaker, rose 7
percent to 1,682 rubles, a second day of gains. The drugmaker
purchased an additional 800 million rubles ($24 million) of
stock as of July 11, raising its buyback amount since February
to 6.1 billion rubles, the company said in a July 12 statement.  The shares slumped 34 percent over three days after a July
8 shakeup in which the company said it offered $630 million for
Bever Pharmaceutical Pte Ltd., without disclosing why, and
announced the spin off of its own branded, non-prescription
drugs business.  The company will offer to buy out shareholders who vote
against the planned spinoff of its over-the-counter unit for
2,180 rubles a share, equivalent to $16.67 per GDR. The GDRs
were trading at a 20 percent premium before the plan was
announced and added 7.2 percent to $12.77 in  London  today.  Relative Strength  JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced the stock to neutral, cutting
its price estimate to $13.50 from $27. The analysts cited
“damage to sentiment caused by what we believe the market sees
as unfavorable treatment of minority shareholders,” according
to the note.  The 14-day  relative strength index  on the Micex was steady
at 65. The RSI measures how rapidly prices have advanced or
dropped during a specified time period. Readings below 30
indicate a security may be poised to rise, while those above 70
signal a potential drop.  Thirty five stocks, or 70 percent, were trading above their
 50-day moving average  on the Micex on July 12. None closed at a
 52-week low  and none at a one-year high, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Russian Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in RTS futures, climbed 0.8 percent today. The Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in
the U.S. added 1.4 percent to 90.26 on July 12, the second day
of gains.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with a multiple of 9.9 for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
