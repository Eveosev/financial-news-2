Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-owned United Arab Emirates energy company known as Taqa
and one of the largest desalination suppliers in the world,
named Ahmed Bin Abbood Al Adawi to lead its water expansion.  Al Adawi will head the utility’s water divisions globally
as vice president, water development and projects, the company
said today in a statement. He’ll report to Taqa power and water
chief Frank Perez. Taqa is majority owner of eight power and
water plants across the U.A.E. When an expansion is completed in
2015, the Fujairah 1 water and power plant will be the Middle
East’s largest reverse-osmosis desalination facility.  Taqa is 75 percent-owned by the Abu Dhabi government and
holds stakes in businesses generating power or producing oil and
natural gas in the  Middle East , the North Sea, India and  North
America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
