BYD Co. (1211) , a Chinese maker of electric
cars, rose to the highest level in more than three weeks in  Hong
Kong  trading after the government announced a plan to promote
the use of energy-saving automobiles.  The  company , partly owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ,  gained  8.2 percent to HK$31.15 as of 1:07 p.m.,
headed for the highest closing price since June 19. Hong Kong’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 0.5 percent.  China plans to boost technology and speed up the
development of less energy-intensive and polluting industries to
upgrade the structure of the economy and shift growth toward
domestic demand, the central government said July 12 after a
meeting of the State Council, China’s Cabinet. Government and
public transport companies should take the lead in expanding the
use of new-energy vehicles, it said.  First-half sales of alternative-energy vehicles in the
nation rose 43 percent from a year earlier to 5,889 units,
according to the  China  Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
Electric-powered vehicles accounted for 87 percent of the total.  The southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, where BYD is based,
is considering incentives to encourage taxi operators to replace
their 15,000 vehicles with electric cars, Lu Xiangzhen, director
assistant of the city’s Energy Efficiency and New Energy
Vehicles Pilot City Leading Group Office, said in a phone
interview on July 2.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
