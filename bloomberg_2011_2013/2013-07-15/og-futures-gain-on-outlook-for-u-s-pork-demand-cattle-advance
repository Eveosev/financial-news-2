Hog futures gained on signs of
increasing demand for U.S. pork amid tight supplies. Cattle also
advanced.  About 343,000 hogs were processed in the  Iowa  and southern
Minnesota region in the week ending July 6, down 8 percent from
the previous week, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. The
average carcass weight dropped 0.2 percent. Grocers may be
increasing purchases on the outlook for rising demand next
month, said  Rich Nelson , the chief strategist at Allendale Inc.  “It is hopes for some last minute August grilling,”
Nelson, who is based in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview. “Fewer animals and generally low weights” are also
boosting prices, he said.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.7 percent to
84.825 cents a pound at 10:37 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
$1.2675 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for August
advanced 1.6 percent to $1.52525 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
