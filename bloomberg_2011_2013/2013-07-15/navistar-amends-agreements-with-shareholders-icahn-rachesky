Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  rose
the most in more than two months after agreeing to let
shareholders  Carl Icahn  and  Mark Rachesky  nominate two directors
each to the truckmaker’s board.  Shares of the Lisle, Illinois-based truckmaker rose 9.7
percent to $31.99 at the close in  New York , the biggest one-day
gain since May 3.  Icahn and Rachesky also agreed they won’t run a proxy
contest at the company’s annual shareholders meeting in 2014,
according to a statement. Navistar last year agreed to add three
directors designated by Icahn Partners and Rachesky’s MHR Fund
Management LLC. To make room for the fourth board
representative, John Pope is retiring as a director immediately,
Navistar said in the statement.  The change “likely puts greater control in the hands of
these activist investors,”  David Leiker , an analyst with Robert
W. Baird & Co., wrote in a report.  Rachesky and Icahn are among Navistar’s largest
 shareholders  and Rachesky is a  director . Each investor owns
almost 15 percent of Navistar. Chief Executive Officer Troy Clarke, who has led the company since April, is trying to end
losses and wants Navistar to concentrate on its main truckmaking
business.  Icahn and Rachesky probably will increase their Navistar
stakes to almost 20 percent each, Leiker wrote.  Navistar has surged 47 percent this year, compared with an
18 percent increase for the Russell 1000 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
