Brazil ’s swap rates fell after
analysts cut their outlook for growth and  China’s economy  slowed
for a second straight quarter, spurring speculation that the
Latin American nation’s central bank will limit increases in
borrowing costs.  Swap rates due in January 2016 declined six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 10.41 percent at 9:59 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.2650 per dollar.  Economists lowered their 2013 growth forecast to 2.31
percent from 2.34 percent a week earlier, according to the
median of about 100 estimates in a central bank survey published
today. They cut their outlook for inflation to 5.80 percent from
5.81 percent.  “There is a perception of slower inflation,” Joao Junior,
a fixed-income trader at ICAP Brasil DTVM, said in a telephone
interview from  Sao Paulo . “The deceleration of  China  also helps
to influence the market.”  China’s statistics agency reported that the economy of
Brazil’s biggest trade partner expanded 7.5 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, down from 7.7 percent in the
first three months of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
