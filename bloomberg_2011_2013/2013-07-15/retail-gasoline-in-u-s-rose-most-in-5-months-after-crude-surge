The average price of gasoline at
U.S. filling stations rose the most since February as the cost
of crude surged above $100 a barrel for the first time since May
2012.  The average  retail price  rose 14.7 cents from the previous
week to $3.639 a gallon, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. Itâ€™s the highest price since June 10
and the largest one-week increase since Feb. 4. The price is 32
percent above the five-year average for this time of year.  West Texas Intermediate oil futures rose 37 cents to settle
at $106.32 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The
front-month contract has increased as Canadian production
outages increased demand from Midwest refineries for oil from
the storage hub at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI. Crude costs make up about 67 percent of the price of retail
gasoline.  Prices increased in all  geographic regions  of the U.S.,
with the largest increase in the Midwest, where gasoline rose 23
cents to $3.639 a gallon. The smallest increase was in the Rocky
Mountain region, where prices increased 0.1 cent to $3.611 a
gallon.  The cheapest gasoline was in the  Gulf Coast , where prices
rose 14.8 cents to $3.443 a gallon. The most expensive was on
the West Coast, where prices rose 5 cents to $3.925 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
