Natural gas futures rose a second
day in New York amid forecasts for warmer-than-average weather

on the New York Mercantile Exchange and was at $3.656 as of
11:20 a.m. in  Singapore . The contract rose 0.9 percent July 12
to settle at $3.644.  Temperatures will be above normal in the Northeast and

usual, according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,
 Pennsylvania .  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
