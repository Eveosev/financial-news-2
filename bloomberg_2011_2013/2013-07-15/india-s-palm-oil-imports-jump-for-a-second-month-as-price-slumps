Palm oil  imports by  India , the
world’s biggest buyer, increased for a second month in June as
prices declined amid rising global cooking oil supplies.  Overseas purchases of crude and refined oils advanced 28
percent to 649,772 metric tons last month from a year earlier,
the  Solvent Extractors’ Association of India  said in an e-mailed
statement today. That was lower than a median estimate of
680,000 tons in a Bloomberg survey published last week.  Rising Indian demand for the oil used in everything from
noodles to biofuel may help stem a 28 percent decline in prices
in the past year in  Kuala Lumpur  and ease stockpiles in
Indonesia and Malaysia, the biggest suppliers. Cooking oil
demand in India may surge to 23 million tons by 2020 from 17.5
million tons now, and imports will rise significantly to meet
demand, according to the Food Ministry.  “Imports have been rising as demand in India is increasing
and the new crop will be harvested only in October, which is
still far away,” said B.V. Mehta,  executive director  at the
extractors’ association. “Rising refined  palm oil  imports
because of lower prices are also a cause of concern for us.”  Palm for delivery in September slumped as much as 2.9
percent to 2,234 ringgit ($700) a ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange today, heading for the lowest close this
year. Prices have fallen 4.4 percent this month after declining
2.2 percent in June as output expanded and demand slowed.  Total  vegetable oils imports , including for industrial use,
gained 21 percent to 947,591 tons in June, the association said.
Crude palm oil imports fell 7.4 percent to 353,542 tons in June
from a year earlier, while  refined, bleached and deodorized palm
olein  more than doubled to 296,230 tons, the association said.  Refined Palm  India is set to import record amounts of the refined
variety, taking advantage of lower export taxes in Indonesia and
 Malaysia  as the producers seek to encourage domestic refining,
according to Dorab Mistry, a director at Godrej International
Ltd. The share of refined oil will climb to 60 percent to 70
percent of total palm purchases by Oct. 31, he said. That may
increase to 80 percent by December if India fails to raise the
import duty, he said. Such products were 20 percent of shipments
a year earlier, the association said.  Soybean oil imports  were 138,849 tons in June, compared
with 139,794 tons a year earlier, while  sunflower oil  imports
climbed 16 percent to 101,480 tons, the association said.
Stockpiles, including those at the ports and in the pipelines,
climbed to 2.06 million tons as of July 1, enough to meet about
45 days of consumption, from 1.98 million tons a month ago,
association data showed.  “Once we enter the festival months of August and
September, the stockpiles should come down,” Mehta said.
Imports may climb to a record of 11 million tons this year from
10.2 million tons a year earlier, he said.  Shipments in the eight months through June rose 12 percent
to 7.15 million tons, according to the association. India meets
more than half of its demand through imports. It buys palm oil
from Indonesia and Malaysia and  soybean oil  from the U.S.,
 Brazil  and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
