Alstom SA (ALO) , the French power-equipment maker, will install 34 wind turbines at  Enel Green
Power SpA (EGPW) ’s project in  Mexico ’s southwestern state of Oaxaca.  The 3-megawatt turbines will be installed at a second phase
of Enel Green’s Sureste I wind farm in the Tehuantepec Isthmus,
Levallois-Perret, France-based Alstom said today on its  website .
It will be Alstom’s first delivery of wind turbines in the
country.  The project will be able to generate a total of 350
gigawatt-hours a year, enough to meet the electricity needs of
60,000 people, once it starts operating fully at the end of next
year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
