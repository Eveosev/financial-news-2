Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. (TWE) , the
world’s second-largest listed wine company, fell the most since
a 2011 listing after saying it would write off A$160 million
($145 million) to get rid of old and out-of-date bottles.  The writedown, greater than the company’s expected net
income this year, was taken to address excess stock in the U.S.,
Treasury Wine’s  largest division  by sales, the Melbourne-based
company said in a regulatory statement. The shares fell 12
percent in Sydney trading to close at A$5.11.  Treasury Wine will destroy stock, discount older bottles,
and take costs for onerous grape-buying contracts and holding an
excess of low-valued bulk wine, as a result of expected lower
shipments to the U.S. which will reduce earnings in 2014 by
about A$30 million, the company said. Net income was A$139
million in the year ended June 30, according to the average of
six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Industry feedback suggests ‘brand  Australia ’ is still out
of favour in the U.S. market,” Michael Simotas, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG in Sydney, wrote in a note to clients July 3.
Weaker-than-expected first-quarter results for  Constellation
Brands Inc. (STZ) , the largest wine company, were “not a good sign”
for the performance of Treasury Wine’s U.S. business, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
