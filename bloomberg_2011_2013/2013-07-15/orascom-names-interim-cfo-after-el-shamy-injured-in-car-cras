Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) , a
Swiss company that builds tourist towns in the Middle East and
Europe, selected an internal candidate for the role of interim
chief financial officer to replace Ahmed El-Shamy.  El-Shamy is stepping down after suffering injuries in a
crash involving his chauffeur-driven car. He will be replaced by
Canadian-Egyptian board member Eskandar Tooma, 35, at the end of
August on an interim basis, the company said in a statement
today.  Orascom develops tourist destinations on the Red Sea coast
and central Europe, and generated 278 million francs ($293
million) in sales last year. The company is present in nine
countries and manages six integrated-towns in  Egypt , Oman and
the United Arab Emirates offering hotels, villas and leisure
facilities.  “The decision was relatively simple, we needed someone who
had the financial experience and knows the company” said Till
Leisner, head of investor relations, in a telephone interview.
“Tooma is up to speed with all its processes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
