World production of refined nickel
in May came to 155,100 metric tons, exceeding demand of 143,100
tons, according to the International Nickel Study Group.  Usage fell from 144,900 tons in April, the Lisbon-based
group said in a report today. Output of the metal used to make
stainless steel rose from 153,500 tons.  Nickel production in 2013â€™s first five months climbed 11
percent from a year earlier to 790,500 tons as demand swelled
5.9 percent to 727,900 tons, the report showed. The market was
in surplus by 62,600 tons through May, almost tripling from the
prior year. Five-month output of refined metal jumped 45 percent
to 273,200 tons in  China  and expanded 28 percent in  Indonesia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
