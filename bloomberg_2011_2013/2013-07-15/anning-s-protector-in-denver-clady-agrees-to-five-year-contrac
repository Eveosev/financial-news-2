Offensive lineman Ryan Clady agreed
to a new five-year contract with the  Denver Broncos  that keeps
quarterback  Peyton Manning ’s blind-side protector under contract
through the 2017 National Football League season.  The Broncos didn’t disclose financial terms of the deal in
a news release yesterday.  ESPN reported  it has a base salary of
$52.5 million and includes at least $33 million in guaranteed
money for the 6-foot-6, 315-pound Clady.  Clady, 26, has started every game for the Broncos at left
tackle since being selected in the first round of the 2008 NFL
draft and allowed only one sack last year. He’s the fourth
offensive lineman in NFL history to start every game and make at
least three Pro Bowls in his first five seasons.  The Broncos’ 13-3 record last year in Manning’s first
season in Denver was tied for the best in the NFL. At left
tackle on the Broncos’ offensive line, Clady protects the right-handed Manning’s back, or blind side.  To contact the reporter on this story:
