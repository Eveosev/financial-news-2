Gold’s rebound may extend to $1,335
an ounce before prices resume a retreat toward a three-year low
of $1,100 in the next two months, according to  technical
analysis  by Barclays Plc.  Bullion futures’ trading volumes have declined on price
gains since mid-April, when the metal entered a  bear market ,
Comex data shows. That’s a bearish signal because it indicates
less investor interest to participate in advances, Barclays
analyst Lynnden Branigan said by e-mail July 12. The bank
recommends selling on any rallies toward $1,335, which is the 50
percent retracement of the drop from May to June, one of the
levels singled out in so-called Fibonacci analysis.  Gold slid 23 percent this year, reaching a 34-month low of
$1,180.50 on June 28, as some investors lost faith in it as a
store of value after the  Federal Reserve  indicated it may slow
bond purchases as the economy improves. Prices rebounded to a
two-week high of $1,298.73 on July 11 as physical demand
increased and Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. still
needs stimulus. The metal traded at $1,291.12 in  London  today.  “We believe that there is still downside risk toward the
$1,100 to $1,150 area,” said London-based Branigan, citing
monthly Fibonacci retracement levels and an Ichimoku cloud base.
“Timing could be in the next one to two months.”  Bullion last traded below $1,150 in April 2010 and below
$1,100 in March that year. Prices reached a record $1,921.15 in
September 2011.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in an asset or
security. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices
rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low. The Ichimoku strategy uses a cloud and lines based on
median prices to provide what some analysts refer to as a
“chart at a glance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
