  Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR)  acquired
Payless Car Rental for about $50 million in cash, adding a
company that focuses on value customers.  Payless has about 120 locations in  North America , Europe
and  South America  and generates $80 million in annual revenue,
according to a statement.  Avis, the third-biggest U.S. car-rental company, acquired
car-sharing company Zipcar Inc. for about $500 million in March.
The company is seeking to compete in a consolidating industry
where rival  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  received final regulatory
approval last week of its $2.3 billion acquisition of Dollar
Thrifty Automotive Group, solidifying Hertz’s position as the
No. 2 player.  “Payless expands our global footprint, enables us to
support Budget’s mid-tier brand positioning, and gives us
greater flexibility to capitalize on opportunities in an
additional segment of the car rental market in order to help
accelerate our growth,” Avis Budget Chief Executive Officer Ron Nelson said in the statement.  Avis Budget, based in Parsippany,  New Jersey , plans to
operate Payless as a separate brand, according to the statement.
The company said it expects “significant” cost savings from
the transaction, including from reduced fleet interest expense.  Closely held Enterprise Holdings Inc., based in St. Louis,
is the largest U.S. car-rental company.  Avis Budget fell 1.6 percent to $32.22 at the close in New
York. The shares have surged 63 percent this year, compared with
an 18 percent gain for the Russell 1000 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
