Gold’s slide into a  bear market  that
wiped $66 billion from the value of funds backed by the metal
pushed prices into the longest run below their 200-day moving
average since the 12-year  bull market  began in 2001.  The attached chart shows bullion has settled below the 200-day measure for five months since Feb. 11. That’s the most since
the eight months to March 2001, the year gold began the longest
run of annual gains in at least nine decades.  Gold is now heading for the first annual drop in 13 years
after some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of
value. Holdings in bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  fell
25 percent since peaking in December and reached the lowest in
more than three years last week. Moving averages are used by
some analysts and traders who study such charts to indicate
trends or future price movements of a security.  “We’re in a downtrend in the short and medium term,” said
Clive Lambert, the founding director of research and training
company FuturesTechs.com Ltd. in Billericay,  England . “Back
above $1,300, there’s a little bit of pressure off.”  Gold for immediate delivery slumped 23 percent this year in
 London  to $1,285.52 an ounce. Prices, which set a record
$1,921.15 in September 2011, entered a bear market in April and
reached a 34-month low of $1,180.50 on June 28. The metal is the
third-worst performer this year in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 commodities, behind silver and corn.  Federal Reserve  Bullion’s drop accelerated after  Federal Reserve  Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 that bond buying could slow if the
economy improves. He said July 10 that the U.S. still needs
stimulative monetary policy, the same day minutes of a June
meeting showed division among policy makers on when to slow and
end asset purchases. The central bank buys $85 billion of
Treasuries and mortgage debt each month.  The $1,285 to $1,300 area and $1,120 are “important”
technical levels that may help support prices or accelerate
declines in the short term, Lambert said. The $1,285 price is
near the 38.2 percent retracement of the rally from 2001 through
2011, one of the levels singled out in so-called Fibonacci
analysis. The $1,120 price is derived from a trend line drawn
from the end of 2001 on a monthly log scale chart.  “Below $1,120, you’re talking potential down to about
$890,” he said. “We have had some pretty nasty down moves and
it could well be more of the same.”  A combination of resistance levels in the $1,320 to $1,340
area will probably spur selling and a climb above about $1,522
would be needed to provide a more bullish outlook, according to
Barclays Plc. A drop below about $1,180 may push prices toward
$1,150 to $1,100, it said in a report yesterday.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in an asset or
security. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices
rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low.  To contact the reporter for this story:
