The pound erased a decline versus
the dollar after a report showed U.S. retail sales increased
less than economists forecast.  Sterling was little changed versus the euro after U.K. home
sellers raised asking prices to a  record . Sales in the U.S.
climbed 0.4 percent last month, half the 0.8 percent median
forecast of 82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Benchmark
10-year gilt yields were within four basis points of the lowest
in almost four weeks. The central-bank minutes, due on July 17,
will reveal how policy makers voted at Governor  Mark Carney â€™s
first meeting.  The pound was little changed at $1.5095 at 3:43 p.m. London
time after falling by as much as 0.5 percent to $1.5028. The
U.K. currency was at 86.37 pence per euro. It reached 86.94
pence on July 11, the weakest since March 13.  Home prices sought in the U.K. climbed for a seventh month,
increasing 0.3 percent to an average 253,658 pounds, London-based property-website operator Rightmove Plc said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
