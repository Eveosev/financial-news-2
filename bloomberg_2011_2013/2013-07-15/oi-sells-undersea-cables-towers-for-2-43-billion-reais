Oi SA, Brazil’s biggest landline
phone company, agreed to sell assets including towers and
undersea cables, raising 2.43 billion reais ($1.07 billion) to
replenish its dwindling cash balance.  Oi will sell 22,500 kilometers (14,000 miles) of submarine
cables to an investment fund run by  Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11)  for 1.75
billion reais, according to a  statement  today. It also  agreed  to
transfer the use and commercial rights of 2,113 towers to  SBA
Communications Corp. (SBAC)  for 686.7 million reais.  The deals help shore up Rio de Janeiro-based Oi’s finances
as it spends the most among peers this year on infrastructure
improvements, with a budget of about 6 billion reais. Chief
Executive Officer  Zeinal Bava , who joined the company last
month, has yet to announce whether he’ll maintain the company’s
pledge to pay 1 billion reais in dividends in August.  Oi closed the first quarter with a net debt-to-earnings
ratio of 3.05, compared with an average of less than 1 for Latin
American telecommunications companies, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company is scheduled to report
second-quarter results on Aug. 14.  Oi jumped 9.9 percent to 3.67 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo , the biggest one-day gain since June 4. The shares have
slid 56 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
