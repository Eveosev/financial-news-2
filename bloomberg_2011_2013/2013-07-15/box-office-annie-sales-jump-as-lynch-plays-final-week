“Annie” had its best week on Broadway in nearly four months as television star  Jane Lynch  ended her run as Miss Hannigan.  The revival took in $1.13 million at the Palace Theatre box office, up 6 percent from a week earlier, according to the trade association the Broadway League. The “Glee” star played her final performance on Sunday. Faith Prince, a Tony Award winner less well-known west of the Hudson, takes over the role on Friday.  Broadway tickets sales overall rose 2 percent to $23.2 million, as both “The Book of Mormon” and “Wicked” played nine performances, instead of the standard eight.  “Kinky Boots,” “Matilda,” “Pippin” and “Motown” all had their second-best weeks to-date. “ Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark ” had its best week in three months. “Cinderella,” after declining 14 percent last week, rebounded 2 percent to $1.1 million.  “ First Date ,” a new musical with actors best known for television, did a respectable $408,000 in its first eight previews. The show stars Zachary Levi (“Chuck”) and Krysta Rodriguez (“Smash.”)  “Macbeth,” with  Alan Cumming  in the title role and virtually all of the others, ended its run, grossing $390,000. It was up from last week but still achieved only about half of its sales potential.  Muse highlights include  New York   Scene  and  books .
