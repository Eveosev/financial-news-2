The slow crawl to the valet-parking stand at the  Parrish Art Museum  Saturday night had one advantage.  There was time to admire the $26 million museum designed by Herzog & de Meuron from afar: the meadow landscape, the wood decks, the improbable linearity of the building, stretching in front of Route 27 like a Hummer limo gone mad.  This Midsummer Party is the first to be held in the new Water Mill location since it opened eight months ago. About 600 guests turned up, followed by 400 young professionals who came for an After Ten Party. The event raised $1 million, according to a museum spokeswoman.  In the foyer,  Bill Ackman  of Pershing Square Capital mingled with Manhattan-based interior designers Tony Ingrao and Randy Kemper; the latter is training for the Hampton Classic Horse Show. Emil Henry of Tiger Infrastructure Partners headed down the hall to see the permanent collection. Board member Doug Polley of P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP took in what was shaping up to be the party of the season.  Bruce Berkowitz’s Fairholme Foundation, KKR & Co.’s Alex Navab and Soros Fund Management’s David Wassong were on the host committee as was Peter J. Solomon, supporting one of the senior executives at his investment bank, Frederic Seegal, who is the museum’s board chairman.  Seegal greeted guests at the entrance with Terrie Sultan, director of the Parrish, who wore a black  Morgane Le Fay  dress printed with constellations. It was a considered decision.  “We’re outside, so we have the constellations, and then there are Alice Aycock’s pictures,” Sultan said in her friendly, not-too-Texas twang. The print on the dress almost matched Aycock’s images of constellations on view in the museum.  Meadow Flowers  The decor too had been carefully thought out, as its designer, Ron Wendt, explained from his dinner seat on the museum’s expansive patio. The flowers were daisies and others that will grow in the Parrish’s meadow landscape.  The tablecloths were red, for a tail light. “What is more iconic than the tail light on Route 27?” said Wendt, who also liked “the way the fog has set in; it’s made it even more dreamy and romantic.”  Glenn Fuhrman of MSD Capital sat between Cindy Sherman and Josephine Meckseper for the meal of yellow gazpacho and wild striped sea bass.  Meckseper, whose work hangs throughout the museum, has a house in Amagansett with her husband, artist Richard Phillips, who said he’s been enjoying surfing. The July 4 holiday weekend was especially good.  “There was surf every single day. It’s rare you get that type of good luck, and it got better and better,” Phillips said.  Asked by a novice how to prepare for the paddle-board race to benefit Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Phillips suggested  Corey Senese . “Spend one week with him,” Philips said.  Surfer Laird Hamilton is set to paddle in the race on Aug. 17 and J. Crew has designed rash guards for competitors.  Hamptons Notes  Samantha Greenberg of Paulson & Co. took her first seaplane to the Hamptons.  Peter Wallace of Blackstone Group attended the first annual Blue Moon GrillHampton, a “grill-off” tasting event presented by Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors. His favorite dish: the grilled beef tenderloin with charred Mexican street corn salad from Elizabeth Karmel at Hill Country Barbecue Market.  Fresh, a two-month-old restaurant in Bridgehampton, had a line out the door Saturday night for dinner service, its first with a liquor license in place.
