Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration will seek $315 billion in infrastructure
investments during his six years in office to accelerate
economic growth.  The plan includes investment by the government and private
companies in energy and about $100 billion in communications and
transportation projects such as new ports and rail lines, Pena
Nieto said today at an event in  Mexico  City.  Pena Nieto has pledged to double Mexico’s growth rate in
part by increasing private investment in the oil industry. The
nation must lift private and public spending in public works,
which have lagged in Latin America’s second-largest economy,
Pena Nieto said.  “With better infrastructure, more investment and
transformational reforms, our nation will be able to grow at its
full potential,” Pena Nieto said.  Mexico’s peso advanced 0.8 percent to 12.7096 per dollar at
1:22 p.m. local time. Shares for steelmaker Industrias CH SAB
surged 3.8 percent while Empresas ICA SAB, the country’s biggest
construction company, advanced 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
