The biggest revision to credit-derivatives contracts in four years will take effect on March
20, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association.  The contracts, which are governed by ISDA, include a new
credit event trigger for government-initiated forced losses and
the addition of delivery of assets for a sovereign reference
entity, according to a document the New York-based trade group
posted on its  website  today. The Dutch government’s
expropriation of SNS Reaal NV’s bonds this year exposed
investors to losses, fueling concern that swaps offered
inadequate protection.  The committee is considering the changes after  Greece ’s
debt restructuring posed the biggest test for the $25 trillion
credit-default swaps market since banks including JPMorgan Chase
& Co. created it more than a decade ago. ISDA last overhauled
the derivatives in 2009 in the so-called Big Bang and Small Bang
protocols that created a new set of standards to increase
transparency and confidence in the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
