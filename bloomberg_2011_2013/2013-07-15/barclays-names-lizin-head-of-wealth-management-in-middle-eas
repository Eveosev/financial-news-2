Barclays Plc (BARC)  appointed Cedric Lizin
head of its wealth and investment management division in the
Middle East and North Africa as Britain’s third-biggest lender
by market value seeks to expand in the region.  Lizin, who joined the London-based bank in 2007 as chief
operating officer for the Asia Pacific region, also leads
Barclays wealth management joint venture in  Japan  with Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp. and SMBC Nikko Securities, the London-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Lizin replaces Rory Gilbert as head of the wealth
management unit, according to a Barclays official who asked not
to be identified because of company policy. Gilbert will move to
another role the official said, without giving more details.  “The  Middle East  and North Africa is a key market for
Barclays and we continue to grow our footprint across the
region,” John Vitalo, the bank’s regional chief executive
officer, said in the statement.  Banks such as Barclays consider the  United Arab Emirates 
and the Middle East as a long-term growth market where economic
expansion and high  oil prices  are driving prosperity. The bank
may double the number of private bankers it has across the
Middle East and North Africa region, Gilbert said last year.  Barclays said last month it will shift 4,000 more
administrative jobs to lower-cost locations to reduce expenses.
The lender plans to save as much as 250 million pounds ($381
million) by moving the positions, which are mostly in
information technology and operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
