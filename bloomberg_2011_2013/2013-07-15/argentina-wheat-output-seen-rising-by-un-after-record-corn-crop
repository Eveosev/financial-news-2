Argentina,  South America ’s largest
wheat grower, may harvest a crop that’s 39 percent larger than
last year’s after farmers increased planting while yields are
expected to rebound, the  United Nations  said.  Argentina may produce 12.5 million metric tons of wheat, up
from 9 million tons in 2012 and the previous five-year average
production at 11.36 million tons, the UN’s Rome-based Food &
Agriculture Organization said today in an online  report . Farmers
may plant about 4 million hectares (10 million acres), according
to the report.  “Sowing of the 2013 wheat crop is under way,” the FAO
said. “Driven by high domestic prices, early indications point
to an overall increase of the area planted from last year’s
sharply reduced level.”  Argentine farmers completed the corn harvest in May, and
official estimates peg that crop at a record 26.1 million tons,
the FAO said. Corn exports may be 18.5 million tons in the
2013-14 season that started March 1, up from 17.15 million tons
a year earlier, it said.  Argentina  is the second-largest
exporter of corn, also known as maize, after the U.S.  “The increase in exports is supported by the improved 2013
production and the highly competitive Argentina maize price
relative to the  United States ,” the FAO said. “Argentina is
also expected to benefit from the recent trade agreements signed
with  China  which gives its agricultural exports preferential
market access.”  Production of paddy rice may be unchanged from last year at
1.6 million tons, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
