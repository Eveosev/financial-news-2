Copper climbed after  China ’s
economic growth in the second quarter met analysts’ estimates.
Aluminum and nickel pared their declines.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.5 percent to $6,985 a metric ton,
before trading at $6,977.50 at 10:58 a.m. in  Shanghai . Aluminum,
which climbing to a one-month high on July 12, pared a 0.8
percent loss to trade 0.5 percent lower at $1,835 a ton while
nickel fell 0.2 percent to $13,753 a ton after earlier falling
as much as 1.1 percent.  China’s gross domestic product grew 7.5 percent in the
second quarter, matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. It slowed from 7.7 percent in the first quarter.
Industrial production rose 8.9 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with the 9.1 percent median forecast and a 9.2
percent gain in May.  “Data overall is in line with market expectations,” said
Cheng Xiaoyong, an analyst at Baocheng Futures Co. “Because
officials have said these levels are acceptable, there probably
won’t be any policies rolled out to stimulate growth.”  China’s Finance Minister  Lou Jiwei  said on July 11 that 6.5
percent expansion wouldn’t be a “big problem.”  Metal for delivery in September on the Comex rose 0.2
percent to $3.1595 a pound. Net-short positions, or wagers on
falling Comex prices, held by funds fell to 26,284 futures and
options as of July 9 from 26,963 a week earlier, according to
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Copper for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 1 percent to 50,190  yuan  ($8,176) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
