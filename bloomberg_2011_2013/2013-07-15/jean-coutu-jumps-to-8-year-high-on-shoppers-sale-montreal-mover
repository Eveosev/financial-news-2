The Jean Coutu Group Inc. (PJC/A) , Canada’s
second-largest publicly traded drugstore, surged the most in 15
months after competitor  Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. (SC)  agreed to sell
itself to Loblaw Cos. for C$12.4 billion ($11.9 billion).  Jean Coutu, based in Longueuil,  Quebec , soared 4.9 percent
to C$18.98 at the close in Toronto, the biggest gain since March
21, 2012. The stock has risen 31 percent this year.  Helene Bisson, a spokeswoman with Jean Coutu, said “it’s
business as usual” at the company and the share price movements
are probably related to the announced deal.  Analysts  covering  Jean Coutu have three buys, nine holds
and one sell rating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The consensus 12-month target price among analysts is C$18.13,
or 4.5 percent less than current levels.  Loblaw, Canada’s largest supermarket company by market
value, will pay C$61.54 a share in cash and stock for Shoppers
Drug Mart,  Canada ’s leading drugstore chain, the companies said
today in a statement. This represents a 27 percent premium to
Toronto-based Shoppers Drug Mart’s last closing price prior to
the announcement.  Shoppers soared 24 percent to C$60.12, a record high, while
Loblaw climbed 5.4 percent to C$50.13, the biggest gain in more
than seven months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
