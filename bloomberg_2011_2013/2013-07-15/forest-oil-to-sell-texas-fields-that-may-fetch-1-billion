Forest Oil Corp. (FST)  intends to sell oil
and natural gas fields in the Texas Panhandle that may fetch as
much as $1 billion, more than the company’s market value.  The Denver-based energy company hired JPMorgan Chase & Co.
to sell about 100,000 acres, including producing wells, after
receiving unsolicited offers, according to a filing today. The
assets may be worth $900 million to $1 billion, Maggie Savage, a
Milwaukee-based analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co., estimated in
a note to clients today.  Proceeds from a sale would be used to pay debt, Forest
Chief Executive Officer Patrick R. McDonald said in a statement.
Forest’s net debt was $1.64 billion as of March 31, according to
data  compiled  by Bloomberg from filings. The company’s market
value was $572.6 million today, after a 28 percent decline in
the stock price this year.  The divestiture would leave Forest with assets in East
Texas and the Eagle Ford shale in West Texas. The company agreed
in April to sell a half stake in future Eagle Ford wells to
 Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  for $90 million.  Forest rose 4 percent to $4.77 at 9:46 a.m. in  New York ,
after rising as much as 8.1 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
