Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, will probably boost  duties  on most oil shipments
abroad by 2.9 percent on Aug. 1 after Urals crude prices rose.  The standard export  duty  may increase to $379.80 a metric
ton, or about $51.81 a barrel, from $369.20 a ton this month,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on oil price data from
the Finance Ministry.  The government is seeking ways to encourage producers to
meet President Vladimir Putin’s goal of keeping output at more
than 10 million barrels a day. Production hit a post-Soviet era
record of 10.53 million barrels a day in June, according to
preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. Oil
and gas provide about half of Russia’s budget revenue.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades may rise to $180.80 a ton from $172.90 a ton this
month. The levy on extra-heavy crude, set at 10 percent of the
standard duty, may climb to $37.90 in August.  Russia bases the export taxes on the average Urals blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged about $105.05 a barrel
during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said today by phone. In the previous
monitoring period, it averaged $102.64, according to the
ministry.  The Economy Ministry will publish the levies on its website
before they come into effect, according to Sakovich.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as fuel oil, may rise to $250.60 a ton from
$243.60. A gasoline tax, set at 90 percent of the crude oil duty
since May 2011 to counter domestic shortages, may increase to
$341.80 a ton in August from $332.20 a ton this month.  The government may reduce the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $40.50 a ton next month,
down from $45.20 a ton this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
