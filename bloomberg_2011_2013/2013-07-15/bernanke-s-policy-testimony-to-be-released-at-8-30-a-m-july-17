Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony to the House Financial Services Committee
will be released at 8:30 a.m. on July 17, rather than at 10 a.m.
as in the past, according to a statement from the committee.  The hearing at which Bernanke will present his semi-annual
monetary policy report will still begin at 10 a.m. He will
testify before the Senate Banking Committee starting at 10 a.m.
on July 18.  “This change will allow members of the Financial Services
Committee the opportunity to review the testimony and the report
before the hearing begins,” according to the statement from the
House committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
