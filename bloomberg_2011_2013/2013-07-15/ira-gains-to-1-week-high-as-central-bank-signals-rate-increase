The lira headed for its highest
level in almost a week as the Turkish central bank said it may
raise  interest rates  this month.  The lira appreciated as much as 1.2 percent against the
dollar and traded up 0.6 percent to 1.9433 by 11:33 a.m. in
Istanbul, set for its highest level since July 9. Yields on two-year benchmark notes fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 9.05 percent, the lowest level in six days on a
closing basis.  “A measured step to widen the interest-rate corridor will
be on the agenda of the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting
on July 23,” Governor Erdem Basci said in a statement on the
central bank’s website today. Turkey’s central bank has sold
$6.35 billion in currency auctions since June 11 to bolster the
lira, which dropped to a record 1.9740 per dollar on July 8. The
 exchange rate  will weaken 3.2 percent to 2.0045 per dollar in
December, currency futures show.  “This is a strong signal that they are ready to take out
the bazooka,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging-market strategy at
 Societe Generale SA (GLE)  in London, said in e-mailed comments today.  Foreign investors reduced the lira debt they owned to $61.5
billion in the week ended June 28 from $71.8 billion on May 3.
Turkey’s 10-year yields have jumped since Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled May 22 the U.S. central bank
may scale back its $85 billion a month of bond purchases that
helped fuel a rally in higher-yielding debt.  “In this environment, it would have to be sizeable,”
SocGen’s Anne said referring to a rate increase in Turkey.  The lira has weakened 9 percent this year in the biggest
depreciation among  emerging markets  in Europe, the  Middle East 
and Africa after the South African rand, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank introduced a so-called interest-rate
corridor in October 2011 to adjust lenders’ funding costs and
rein in a current-account deficit that swelled to a record $77
billion that year. It has lowered the corridor this year and cut
borrowing costs to spur growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
