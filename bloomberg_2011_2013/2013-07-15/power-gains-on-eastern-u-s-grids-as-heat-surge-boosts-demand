Spot wholesale electricity on three
East Coast grids surged as unusually hot weather increased air
conditioner use.  New York City topped $1,000 a megawatt-hour as the state
grid operator said it initiated required and voluntary
curtailments from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. for businesses and large
power users participating in demand-response programs.
 Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED)  expects power use in its New York City
and Westchester County area to reach a record 13,200 megawatts
today, according to a  statement  from the utility.  The temperature in  Manhattan  rose to 92 degrees Fahrenheit
(33 Celsius), 8 above the average high, while  Washington  reached
95, according to AccuWeather Inc. The Northeast and mid-Atlantic
states will see highs in at 90s for most of this week, the
forecaster in State College,  Pennsylvania , said on its website.  “We got the big spike in power and I have to imagine
that’s going to continue, based on this heat,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a consulting group in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. “This is where the peaker units make
their bread and butter this week.”  Spot power for New York City jumped 11-fold to average
$544.22 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 3 p.m. after
surging to $1,085.47, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
The  on-peak average  has gained more than fivefold to $208.41 a
megawatt-hour from the July 12 full-day average of $39.80. On-peak hours run from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. Monday through Friday.  Boston Prices  Boston climbed eightfold to $304.56 a megawatt-hour,
causing the  on-peak  to almost quadruple to $134.79. PJM’s
 Eastern hub , which includes cities such as Philadelphia,
Baltimore and Richmond,  Virginia , rose fivefold to $217.311 and
the  on-peak average  has almost tripled to $143.40.  The premium for New York City electricity widened versus
New England and PJM as imports from these neighboring grids fell
below day-ahead forecasts, said Matt Oatway, a Boston-based
analyst with Genscape Inc., which tracks real-time power data.  The premium for New York City on-peak power widened versus
Boston to $73.63 a megawatt-hour from $5.32 on July 12. New
York’s premium versus Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s
northern New Jersey territory on the PJM grid widened to $35.48
from $2.60.  Sustained high temperatures expected for this week may push
demand on the New York state grid close to an all-time high of
33,939 megawatts, reached in August 2006, the NYISO said in an
emailed statement. The grid operator said it may activate demand
response programs for its commercial and industrial consumers to
cut demand again tomorrow.  New England  Power consumption  from  Maine  to  Connecticut  may peak at
26,200 megawatts in the hour ending at 5 p.m., heading for the
highest hourly average since July 22, 2011, according to ISO New
England data. PJM expects  demand  on its grid, the largest in the
U.S., to peak at 151,517 megawatts today, the most since July
18, 2012.  The scorching heat lifted also lifted natural gas, a fuel
used to generate electricity, on the spot market to the highest
levels in more than three months.  Algonquin City Gates, which includes deliveries to  Boston ,
rose $3.509, or 78 percent, to $8.0104 per million British
thermal units on the IntercontinentalExchange, the highest since
March 21, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Transco Zone 6 for
New York City increased $1.3523, or 35 percent, to $5.2137, the
most since April 2.  The utilities serving New York City and Long Island
declared today a minimum oil burn day, requiring oil-fired
plants to ramp up to assure sufficient supplies, according to
the NYISO’s website. Oil- and coal-fired generators increased
output in New England, accounting for 12 percent of the region’s
power supply as of 3:44 p.m., according to ISO New England
Inc.’s website. That’s up from about 2 percent on July 12. Gas
accounted for 53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
