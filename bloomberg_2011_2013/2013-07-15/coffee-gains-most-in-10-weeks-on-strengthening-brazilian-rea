Arabica-coffee futures gained the
most in 10 weeks as a rally in the Brazilian real eased concern
that exporters will expand shipments at a time of global
surplus.  The Brazilian real strengthened 1.1 percent to 2.242 per
dollar at 12:54 p.m. after touching a four-year low of 2.803 on
July 10. The currency tumbled 11 percent in the two months
through July 12, increasing the incentive for coffee exporters
to ship more beans and sending prices in New York down 17
percent over the period. The collapsed-exchange rate created
incentive for exports sold in the U.S. currency.  “The real has reversed over the weekend and is spurning
sales,” James Cordier, the founder of Optionsellers.com in
Tampa,  Florida , said in a telephone interview.  Arabica coffee for September delivery advanced 3.3 percent
to $1.2335 a pound on ICE Futures U.S., heading for the biggest
gain since May 2. Prices were down 17 percent this year through
July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
