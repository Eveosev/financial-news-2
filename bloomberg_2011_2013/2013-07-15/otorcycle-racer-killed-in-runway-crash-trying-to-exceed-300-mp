Motorcycle racer Bill Warner died
while attempting to become the first person to exceed 300 miles 
per hour (483 kilometers per hour) over one mile on a
conventional motorcycle. He was 44.  Warner had reached 296 mph during a previous run before
losing control and crashing off a paved runway yesterday at the
former Loring Air Force Base in Limestone,  Maine . Warner was
conscious following the accident, though he died at a local
hospital about an hour and 15 minutes later, said Tim Kelly, the
race director for the land speed competition known as  The
Maine Event .  Warner in 2011 had reached a world record speed of 311.9
mph over a 1 1/2-mile distance on the same track.  The Loring Timing Association’s race track is the world’s
longest asphalt surface available for land-speed record attempts
at more than 2.5 miles long, according to the association’s
website. The facility was closed as a U.S. Air Force base in
1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
