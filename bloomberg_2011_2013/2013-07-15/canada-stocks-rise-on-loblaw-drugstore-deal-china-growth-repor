Canadian  stocks  rallied to the
highest in almost six weeks as raw-materials producers gained
after  China ’s growth matched forecast and Loblaw Cos. agreed to
the biggest takeover of a Canadian retailer.  Loblaw Cos. jumped to a six-year high after agreeing to buy
 Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. (SC)  for C$12.4 billion ($11.9 billion).
Shoppers surged 27 percent to a record. Endeavor Silver Corp.
added 7.4 percent as the company restated its second-quarter
revenue to a higher level. Barrick Gold Corp. climbed 2.1
percent as the precious metal traded near a two-week high. Niko
Resources Ltd. dropped 1.6 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 74.24
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,536.42 at 10:12 a.m. in Toronto,
the highest intraday since June 5. The benchmark gauge jumped
2.7 percent last week, its biggest five-day rally since
November, to erase a loss for the year. Trading was 16 percent
below the 30-day average at this time of day.  Loblaw (L) , the country’s largest supermarket company by market
value, surged 8.4 percent to C$51.52, the highest since July
2007. The cash and stock deal for the country’s  leading
drugstore chain  is the largest between two Canadian companies
since Suncor Energy Inc. bought Petro-Canada in 2009.  China’s gross domestic product rose 7.5 percent in the
April-to-June quarter from a year earlier, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing. That equaled the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and the government’s
target rate for 2013. The economy expanded at a 7.7 percent pace
in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
