Coskata Inc., a biofuel company
backed by venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, withdrew its
registration for a planned initial public offering to raise as
much as $100 million.  “At this time, due to current public market conditions,
the company has determined not to proceed with the initial
public offering,” it said today in a filing.  Coskata is the fourth biofuel company, and second backed by
Khosla, to cancel an initial share sale since last year. Enerkem
Inc. canceled its planned IPO in April 2012, followed by Fulcrum
BioEnergy Inc. in November and Khosla-backed  Mascoma Corp. (MCM)  in
March.  The company, based in Warrenville,  Illinois , shelved the
offering indefinitely almost a year ago, and Chief Executive
Officer Bill Roe said unfavorable market conditions were the
reason for putting the deal on hold. He’s seeking investors for
a plant that will convert natural gas into ethanol, a shift from
Coskata’s prior focus on converting biomass into fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
