Robinson Cano of the  New York 
Yankees signed an endorsement contract with  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , his
first sponsorship deal since joining the athlete representation
firm started by entertainer Shawn “Jay Z” Carter.  Terms of the accord weren’t disclosed by Roc Nation Sports
spokesman Ron Berkowitz. PepsiCo, the world’s largest snack food
maker, is an official sponsor of Major League Baseball and Pepsi
has been MLB’s official soda since 1997.  Cano, a free agent after the 2013 season, fired agent  Scott Boras  in April and is now co-represented by Roc Nation Sports
and Creative Artists Agency. The All-Star second baseman leads
the Yankees at the All-Star break with a .302 batting average,
21 home runs and 65 runs batted in.  Jay Z’s wife, Beyonce, appears in Pepsi commercials. He was
certified last month by the National Basketball Association and
the MLB players’ unions to negotiate contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
