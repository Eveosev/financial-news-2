Banks in the  United Arab Emirates 
are seeking five years to comply with a central bank regulation
to limit their exposure to government entities in the second-biggest Arab economy.  The banks seek to “exclude marketable bonds, sukuks from
the proposal, and to apply means and purpose test in order to
determine whether the large exposure regulation applies to an
entity, and to consider five years term to fully comply with
these regulations,” the U.A.E. Banks Federation said in an e-mailed statement today.  The central bank said in April 2012 that banks must not
lend more than 100 percent of their capital to local governments
and the same amount to government-related entities to help
reduce risk, and must comply with the new regulations before by
Sept. 30, 2012. There was no limit under previous rules.  The banks federation said the central bank postponed the
September deadline to allow lenders to “study, evaluate” the
new rules and to revert back to the regulator with a final
proposal.  Many U.A.E. banks suffered from an increase in bad loans
linked to debt restructuring by state-owned businesses including
Dubai World, which roiled global markets in 2009 with its
request to delay payments on $25 billion in loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
