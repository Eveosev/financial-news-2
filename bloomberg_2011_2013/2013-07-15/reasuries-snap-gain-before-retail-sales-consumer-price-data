Treasuries rose, extending the
biggest weekly rally in more than a year, as slower-than-forecast growth in retail sales in June added to signs of a
second-quarter slowdown in the  U.S. economy .  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes dropped after Commerce
Department figures showed a  0.4 percent gain  in retail sales,
compared with a median forecast of a 0.8 percent in a Bloomberg
survey of 82 economists. Federal Reserve Governor  Daniel Tarullo 
said any slowing of central-bank asset buying would depend on
economic gains. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  delivers to his
semi-annual monetary-policy testimony to Congress on July 17-18.  “Today’s data underscores the weak gross-domestic-product
scenario -- the consumer is still extremely cautious,” said
 Richard Gilhooly , an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities
Inc. in  New York . “Things have recovered more tentatively than
the Fed would like. We have quite a while before the economy
will have gained real traction.”  Ten-year  yields  fell five basis points, or 0.5 percentage
point, to 2.54 percent at 5 p.m. New York time after rising to
2.64 percent, Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The 1.75
percent note due May 2023 gained 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face
amount, to 93 6/32.  The yield fell 16 basis points last week, the biggest five-day drop since the period ended June 1, 2012.  Treasuries declined 2.5 percent in the first half of the
year, the most since 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. They advanced 0.6 percent last week.  Volatility, Volume  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was at 89.4, the lowest
level since June 19. The figure is down from 117.89 on July 5,
the highest since December 2010. The one-year average is 64.38.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 27 percent to
$188 billion from $258.5 billion July 12. The 2013 average is
$321 billion.  The 10-year yield’s 14-day  relative strength index  fell to
58 after rising to 77 on July 5, above the 70 level some traders
see as a sign that a reversal is imminent.  Tarullo, who has always voted in favor of bond purchases by
the Fed, said today in  Washington  that changes in the monthly
amount of purchases are “data driven, dependent on the economy,
as we see the economy develop then we will make our judgment.”  ‘Very Accommodating’  “We are not specifying no matter what happens on this
particular date we are going to have a change in the flow,” he
said. “It will still be a very accommodating policy.”  Bernanke said last month the central bank may begin to slow
its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases this year and end them
in 2014 if economic growth meets policy makers’ goals. He said
July 10 that the U.S. needs “highly accommodative monetary
policy for the foreseeable future.”  “The story is still about Bernanke,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “We expect him to reiterate that the Fed is
currently in a data-dependent mode and the improvement in the
labor market will be the primary focus as they decide on the
timing for tapering quantitative easing. He will stress the
difference between tapering and tightening.”  A Labor Department report tomorrow will show the  consumer
price index  excluding food and energy costs climbed 1.6 percent
in the 12 months through June, the smallest gain in two years,
another survey of analysts shows.  TIPS Auction  The  difference  in yield between 10-year notes and TIPS, a
measure of trader expectations for inflation over the life of
the debt called the break-even rate, was at 2.08 percentage
points after shrinking to 1.81 percentage points on June 24, the
narrowest since October 2011. The 2013 average is 2.37
percentage points.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $15 billion in 10-year TIPS
on July 18. The Treasury previously sold $13 billion of the
securities on May 23 at a yield of negative 0.225 percent, the
highest yields in 14 months.  While the rate on 10-year Treasuries has risen from as low
as 1.61 percent in May, the  term premium , which measures the
risk of holding longer-dated bonds by incorporating investors’
outlook for inflation and growth, suggests they are no longer
overvalued. The term premium reached 0.46 percent this month,
compared with the 0.40 percent average in the decade before the
2007 financial crisis and the Fed’s efforts to pump cash into
the economy by purchasing bonds, according to Columbia
Management Investment Advisers LLC.  “We actually just bought Treasuries because we think we
are pretty close to that equilibrium price,”  Jack McIntyre , a
 money manager  who oversees $44.5 billion at Brandywine Global
Investment Management LLC in Philadelphia, said in a July 9
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
