China’s stocks  rose, extending last
week’s gains, after the nation’s economy grew in line with
analysts’ forecasts and the government widened foreign investor
access to its markets.  Citic Securities Co. (600030)  and Haitong Securities Co. climbed 4
percent after regulators almost doubled qualified foreign
institutional investment quotas to $150 billion. Chongqing
Changan Automobile Co. jumped 1.9 percent after profit more than
doubled. China’s economy grew 7.5 percent in the second quarter,
easing concerns that growth would fall below official forecasts
after Finance Minister  Lou Jiwei  said last week that 6.5 percent
expansion wouldn’t be a “big problem.”  “The market has factored in a reasonably negative outlook
for the economy and this number, if people believe it, eases the
worries a little bit,” said Howard Wang, who oversees $9
billion for JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. The GDP data
show “the economy is not sliding inexorably into recession, but
rather, finding itself in a slower growth phase.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1 percent to 2,059.39 at
the close, adding to last week’s gain of 1.6 percent. The CSI
300 Index climbed 1.4 percent to 2,307.30 and the  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slipped less than 0.1 percent. The
Bloomberg China-US 55 Index fell 1.4 percent on July 12.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 6.2 percent
higher than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The index has dropped 9.2 percent this year as data
from industrial production to exports pointed to a slowdown in
the economy and as money-market rates reached record highs last
month. The measure trades at 8.4 times 12-month projected profit
after valuations fell in June to the lowest level in at least
five years, Bloomberg  data  show.  Brokers Rally  A measure of financial stocks in the CSI 300 including
brokerages and banks rose 1.5 percent. Citic Securities, the
biggest-listed brokerage, rallied 4 percent to 10.96  yuan .
Haitong Securities, the second largest, advanced 4 percent to
10.78 yuan. China Citic Bank Corp. advanced 4.3 percent to 3.91
yuan. Industrial Bank Co. gained 1.9 percent to 10.26 yuan.  Besides increasing QFII quotas, the  China Securities
Regulatory Commission  said on July 12 it will also permit
investors with yuan holdings in Singapore and  London  to invest
in China’s markets.  China last increased QFII limits in April 2012 by boosting
it to $80 billion from $30 billion. Foreign investors have only
fulfilled $43 billion of the $80 billion quotas since China
started to allow overseas investment through the QFII program in
2002, according to regulators. They account for 1.6 percent of
 China ’s A-share stock market.  Capital Inflows  “QFII is a piece of good news and it shows the regulator
wants more capital inflows to support the market,” said Wu Kan,
a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “The market is concerned that the
government will now sacrifice short-term growth to alter the
structure of the economy. However, that’s the price China needs
to pay for long-term sustainable growth.”  China’s economic growth slowed as gains in factory output
weakened, and is at risk of weakening further as the government
reins in credit expansion to reduce the danger of a financial
crisis. Comments by Premier Li Keqiang last week that growth
should remain above a certain unspecified floor and Lou’s
remarks added to confusion about where the government’s
tolerance would end.  While the 7.5 percent growth in the second-quarter gross
domestic product was lower than the 7.7 percent expansion in the
previous quarter, it matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 45 analysts. The government in March set a 2013
growth target of 7.5 percent.  ‘Some Relief’  “Given the higher probability that the GDP data would miss
estimates, the markets are showing some relief,” said Gavin Parry, managing director of Hong Kong-based brokerage Parry
International Trading Ltd.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays
Plc last month reduced their China growth estimates for this
year to 7.4 percent, which would be the weakest pace since 1990.
Nomura Holdings Inc. today cut its forecast for 2014 growth to
6.9 percent from 7.5 percent.  Among other data today from the National Bureau of
Statistics, industrial production rose 8.9 percent in June from
a year earlier, compared with the 9.1 percent median forecast of
44 economists. Retail sales in June jumped 13.3 percent after a
12.9 percent increase in May. The median forecast was for an
increase of 12.9 percent. Home sales transaction values climbed
24 percent in June, the biggest monthly gain this year.  Lackluster Investment  A gauge of consumer-discretionary companies rose 1.9
percent. Changan Auto climbed 1.9 percent to 9.55 yuan.  FAW Car
Co. (000800) , which makes cars in China with Volkswagen AG, jumped 4.3
percent to 13.65 yuan. The company said it estimated first-half
net income of as much as 750 million yuan ($122.2 million),
compared with a net loss of 61.4 million yuan in the same period
last year.  China’s 20-year economic boom has boosted the wealth of its
1.3 billion citizens at the fastest pace worldwide and spawned
some of the biggest companies in history. Foreigners earned less
than 1 percent a year investing in Chinese  stocks , a sixth of
what they would have made owning U.S. Treasury bills.  The MSCI China Index has gained about 14 percent, including
dividends, since  Tsingtao Brewery Co. (168)  became the first mainland
company to sell H shares to international investors in Hong Kong
in July 1993. That compares with a 452 percent return in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, 322 percent in the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index and 86 percent from Treasuries. Only the MSCI
Japan Index had a weaker performance among the 10 largest
markets, losing about 1 percent.  “H-share companies have to create value for
shareholders,” said Victoria Mio, chief investment officer for
China at Robeco Hong Kong Ltd., whose parent company oversees
about $247 billion.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
