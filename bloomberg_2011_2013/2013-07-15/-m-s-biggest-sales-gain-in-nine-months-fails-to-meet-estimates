Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , Europe’s
second-biggest clothes retailer, reported June sales that missed
estimates after growth slowed in the latter part of the month.  Revenue at stores and operations open at least a year rose
3 percent compared with the same month a year earlier, the
Stockholm-based company said in a statement today. The monthly
growth was the strongest since September, yet was less than the
4.1 percent expected in a SME Direkt survey.  “We believe the improved performance in comparison to
previous months may be discount-driven after a disappointing
spring/summer season led to a higher level of inventory,”
analyst Allegra Perry at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note.  H&M rose 0.5 percent to 238.30 kronor at 9:12 a.m. in
Stockholm trading, largely mirroring the broader market.  H&M’s total sales advanced 13 percent last month, compared
with a predicted 13.5 percent increase. When reporting second-quarter earnings June 19, the retailer said revenue from June 1
to June 17 rose 14 percent. Today’s numbers therefore suggest a
slowdown in the second half of the month, Perry said.  H&M said it had 2,926 stores at the end of June, up from
2,596 a year ago. It plans to open 350 this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
