McDonald’s (MCD)  workers need two jobs to
make ends meet.  Such is the assumption of “Practical Money Skills,” a
budgeting guide created by Visa Inc. and Wealth Watchers
International for McDonald’s Corp. employees. A sample  budget 
assumes workers with two jobs earn $2,060 a month, or $12.88
an hour, for a 40-hour week. U.S. fast-food cooks, on average, 
make $9.03 an hour, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in March.  In recent months, industry workers have gone on strike in
cities across the U.S., including  Chicago  and New York, to
protest for higher wages. In April, employees from McDonald’s,
Dunkin’ Donuts, and Subway restaurants walked off the job and
marched in the Chicago Loop and near the Magnificent Mile
shopping area to call for $15-an-hour pay.  Heidi Barker, a spokeswoman for Oak Brook, Illinois-based
McDonald’s, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  The budget journal, available in English and Spanish,
features McDonald’s golden arches logo. A disclaimer at the
bottom says McDonald’s “does not endorse or control this
program, but permits Wealth Watchers International and  Visa Inc. (V) 
to make this offer available.”  The sample budget assumes workers are left with $800 a
month in spending money after expenses, which includes $600 on
housing and $100 in savings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
