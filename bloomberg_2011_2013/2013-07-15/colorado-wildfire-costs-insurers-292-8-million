The  Colorado  Black Forest wildfire
cost insurers $292.8 million and ruined a record 486 structures,
making it the second-most costly fire in the state’s history.  Policyholders submitted 3,630 home and auto claims for the
fire, the Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association, an
industry group, said in a  statement  today. The number of
properties destroyed compares with 347 total losses in last
year’s Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado. That blaze, in a less
rural area, led to more than 6,000 claims and about $453.7
million in insured losses, according to the RMIIA.  The Black Forest Fire started on June 11, killing two
people about 21 miles (34 kilometers) from  Colorado Springs ,
according to the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office website. The
department ruled out natural causes of the blaze, according to a
June 26 statement.  “Wildfire continues to exact a tragic and financial toll
on our state,” Carole Walker,  executive director  at the
association, said in the statement. “Insurance catastrophe
adjusters have been on the ground since the first evacuation
notice, and the industry is prepared over the long-term to help
impacted residents recover.”  The state’s costliest season occurred in 2012 when insurers
had losses of more than  $500 million  to cover damages from the
Waldo Canyon Fire that hit Colorado Springs and the High Park
Fire near  Fort Collins , the association said.  Policyholder-owned State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Co., the biggest U.S. home and car insurer, has the top market
share in Colorado, according to 2012 A.M. Best Co. data compiled
by Bloomberg. It is followed by Farmers Insurance Group, which
has a management relationship with  Zurich Insurance Group AG. (ZURN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
