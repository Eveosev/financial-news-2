The rand gained for a second day
after China, the largest buyer of South African raw materials,
posted economic growth that was in line with estimates.  The Chinese economy grew by 7.5 percent in the three months
through June, compared with 7.7 percent the previous quarter and
meeting the median estimate of 74 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. South Africa, which has the world’s largest known
reserves of platinum and chrome, relies on metals for more than
50 percent of its export earnings.  “The market is relieved that this morning’s figure wasn’t
worse,” John Cairns, a currency strategist at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ’s
Rand Merchant Bank unit, said in an e-mailed note to clients.  The rand strengthened 0.4 percent to 9.9460 per dollar by
9:33 a.m. in Johannesburg. The currency is the worst performer
this year among 24 major emerging-market peers tracked by
Bloomberg, with a drop of 15 percent in the period. Yields on
10.5 percent government debt due December 2026 declined 2 basis
points to 7.99 percent.  Foreign investors bought a net 531 million rand ($53
million) of South African bonds last week, bringing the total to
19.8 billion rand this year, compared with 93.5 billion rand a
year earlier.  The spot price of gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,286.55 per
ounce. South Africa is the world’s fifth-largest producer of the
metal. Platinum gained for a sixth day in the longest winning
streak since January, advancing 0.3 percent to $1,412.77 per
ounce.  China ’s “slowdown is a major worry for commodities and
therefore for South Africa and the rand,” Rand Merchant Bank’s
Cairns said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
