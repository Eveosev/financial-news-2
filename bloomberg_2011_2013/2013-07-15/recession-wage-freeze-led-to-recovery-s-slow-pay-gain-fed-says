A surge in the number of workers
whose wages were frozen during the most recent U.S. recession
may explain why wage growth has been tepid during the recovery,
a Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco study showed.  “As the economy recovers, pent-up wage cuts will probably
continue to slow wage growth long after the unemployment rate
has returned to more normal levels,” Mary Daly, Bart Hobijn and
Timothy Ni of the San Francisco Fed wrote in the paper released
today. “We expect wage growth to accelerate” once the number
of people with frozen wages declines, they said.  Fed policy makers have been grappling with why inflation
has slowed even after four years of economic recovery, with the
central bank’s preferred price gauge increasing 1 percent in
May. The Federal Open Market Committee targets inflation of 2
percent.  Disposable, or after-tax, income adjusted for inflation
rose 1.1 percent in May from a year earlier, according to
Commerce Department figures.  Wage rigidity -- a phenomenon in which employers are unable
to lower wages to respond to a downturn even if they want to --
has been a feature in all three of the recessions since 1986,
according to the researchers.  In the 2007-2009 contraction, “the main difference is that
the depth of the most recent recession has intensified the
impact,” they said in the report.  The inability to cut pay may also have prompted employers
to fire more workers than they typically would to contain costs,
causing the unemployment rate to spike unusually high, the study
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
