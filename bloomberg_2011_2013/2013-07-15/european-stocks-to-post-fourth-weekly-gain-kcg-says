European stocks may post their
fourth weekly rally as a momentum indicator signaled further
gains for the the region’s  benchmark equity gauge , a strategist
at KCG Europe Ltd. said.  The moving average convergence-divergence line, or MACD, on
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, climbed above zero on July 12,
suggesting that a bullish trend is strengthening, Ioan Smith,
KCG strategist in  London , said.  “The MACD offered a buy signal last week by crossing back
above the zero line,” Smith said. “It suggests there may be
some short-term upside. In a quiet tape devoid of catalysts,
signals like this tend to garner more attention. We will look
for a volume increase to confirm the move over the next few
days.”  The benchmark Stoxx 600 last week rallied 2.7 percent, its
biggest gain since the week ending April 26, as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  backed sustained monetary stimulus for
the world’s largest economy. The gauge rose 0.4 percent to
297.36 at 2:04 p.m. in London.  “I would expect, maybe, a week or so of gains before we’ll
look for a change in momentum,” said Smith.  “We have a couple
of things which could impact sentiment over the next couple of
weeks.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study graphs
to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
