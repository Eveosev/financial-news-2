Palm oil  slumped to the lowest in
more than two months as exports dropped amid speculation that a
slowdown in China’s economy may damp demand from the world’s
second-largest consumer after  India .  The contract for September delivery retreated as much as
1.8 percent to 2,260 ringgit ($710) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the lowest level for the most-active
futures since May 7, and ended the morning trading session at
2,267 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Palm for local physical delivery
in August was at 2,320 ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shipments from Malaysia, the second-largest producer, fell
23 percent to 547,857 in the first 15 days of July from same
period in June, surveyor Intertek said today. China’s  economy 
slowed for a second quarter as gains in factory output
decelerated, and is at risk of weakening further as the
government reins in credit expansion to reduce the danger of a
financial crisis.  “With this general pessimism about demand for crude palm
oil, prices are trending down,” said Sim Han Qiang, an analyst
at Phillip Futures Pte in Singapore. “If  China’s economy  is
likely to slow going forward, that will also translate to weaker
demand for crude palm oil. We believe the trend is still down
and futures are likely to test 2,200 ringgit.”  Malaysia left the tax on crude palm oil exports unchanged
for a sixth month in August at 4.5 percent, according to a
Customs Department statement.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December declined 0.8 percent
to 45.37 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for delivery in November gained 0.2 percent to $12.6025
a bushel. Refined palm oil for January delivery fell as much as
2.8 percent to 5,656  yuan  ($922) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , the lowest price for the most-active contract since
September 2009, while soybean oil for delivery in the same month
dropped 1.1 percent to 7,204 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
