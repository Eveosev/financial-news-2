  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest U.S.
solar-panel manufacturer by shipments, plans to build a $370
million photovoltaic power plant in the Atacama Desert in
northern Chile.  First Solar applied for permits for the 162.4-megawatt Luz
del Norte project, the Tempe, Arizona-based company said today
in a filing with Chileâ€™s environmental licensing agency Servicio
de Evaluacion Ambiental. Work is expected to start in June 2014.  The project will produce about 480,000 gigawatt-hours of
electricity a year, according to the filing. It will have about
1.7 million solar panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
