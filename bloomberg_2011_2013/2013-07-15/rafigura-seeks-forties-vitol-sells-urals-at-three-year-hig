Trafigura Beheer BV failed to buy
North Sea Forties crude at the highest price in more than five
months. Vitol Group sold Russian Urals in northwest Europe at
the biggest differential to Dated Brent in at least three years.  India ’s Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Mangalore Refinery &
Petrochemicals Ltd. bought via two tenders three cargoes of 1
million barrels each of West African crude from Total SA and
Exxon Mobil Corp., said five traders who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  North Sea  Trafigura sought to buy Forties without success for loading
Aug. 6 to Aug. 8 at 75 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. This compares with a
premium of 40 cents for its bid on July 12 and is the highest
since Jan. 29.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA didn’t manage to buy Forties for
the same period at 65 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
survey showed.  Total was unable to buy two cargoes of Forties at a premium
of 70 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, according to the survey. It
bid for shipments loading on Aug. 6 to Aug. 8 and July 29 to
July 31.  There were no bids or offers for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was unchanged at a premium of 47 cents to Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $108.81 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $108.52 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $107.90 at the same time today, a discount of 91
cents to August.  Forties cargo F0715 will be deferred by two days to load on
July 23 to July 25, according to three people with knowledge of
the matter.  Forties shipment F0720 will be exported on Aug. 6 to Aug.
8, eight days later than originally scheduled, said two people
who participate in the market.  Loadings of Flotta crude for August will be unchanged at
one cargo of 600,000 barrels for Aug. 15 to Aug. 17, a shipping
schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals for loading July 27
to July 31 to Statoil ASA at 55 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam,  according to the
survey. This is the highest traded price in at least three
years.  Urals in the Mediterranean was stable at a premium of 77
cents a barrel to Dated Brent, the highest since at least July
1991, when Bloomberg started tracking the data. The  grade  was
unchanged at 47 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, the data showed.  Two free positions of Urals for loading in July remained
unallocated, said two traders who participate in the market,
asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  One slot is of 140,000 tons for loading on July 22 to July
23 from Novorossiysk on the Black Sea and the other is of
100,000 tons for loading on July 16 to July 17 from Ust-Luga on
the Baltic Sea, they said.  Should these two slots remain unassigned, exports from
Novorossiysk in July will be revised downward by 140,000 tons to
2.792 million tons while Ust-Luga loadings will be revised
downward to 1.8 million tons from 1.9 million, according to a
shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  OMV AG resumed pumping oil in Libya on July 12, the company
said in an e-mailed statement. The company said on July 9 that
most of its production in the country had been shut-in since
June 25.  West Africa  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe was priced at $2.50 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, unchanged from the previous session, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Bharat Petroleum bought one cargo of Qua Iboe for loading
in August from Total, while Mangalore Refinery purchased one
shipment of Angolan Dalia crude for Aug. 16 to Aug. 31 loading
from Total and one lot of Angolan Hungo crude for Sept. 1 to
Sept. 15 from Exxon, according to traders.  Bharat Petroleum booked supertanker Gulf Sheba for loading
Aug. 6 from West Africa to West Coast of India, at a cost of
$3.65 million, according to five tanker reports, including one
from Athens-based Optima Shipbrokers. One very large crude
carrier typically holds 2 million barrels of crude.  The company last month bought 1 million barrels each of Qua
Iboe and Akpo crudes for August loading from China International
United Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Unipec, via a
tender.  To contact the reporters on this story:
