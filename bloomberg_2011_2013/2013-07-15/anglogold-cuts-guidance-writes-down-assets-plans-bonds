AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world’s
third-biggest producer of the metal, cut its output forecast for
this year and will write down the value of assets by as much as
$2.6 billion after reducing gold-price forecasts.  The company will produce 4 million to 4.1 million ounces,
less than the 4.1 million to 4.4 million ounces previously
expected, Johannesburg-based AngloGold said in a statement
yesterday. It will take an impairment of $2.2 billion to $2.6
billion after revaluing its assets and ore stockpiles.  “Over the remainder of 2013, all business plans,
associated reserves and resources will be revised and optimized
to reflect lower gold-price assumptions, associated mitigation
measures and management initiatives to improve margins and cash
flow,” the company said.  Gold mining companies have announced at least $11 billion
in charges during the past two months, after the precious
metal’s steepest quarterly drop in at least 90 years. Barrick
Gold Corp., the biggest producer, said June 28 it expects to
write down the value of a delayed Latin American project by as
much as $5.5 billion and is reviewing other assets for potential
charges.  Australia ’s Newcrest Mining Ltd. said last month it
might take a charge of as much as A$6 billion ($5.5 billion).  Investor Meetings  AngloGold fell 3.3 percent to 121.40 rand at 9:15 a.m. in
Johannesburg today, heading for the lowest closing level since
April 23, 2001. Gold declined 23 percent in the second quarter,
reaching a 34-month low of $1,180.50 an ounce in  London  on June
28.  The company produced 935,000 ounces of gold at cash costs
of $900 to $920 an ounce in the second quarter.  David Haughton, a Toronto-based analyst at BMO Capital
Markets, had estimated output of 939,000 ounces at costs of
about $872 an ounce, he said in a note yesterday. BMO is
expecting 3.9 million ounces at about $845 an ounce for the full
year, he wrote.  AngloGold has asked Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and
Goldman Sachs Inc. to arrange meetings with bond investors in
 Europe  and the U.S. as the company plans to sell dollar-denominated debt in 2013, it said in a separate statement.  A possible notes offering may be considered to refinance
near-term debt, Haughton said.  Yields Fall  Yields on AngloGold’s dollar bonds due in August 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.15 percent in
London yesterday, paring the advance this year to 236 basis
points. That compares with an increase of 171 basis points in
the average yield for emerging-market metals and mining
companies to 6.85 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
indexes.  Moody’s Investors Service cut AngloGold’s debt rating by
one step to to Baa3, the lowest investment grade, last week.  Gold operators in  South Africa , the world’s sixth-biggest
producer of the metal, have faced demands from some labor unions
to at least double pay of entry-level workers, even after the
price slump.  AngloGold also said Anthony O’Neill has resigned as an
 executive director  after five years at the company. O’Neill, who
leaves July 19, was acting joint interim chief executive officer
earlier this year before Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan replaced
Anglo American Plc-bound  Mark Cutifani  as CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
