(Corrects share price in fifth paragraph of story published
yesterday.)  AgFeed USA LLC (FEED) , a producer of hogs
and supplier of hog feed to China, filed for  bankruptcy
protection , citing a dispute with Hormel Foods Corp. that led to
a default on its debt.  The Chapter 11 petition filed in Wilmington, Delaware,
today listed as much as $500 million in  assets  and debt as high
as $100 million. The company had a disagreement with Hormel,
which led to arbitration and a default under one of its loan
agreements, according to the filing. Also filing was parent
AgFeed Industries Inc.  “A sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
AgFeed USA” is the best way to reorganize, and the company
already has an offer for $79 million, Chief Restructuring
Officer Keith Maib said in court papers. It plans to hold an
auction to test for higher offers in bankruptcy.  AgFeed operates through units in China and the British
Virgin Islands and has 21 commercial farms and five feed mills
that produce more than a quarter-million hogs a year, according
to the filing.  AgFeed Industries rose 2 cents to 7 cents today in over-the-counter  trading , compared with an all-time high of $20.94 in
May 2008.  The case is In re AgFeed USA, 13-bk-11761,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
