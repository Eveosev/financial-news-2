Intelsat SA (I) , the largest issuer of
speculative-grade bonds in the U.S. this year, is seeking to
reduce debt that will help boost equity returns, according to
Chief Financial Officer Michael McDonnell.  The world’s biggest satellite services business may cut its
debt relative to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization to as little as 5 times from 7.5 times over the
next few years, McDonnell said during a July 11 telephone
interview. The Luxembourg-based company has sold $6.1 billion of
notes this year to pare borrowing costs.  Intelsat raised $572.5 million in a U.S. initial public
offering and through the sale of preferred convertible shares in
April in an effort to decrease its $15.3 billion in bond and
loan  obligations , according to Dianne VanBeber, a company
spokeswoman. This year’s debt offerings will diminish annual
interest payments by $240 million, McDonnell said.  “We’ve got no significant maturities until 2018, largely
as a result of the IPO we did and refinancing activity,”
McDonnell said. “There are significant returns for our equity
investors as we delever the business.”  A target for repayment may be a $3.2 billion term loan B
due April 2018, which can be prepaid at 101 cents on the dollar
now and at par after Oct. 1, according to McDonnell. A $500
million note due November 2019 may be refinanced or repaid at
104.25 cents on the dollar in November 2014, when it can be
called, he said.  Equity Value  By retiring the bonds and loans “you’re using the free
cash flow of the business to retire debt that sits in front of
equity, thus growing the value of the equity,” McDonnell said.  Intelsat, which sold 19.3 million shares for $18 each in
its April 18 IPO, had leverage of 7.94 times as of March 31, the
highest among telecommunications services companies in the U.S.
or Western Europe, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
average ratio among companies in the industry was 3.1 times.  The $500 million of 8.5 percent notes due 2019 traded at
110 cents on the dollar July 11 to yield 6.53 percent, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  The company’s shares  fell  1.19 percent to $20.59 at 11:08
a.m. in  New York . They’ve gained 14.6 percent since the
offering.  Intelsat was established in 1964 as the first commercial
satellite-services provider, according to its  website . A group
of private-equity funds led by BC Partners Ltd. and Silver Lake
Management LLC acquired Intelsat in a 2008 buyout that valued
the satellite operator’s equity at about $5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
