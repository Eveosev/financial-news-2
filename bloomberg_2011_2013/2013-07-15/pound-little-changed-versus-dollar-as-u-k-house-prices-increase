The pound was little changed against
the dollar before the  Bank of England  publishes the minutes of
its most recent policy meeting later this week.  Sterling erased a decline versus the greenback after a
report showed U.S. retail sales increased less than economists
forecast last month. It was also little changed against euro as
U.K. home sellers raised asking prices to a  record . Benchmark
10-year gilt yields were about five basis points from the lowest
level in almost four weeks. The central-bank minutes, due on
July 17, will reveal how policy makers voted at Governor  Mark Carney ’s first gathering.  “The minutes will be absolutely critical because everyone
is going be looking at how Carney voted,” said Kathleen Brooks,
research director in  London  at Forex.com, a unit of online
currency-trading company  Gain Capital Holdings Inc. (GCAP)  “If he
voted for further bond purchases, we are probably going to see a
decline in the pound. The market is recalibrating its view on
the fact that Carney is likely to be a dovish force at the Bank
of England.”  The pound was at $1.5087 as of 4:31 p.m. London time after
falling as much as 0.5 percent. It declined to $1.4814 on July
9, the lowest level since June 2010. The U.K. currency was at
86.40 pence per euro. It reached 86.94 pence on July 11, the
weakest since March 13.  Brooks forecast the pound will drop to as low as $1.48 over
the next three months.  Home prices  sought climbed for a seventh month, increasing
0.3 percent to an average 253,658 pounds, London-based property-website operator Rightmove Plc said.  Pound Pares  U.S. retail sales increased 0.4 percent following a 0.5
percent growth in May, Commerce Department figures showed in
 Washington . The median forecast of 82 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 0.8 percent advance.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee kept its
asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds and held its
benchmark rate at a  record-low  0.5 percent on July 4. The
central bank signaled in a statement that followed the decision
that it will keep borrowing costs low for longer than investors
had expected.  The U.K. economy will expand 1.1 percent this year,
compared with an April forecast of 0.6 percent, the Ernst &
Young Item Club said in a report to be published tomorrow.
Growth will strengthen to 2.2 percent next year and 2.6 percent
in 2015, both faster than previous estimates, it said.  Bets Increase  Futures traders increased their bets that the British pound
will decline against the  U.S. dollar , figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the pound compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 34,259 on July 9,
compared with net shorts of 31,324 a week earlier.  The pound has weakened 2 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar rose 6.4 percent and the
euro gained 5.1 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield was little changed at 2.34 percent.
It reached 2.29 percent on July 12, the  least  since June 20. The
price of the 1.75 percent security due in September 2022 was
95.21.  U.K. 10-year gilts  yielded  197 basis points more than two-year securities. The average in the past 10 years was 101 basis
points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BOE Guidance  Carney is due to announce next month how officials will use
forward guidance when setting policy after the central bank gave
a signal on rates on July 4. That kind of policy signal and the
improvement in the economy will probably widen the gap between
short-dated and long-maturity yields further, said Deutsche Bank
AG.  “Guidance in any form arguably implies a steeper curve, as
the front end could be anchored, while terminal rates can be
repriced,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategist Soniya Sadeesh in an
e-mailed note dated July 12. “We maintain two- and 10-year
steepeners.”  Gilts handed investors a loss of 2.5 percent this year
through July 12, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds declined 0.8 percent and Treasuries fell 2.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
