Colombia’s peso rose the most since
November as a slowdown in U.S. retail sales eased concern that
the  Federal Reserve  will slow bond buying that has boosted
demand for emerging-market securities.  The currency gained 0.9 percent to 1,886.98 per  U.S. dollar 
today, extending its gain in the past five days to 2.1 percent,
the most among major Latin America currencies.  The peso has beaten its peers since Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  said last week that the government will delay
a rule encouraging pension funds to shift assets abroad. U.S.
retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month, half as fast as
economists predicted, boosting speculation Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will tone down talk of ending stimulus when he
addresses Congress on July 17-18.  “The whole of emerging markets rallied today,” said
 Alejandro Cuadrado , a currency strategist at  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in New York, who recommends that investors
buy the peso after the pension fund rule was shelved. “We’re
positive in the short term, but today was almost too much of a
move. We have to be careful. We favored the peso but weren’t
looking for a massive rally.”  The pension fund rule change might have resulted in $5
billion of assets moving out of Colombian pesos, Cuadrado said.  Strategists at Nomura Holdings Inc. today also recommended
taking short-term positions in the Colombian peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
