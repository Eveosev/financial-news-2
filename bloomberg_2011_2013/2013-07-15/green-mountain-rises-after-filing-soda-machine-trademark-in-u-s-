Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) 
advanced the most in more than two months after filing a U.S.
trademark application for a soda machine that could compete with
those made by  Israel ’s  SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA)   The shares  rose  6.3 percent to $73.19 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest gain since May 9. The maker of Keurig brand
single-serve pods and machines has risen 77 percent this year,
while the S&P Midcap 400 Index has added 20 percent.  Green Mountain has been trying to combat private-label K-Cup competition with new beverage brewing machines. Earlier this
month, it introduced a commercial grade brewing system that can
make a 64-ounce pot of coffee. Last year, the Waterbury,
Vermont-based company started selling the Rivo brewer that makes
cappuccinos and lattes.  The trademark was filed by  Green Mountain ’s Keurig division
on July 3, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark website.
The machine would make still, carbonated and sparkling
beverages, as well as soda.  “We are not going to comment on this specific trademark,”
Suzanne DuLong, a spokeswoman for Green Mountain, said in an e-mail. “As we continue to grow, we are likely to seek any number
of trademarks.”  SodaStream International, based in Airport City, Israel,
makes home soda machines sold in the U.S. The shares rose 1.5
percent to $60.39 today and have gained 35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
