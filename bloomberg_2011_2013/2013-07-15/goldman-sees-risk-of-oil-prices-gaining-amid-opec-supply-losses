Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said price
risks for  Brent crude  in the second half of the year have
changed “to the upside” amid production losses in some OPEC
nations and political threats to supply.  Reductions in output from Libya, Iraq and Nigeria have the
potential to limit availability, the bank said today in an e-mailed report. Even so, increased production outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will probably keep
global markets adequately supplied this year, said Goldman,
which forecasts Brent crude to average $105 a barrel in the
second half. Brent futures traded at about $108 a barrel in
London today.  “The risks have shifted more to the upside over the short
term due to the possibility of continuing OPEC production
shortfalls and increased geopolitical risks,” Jeff Currie, the
head of commodities research in  New York , said in the report.  OPEC output fell by 370,000 barrels a day in June amid
unrest and violence in Libya, Iraq and Nigeria, the
 International Energy Agency  said in its most recent monthly
market report on July 11. The losses come just as increasing
seasonal demand for motor fuels is pushing up global oil
consumption, Goldman said. OPEC supplies about 40 percent of the
world’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
