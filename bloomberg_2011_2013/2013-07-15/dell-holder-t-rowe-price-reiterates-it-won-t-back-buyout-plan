Dell Inc. (DELL)  investor T. Rowe Price
Group Inc. said it won’t support the proposed buyout of the
personal-computer maker by founder  Michael Dell  and Silver Lake
Management LLC, reiterating its opposition ahead of this week’s
deadline to vote on the deal.  “We continue to believe the proposed buyout does not
reflect the value of Dell,” T. Rowe Chief Investment Officer
Brian Rogers said in an e-mailed statement. “We do not intend
to support the offer as put forward.” The firm owns 71.9
million  shares  of Dell, or 4.1 percent of the company’s
outstanding stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shareholders are set to vote by July 18 on the $24.4
billion proposal to take the company private. The buyout group
faces a challenge from activist investor  Carl Icahn , who says
the $13.65-a-share offer is too low because the company is still
a strong contender in the PC market.  Dell  shares  slipped 1.3 percent to $13.15 at the close in
New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
