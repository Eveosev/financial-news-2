Acciona SA (ANA) , a renewable energy
company that’s built more than 70 desalination plants globally,
was awarded a water contract to supply 200,000 residents of
southern Spain’s Jaen region. No terms were disclosed.  The operation and maintenance contract is for the Martos
drinking water treatment plant and Quiebrajano and Viboras
reservoirs. The Martos plant is able to treat brackish water
needed for maintaining Viboras reservoir salinity levels,
Acciona Agua said today in a website statement.  Last week, Spain cut profit for renewable energy companies
and the electric grid operator to help curb a 4.5 billion-euro
($5.9 billion) deficit forecast for the industry this year.
Alcobendas, Spain-based Acciona, the owner of more than 4
gigawatts of wind farms in Spain, slid as much as 8.5 percent
today in Madrid trading to its lowest since last August.  Acciona Agua also operates the sewer system for 50 percent
of the Madrid regional territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
