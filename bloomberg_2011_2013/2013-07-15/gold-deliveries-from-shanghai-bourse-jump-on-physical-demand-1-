Physical gold delivered to buyers by
 China ’s largest bullion bourse in the first half of this year
almost matched the entire amount taken from its vaults in 2012,
and was more than double the country’s annual production.  The Shanghai Gold Exchange supplied 1,098 metric tons in
the six months through June, compared with 1,139 tons for the
whole of last year, according to data from the bourse today.
Output in China, the world’s largest gold producer, reached a
record 403 tons last year, according to the China Gold
Association.  The surge in deliveries underscores buying interest in
China, which may pass  India  as the largest bullion consumer as
early as this year after the government in New Delhi raised
import taxes while regulators in Beijing made investing in the
metal easier. Miners, smelters and refineries are required to
sell gold via the  Shanghai  bourse, the only state-sanctioned
marketplace for spot bullion in China.  “The number shows demand for bullion as an underlying
asset in China that investors here remained big buyers of the
physical commodity this year,” said Fu Peng, a commodity
strategist in Beijing at Galaxy Futures Co, a brokerage
controlled by the country’s sovereign wealth fund.  Bullion lost 23 percent last quarter amid speculation that
the Federal Reserve would curb its asset-buying program as the
U.S. economy recovers. Bullion may drop to $1,050 an ounce over
12 months as demand for the metal as a safe haven wanes, UBS AG
said on July 4. Citigroup lowered its 2013 gold estimate to
$1,358 an ounce.  Import Rules  The gold exchange was set up in 2002 and under the
jurisdiction of the central bank. Commercial banks that are
qualified to import gold are also required to sell their
shipments into the bourse.  Bullion of  99.99 percent purity  on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange fell 27 percent in the first six months and was at
259.70  yuan  a gram ($1,315.93 an ounce) today. In  London , gold
for immediate delivery traded at $1,282.89 an ounce at 5:55 p.m.
Shanghai time, 23 percent lower this year.  Still, monthly gold deliveries are now below the record 236
tons in April, having eased to 224 tons in May and 180 tons in
June.  “Investors aren’t inclined to rush to buy gold the way
they did to the abrupt price drop in mid-April,” said Long
Ling, an analyst at Industrial Futures Co. in Shanghai.  Volume Peak  Trading of spot bullion of 99.99 percent purity on the
Shanghai exchange exceeded 20 tons every day between April 16
and May 6. That’s more than four times the daily average in
2012. Volume reached a record 43.27 metric tons on April 22 and
climbed above 20 tons for two days through June 21, according to
the exchange.  China’s net gold imports from Hong Kong increased 40
percent in May from a month earlier as the metal’s deepening
slump continued to attract bargain hunters to bullion shops.  Mainland buyers purchased 106 tons during the month, after
deducting flows from China into Hong Kong, compared with 76 tons
a month earlier, according to calculations by Bloomberg based on
data from the Hong Kong government. Inbound shipments including
scrap were 127 tons, from 75.6 tons a year earlier and 126.1
tons in April.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
