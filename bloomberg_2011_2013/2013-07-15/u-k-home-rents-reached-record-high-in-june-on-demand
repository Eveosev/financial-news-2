The cost of renting a U.K. home
climbed to an all-time high in June, outpacing inflation and
tenant earnings, as more people sought a residence, according to
HomeLet.  The average rent was 811 pounds ($1,220), 5.1 percent more
than a year ago and 3 percent higher than the previous month,
Homelet, the U.K’s largest reference checking and rentals
insurance company, said today in a statement. In a separate
report, London-based property-website operator Rightmove Plc
said U.K. home sellers raised asking prices for a seventh month
to a record in July.  “The ability to become a home owner will still be a long-term plan for many,” said Andy Richards, Lincoln, England-based
HomeLet’s business development director. “As a result, the
private rented sector will continue to grow.”  There’s typically an increase in the number of people
seeking to rent a new home at this time of year, particularly
students who move into costlier properties, Richards said. That
pushes average rents up, he said.  Tenants’ average earnings increased by 0.8 percent to
28,000 pounds during the year, according to HomeLet.  A modest rented home is beyond the reach of a third of all
lower-income households in Britain, the  Resolution Foundation ,
an advocacy group for low- to middle-income families, said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
