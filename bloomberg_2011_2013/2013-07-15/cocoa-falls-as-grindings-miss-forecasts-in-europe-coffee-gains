Cocoa futures fell the most in a
week after processors in  Europe , the biggest consuming region,
reported slower growth in bean demand than analysts forecast.
Coffee and sugar advanced, while cotton fell. Orange juice was
little changed.  Grinding of  cocoa beans  rose 6.1 percent in the second
quarter to 310,408 metric tons from 292,551 tons a year earlier,
the European Cocoa Association said today. Analysts and traders
expected an 8.3 percent increase, a Bloomberg survey showed. In
a separate report, the German Confectionery Industry said
processing dropped 11 percent in the period to 75,612 tons.
Prices are down 18 percent since reaching a 10-month high in
September.  “Grinding markets missed expectations, and that is
weighing on the market,” Sterling Smith, a futures trading
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The German figures were noticeably lower, and that
was troubling. Cocoa will see less growth in the future.”  Cocoa for September delivery slid 0.6 percent to $2,222 a
ton at 10:32 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , heading for
the biggest decline since July 8.  Prices also fell on speculation that rain in  Ivory Coast ,
the world’s biggest producer, “will lead to a favorable crop,”
Smith said.  Parts of West Africa, including cocoa growing regions of
Ivory Coast,  Nigeria  and Cameroon, had thunderstorms over the
weekend, with daily rainfall ranging from 0.2 inches (0.5
centimeters) to 0.7 inches, through yesterday, according to
AccuWeather Inc. Dry weather can hurt crop development.  Speculator Holdings  Hedge funds  and other large speculators decreased their
net-long positions, or bets prices will rise, by 11 percent in
the week ended July 9 to 31,761 contracts, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That’s the fourth
straight decline and the least-bullish since April 23.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery advanced 2.2
percent to $1.22 a pound on ICE.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery rose 0.4 percent to
16.12 cents a pound, heading for the first gain in four
sessions. The price touched 16.03 cents on July 12, the lowest
since July 1, 2010. This year, the commodity dropped 18 percent
through last week.  Cotton futures for December delivery declined 0.3 percent
to 84.84 cents a pound. The price climbed 13 percent this year
through last week.  Orange-juice  futures for September delivery was up less
than 0.1 percent at $1.3925 a pound, after fluctuating between
gains and losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
