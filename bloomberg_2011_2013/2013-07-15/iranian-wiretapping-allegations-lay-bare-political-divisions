The political divisions facing
Iranian President-elect Hassan Rohani were laid bare at a heated
debate in  Iran ’s parliament over a lawmaker’s allegation his
office was bugged.  Ali Mohatari’s charge shunted aside other orders of
business when lawmakers reconvened after an 18-day summer
recess, the  Etemaad  newspaper reported today. Several
legislators said the Intelligence Ministry should address the
accusations. Another warned that foreign media would use the
episode to illustrate divisions among Iran’s ruling elite,
according to Etemaad and  Shargh , another Tehran-based newspaper.  Rohani, who takes office Aug. 3, has vowed to work to
bridge rifts between top officials that deepened under incumbent
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Wiretapping is perceived by the Iranian public as
widespread. Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi hasn’t
immediately commented on Motahari’s wiretapping claim.  Motahari is critical of Ahmadinejad and in 2011 spearheaded
a petition to summon him to parliament for questioning over
allegedly illegal acts including violations of budgetary laws
and mismanagement of the economy.  He wrote on his website July 13 that his office director
noticed changes in the room and new paint on part of the wall,
then dug out audio and video recorders from behind the air
conditioner’s pipe.  “By law, tapping may be carried out on a judge’s order in
critical cases, like the hunt for a murderer,” Motahari wrote
on his  website . “When this is how a well-known lawmaker is
treated, I wonder how ordinary Iranians are oppressed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
