Units of  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , the
world’s largest theme-park operator, tentatively settled a
lawsuit alleging they violated U.S. antitrust law by agreeing
with competitors not to recruit one another’s employees.  Animation studio  Pixar  and visual-effects specialist
 Lucasfilm Ltd.  told U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose,
California, they agreed to settle all claims, according to court
papers filed July 12.  “The parties anticipate completing documentation of the
proposed settlement and presenting it for the court’s
consideration in the near future,” plaintiffs’ lawyers said in
a letter to Koh.  A group of high-tech employees sued the companies
complaining that industry agreements not to pursue cross-hires
amounted to a conspiracy “to fix and suppress the compensation
of their employees,” according to an amended complaint filed on
Sept. 13, 2011.  Zenia Mucha , a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail and a voice-mail
message seeking comment on the settlement.  The case is In Re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation,
11-cv-02509, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
