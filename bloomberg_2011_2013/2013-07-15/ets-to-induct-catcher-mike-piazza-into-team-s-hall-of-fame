The  New York Mets  will induct former
catcher  Mike Piazza  into the team’s Hall of Fame on Sept. 29,
which is Fan Appreciation Day, the franchise said in a
statement.  The Mets are slated to play the Milwaukee Brewers that day
at 1:10 p.m.  New York  time at Citi Field.  Piazza, who was a seven-time All-Star with the team, hit
220 of his Major League-leading 427 career home runs at the
position with the Mets, the team said. Piazza ranks first in
team history with a .542 slugging percentage and is third in
runs batted in with 655, the Mets said.  He set a team single-season record with 124 RBI and 40
homers in 1999, and had 38 home runs and 113 runs batted in the
following year as the Mets qualified for the playoffs in back-to-back years, the team said. The most recent former Mets player
inducted into the franchise’s Hall of Fame was reliever John Franco last year, and Piazza will join 25 other members
including five Mets from the team’s 1986  World Series 
championship, the team said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
