Kenya  Airways Ltd., sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, headed for the biggest gain in a
month after a technical signal indicated the company’s stock may
have been oversold.  The company’s shares, the third-worst  performer  in Kenya
this year, climbed for a second day, gaining 1.6 percent to 9.65
shillings by 2:11 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the most on a
closing basis since June 17.  Kenya Airways’ 14-day relative-strength  index  fell to 28.5
on July 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A level
below 30 signals to some technical analysts that the stock is
oversold and set for a rise. The RSI rose to 37.5 today.  The carrier posted a loss of 7.86 billion shillings ($90
million) in the 12 months through March, compared with a profit
of 1.66 billion shillings a year earlier, it said on June 14.
Kenya Airways failed to boost passenger numbers and revenue was
eroded by a stronger shilling, it said. The shares retreated 15
percent this year, while the FTSE NSE Kenya 25 Index gained 28
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
