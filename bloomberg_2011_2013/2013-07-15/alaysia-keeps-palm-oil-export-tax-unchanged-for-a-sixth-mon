Malaysia left the tax on crude  palm
oil  exports unchanged for a sixth month in August as the world’s
second-largest producer seeks to boost shipments amid falling
demand. Futures dropped to a two-month low.  Shipments will be taxed at 4.5 percent next month as the
reference price was set at 2,383.84 ringgit ($748) a metric ton,
within the minimum band for a levy to be applied, according to a
Customs Department statement. The tariff was zero in January and
February before being raised to 4.5 percent in March.  Futures of the tropical oil, which competes with  soybean
oil  in food and biofuels uses, have tumbled 27 percent in the
past year as production outpaced demand, boosting inventories in
 Malaysia  to a record in December. The Malaysian government said
in October it would cut the export tax to between 4.5 percent
and 8.5 percent from about 23 percent to help trim the
stockpiles and compete with  Indonesia , the largest producer.  “The low export tax will still be supportive for shipments
if demand is there,” said Alvin Tai, an analyst at RHB
Investment Bank Bhd. “Soybeans have actually started arriving
at their destination markets and that helped to soften demand
for palm.”  Chinese state-owned grain companies bought eight cargoes of
soybean oil that totaled 320,000 tons, four trading executives
with knowledge of the transactions said July 10.  China  is the
largest cooking oil consumer. South American soybean exports
rose to a record in May, even as rain hampered loading and
strikes in Brazil and  Argentina  curbed shipments, Oil World
reported June 11.  Exports Drop  Palm oil for delivery in September fell as much as 1.8
percent to 2,260 ringgit a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest price for the most-active futures since May
7, and was at 2,266 ringgit at 12:12 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.
