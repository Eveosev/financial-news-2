The  Metropolitan Transportation
Authority  plans to use bonds designed to help New York City’s
subway operator guard against storm surge damage after suffering
$4.8 billion in wreckage from  Hurricane Sandy .  The largest U.S. transit agency will buy protection from
MetroCat Re Ltd., a Bermuda-based special-purpose insurer that
plans to issue the three-year securities, Standard & Poor’s
analysts led by Gary Martucci wrote in a July 12 report. The
bonds have a preliminary rating of BB- (sf).  Sandy struck New York on Oct. 29, triggering a tidal surge
that inundated rail stations and tunnels. It coated electrical
and communications equipment with corrosive saltwater and
destroyed Manhattan’s newest subway stop.  Bond investors would stand to lose money if future storm
surges exceed certain thresholds that Sandy would have breached,
triggering payments to the MTA’s First Mutual Transportation
Assurance Co., according to the report.  Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the MTA, said he couldn’t
immediately comment on a potential bond sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
