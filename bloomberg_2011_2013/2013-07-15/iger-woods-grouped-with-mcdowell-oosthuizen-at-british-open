(4:45 a.m. Eastern time) in the second round.  Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy, No. 2 in the world
ranking, is paired with American  Phil Mickelson , who won last
weekend’s Scottish Open, and Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama for the
first two days.  Defending champion Ernie Els of South Africa, the winner
the last time the British Open was played at Muirfield in 2002,
will play with U.S. Open winner Justin Rose of England and
