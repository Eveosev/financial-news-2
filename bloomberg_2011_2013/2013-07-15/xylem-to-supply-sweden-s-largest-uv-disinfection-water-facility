Xylem Inc. (XYL) , the ITT Corp. spinoff
whose pumps helped clean tunnels flooded by  Hurricane Sandy , won
a contract to provide ultraviolet drinking-water treatment  for
the largest project of its type in Sweden.  The White Plains, New York-based company gave no terms in
today’s statement on the agreement with Sydvatten AB Waterworks
in the Scania region of southern Sweden to help deliver treated
drinking water to 900,000 people in 16 municipalities. Xylem’s
shares have risen 26 percent the past year compared with a 21
percent gain by the 50-member S&P Global Water Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
