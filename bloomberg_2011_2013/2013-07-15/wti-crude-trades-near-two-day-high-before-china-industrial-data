West Texas Intermediate crude
declined after a thirdly weekly increase amid evidence that
economic expansion in  China , the world’s second-largest oil
consumer, is slowing.  Futures retreated as much as 1.1 percent in  New York .
China’s growth dropped to 7.5 percent in the second quarter from
7.7 percent in the first, as factory output and investment in
fixed assets decelerated, data from the National Bureau of
Statistics in Beijing showed. Crude slipped even as Islamists in
 Egypt , home to the  Suez Canal , called for mass protests today to
demand the reinstatement of ousted President Mohamed Mursi.  “China’s growth is well below the Formula-One speed seen
in the pre-financial-crisis times,” said Michael Poulsen, an
analyst at Global Risk Management in Middelfart,  Denmark , who
predicts  Brent crude  may rebound to $112 a barrel this month.
“The data does indeed weigh on prices, but I would estimate it
would not be enough to counter the current geopolitical
jitters.”  WTI for August delivery fell as much as $1.19 to $104.76 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $104.92 at 1:34 p.m. London time. The
volume of all futures traded was 7.9 percent below the 100-day
average. The contract climbed $1.04 to $105.95 on July 12,
capping a 13 percent rally over the past three weeks.  Brent for August settlement was at $108.24 a barrel, down
57 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The
more active September future was 54 cents lower at $107.39. The
European benchmark grade was at a premium of $3.33 to WTI. The
spread was $1.99 on July 10, the narrowest based on closing
prices since November 2010.  Chinese Economy  China’s industrial production increased 8.9 percent in June
from a year earlier, according to the statistics bureau. That’s
below a median 9.1 percent advance forecast by 44 economists in
a Bloomberg survey and also lags a 9.2 percent gain in May.  “The China data is very mixed, and that’s probably why the
response is so muted,” said  Michael McCarthy , a chief market
strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. “There is underlying
fundamental strength in the energy complex. We’re still looking
for a test of that $106-to-$108 zone for West Texas.”  Oil consumption in Asia’s most populous nation surged 11
percent from a year ago to about 10 million barrels a day last
month, the data showed. China will account for 11 percent of
world oil demand this year, with the U.S. taking a 20 percent
share, the  International Energy Agency  forecast in its monthly
oil-market report July 11.  Demand Outlook  Demonstrations in Egypt, which may target military sites,
are building on efforts by the Muslim Brotherhood to squeeze the
army after it pushed Mursi from power on July 3 following a wave
of protests against his rule. A combined 2.24 million barrels a
day of oil were shipped from the  Red Sea  to Europe and  North
America  in 2011 via the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean
pipeline, Energy Department data show.  Hedge funds  increased bullish bets on WTI to the highest
level since May 2011, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said July 12. Money managers boosted their  net-long
positions  on WTI, or wagers that prices will rise, by 6.9
percent to 281,918 futures and options combined in the week to
July 9, the CFTC said in its Commitments of Traders report.  Funds and other money managers raised  bullish bets  on Brent
crude to the highest level in almost five months in the week to
July 9, according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 176,988 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitments
of Traders report. The increase of 28,458 lots, or 19 percent,
is the biggest in percentage terms since November, 2012, and
brings net-long positions to their highest since June 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
