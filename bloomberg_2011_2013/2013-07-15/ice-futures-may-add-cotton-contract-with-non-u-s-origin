IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) ’s U.S.
unit plans to introduce a new cotton contract that may allow
delivery of fiber produced outside the country.  “We are working out the details to reflect the commercial
changes that have taken place,” Ben Jackson, the president of
ICE Futures U.S., said today at an industry conference in  New
York . “The new contract will complement the existing one,”
which is restricted to a U.S.  origin  for supply, he said. He
didn’t provide further details.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest exporter, and  China  is the
top buyer. In April, Antonio Vidal Esteve, the chief executive
officer of cotton operations at Ecom Trading and a former
president of the International Cotton Association, said “there
is still a lot of controversy” involving supply sources and
points of delivery for a contract to complement ICE futures, the
global benchmark.  U.S. exports may be 11 million bales in the 12 months that
start Aug. 1, down from 13.3 million in the current season, the
government said on July 11. Global production may be higher than
forecast last month as output gains in  India , boosting world
stockpiles.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to close at 85.1 cents a pound on ICE in New York. The
price has climbed 13 percent this year. The commodity reached a
record $2.197 in March 2011.  IntercontinentalExchange, the parent of ICE Futures, is
based in Atlanta. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
