MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX)  filed with
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to become a swap-execution facility.  “We are pleased that the CFTC has finalized SEF rules and
we welcome their oversight of our rapidly growing CDS electronic
trading platform,” Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess, said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The news release from the New York-based company didn’t
specify which types of swaps will be offered on the trading
system, which was created under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The
firm has specialized in electronic trading of credit-default
swap indexes and single-name contracts. As of 3 p.m. in  New
York , no documents related to the firm’s applications were
available on the CFTC website.  Congress included rules about how swaps should trade in
Dodd-Frank after the largely unregulated contracts helped fuel
the 2008 credit crisis that led to the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. and a U.S. rescue of New York-based
American International Group Inc. The CFTC finalized the SEF
trading rules in May.  Bloomberg LP, the parent company of  Bloomberg News , and
Tradeweb LLC have applied with the CFTC to become SEFs,
according to the CFTC  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
