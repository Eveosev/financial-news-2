The yield on Indian bonds due 2022
rose to the highest level this month on speculation accelerating
inflation will limit the central bank’s scope to cut  interest
rates  and spur economic growth.  Wholesale prices , the benchmark inflation gauge, rose 4.94
percent in June from a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due
today. That compares with a 4.7 percent gain in May.  Consumer
prices (INFUTOTY)  climbed 9.87 percent last month, versus 9.31 percent in
May, official data showed after trading hours on July 12.  “The rise in consumer-price inflation is a cause for
worry,” said N.S. Venkatesh, the Mumbai-based head of treasury
at state-run IDBI Bank Ltd. “The reduction in interest rates
will happen only when the rupee stabilizes.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 jumped
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.72 percent as
of 10:54 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate climbed 18 basis points last month, the most
since the securities were issued in June 2012.  Reserve Bank  of  India  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left the
repurchase  rate  unchanged at 7.25 percent at a June 17 policy
meeting, citing inflation risks. A report on July 12 showed
India’s industrial production unexpectedly contracted in May,
while the rupee reached a record low of 61.2125 per dollar on
July 8.  “It is only a  durable receding  of inflation that will open
up the space for monetary policy to continue to address risks to
growth,” the RBI said in a statement after last month’s review.
The next meeting is July 30.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, increased eight
basis points to 7.63 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
