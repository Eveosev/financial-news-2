The Bank of  Korea  promoted Suh Young Kyung to become the first female deputy governor in the central
bank’s 63-year history as Governor Kim Choong Soo pushes
diversity in a male-dominated institution.  Suh, 50, currently director for financial markets, will be
responsible for research and economic statistics, the central
bank said in an e-mailed statement in Seoul today.  Park Geun Hye’s rise to become South Korea’s first female
president in February underscored the potential for more women
to take key policy-making roles in the nation. While Suh becomes
one of five deputy governors, she won’t be a member of the
committee which sets interest rates.  When Suh joined the central bank in 1988, officials told
her to wear a schoolgirl-style outfit, Suh said in an interview
this year, adding that she refused.  “They tried to force me to wear the same uniform as high-school graduates while giving money to my male colleagues to buy
a suit every season,” Suh said. “The BOK was entirely
dominated by men when I started.”  In March of this year, the central bank had only three
women among about 230 high-level positions. Governor Kim has
said that he wants to promote diversity. One female has served
on the monetary policy board, Lee Sung Nam, who was a member
from 2004 to 2008 after being appointed from outside the
institution.  Separately, Hur Jae Sung, head of the Bank of Korea
Academy, was appointed today as a deputy governor in charge of
communication and personnel training.  To contact the reporter on this story:
