Hedge funds  and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to their highest level in
almost five months in the week to July 9, according to data from
the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 176,988 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitments
of Traders report. The increase of 28,458 lots, or 19.2 percent,
is the biggest in percentage terms since November, 2012, and
brings net-long positions to their highest since June 18.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 400,082, an
increase of 7.5 percent. It’s the biggest net-short position
since January, 2011, the earliest available point for the data.  Brent rose 3.7 percent in the week to July 9, to $107.81 a
barrel, and traded at $105.26 as of 12:05 p.m. London time.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators and institutional
investors, as well as commercial companies that buy or sell
futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers  reduced net-long positions by 3.2 percent to
254,418 in the week to July 9, according to the data.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  futures
rose a second week, by 66 percent to 42,122 contracts. That’s
the highest since April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
