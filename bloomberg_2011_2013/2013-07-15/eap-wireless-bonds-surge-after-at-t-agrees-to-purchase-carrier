Bonds of  Leap Wireless International
Inc. (LEAP)  surged after  AT&T Inc. (T)  agreed to buy the carrier for $1.2
billion to gain more airwaves and a larger piece of the pay-as-you-go market.  Leap’s $1.6 billion of 7.75 percent notes due October 2020
surged 14 cents to 115.4 cents on the dollar to yield 5.18
percent at 9:11 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The bonds have climbed from a 2013 low of 94 cents on
June 24.  The securities, issued by Leap’s Cricket Communications
 unit  and rated CCC+ by Standard & Poor’s, also have a covenant
that allows investors to receive 101 cents on the dollar in
addition to unpaid interest for their holdings upon certain
change-of-control situations, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier, is ranked
A- by S&P, 10 steps higher than junk-rated Leap’s unsecured
obligations. Verizon Wireless is the nation’s biggest mobile-phone company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
