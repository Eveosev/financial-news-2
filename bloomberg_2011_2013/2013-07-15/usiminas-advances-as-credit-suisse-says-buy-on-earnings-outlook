(Corrects percentage change for Ebitda estimate in fifth
paragraph.)  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest steelmaker by output, rose the most
in three weeks as  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  recommended the stock,
citing its attractive valuation and the potential for improved
profits.  Usiminas, as the company is known,  gained  8.4 percent to
7.10 reais at 11:52 a.m in Sao Paulo. Earlier the stock surged
as much as 9.3 percent to 7.16 reais in the steepest intraday
advance since June 25. The Ibovespa stock benchmark  added  1.1
percent.  After losing 49 percent this year, Usiminas is “a low-hanging fruit,” Credit Suisse analysts including Ivano Westin
wrote in a note to clients today. The investment bank expects
the steelmaker’s gains to increase this year as a weaker
Brazilian currency allows for “possible market share gains”
and higher prices in the domestic market.  The real depreciated 10 percent in the second quarter.  Usiminas trades at 5.9 times estimated earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2014, or a 10
percent discount compared to global peers, according to Credit
Suisse calculations. The bank expects Usiminas’s Ebitda to
increase by 41 percent next year to 1.97 billion reais ($870
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
