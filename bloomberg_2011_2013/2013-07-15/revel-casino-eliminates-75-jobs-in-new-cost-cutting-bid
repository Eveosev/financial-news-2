The Revel Casino-Hotel in  Atlantic
City  eliminated 75 salaried positions as part of a cost-cutting
drive by the resort, which emerged from bankruptcy in May.  The cuts amount to 2 percent of the workforce, the New
Jersey casino said yesterday in a statement.  Revel  also said it
recorded its first profitable week this month, after posting a
loss of $150 million for the 12 months ended March 31.  The casino, Atlantic City’s first new property since 2003,
opened in April 2012 at a cost of $2.6 billion. New Jersey
Governor  Chris Christie  jump-started the project with $261
million in tax incentives as part of an overall plan to revive
the state’s gambling industry, which has lost customers to
neighboring markets.  Revel’s strategy of targeting customers who were not
regular Atlantic City visitors by offering smoke-free gambling
and high-end restaurants flopped, and the property regularly
ended up toward the bottom of the state’s monthly casino
reports. The bankruptcy filing by Revel AC Inc., owner of the
business, reduced its debt burden by more than $1 billion.  Creditors taking over the property replaced senior
management and introduced a marketing campaign last month under
the slogan “Gamblers Wanted.” In addition to adding a smoking
section and more affordable restaurants, Revel is also  refunding 
slot-machine losses over $100 for the month of July to players
who sign up for the property’s loyalty card.  To contact the reporter on this story:
