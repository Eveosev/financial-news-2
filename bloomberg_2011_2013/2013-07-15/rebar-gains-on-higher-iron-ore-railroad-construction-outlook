Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose for the fourth day, buoyed by a rally in  iron ore 
prices and the possibility of further railroad construction.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 1 percent to 3,694 yuan ($601) a metric
ton, and was at 3,686 yuan at 10:41 a.m. local time, headed for
the highest close since April 19. Futures gained for the sixth
week last week.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose for
the fourth day on July 12, adding 1.3 percent to $126.80 a dry
ton, the highest since May 14, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
Investors were encouraged by last week’s news that  China  may
continue its development of railroad construction to absorb some
overcapacity in the steel and cement industries, said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing CIFCO Futures Co. in Tianjin.  “Rebar has established its upward trend, so news about
policy-induced building material demand and any possible cut in
capacity due to environmental concerns will all support
prices,” Wang said.  China’s Gross domestic product rose 7.5 percent in the
April-June period from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said in Beijing today. That matches the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and compares with 7.7
percent in the first three months.  The average  spot price  for rebar in China gained 0.2
percent to 3,409  yuan  a ton on July 12, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
