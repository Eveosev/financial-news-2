Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena
SpA ’s biggest investor, the foundation that has controlled the
Italian bank for 18 years, agreed to remove a cap that limits
other owners’  voting rights  as the lender seeks to raise funds.  Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which owns about 34
percent of Paschi, said it will back the Siena, Italy-based
bank’s proposal to abolish the 4 percent cap to voting rights at
an extraordinary shareholders meeting on July 18, according to a
stock-exchange statement.  Paschi Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Viola and Chairman
 Alessandro Profumo , who were appointed last year to turn the
company around, are seeking to attract new investors in a 1
billion-euro ($1.3 billion) stock sale to help repay state aid.
The pair must also return the bank to profit this year under a
rescue plan to avoid handing over a stake to the government.  Fondazione Monte Paschi was created on Aug. 28, 1995.
Nonprofit foundations were entrusted with  Italy ’s state-owned
lenders as the banks were removed from direct government
ownership. They reduced their stakes over time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
