Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened beyond
10,000 per dollar for the first time since September 2009 as
slowing economic growth in  China  dimmed the outlook for exports
and the current-account deficit.  Government bonds  declined.  China, the No. 1 destination for shipments from the
Southeast Asian nation, reported a second-quarter expansion
today of 7.5 percent compared with 7.7 percent in the prior
three months. Indonesia’s  exports  contracted for a 14th month in
May, giving a trade shortfall of $590 million, official data
show. The current-account gap was a record $24.1 billion in 2012
and $5.3 billion in the first three months of 2013.  The rupiah declined 0.3 percent to 10,023 per dollar as of
3:41 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month non-deliverable forwards fell
0.5 percent to 10,218, having traded weaker than the 10,000
level for more than a month. The rupiah’s current level is in
line with market conditions and economic fundamentals,  Bank
Indonesia  Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said in a mobile-phone
text message today.  “A slowing China will impact other Southeast Asian
countries and further weigh on our exports,” said Leo Rinaldy,
a Jakarta-based economist at PT Mandiri Sekuritas, a unit of the
nation’s largest lender by assets. “Bank Indonesia’s rate hikes
are enough to stem inflation but not to calm markets as external
imbalances pressure the currency.”  The monetary authority raised its  reference rate  by 50
basis points, or 0.50 percentage point, to 6.50 percent on July
11, the biggest increase since 2005, following a 25 basis point
move in June. Bank Indonesia is confident the currency will
stabilize after the changes, which were aimed at boosting
confidence, Warjiyo said.  Rupiah Intervention  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 rose five basis points to 8.21 percent, the highest level
for a benchmark 10-year note since March 2011, according to
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  Indonesia’s central bank sold dollars in the past two to
three months to support the rupiah, Warjiyo said in a July 12
conference call from Jakarta, and its  foreign-exchange reserves 
dropped below $100 billion in June for the first time since
February 2011. Global funds cut their holdings of the nation’s
local-currency sovereign debt by 18.2 trillion rupiah ($1.8
billion) since May 22, when the  Federal Reserve  signaled it may
reduce its monthly bond purchases.  Stability Signs  “The rupiah will likely stabilize near here for the next
couple of months after it converged with the offshore level and
as Bank Indonesia supports it,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia . “Investors are
waiting to get in, but this depends on a number of key things
like improvement on the current-account deficit and more clarity
on the Fed’s policy.”  The rupiah’s onshore spot rate was 1.9 percent stronger
than the one-month non-deliverable forwards, having been at a
premium of as much as 5.2 percent in June, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Non-deliverable forwards are traded offshore and
settled in dollars. The currency is set to decline further to
10,059 by the year-end, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, lost 53 basis points
to 10.71 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
