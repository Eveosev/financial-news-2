Brazil economists raised their 2014
benchmark  interest rate  forecast to the highest all year, as
policy makers work to slow inflation that has curbed consumption
and confidence in the world’s second-biggest emerging market.  Brazil’s central bank will lift the Selic to 9.50 percent
next year, compared with the previous week’s forecast of 9.25
percent, according to a July 12 central bank survey of about 100
analysts published today. Economists maintained their 2013 year-end Selic forecast at 9.25 percent.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is facing renewed
pressure to tame inflation, after rising prices helped spark the
largest street protests in decades last month. Policy makers on
July 10 raised the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points
for the second straight meeting after inflation in June reached
a 20-month high. Price increases running above the central
bank’s target range have slowed consumption and industrial
production, prompting central bankers to signal they will
continue the world’s biggest tightening cycle.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.61 percent at 9:04
a.m. local time. The real weakened by 0.1 percent to 2.2701 per
 U.S. dollar .  Consumer prices rose 6.70 percent  in June  from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since October 2011, the national
statistics agency said on July 5. Higher costs for food, fuel
and public tariffs have worsened consumer and business
sentiment, the central bank said in its quarterly inflation
report published June 27. Policy makers target inflation at 4.5
percent plus or minus two percentage points.  Street Riots  Protesters took to the streets in early June to oppose a
bus fare increase in  Sao Paulo , with discontent spreading to
other cities including  Porto Alegre , Rio de Janeiro and
Brasilia. Rousseff’s approval rating fell to 30 percent, down
from 57 percent before protests started and a high of 65 percent
in March, according to a survey by Datafolha published June 29.  Retail sales in May were unchanged from the month prior,
the national statistics agency said on July 11. Industrial
production in May fell by 2 percent, the second contraction in
four months.  Brazil ’s gross domestic product  expanded  0.55 percent in
the first quarter, less than the 0.9 percent median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey. The economy grew 0.9 percent last year, the
worst performance since it contracted in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
