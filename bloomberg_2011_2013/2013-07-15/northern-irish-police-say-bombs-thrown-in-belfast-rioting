Police in  Belfast  were attacked with
explosives and gasoline bombs as rioting continued for a fourth
night over a decision to ban a Protestant parade from passing by
a Catholic area of the city.  The bombs were thrown at police lines in the Newtownards
Road area of east Belfast, a police spokesman said today in a
recorded message. In north Belfast a “pipe-bomb-type device”
was thrown at police. No injuries were reported.  The violence began on July 12, the climax of a Protestant
celebration of a 17th-century victory over Catholics, when
thousands of parades marking the victory take place across
 Northern Ireland . One such parade was banned from passing by the
Catholic district of Ardoyne in north Belfast, and Protestants
have been protesting at the decision since then.  In north Belfast two roads were closed because of crowds,
police said. Last night, sporadic rioting occurred across
Protestant areas of north Belfast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
