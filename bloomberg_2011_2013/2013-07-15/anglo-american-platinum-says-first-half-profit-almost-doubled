Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the
world’s biggest producer of the metal, said first-half profit
almost doubled from a year earlier after the rand weakened,
curbing the impact of cost increases in South Africa.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items probably rose
to a range of 4.80 rand ($0.50) to 5.35 rand in the six months
through June compared with 2.73 rand a year earlier, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement. The stock
climbed as much as 2.6 percent, the most in a week.  The price of platinum declined 0.5 percent to an average
$1,549 an ounce in the first half compared with a year earlier
while the rand depreciated 14 percent against the dollar, making
it the worst performer among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The currency swing has helped Amplats, as the company
is known, offset above-inflation gains in costs such as
electricity and wages.  “The rand has obviously bailed these guys out quite a
lot,” Justin Froneman, a Johannesburg-based analyst at Standard
Bank Group Ltd.’s securities unit, who has a hold rating on the
stock, said by phone. “The market was possibly anticipating
slightly weaker results.”  The shares advanced as much as 2.6 percent after the
announcement and traded 2 percent higher at 296.98 rand by 12:25
p.m. in Johannesburg, heading for the strongest closing level
since June 19.  Basic earnings per share for the first half will probably
increase to between 4.50 rand and 4.86 rand compared with a loss
of 1.78 rand in the same period in 2012, Amplats said in the
statement. The 2012 figure includes a one-time loss of 1.2
billion rand, or 4.55 rand per share, due to writing down
uneconomic projects and assets.  “It’s difficult to get a read on what this means
operationally as there are quite a lot of working-capital
adjustments in the background that one needs to be aware of,”
Froneman said.  Amplats will releases its full earnings report on or about
July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
