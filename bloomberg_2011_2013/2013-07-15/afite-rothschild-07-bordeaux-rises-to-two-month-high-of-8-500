A case of 2007 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, the most expensive of the Medoc first-growth wine
estates, sold for 5,600 pounds ($8,500) on the Liv-ex market, a
two-month high and up 8 percent from its low for this year.  The transaction on July 12 was 30 percent below the record
8,000 pounds a case at which it traded in 2011, at the height of
the  bull market  for  Bordeaux , and is up 22 percent from the
level to which it fell in August 2012 as demand cooled.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 4 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared
by a decline since then. Restrained investor demand for Bordeaux
2012 wine futures, known as en primeur sales, over the past
three months has weighed on prices of earlier vintages.  “Following the more than disappointing en primeur season,
which is now over, the overall impression is now of a market
seeking direction,”  Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine
Investment Fund in London, said in an e-mailed market report
this month. The fund, invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  The 2007 Lafite ranks as the Pauillac estate’s sixth
highest-priced wine of the past 10 years, lagging those from
2010, 2009, 2008, 2005 and 2003, according to merchant prices
collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  The vintage was awarded a 94 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , below the marks for the three recent
higher-priced vintages and also a lower score than that of its
2006 and 2004 wines, according to the eRobertParker.com  website .  First Growth  Chateau Lafite-Rothschild has about 100 hectares (247
acres) planted with red-grape vines.  Cabernet Sauvignon 
typically makes up between 80 percent and 95 percent of its
wine, with Merlot between 5 percent and 20 percent, and smaller
quantities of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyard, owned by  Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite) , is on the left bank of the Gironde estuary and ranked
among the top Bordeaux first-growth estates in the Medoc
classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris
Exhibition, which remains in force.  Its vineyards date back at least to the 17th century and
the estate has been under the control of the Rothschild family
since being acquired by Baron James de Rothschild, then head of
its French branch, in August 1868.  To contact the reporter on this story:
