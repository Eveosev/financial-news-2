Money managers  boosted bullish bets 
on cocoa traded in London by 43 percent in the week ended July 9
as dry weather in leading producer  Ivory Coast  threatens to hurt
the development of the next crop, NYSE Liffe data showed.  The net-long position, or a wager on a higher market,
totaled 24,157 futures and options, the Commitments of Traders
report published on the exchange’s website today showed. That
compares with 16,932 contracts a week earlier. The beans for
delivery in September gained 3.5 percent in the period.  Dryness is increasing in eastern-central Ivory Coast and
continues in  Ghana , the second-biggest producer, MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a report dated July
11. Ivory Coast’s central-western Daloa, which produces about
300,000 metric tons of cocoa a year, was dry July 1 to July 10,
according to the National Meteorological Service. Rain in the
period is usually 43 millimeters (1.69 inches), averages show.  Rain over the weekend may help ease concerns about dry
weather,  Jonathan Parkman , co-head of agriculture at futures and
options brokerage Marex Spectron Group, said by phone from
London today. Scattered thunderstorms were expected from Ivory
Coast eastward to Nigeria and Cameroon through yesterday, with
daily rainfall ranging from 0.2 inch to 0.7 inch, AccuWeather
Inc. said in a report on July 12.  In white, or refined, sugar, money managers  increased bets 
on rising prices by 22 percent, according to the data. The net-long position was 5,791 futures and options, up from 4,728
contracts a week earlier. The sweetener fell 0.5 percent in the
period. Money managers turned bullish on sugar for the first
time in almost two months in the week ended June 25.  Money managers’  net-short position , or a bet on lower
prices, in robusta coffee fell to 7,740 contracts from 9,128
lots a week earlier, the data showed. The beans used to make
instant coffee and espresso rose 1.9 percent in the week.  In feed wheat, money managers boosted their net-short
position to 564 contracts from 535 lots a week earlier. The
grain gained 2.5 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
