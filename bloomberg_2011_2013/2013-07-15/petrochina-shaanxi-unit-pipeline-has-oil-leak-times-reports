Crude oil has leaked from a cracked
pipeline in the Changqing oilfield owned by  PetroChina Co. (857)  in
the northwestern province of Shaanxi,  Securities Times  reported,
citing local village residents.  The “large quantity” of leaked oil from the accident,
which occurred in Zhidan county of Yanan city on July 12,
entered the surrounding water system and may flow into a
downstream reservoir, which provides drinking water to more than
200,000 residents, the newspaper said without citing anyone.  Several attempts by the company to send people to clean up
the oil were thwarted by rain, the report said.  PetroChina has not received any report about the accident
and is trying to contact the local unit for more details,
Beijing-based spokesman  Mao Zefeng  said by phone today.  In November, 2011, China National Petroleum Corp., the
parent of PetroChina, was given a disciplinary warning by the
central government for an accident in the previous year,  in
which an  oil spill  caused by an explosion polluted more than 183
square kilometers (70 square miles) off the coast.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
