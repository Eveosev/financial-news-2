Broadwind Energy Inc. (BWEN) , a Cicero,
Illinois-based maker of steel towers, rose to the highest in
more than a year after winning an order worth $87 million from a
U.S. wind-turbine manufacturer.  Broadwind rose 10 percent to $5.50 at 8:52 a.m. in
premarket trading in New York. The shares have more than doubled
this year.  The company will manufacture the towers at its factories in
Abilene,  Texas , and Manitowoc,  Wisconsin , and plans to deliver
them next year, according to a statement today. The buyer wasn’t
identified. Broadwind has received orders for $200 million worth
of towers this year, the company said.  “Broadwind’s tower business continues to benefit from the
rebound of the U.S. wind energy industry as a result of the
Production Tax Credit extension and the continuing decline in
the cost of electricity from wind energy,” Chief Executive
Officer Peter C. Duprey said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
