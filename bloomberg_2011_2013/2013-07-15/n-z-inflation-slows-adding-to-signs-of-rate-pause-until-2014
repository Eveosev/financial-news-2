New Zealand consumer prices
increased less than economists expected last quarter as import
prices dropped, adding to signs a period of record-low interest
rates will be prolonged for the rest of this year.  Consumer prices  rose 0.2 percent from the first quarter,
when they gained 0.4 percent, Statistics New Zealand said in
Wellington today. That’s less than the 0.3 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 13 economists. Prices
gained 0.7 percent from a year earlier, the slowest since 1999
and less than the 0.8 percent estimate.  Annual inflation was slower than the central bank’s 1
percent to 3 percent target for the fourth straight quarter.
Contained price moves may ease pressure on Reserve Bank Governor
Graeme Wheeler to raise the official cash rate from a record-low
2.5 percent even as economic growth strengthens,  housing booms
and the currency declines. The central bank last month signaled
no change in borrowing costs until mid-2014.  New Zealand’s dollar fell, trading at 77.97 U.S. cents as
of 10:52 a.m. in Wellington from 78.20 cents immediately before
the report.  The central bank on June 13 estimated prices rose 0.8
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. It projected
annual inflation won’t reach 2 percent until the second half of
2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
