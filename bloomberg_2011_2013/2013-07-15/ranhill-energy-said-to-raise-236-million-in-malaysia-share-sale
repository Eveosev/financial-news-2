Ranhill Energy and Resources Bhd. , a
Malaysian energy and water company, raised 753 million ringgit
($236 million) after pricing its initial public offering at the
top end of a marketed range, two people familiar with the matter
said.  The company, based in Kuala Lumpur, sold shares to
institutional investors for 1.85 ringgit each, said the people,
asking not to be named because the information is private.
Ranhill Energy had offered the shares at between 1.70 ringgit
and 1.85 ringgit.  Ranhill Energy is raising the funds after the re-election
of Prime Minister Najib Razak helped lift Malaysia’s stock
benchmark to a record on May 14. Najib has promised to spend as
much as $444 billion on infrastructure and the FTSE Bursa
Malaysia KLCI Index is within one percent of its high.  Ranhill Energy is part of Ranhill Bhd. which was delisted
in 2011 after a buyout led by Chief Executive Officer Hamdan Mohamad. Hamdan wasn’t immediately able to comment on the
pricing when phoned out of normal office hours.  The revamped company is now focusing on providing
engineering services to the oil and gas industry. It also
operates power plants and manages water and wastewater
concessions, according to the listing prospectus.  To contact the reporters on this story:
