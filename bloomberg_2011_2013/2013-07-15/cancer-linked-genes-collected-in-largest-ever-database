Scientists at the  National Cancer
Institute  have produced the largest database of cancer-related
gene variations, a feat that will aid research efforts in
developing medicines that target the disease more precisely.  The work generated six billion data points that tie
hundreds of existing and experimental cancer medicines to gene
variations that may be used to better understand drug response,
the institute said today in a statement. The scientists
sequenced DNA from the human genome across 60 different cell
lines involved in nine types of cancer.  The data, to be available to any researcher, can help
scientists understand the ways gene mutations determine response
or resistance to treatment, the NCI said. By making the database
public, the  cancer research  community will be better equipped to
understand the genetic aberrations that allow tumors to form,
said  Yves Pommier , chief of the  Laboratory of Molecular
Pharmacology  at the Bethesda, Maryland-based NCI.  “This is the first time the whole exome, all the coding
genes of cancer cells, have been sequenced from mutation in
relation to drug connectivity,” Pommier said in a telephone
interview.  The database contains 20,000 compounds that may one day be
used to treat cancer, including all of the anti-cancer drugs
already approved by the  FDA , Pommier said in an interview about
the data, which was published today in Cancer Research, a
journal of the  American Association  for Cancer Research.  Information collected from 60 isolated cell lines comprise
what is known as the “NCI-60,” the source of the data released
today. The NCI-60 panel contains information about cancer-related genetic variations in the breast, ovary, prostate,
colon, lung, kidney, brain, blood and skin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
