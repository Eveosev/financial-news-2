Natural gas futures climbed for a
second day in  New York  on forecasts for hotter-than-usual
weather that would boost demand for electricity generation.  Gas gained 0.8 percent as MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said temperatures would be above normal
in the Northeast and Great Lakes region through July 19. Prices
earlier declined as much as 2.7 percent. The high in New York on
July 18 may be 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius), 11 higher
than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc.   “We’re starting to see some heat come into the equation
and provide some support for gas prices,” said  Phil Flynn , a
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The
weather is looking a lot more seasonal for the middle of
summer.”  Natural gas for August delivery rose 3 cents to settle at
$3.674 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 14 percent below the
100-day average at 2:45 p.m. Prices have advanced 9.6 percent
this year.  The discount of August to October futures narrowed 0.4 cent
to 1 cent.  October $2.70 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent higher at 0.8 cent per
million Btu on volume of 3,085 at 2:48 p.m. Puts accounted for
55 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in August was 30.44 percent at 2:45 p.m.,
compared with 28.22 percent on July 12.  Hedge Funds  Hedge funds  reduced  net-long wagers  on four U.S. natural
gas contracts for a sixth week in the seven days ended July 9,
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said July 12.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex  Henry Hub 
Swap Futures, Nymex ClearPort Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and
the ICE Futures U.S. Henry Hub contract. Henry Hub, in Erath,
 Louisiana , is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark
price for the fuel.  The high in  Cleveland  on July 18 may be 90 degrees, 8 more
than usual, AccuWeather data show.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Fall Supplies  Gas inventories totaled 2.687 trillion cubic feet in the
seven days ended July 5, the EIA said last week. Supplies were
0.8 percent below the five-year average and 14.2 percent below
year-earlier stockpiles.  The U.S. cut its 2013 marketed natural gas production
estimate to 69.96 billion cubic feet a day from last month’s
forecast of 70.01 billion, the EIA said July 9 in in its Short-Term Energy Outlook. Output may rise 1.1 percent from 2012 to a
record as onshore supplies climb.  Stockpiles may total 3.809 trillion cubic feet at the end
of October, about 120 billion below last year’s level for the
time of year, the EIA said.  The U.S. met 89 percent of its own energy needs in March,
the highest monthly rate since April 1986, EIA data show.  Spot gas at the Algonquin City Gates hub for deliveries to
locations including  Boston  jumped 78 percent to $8.0104 per
million Btu, the biggest gain since Jan. 31 and the highest
price since March 21, on the IntercontinentalExchange. Gas at
Transco Zone 6 in New York climbed 35 percent to $5.2137 per
million Btu, the highest price since April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
