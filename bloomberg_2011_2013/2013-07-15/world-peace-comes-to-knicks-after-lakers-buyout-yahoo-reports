Free-agent forward Metta World Peace
agreed on a two-year, $3.2 million contract with the New York
Knicks, Yahoo Sports reported today, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the negotiations.  The 33-year-old World Peace, who used to be known as  Ron Artest , averaged 12.4 points and five rebounds in 75 games last
season with the  Los Angeles Lakers . He was bought out by the
team last week under the National Basketball Association’s
amnesty clause, which absolves them of paying a luxury tax on
the package, and cleared waivers yesterday.  World Peace said in a text message that no new deal had
been finished, according to Twitter posts from USA Today and the
New York Post. Knicks spokesman  Jonathan Supranowitz  didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the Yahoo
report, which said that World Peace was publicly insisting he’s
considering other options.  World Peace has averaged 14.1 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.8
steals in his 14-year career with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana
Pacers,  Sacramento Kings , Houston Rockets and Lakers. He was
named the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year in 2004, when he
also played in his only All-Star Game.  A native of Queens, New York, he played at St. John’s
University from 1997 to 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
