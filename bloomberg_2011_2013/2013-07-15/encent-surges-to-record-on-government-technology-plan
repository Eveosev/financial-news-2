Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s
biggest Internet company, led technology stocks higher in Hong
Kong trading after the central government announced plans to
boost the telecommunications industry.  Tencent climbed 3.7 percent to HK$321.40 as of the market
close, the highest since the stock began trading in 2004.  Comba
Telecom Systems Holdings Ltd. (2342)  advanced 7.5 percent and  China
Fiber Optic Network System Group Ltd. (3777)  rose 13 percent.  Private investment in telecommunications will be encouraged
and upgrades to Internet and communications infrastructure will
be accelerated, according to a July 12 statement on the central
government website. The plan includes pushing forward the
connection of homes to fiber, enhancing third-generation
wireless networks and issuing 4G licenses by the end of this
year, Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
wrote in a note today.  “Investors are optimistic on Internet stocks,” said Kevin Tam, an analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International in Hong
Kong. “They have a more secure economic outlook amid uncertain
macroeconomic elements in China.”  Tencent has gained 29 percent this year and is the  best
performer  in the city’s  Hang Seng  index this year. The benchmark
has fallen 6 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
