Contractors that had their payments
frozen when Nakheel, a Dubai-based developer, announced
reorganization in 2009 are demanding 8 billion dirhams ($2.2
billion) in compensation,  Al Ittihad  reported, citing Nakheel
Chairman Ali Rashid Lootah.  Nakheel wants to reach agreement on the claims and has
established a committee to look into them, the newspaper cited
Lootah as saying. Lootah hopes to cut the amount demanded by 75
percent, to 2 billion dirhams, Ittihad said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
