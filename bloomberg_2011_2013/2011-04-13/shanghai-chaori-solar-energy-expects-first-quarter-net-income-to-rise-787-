Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy
Science & Technology Co., a Chinese solar-cell maker, expects
net income to rise as much as 787 percent in the first quarter
from last year to 39 million yuan.  The company attributes the increase to rising sales outside
 China  and the euroâ€™s appreciation, according to a statement to
the Shenzhen stock exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
