German two-year bonds fell as a
measure of inflation in  Europe ’s largest economy accelerated to
the fastest pace in more than 29 years last month and the nation
sold 30-year debt.  Greek 10-year bond yields reached a record and two-year
yields gained 50 basis points after  Germany ’s Zeit newspaper
reported that a restructuring of Greek sovereign debt could
involve imposing losses of between 50 percent and 70 percent on
investors. Reports showed German wholesale prices rose 10.9
percent in March from a year earlier, while European industrial
production gained 0.4 percent in February.  “Supply is weighing a bit on the market because, from
yesterday until Thursday, there’s a lot of supply coming
through,” said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European fixed-income
strategy at  RBC Capital Markets  in  London .  The yield on the two-year German note was one basis point
higher at 1.86 percent as of 5:37 p.m. in London. The 1.5
percent security maturing in March 2013 fell 0.015, or 15 euro
cents per 1,000-euro ($1,447) face amount, to 99.325. The 10-
year bund yield was little changed at 3.44 percent, after
earlier rising to 3.47 percent. Earlier this week, it reached
3.50 percent for the first time since Aug. 13, 2009.  Germany sold 1.67 billion euros of 30-year debt at an
average yield of 3.93 percent, up from 3.58 percent at an
auction in January. Investors demanded 1.5 times the debt on
sale, up from a so-called bid to cover ratio of 1.2 at the
previous offering. The central bank also sold 2.76 billion euros
of seven-year index-linked debt.  Greece , Portugal, Ireland  “Inflation is accelerating, which provides a very
supportive context” for the index-linked sale, Khrishnamoorthy Sooben, a fixed-income strategist at  Barclays Capital , wrote
before the offering.  The 10-year German breakeven rate, a measure of inflation
expectations derived from the difference in yield between index-
linked bonds and their nominal peers, rose as high as 2.36,
within four basis points of a record.  Greek two-year yields surged 51 basis points. Zeit reported
that the head of Standard & Poor’s European debt-evaluation
team,  Moritz Kraemer , said the risk of a Greek restructuring was
“almost one in three.”  “We can generate jobs and investments and we are not
changing track,” Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou 
said at a conference in Athens today. Reforms will “lead to
growth that will avoid the need for restructuring,” he said.  Greece, Ireland, Portugal  Greek 10-year yields rose five basis points to 12.92
percent after reaching a record 12.96 percent, while Portuguese
five-year yields also reached a euro-era high of 10.30 percent.
Irish benchmark 10-year bond yields snapped eight days of
declines, gaining as much as 21 basis points to 9.30 percent
before settling at 9.09 percent.  “People are very negative about Greece, they’re very
skeptical,” said Schaffrik. “Nobody believes the official
line. Greece is a very different story from the other two. I
think Ireland is the most positive story for a number of reasons
and  Portugal  sits in the middle.”  German  government bonds  have handed investors a 2.8 percent
loss this year, while U.S. Treasuries are 0.1 percent lower,
according to indexes compiled by the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Portuguese debt is
the worst performer among the euro-region nations, losing 10.3
percent this year, while Greek bonds have lost 0.8 percent and
Irish securities have returned 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
