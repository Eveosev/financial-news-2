Sony Corp. (6758)  plans to adjust work
hours and holidays this summer to conserve power after  Japan ’s
March 11 earthquake crippled a nuclear plant and caused outages.  The Tokyo-based maker of Bravia televisions aims to
introduce a summer shift, which will begin and finish earlier
than the usual work hours of 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Yuko Minami, a
spokeswoman, said by phone today without elaborating. Sony also
plans two weeks of holidays for all workers in Japan.  The plan comes after Tokyo Electric Power Co. said power
supply to Tokyo may fall 20,500 megawatts short of summer
demand, or 34 percent less than the peak consumption last year.
The owner of the stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant is
capable of supplying 37,500-megawatts and had planned to add
about 2,000 megawatts of thermal generation, it said last month.  Sony’s plans need approval from the labor union and details
are yet to be finalized, Minami said. Employees may also work on
Saturdays and Sundays and take compensatory time-off during
weekdays between June and September, she said.  The proposal covers nine offices located in  Tokyo  and
Kanagawa prefecture and doesn’t include factories, marketing
units and other subsidiaries, according to the spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
