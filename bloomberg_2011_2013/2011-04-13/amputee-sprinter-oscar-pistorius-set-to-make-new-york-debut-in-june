Oscar Pistorius, the double-
amputee South African sprinter who wants to compete in track
and field events at the Olympics, will make his New York debut
June 11 in the Adidas Grand Prix.  Pistorius, 24, who was born without fibulas and had both
legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old,
competes with prosthetic blades made of carbon fiber.  Known as the “Blade Runner,” Pistorius will compete
against three-time Olympic gold medalist Jeremy Wariner at 400
meters at Icahn Stadium on Randall’s Island, meet organizers
said yesterday in a release on the  Adidas Grand Prix website .  “I expect the race to be a challenge and one that I am
looking forward to,” Pistorius said in a statement released by
meet organizers. “I need to run against the best.”  Pistorius is a four-time gold medalist in the Paralympics
and is seeking a time that would qualify him for the 2012
London Olympics and the track and field world championships.  The Adidas Grand Prix is part of track and field’s annual
Diamond League circuit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
