The premium for white sugar over
the raw sweetener has risen due to refinery shutdowns and on
speculation exports from  India , the world’s second-largest
producer, may be delayed, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  Al Khaleej Sugar Co.,  the world’s largest sugar refinery,
closed its plant and is reselling the raw sugar it bought as
demand for the refined variety slowed, general manager Cyrus Raja said on April 11. A panel of ministers approved 500,000
metric tons of sugar exports from India on March 22.  “The white premium has risen on speculation export
licenses out of India aren’t being issued despite the approval
of 500,000 tons of exports,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at the
Rolle, Switzerland-based company, said in an e-mail today.
“Refining stoppages due to losses and the difficulty to compete
with Thai sugar also translated into a higher premium.”  White sugar for May delivery was about $132 a ton more
expensive than May-delivered raw-sugar by 12:37 p.m. London
time, according to data on Bloomberg. That represents a gain of
57 percent over the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
