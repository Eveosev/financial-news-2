OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest
producer of steelmaking coal, said the U.S. Justice Family has
proposed to offer as many as 26 million preferred shares for
sale, according to a regulatory filing.  Jim Justice, a West Virginian-businessman and his family,
are offering their shares to Russian and international
investors, the filing said.  Mechel has asked for the preferred shares to be admitted
for trading on Moscow’s RTS and Micex stock exchanges under the
ticker MTLRP.  The Justice family sold U.S. coal producer Bluestone Coal
Corp. to Mechel in May 2009 for $436 million in cash and 83.3
million Mechel preferred shares after the global credit crisis
slashed financing for acquisitions. The family also grows corn
wheat and soybeans in West Virginia and neighboring states.  Morgan Stanley,  Renaissance Capital  and VTB Capital have
been hired to organize the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
