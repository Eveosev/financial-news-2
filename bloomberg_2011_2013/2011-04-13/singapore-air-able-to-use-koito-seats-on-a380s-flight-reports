Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  will use
 Koito Industries Ltd. (6747)  business-class seats on at least one
delayed Airbus SAS A380 after the planemaker granted an
expectional authorization, Flight International reported without
giving a source for the information.  The certification covers the carrierâ€™s 12th superjumbo, the
aerospace magazine said on its website today. The airline has
three A380s deliveries due in the next few months and it has
been working with Airbus and Koito on certification for the
business-class seats, an unidentified spokesman for the airline
said, according to the report.  Koito last year admitted to falsifying data related to
about 150,000 seats installed on commercial aircraft worldwide.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
