Mandatory clearing of derivatives
may inadvertently increase counterparty risk, according to James Hill, a managing director at Morgan Stanley.  Regulators have argued that more derivatives trades should
be centrally cleared to limit the fallout if a counterparty
defaults. Separating trades that can be centrally cleared from
those that can’t introduces counterparty exposure that may
otherwise be offset, Hill said at the  International Swaps &
Derivatives Association ’s annual meeting in  Prague  today.  “You have a bifurcation of your book between trades that
are cleared and those that are not cleared,” he said. “That’s
magnified by the problem that within cleared trades you have
multiple clearing houses.”  That may increase the cost of trading and reduce liquidity
in the market, Hill said.  “I expect that as the market progresses and dealers start
to think about where they’re warehousing risk, they will make a
different price for the exact same trade based on where it
clears,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
