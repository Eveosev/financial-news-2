The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
advanced 113.92, or 0.4 percent, to 32,353.79 at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, rebounding from yesterday’s 1.8 percent
slide.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , the world’s third-largest
gold producer, rose to the highest in almost week, gaining 5
rand, or 1.5 percent, to 332 rand. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analyst Eugene King raised the price estimate on the stock to
405 rand, from 327 rand.  Consolidated Infrastructure Group Ltd. (CIL)  , a
developer of high-voltage electrical substations, jumped the
most since March 30, rising 4 cents, or 5.3 percent, to 80
cents. Earnings rose to 46.5 million rand ($6.9 million) in the
first half through February, from 41.1 million rand a year
earlier, according to a filing with the Johannesburg bourse.  Metorex Ltd. (MTX)  , a producer of copper, rallied for a
third day, climbing 15 cents, or 2.1 percent, to 7.30 rand.
Analysts at Fidelity International Ltd. and Metropolitan Asset
Managers said Vale SA, the second-largest copper miner, should
boost its bid for Metorex by about 35 percent because its $1.1
billion, or 7.35 rand-a-share offer undervalues the company.  Paladin Capital Ltd. (PLD)  , a private equity company,
advanced the most since March 10, gaining 10 cents, or 4.1
percent, to 2.54 rand. The company said profit increased to 355
million rand in the year ended February, from 179.6 million a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
