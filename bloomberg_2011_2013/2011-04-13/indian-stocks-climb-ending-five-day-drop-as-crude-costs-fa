India ’s stocks advanced, reversing
a five-day decline, as some investors judged the recent losses
as excessive and as  oil prices  fell.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a builder of dams, roads and
bridges, surged 7.4 percent, the most among the 30 companies on
the benchmark stock index.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  rose
2.1 percent, pacing gains among technology shares before the
start of earnings season on April 15. Crude fell to a two-week
low yesterday after the  International Energy Agency  reported
signs of an oil-demand slowdown and as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
forecast a “substantial” correction.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 466.34, or 2.4 percent, to 19,728.88, according to
preliminary closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The S&P CNX
Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange added 2.4 percent to
5,922.50 and its April futures settled at 5,944. The BSE 200
