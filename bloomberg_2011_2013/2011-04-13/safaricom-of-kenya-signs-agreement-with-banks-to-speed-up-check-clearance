Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s
biggest mobile-phone company, said it signed an agreement with
the Kenyan Bankers Association on data provision to help speed
up check-clearance times.  In terms of the accord, Safaricom has inter-linked the
nation’s 42 banks to the Central Bank of  Kenya  via its fiber-
optic network, Sylvia Mulinge, the company’s general manager for
enterprise, told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. She
declined to give the value of the deal.  The five-year contract is renewable, KBA Chief Executive
Officer Habil Olaka said at the media briefing.  The initiative is expected to result in “a reduction of the
time required for payment of checks, a cut in the associated
cost of transit, thus speeding up the process of realization of
checks,” Olaka said.  Last week, the central bank said Kenyan lenders will on
June 1 begin converting checks to electronic format for
clearing, reducing the processing time to three days from as
long as 10 days under the current manual system. The new system
will cost 650 million shillings ($7.73 million) to implement,
according to the KBA.  Shares of Safaricom gained the most in two days, advancing
5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to 4.1 shillings at 10:54 a.m. in
Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
