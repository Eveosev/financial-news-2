President  Barack Obama  next month
will award the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military
decoration, to two U.S. Army soldiers who died in the  Korean
War .  The families of Privates First Class Anthony Kaho’ohanohano
and Henry Svehla will attend a White House ceremony for the
awards on May 2 commemorating the two soldiers’ “conspicuous
gallantry,” the White House said in a statement today.  Kaho’ohanohano will be cited for engaging enemy forces with
his firearm, grenades and in hand-to-hand combat to protect the
withdrawal of friendly forces, the statement said. He died in
battle on Sept. 1, 1951.  Svehla led a counterattack against enemy troops and when a
grenade landed nearby and he threw himself on it to protect his
comrades. He died on June 12, 1952.  The medals will be the fourth and fifth awarded by Obama as
president.  Obama has awarded only one to a living honoree, to U.S.
Army Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta last year for heroism in
 Afghanistan .  He has also awarded the medal to U.S. Army Staff Sergeant
Jared C. Monti, who was killed in Afghanistan in 2006, Robert J.
Miller, who was killed in Afghanistan in 2008, and Richard L.
Etchberger, who died in  Vietnam  in 1968.  More than 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded since
Congress authorized them in 1861.  To contact the reporter on this story:
