Lenders to Energy Future Holdings
Corp., which was taken private in the largest buyout in history,
have agreed to extend the maturity on more than 80 percent of
its term loans and letters of credit.  Lenders agreed to extend the maturity on $15.4 billion of
term loans to 2017 from 2014, while lenders holding $1.02
billion of a letter of credit facility extended its expiration
date to 2017, the Dallas-based company said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. Creditors holding $1.38 billion of revolving
lines of credit also delayed the maturity of their debt to 2016
from 2013, according to the filing.  The company said in a filing to regulators today it plans
to sell $1.73 billion of senior secured bonds due 2020 to repay
about $1.6 billion of loans signed in 2007.  The former TXU Corp., taken private in 2007 by KKR & Co.
and TPG Capital, asked lenders April 1 to extend its debt,
according to a lender presentation and a regulatory filing from
that day.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  arranged the extension.  The extension is dependent upon the electricity provider
selling senior secured notes, according to the news release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
