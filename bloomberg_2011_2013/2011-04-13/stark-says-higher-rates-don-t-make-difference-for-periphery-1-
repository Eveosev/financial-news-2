European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said last week’s increase in the
benchmark interest rate doesn’t “make much of a difference”
for peripheral euro-region countries.  “The real economic adjustment that some euro-area
countries are doing is painful, even at 1 percent,” Stark said
in Stuttgart late today. “Risk premiums are that high that the
short-term  interest rates  we set don’t make much of a
difference.”  The ECB lifted its key rate to 1.25 percent on April 7, its
first increase in almost three years, to stem faster inflation
and keep higher prices from feeding into wages. The yield on
Greek 10-year bonds rose to a record close to 13 percent today
after  Germany ’s Zeit newspaper reported that a restructuring of
Greek sovereign debt could involve imposing losses of between 50
percent and 70 percent on investors.  Stark said annual consumer-price gains in the euro area
will average above 2 percent this year. Banks are borrowing less
money from the ECB in refinancing operations, signalling that
confidence in the  interbank market  has increased, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
