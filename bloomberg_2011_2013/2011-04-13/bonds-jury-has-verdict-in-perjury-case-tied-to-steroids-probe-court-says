Jurors in the Barry Bonds perjury
case reached a verdict on whether the former  San Francisco 
Giants outfielder lied in a federal investigation of steroids,
the court announced.  The eight-woman, four-man jury in San Francisco federal
court began deliberations April 7 over three perjury counts and
one obstruction of justice charge against Bonds, whose trial
began March 21. More than a dozen witnesses testified for the
government. If convicted, the maximum sentence Bonds faces for
each count is 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  Bonds, 46, who broke  Hank Aaron ’s record of 755 career home
runs in August 2007, was indicted in November of that year. He
was the first major-league player to be charged in a years-long
federal probe of steroids use in professional sports. He didn’t
testify at trial and his lawyers didn’t put on any witnesses.  He was accused by prosecutors in San Francisco of lying to
a federal grand jury in 2003 when he said he didn’t knowingly
take performance-enhancing substances provided by Anderson and
only received injections from his physician. He was also charged
with obstruction, as prosecutors alleged his untruthful
testimony impeded their steroids investigation.  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
