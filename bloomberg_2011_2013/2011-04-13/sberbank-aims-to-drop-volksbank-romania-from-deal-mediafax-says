OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
lender, wants to buy the international division of Austria’s
Volksbanken AG Group without its Romanian unit to avoid
consolidating its European Union business in the eastern
European country,  Mediafax  reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.  Sberbank has asked Volskbank to exclude the Romanian unit,
its biggest in eastern  Europe , after visiting the Bucharest-
based lender and meeting with the  National Bank of Romania  three
weeks ago, the news service reported today, citing the unnamed
bank industry people.  Romania ’s central bank would be the main
supervisor of the Russian bank’s operations in the EU after the
potential deal, according to Mediafax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
