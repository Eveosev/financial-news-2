A former  AllianceBernstein Holding
LP (AB)  employee was charged with stealing software used to send and
receive messages related to clients’ securities transactions.  Peter Jan, 35, was arraigned today in Manhattan state
 Supreme Court  on computer trespass, grand larceny and unlawful
duplication of computer-related materials. He pleaded not
guilty.  “The defendant, who was leaving his job and moving to a
new firm, saw and took an opportunity to steal
AllianceBernstein’s software and thereby violate New York State
law,” New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in an e-
mailed statement. “Employees who take advantage of their access
to sensitive information will face criminal prosecution for  data
theft .”  Jan, an application support specialist, gave notice to
Alliance-Bernstein on March 8, 2010, and was supposed to leave
the company 11 days later. On four occasions, he downloaded
software used by the company for FIX messages, a financial
information exchange standard, Manhattan Assistant District
Attorney Tracy Conn said. He was fired on March 15, 2010, she
said.  At today’s arraignment, the judge, Larry Stephen, asked,
“Do we know if the information was used?”  “It’s currently being investigated,” Conn said.  Jan was released without bail and is due back in court May
17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
