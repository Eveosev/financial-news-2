Spain  has separated itself from
 Portugal  and Ireland by taking appropriate policy action, an
International Monetary Fund official said.  “The actions that have been taken in Spain recently have
managed to decouple in the views of markets the fortunes of
Spain relative to those of Portugal, or even more, Ireland,”
Jose Vinals, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets
department, said in Washington today.  “I think we’re talking about completely different cases,
and policy action has been taken in the case of Spain in the
context of fiscal consolidation, in the context of the
restructuring,” Vinals said at a press conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
