UCB SA (UCB)  is at the beginning of a
“curve of strong growth” from 2012 as the drugmaker faces no
“major” patent concerns for 10 years, De Tijd reported, citing
an interview with Chief Executive Officer Roch Doliveux.  “It is not the question if we shall grow, but when,” the
newspaper cited the CEO as saying. “Investors need to see they
don’t miss the boat.”  Doliveux said last month that after 2011, UCB wasn’t
expected to face major patent expiries for more than a decade,
with its Cimzia, Vimpat and Neupro treatments driving growth for
the company, as well as further growth foreseen from new
products.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
