Rubber declined for a second day to
the lowest level in more than a week after  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
said its car production in  Europe  will be halted later this
month, boosting speculation demand for tires will weaken.  The September-delivery contract lost as much as 4.6 percent
to 438.2 yen per kilogram ($5,210 a metric ton), the lowest
level since April 4. It settled at 450.4 yen on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange.  Output at Toyota’s five European plants will be halted for
several days in late April and early May because of a shortage
of parts as a result of the March 11 earthquake in  Japan , the
company said yesterday. The world’s biggest automaker also told
U.S. dealers that assembly disruptions triggered by the record
quake may thin supplies of vehicles into the third quarter.  “The car industry has not yet recovered from damage
caused by the quake,  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at commodity
broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today. “Concerns
about demand put a drag on rubber prices.”  The Japanese government cut its assessment of the economy
for the first time in six months after the earthquake and
tsunami that followed killed more than 12,000 and led to the
worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.  “Although the Japanese economy was picking up, it has
shown weakness” since the temblor, the Cabinet Office said in a
report today. A power shortage that resulted from a crippled
nuclear facility, delays in resolving supply-chain disruptions
and costlier oil threaten to depress growth further, it said.  Oil Rebounds  Losses in rubber futures were limited as oil gained for the
first time in three days, raising the appeal of the commodity as
an alternative to synthetic products made from petroleum.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 0.6 percent to $106.92 per
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:52 p.m. Tokyo time amid speculation that U.S. gasoline
stockpiles are shrinking.  Oil tumbled 5.9 percent on April 11 and 12, the biggest
two-day retreat since May 14 and May 17 in 2010. The IEA
reported signs of an oil-demand “slowdown” in its monthly Oil
Market Report.  The physical price of Thai rubber was unchanged at 184.8
baht ($6.15) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber
Research Institute of  Thailand . The price was supported as
supply fell after recent floods in southern Thailand, it said.
The Thai market was closed for national holiday today.  The floods in 10 southern provinces have killed 61 people,
according to the Department of Disaster Prevention & Mitigation.
About 50,000 rai (19,641 acres) of rubber plantations in the
nation, the largest producer and exporter, have been damaged.  Rubber for September delivery in  Shanghai  gained 0.3
percent to 36,555 yuan ($5,595) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
