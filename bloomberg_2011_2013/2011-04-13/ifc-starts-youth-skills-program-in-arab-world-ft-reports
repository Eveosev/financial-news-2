A $2 billion initiative to improve
skills among young people in Arab countries will be announced
today by the International Finance Corp., the  World Bank ’s
private-sector development arm, the Financial Times reported,
citing Lars Thunell, the IFC’s chief executive officer.  Arab nations suffer from the highest youth unemployment in
the world at more than 25 percent, according to a report by
McKinsey, a consulting company, which was commissioned by the
IFC, the newspaper said.  For demographic reasons, the region has to create 35
million to 40 million jobs simply to maintain current average
unemployment rates, the FT cited the report as saying.  Thunell said he plans to start a program in partnership
with the World Bank and the  Islamic Development Bank  to bridge
the gap between education and employment, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
