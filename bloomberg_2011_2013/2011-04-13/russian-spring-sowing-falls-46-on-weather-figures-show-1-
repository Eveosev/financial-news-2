Spring crop sowing in  Russia  fell
46 percent from last year because of delays caused by adverse
weather, Agriculture Ministry figures showed.  Farmers planted 862,000 hectares (2.1 million acres) with
spring crops as of today, the ministry said on its  website ,
without providing a comparative figure. Spring sowing came to
1.59 million hectares as of April 14, 2010, the ministry said at
the time.  Winter grain plantings are in “good” condition across
Russia, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
