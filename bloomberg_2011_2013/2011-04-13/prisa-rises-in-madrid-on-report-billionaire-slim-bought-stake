Promotora de Informaciones SA (PRS) ,
Spain’s largest media company, rose the most in almost three
months after  El Confidencial  reported that Mexican billionaire
 Carlos Slim  bought a stake.  Prisa, as the company is known, rose as much as 6.9
percent, its biggest intraday increase since Jan. 19, and traded
at 2.19 euros, up 4.3 percent, at 9:37 in Madrid.  Slim, the world’s richest person according to Forbes
magazine, bought a stake of 2 percent to 3 percent in the
publisher of El Pais newspaper, according to El Confidencial.  Two Prisa spokeswomen weren’t immediately available when
contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
