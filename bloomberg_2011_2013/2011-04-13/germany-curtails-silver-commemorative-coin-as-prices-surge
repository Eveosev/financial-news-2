Germany  will curtail the production
of silver commemorative coins because of the increase in the
value of the metal this year by more than 30 percent.  German mints will begin producing commemorative coins using
a copper-nickel alloy this year, the  Finance Ministry  in Berlin
said today in a statement. Coins containing a silver-copper
alloy will be worth more than their face value.  The ministry cited budgetary restrictions for the decision,
as well as concern that such coin issues could become an object
of market speculation. The decision affects a series of 10-euro
($14.45) commemorative coins, the government said.  Silver climbed as high as $41.975 an ounce on April 11, the
highest level since 1980, when the metal touched a record
$50.35. Metals such as silver and gold have gained on
speculation that rising commodity costs and record-low  interest
rates  will spur demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
