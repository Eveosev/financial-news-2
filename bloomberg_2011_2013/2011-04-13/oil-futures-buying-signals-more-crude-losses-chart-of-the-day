Oil is poised to fall further
because so much recent speculation in the U.S. futures market
has focused on price gains, according to Myles Zyblock, chief
institutional strategist at  RBC Capital Markets .  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the net number of contracts
owned by non-commercial oil traders, as compiled weekly by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, with the price of crude
oil in  New York  since 2007.  Crude oil tumbled 5.8 percent in the first two days of this
week to $106.25 a barrel. The decline was the biggest since May,
and yesterday’s close was the lowest this month.  “A price drop to $100 a barrel over the next week or two
is not out of the question” as speculative demand for oil
declines, Zyblock wrote today in a report. Energy stocks would
suffer if crude retreats to the low $90s, he wrote.  Last week’s CFTC figures showed there were 252,151 more
long positions, which rise along with crude prices, than short
positions, which add value when oil drops. The total was about 9
percent below a record set in March -- and 18 times the net
figure when crude peaked at $147.27 a barrel in July 2008.  Zyblock recommends that investors’ holdings of energy
producers exceed the group’s weight in market indexes. Energy
accounts for 12.8 percent of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s
value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
