U.S. ethanol production fell 0.4
percent to 898,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department.  Stockpiles jumped 2.3 percent to a record 20.5 million
barrels while output fell to the lowest level since March 11,
the department said in a report released in  Washington .  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
rose 1 percent to 4.9 million barrels a day. Refiners receive a
45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into the
motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery climbed 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.68 a gallon at 10:35 a.m. New York time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have climbed 74 percent in the
past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
