Cash premiums for corn shipped in
April and May to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to
Chicago futures as demand weakened. Soybeans basis rose as
farmers withheld crops.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in the
first half of this month was 51 cents to 55 cents a bushel above
May futures, compared with 57 cents to 60 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. Deliveries in the second
half of April and all of May fell as much as 8 cents. The
soybean basis for delivery in April rose to 58 cents to 67 cents
a bushel from 58 cents to 66 cents.  “Export trade seems to be a little weaker, and some
commercial companies may be selling some corn,” said  Glenn Hollander , a partner at Chicago-based Hollander & Feuerhaken, a
cash trader and futures broker. “Less soybeans are moving off
farms,” tightening supplies, he said.  Corn futures for May delivery gained 3 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $7.555 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today.
Soybean futures for May delivery rose 3.75 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $13.335 a bushel on the CBOT.  Moderate flooding  has slowed barge traffic and some grain
loading along the upper  Mississippi River , Hollander said. More
rain this weekend may increase shipment delays to export
terminals.  “Some of the river terminals may have to halt or slow
loadings next week,” Hollander said. “It’s nothing unusual for
this time of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
