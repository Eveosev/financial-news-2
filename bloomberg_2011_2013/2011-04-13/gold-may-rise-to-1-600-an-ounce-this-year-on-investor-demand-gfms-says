Gold will rise as much as 9.5
percent this year to a record $1,600 an ounce, extending a rally
that began in 2001, as investors boost demand for the metal as
an inflation hedge, said researcher GFMS Ltd.  Prices in  New York  touched an all-time high of $1,478 on
April 11 amid speculation that governments will keep borrowing
costs near record lows to revive economic growth, increasing the
risk of accelerated costs for consumers. Total gold demand rose
0.4 percent to 4,334 metric tons in 2010, the third straight
gain, according to an annual report from GFMS.  “The prospects for  gold prices  this year remain bright,”
GFMS Executive Chairman  Philip Klapwijk  said in a statement.
“Investors continue to be concerned about the outlook for
inflation, with governments in general showing little appetite
to tighten monetary policy significantly.”  Gold, the most widely traded precious metal, rallied 27
percent in the past year as the  Federal Reserve  kept the
benchmark U.S. interest rate at zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008 in a bid to pull the economy out of recession.
Last week, the  European Central Bank  raised the main borrowing
cost 25 basis points to 1.25 percent.  Gold futures for June delivery traded at $1,460.90 an ounce
by 11:21 a.m. on the Comex in New York.  Investment in exchange-traded funds backed by the metal
rose 18 percent to 2,177 tons in 2010, and buyers increased
purchases of gold bars, coins and jewelry, according to GFMS.  Inflation Target  Demand for physical gold bars rose 66 percent last year to
a record 880.5 tons, led by purchases from  China . The country’s
central bank has raised rates four times since early October to
combat accelerating prices. China’s consumer-price inflation
reached 4.9 percent in February, above the government’s target
of 4 percent.  India , the biggest user, accounted for most of last year’s
rebound in global jewelry demand, which increased 11 percent to
2,017 tons, according to GFMS. India purchased 685 tons, up 36
percent. While higher prices will act as “a bit of a cap” on
jewelry demand this year, a decline in consumption will be
“limited,” Klapwijk said today in a presentation in London.  Buying Gold  Central banks bought 73 tons of gold last year, halting a
two-decade trend of reducing their  gold reserves , the researcher
said. The banks were “consistent” net sellers of the metal
from 1989 to 2009 and accounted for 10 percent of total supply
between 2001 and 2009, according to the report. Central banks
will likely keep buying gold this year, Klapwijk said in London.  Mine supply expanded by 3.8 percent to 2,688.9 tons, led by
the biggest producer, China, GFMS said. Production will rise 4
percent this year, while scrap supply will have a “fair
increase,” pushing total supply up 6 percent, Klapwijk said in
the presentation.  Miners paid an average $557 an ounce to extract gold, a 17
percent increase from 2009, according to the report. De-hedging
by producers this year will be limited, Klapwijk said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
