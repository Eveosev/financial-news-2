ECM Real Estate Investments AG (ECM) , a
developer in central  Europe , reported its loss widened last year
after the value of its assets fell and rental income lowered.  The net loss for 2010 was 94.5 million euros ($137 million)
compared with 62.3 million euros a year earlier, the Prague-
based developer said in a presentation on its web site today.
Its total asset value dropped 54 percent to 156 million euros.  Ceska Sporitelna AS, the Czech unit of Erste Bank AG and
the largest Czech holder of ECM’s bonds, filed an insolvency
proposal to the Municipal Court in Prague this week against ECM
for breaching covenants. The court rejected the filing, which
called for reorganization of the company, for formal mistakes.  ECM’s board will hold talks about options for restructuring
the company or sending it into bankruptcy. It will negotiate
with creditors about different options over the “next days,”
the company said in a presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
