Airbus SAS, the world’s largest
commercial planemaker, provided  France  with a long-haul A340
aircraft normally used for test flights to bring 9 tons of
medical and other rescue supplies to Libya.  The planemaker, based in Toulouse, France, made the jet and
a crew of three test pilots available at the request of the
French Foreign Office, said Airbus spokesman Jacques Rocca. The
French government needed highly skilled test pilots because the
airport’s condition in Benghazi is sub-standard given the war in
the country, the spokesman said.  “We are proud to contribute to the humanitarian effort in
Libya with a flight of our test aircraft,” Airbus Chief
Executive Officer  Tom Enders  said. “And providing support to
France, NATO and the UN in this situation is natural for us.”  The supplies will go to non-governmental organizations
operating in  Libya  to support the population, he said.  The French government also came to Airbus when it needed to
send planes to  Haiti  following the earthquake last year, because
conditions made deployment of aircraft from leasing companies
unfeasible, Airbus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
