The Philippine peso fell for a
third day on concern the after-effects of  Japan ’s worst
earthquake on record will disrupt trade and slow global economic
growth. Bonds advanced.  The currency touched a one-week low after Japan raised the
severity rating of its nuclear crisis to the highest level
yesterday, matching the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The Japanese
government cut its assessment of the economy for the first time
in six months today as damage from the March 11 temblor mounts.  “There’s a little bit of  risk aversion  on the raising of
the level of the nuclear crisis in Japan and its effect on
growth and trade,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice
president and treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in Manila.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 43.232 per dollar as of
4:14 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
43.36 earlier, the weakest level since April 5.  Philippine exports rose 8.2 percent in February from a year
earlier, the least in 15 months, a report showed yesterday.
Japan is the  Philippines ’ largest export destination.  Benchmark five-year bonds rose a second day, pushing yields
to the lowest this week. The yield on the 7 percent bond due
January 2016 fell 7.5 basis points, or 0.075 percentage point,
to 5.40 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
