Irish  consumer confidence  rose in
March to its highest level in seven months as the country’s new
government enjoyed a “honeymoon” after taking power.  A household sentiment index climbed to 59.5, the highest
since August, from 50.3 in February, the third-largest monthly
gain in the 15-year history of the survey, KBC Ireland and the
 Economic & Social Research Institute  in Dublin said today in an
e-mailed statement. A gauge of consumer expectations also rose.  “The results could be interpreted as hinting at a measure
of recession fatigue among weary Irish consumers,” said  Austin Hughes , chief economist at KBC Ireland. They “may feel they
have prepared themselves for a continuing storm to the best of
their abilities.”  A “honeymoon period” for Prime Minister  Enda Kenny ’s new
government, which took office on March 9, may have contributed
to an improvement in sentiment, according to Hughes. Kenny
replaced Brian Cowen as the country’s leader after the Fianna
Fail-led administration oversaw a tripling of unemployment and
an international bailout of Ireland.  A gauge measuring households’ expectations rose to 49.9 in
March from 37.8 the previous month, today’s report showed. KBC’s
gauge of how consumers view their current situation climbed to
73.8 from 68.9 the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
