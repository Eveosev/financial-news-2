Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy
Science & Technology Co., a Chinese solar-cell maker, rose to
the highest in four weeks after saying first-quarter net income
may have increased as much as 787 percent from a year earlier.  Shanghai Chaori gained 1.1 percent to 50.25 yuan, heading
for its highest close since March 17.  The company attributes the net income increase to rising
sales outside  China  and the euroâ€™s appreciation, according to a
statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
