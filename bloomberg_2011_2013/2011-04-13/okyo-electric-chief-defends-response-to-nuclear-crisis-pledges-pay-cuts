Tokyo Electric  Power Co. plans to
seek government approval to start a nuclear reactor shut after a
2007 earthquake to help ease power shortages, while the utility
battles radiation leaks from its Fukushima Dai-Ichi station.  The reactor at Kashiwazaki Kariwa, the world’s biggest
atomic station, is capable of supplying electricity this year,
Masataka Shimizu, president of the utility known as Tepco, said
in Tokyo yesterday. “I would like to get approval to restart
the No. 3 reactor early, this year if possible,” he said.  Japan has experienced rolling blackouts and faces more
power shortages as temperatures rise. The blackouts came after a
magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11 shut power plants
and crippled the six-unit Dai-Ichi station, triggering the worst
nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.  “This ‘operations first, safety second’ approach and the
failure to learn the lessons from the 2007 quake was the cause
of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear disaster,” said Philip White,
international liaison officer at the Citizens’ Nuclear
Information Center in  Tokyo . “How many more disasters will it
take?”  Shimizu defended Tepco’s response to the nuclear crisis at
its Fukushima plant 220 kilometers (135 miles) north of Tokyo.
“The steps we have taken so far were the best that we could
do,” he said.  Explosions, Leaks  Tsunami defenses, which were about 5 meters (16 feet) below
the maximum wave height, followed regulatory guidelines, he
said. The company didn’t delay a decision to use seawater to
cool four reactors because it would render them inoperable,
Shimizu said.  The tsunami knocked out backup generators and cooling
systems at the station, leading to explosions and radiation
leaks as water in the reactors and spent-fuel ponds boiled away.
 Japan ’s strongest quake on record and tsunami left about 27,500
dead or missing, according to the  National Police Agency .  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency this week
raised the severity rating of the accident to 7, the highest on
the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale and the
same level as the Chernobyl disaster.  The ranking was increased from 5, the same as the 1979
partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in  Pennsylvania . Each step
on the scale represents a 10-fold increase in severity.  Preventing Damage  The Fukushima station is yet to stabilize and the reactors
must be kept cool to prevent the crisis from deteriorating,
 Gregory Jaczko , chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, said at a Senate hearing April 12.  Efforts to restore cooling systems at the Fukushima plant
have been hindered as aftershocks forced workers to evacuate
periodically. Crews were still using temporary pumps for reactor
cooling yesterday, and used a cement-pumping truck to spray
water into a damaged spent-fuel pool, Tepco said in a  statement .  A total of 238 workers, including 39 subcontractors, were
deployed at the station as of 6:30 a.m. today, according to
information posted at Tepco’s media center.  The utility can’t rule out the possibility that some fuel
may be damaged after analyzing water in the spent fuel pool of
the No. 4 reactor, Junichi Matsumoto, a spokesman, said at a
news conference yesterday.  Tokyo and eight nearby prefectures face power shortages
after the disaster and aftershocks, knocked out 8 percent of
generating capacity, the government said on April 8.  Strengthening Structures  Three of seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki Kariwa station
are closed while Tepco strengthens structures to improve their
resistance to earthquakes. Work can continue at two units, while
Unit 3 is restarted, Shimizu said yesterday.  Local government approval is required for a restart. There
will be no progress on starting the three reactors until Tokyo
Electric resolves the Fukushima incident, Takehiko Katagiri a
spokesman for the city of Kashiwazaki said on April 6.  Shimizu said Tepco’s board members and senior executives
will take pay cuts and the company is in discussions with the
government on how to compensate people affected by Japan’s worst
civilian nuclear crisis.  He reaffirmed that Dai-Ichi reactors No. 1, 2, 3 and 4 will
be decommissioned, and said the fate of the two remaining units,
which were shut when the tsunami struck, is undecided.  To contact the reporters on this story:
