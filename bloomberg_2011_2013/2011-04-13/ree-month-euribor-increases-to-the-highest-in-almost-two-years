The rate at which European banks
say they see each other lending in euros for three months rose
to the highest level in almost two years, according to the
European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, gained for a
19th consecutive day, adding 0.7 basis point to 1.327 percent,
according to the European Banking Federation. That matches the
highest since May 7, 2009, and is the longest run of daily
increases since the 23-day streak ending Oct. 28, EBF data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
