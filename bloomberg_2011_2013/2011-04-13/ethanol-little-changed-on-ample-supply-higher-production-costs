Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  after a government report showed record stockpiles
and as higher corn prices signaled more-expensive production.  The grain-based gasoline additive was steady after the
Energy Department said inventories climbed 2.3 percent to a
record 20.5 million barrels last week. Separately, corn gained
on speculation that yesterday’s price drop will spur demand. The
grain is used to produce ethanol in the U.S.  “That just kind of added to the bearish sentiment,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “There’s
plenty of supply out there.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery slumped 0.2 cent to
$2.658 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have risen
12 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf surged 7.5
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.81 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive increased 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.775,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.825 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.675.  Corn for July delivery gained 3.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
close at $7.61 bushel in Chicago. The grain touched a 33-month
high of $7.8875 on April 11 on increasing demand for feed and
ethanol.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are earning 11 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are making 15 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
