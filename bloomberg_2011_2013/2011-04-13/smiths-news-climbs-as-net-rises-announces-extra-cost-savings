Smiths News Plc (NWS) , Britain’s biggest
newspaper and magazine distributor, rose 2.6 percent in London
trading after posting higher first-half profit and increasing
its cost-savings target by 50 percent.  Net income in the six months ended Feb. 28 climbed 11
percent to 13.7 million pounds ($22.3 million), the Swindon,
England-based company said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today. It raised its interim dividend 8.3 percent to
2.6 pence a share.  Smiths raised its three-year efficiency savings target to
30 million pounds from 20 million pounds. The company, which was
spun off from WH Smith Plc in 2006, is taking costs out
following its purchase of Bertrams, a book wholesaler. It’s
looking for further acquisitions and has as much as 70 million
pounds available to spend.  “They operate in markets in long-term decline so the
increased savings are a big positive surprise,” James Tetley,
an analyst at Brewing Dolphin Holdings Plc who rates the shares
“add,” said in a telephone interview. “The dividend is now
yielding over 9 percent, which is pretty hefty.”  The shares climbed as much as 6.4 percent to 92 pence
before closing at 88.75 pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London . The rise
pared this year’s decline to 25 percent.  “The board confirms the group is firmly on track to
deliver profits in line with full-year expectations,’ the
company said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
