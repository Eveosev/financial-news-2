Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  won
approval for a change in settling derivative transactions,
defeating an objection from Asian investors who bought Lehman
structured notes known as minibonds.  Hong Kong  holders of $1.5 billion of the minibonds accused
Lehman of trying to extract hundreds of millions of dollars from
the minibond program, saying the procedures interfered with
their dispute against Lehman and HSBC Holdings Plc, according to
court documents.  About 43,000 Hong Kong investors bought an estimated
$1.8 billion of the minibonds that were sold by lenders before
New York-based Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008. Investors
protested almost daily outside bank branches in Hong Kong,
banging cymbals and blaring pre-recorded statements from
bullhorns after they were offered repayments of at least 60
cents on the dollar in 2009.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, Lehmanâ€™s receiver, said on
March 27 the repayment offer was boosted so some minibond
holders may receive 70 percent to 93 percent of their money
back. Some investors want all their money refunded.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
