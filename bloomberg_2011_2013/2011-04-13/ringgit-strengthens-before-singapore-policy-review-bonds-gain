Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened,
reversing earlier losses as speculation local exporters will
benefit from  Singapore ’s possible decision to allow its currency
to appreciate.  The Malaysian currency gained as Asian stocks and
commodities including crude oil snapped a two-day slide. There’s
a 70 percent probability of Singapore allowing its currency to
strengthen after a review tomorrow, Malayan Banking Bhd. said in
a research note today. Ringgit bonds advanced.  “The ringgit is shadowing the Singapore dollar movements
before the policy decision,” said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a
foreign-exchange trader at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala
Lumpur . “People still want to sell the  U.S. dollar .”  The ringgit rose 0.1 percent to 3.0240 per dollar as of
4:46 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Singapore dollar  traded at S$1.2559 versus
S$1.2564 yesterday, after weakening as much as 0.3 percent to
S$1.2598.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore will revalue its
currency by re-centering its trading band, according to 10 of 20
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey published on April 11. Four

Malaysia shipped 13.4 percent of its exports to Singapore in
2010, its single largest overseas market.  Five-year  government bonds  rose for a third day. The
government will sell 3 billion ringgit ($991 million) of 2026
bonds tomorrow.  The yield on the 4.262 percent note due September 2016
declined 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.57
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price rose 0.06, or 60
sen per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 103.38.  “The 15-year auction should receive firm demand,
especially by insurers and other investors who chase long-tenor
investments,” CIMB said in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
