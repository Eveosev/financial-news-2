OAO Rosneft and BP Plc may extend
by a month the deadline to complete their share swap, Vedomosti
Russian newspaper reported today, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter at both companies.  The firms need more time to complete talks with BP’s
billionaire partners in its TNK-BP Russian venture after TNK-
BP’s Russian partners won an injunction against the deal, the
newspaper reported.  Rosneft and BP failed to agree on a price for the stake in
TNK-BP at which BP’s Russian partners would agree to sell, the
newspaper reported, citing sources at the three companies.  Today is the initial deadline for BP and Rosneft to
complete the planned $7.8 billion swap.  An e-mail from Bloomberg News to BP’s London offices
seeking comment wasn’t immediately returned. Calls to Rosneft’s
Moscow offices after the close of normal business hours went
unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
