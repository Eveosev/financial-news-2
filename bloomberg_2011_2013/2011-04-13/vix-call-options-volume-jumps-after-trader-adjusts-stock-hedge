VIX options volume jumped to almost
double the four-week average after a single trade of about
300,000 contracts in a strategy that profits if stocks plunge
and volatility rises.  An investor sold 50,000 July 22.50 calls and bought 100,000
July 30 calls while trading out of a similar position that used
May contracts, according to Frederic Ruffy, a senior options
strategist at WhatsTrading.com, a New York-based provider of
options-market analytics. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index is known, fell 1 percent to 16.92 at
4:15 p.m. in New York.  “We structured a strategy so that if there’s a small move
in the VIX it has little impact,” said Rebecca Cheong, a New
York-based equity derivatives strategist at  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,
which has been recommending the strategy as a hedge to customers
for more than a year. “If the VIX spikes in an extreme
situation, this will perform like a  call option .”  The VIX has retreated 42 percent from an eight-month high
of 29.40 on March 16, the week after the Japanese earthquake, as
takeovers and the improving U.S. economy bolstered optimism that
the global recovery can be sustained. The index has averaged
20.37 over its two-decade history.  The VIX measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which rose
0.1 percent to 1,314.93.  May VIX futures slumped 1.9 percent to 20.30, while July
contracts fell 0.9 percent to 22.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
