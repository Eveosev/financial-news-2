Asian currencies snapped a two-day
decline, led by  South Korea ’s won, as regional stock markets
rebounded on speculation the disaster-stricken Japanese economy
will not derail the global recovery.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose 0.1 percent
after being down 0.1 percent earlier. The MSCI Asia-Pacific
Index of regional shares climbed 0.7 percent as investor
appetite for emerging-market assets revived.  Japan  raised the
severity level of the accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
power plant yesterday to match the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  “It was a fairly nice rebound in risk taking,” said Thio Chin Loo, a senior currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA in
 Singapore . “It is generally about a global reassessment that
the risk in Japan will be contained within the country for
now.”  The won strengthened 0.5 percent to 1,087.93 per dollar as
of the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar and Malaysia’s ringgit advanced 0.1
percent to NT$29.089 and 3.0245, respectively.  China ’s yuan
gained 0.10 percent to 6.5340.  Singapore’s economy probably grew at the fastest pace in
three quarters, according to a Bloomberg News survey before a
government report tomorrow. Gross domestic product rose an
annualized 11.4 percent in the first quarter from 3.9 percent in
the previous three months, according to the median estimate of
14 economists.  Worries Overdone  A government report today will show U.S. retail sales
gained 0.5 percent in March, following a 1 percent increase in
February, according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  The won halted two days of losses as the  Bank of Korea 
said today economic growth this year will stay in line with
expectations at 4.5 percent and inflation will average 3.9
percent, more than the previously forecast 3.5 percent.  “The worries about Japan’s nuclear crisis were a bit
overdone,” said Yun Se Min, a currency dealer at Busan Bank in
Seoul. “Now, we are looking at fundamentals and the Korean
stock market ended up.”  Taiwan’s dollar advanced for the first time in three days
as the benchmark Taiex index of shares rose 0.6 percent.  “We see signs of the change in momentum in the stock
market, which is good for the  currency market ,” said Eric Hsing,
a debt trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. Investor
“confidence is still fragile,” he said.  The Philippine peso fell for a third day, its longest
losing streak in two months, after a report yesterday showed
exports rose 8.2 percent from a year earlier in February, the
least in 15 months. Japan is the  Philippines ’ largest export
destination. The currency dropped 0.1 percent to 43.232 per
dollar, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah slipped 0.1 percent to 8,657
per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India’s
rupee weakened 0.2 percent to 44.465 and the  Singapore dollar 
rose 0.1 percent S$1.2556. Local financial markets were closed
in  Thailand  for a holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
