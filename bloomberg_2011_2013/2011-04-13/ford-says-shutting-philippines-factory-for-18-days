Ford Motor Co. (F)  is shutting its
factory in the Philippines for 18 days as a precautionary move
to ensure parts availability following the March 11 earthquake
in  Japan .  The plant produces the Escape sport-utility vehicle, Focus
sedan and two Mazda models. The shutdown includes an already
planned weeklong idling for the Easter holiday in the
Philippines, spokesman Todd Nissen said in an e-mail.  Parts shortages may cause shutdowns at Ford facilities in
 Asia  this month and next, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker
said in an April 11 regulatory filing. Halting production at
Asian plants isn’t expected to have a “material impact” on
financial results, the automaker said.  Ford rose 1 cent to $14.92 at 9:52 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares dropped 11 percent this
year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
