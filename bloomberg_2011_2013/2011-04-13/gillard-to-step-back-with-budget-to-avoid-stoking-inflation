Australian Prime Minister  Julia
Gillard  said the government will “step back” at next month’s
budget to avoid driving up prices as corporate investment rises.  Government spending  must retreat when private companies
bolster their workforces, increase investments and roll out more
projects, Gillard told the Sydney Institute Annual Dinner late
today, according to the text of her speech.  “The time for government to step back is in this budget,”
she said. “By not adding to inflationary pressures it reflects
the best way of helping Australians manage cost of living
pressures. So we will be making hard decisions in this budget:
to prevent greater pain in the long term.”  Gillard has pledged to return the budget to surplus by the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, after recording a deficit of
A$54.8 billion ($57 billion) last fiscal year that reflected
spending to avoid a recession during the global financial
crisis. The budget will be presented to parliament on May 10.  A gauge of  Australia ’s annual inflation remained above the
top of the central bank’s target range in March as food prices
and automotive fuel costs advanced, a private report showed this
month.  The government will “keep a tight rein” on spending to
return the budget to surplus as targeted, Gillard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
