French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
told lawmakers from his party that he’s optimistic about the
2012 presidential race,  Agence France-Presse  reported today,
citing unnamed people to whom he spoke.  “The situation feels right to me,” Sarkozy told officials
from  his Union for a Popular Movement  today in a meeting at the
Elysee Palace in Paris, AFP said. “I have come a long way.
Since 1995, I’ve gained so much knowledge of the country. French
people look at their leaders, how they behave and in hard times,
if they are strong,” he was quoted as saying by AFP.  Sarkozy hasn’t said if he will run in elections due to be
held in April and May 2012. He is the least popular post-war
president, with surveys in the past month showing he would be
eliminated in the first voting round. His approval rating was 29
percent in a Viavoice poll in  Liberation newspaper  April 11.  “When a peasant sows, an idiot by the road can’t see he’s
sowing and that he has plowed deeply for a long time,” Sarkozy
told the lawmakers, AFP reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
