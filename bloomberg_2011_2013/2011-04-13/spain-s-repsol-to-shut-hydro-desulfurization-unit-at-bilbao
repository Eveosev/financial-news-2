Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, will halt a hydro-desulfurization unit at its Petronor
refinery in Bilbao for maintenance that may lead to increased
flaring, or the release of gases into the air.  The company “is in the process of stopping the HD3 unit”
at the site in the north of the country, according to a
statement today on  Petronor’s  website. The statement didn’t give
the duration of the shutdown.  Hydro-desulfurization units remove sulfur from fuels such
as gasoline. On April 8, the company said it was halting the AK3
unit for maintenance, without specifying what it does.  The refinery has the capacity to process 220,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Flaring is
a safety measure to prevent excessive pressure from building up
in processing units that are being shut down or started up.  To contact the reporters on this story:
