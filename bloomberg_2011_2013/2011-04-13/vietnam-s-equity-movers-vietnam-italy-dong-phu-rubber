Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Vietnam trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, fell 0.7 percent to 461.01, the biggest decline
since March 25.       Vietnam Italy Steel Joint-Stock Co. (VIS VN), which
manufactures and supplies construction steels, dropped 2 percent
to 24,000 dong, the most since March 30.  The Southeast Asian nation has 393,000 metric tons of steel
in stockpiles as demand declines, the Tuoi Tre newspaper
reported, citing information from the Vietnam Steel Association.
Steel prices are expected to drop in the second quarter, the
report said, without giving specific prices.       Dong Phu Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (DPR VN), fell 0.8 percent
to 59,000 dong, the lowest since April 7.  Rubber declined for a second day as a slump in oil cut the
appeal of the commodity and Toyota Motor Corp. said its car
production in  Europe  will be halted later this month, boosting
speculation demand for tires will weaken.  The September-delivery contract lost as much as 4 percent
to 440.8 yen per kilogram ($5,250 per metric ton) before trading
at 443.2 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 10:47 a.m. The
price retreated 3.4 percent yesterday.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang. Editor:  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
