A fully owned unit of Poland’s
dominant gas supplier, known as PGNiG, will drill three wells
for  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  in potential shale deposits in the
north of the country.  PNiG Nafta  will start drilling for Calgary-based Talisman
in September under an agreement signed today, the Pila-based
company said in an e-mailed statement.  Poland’s reserves of  shale gas  may be as much as 5.2
trillion cubic meters, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said in a  report  published earlier this month,
potentially making the eastern European country a net exporter
of gas and reducing the region’s dependence on  Russia .  Shale development, where rock formations are horizontally
drilled and fractured using water and other liquids under high
pressure, is driving a surge in U.S. gas output. Poland’s
deposits have drawn interest from companies including  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  ConocoPhillips. (COP)   Talisman’s licenses are in the Baltic basin in northern
Poland. PNiG Nafta is also drilling for ConocoPhillips, and will
spud wells for Chevron in the fall .  To contact the reporter on this story:
