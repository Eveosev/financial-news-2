OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest
energy company, advanced the most in four weeks in Vienna
following a natural-gas discovery on the North West Shelf of
Australia.  OMV rose 2.7 percent to 31.97 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close
of trading in the Austrian capital, climbing the most since
March 17.  The find at the Zola-1 well is located around 100
kilometers (62 miles) from the western Australian coast,
according to a statement today.  “This represents one of the largest gas discoveries by the
company,” OMV said in the statement. “New 3D seismic data will
be acquired to further assess the potential of the discovery.”  OMV holds 20 percent of the field, while  Apache Corp. (APA) , the
operator, has 30 percent,  Santos Ltd. (STO)  25 percent, Nippon Oil
Corp. 15 percent and  Tap Oil Ltd. (TAP)  10 percent.  The discovery well and drilled sidetrack appraisal well
“confirmed the existence of sandstone layers with 130 meters of
net gas pay in an area south of the giant Gorgon gas field,”
OMV said.  Apache, a U.S. oil and natural-gas producer, and Santos,
Australia’s third-largest oil producer, announced the initial
find on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
