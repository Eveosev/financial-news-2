Venture-capital funds in the
European Union may be granted a “passport” to invest anywhere
in the EU under proposals to advance the region’s single market
and spur economic growth.  Funds established in one member state would be allowed “to
invest in any another member state,” the European Commission,
the 27-nation EU’s executive arm, said in an e-mailed statement.  The EU agreed last year to give private equity managers
access to investors across the region with a single registration
in return for signing up to transparency rules. Today’s
proposals would create a similar passport for funds supporting
businesses at an early stage of development to invest freely in
different countries.  “A clearer cross-border regulatory framework for making
venture capital investments would lower operating costs and
risks,” Ross Butler, a spokesman for the European Private
Equity and Venture Capital Association, said in an e-mailed
statement. This would lead to “more capital” flowing into
innovative small businesses, he said.  Financial Services Commissioner  Michel Barnier  is seeking
to put in place measures by the end of 2012 to improve the free
movement of goods, services and capital in the EU. Other
proposals today include plans to simplify accounting standards
and modernize public procurement rules, the commission said.  The venture capital passport would involve creating a
“common statute” for funds which is recognized across the EU,
the commission said. This would make it easier for small
businesses to get financing at an “attractive price.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
