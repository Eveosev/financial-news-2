The shekel gained for a second day
on speculation  Israel ’s March trade deficit narrowed, boosting
the chances interest rates will rise. The 10-year government
bond climbed to the highest level in almost a week.  The Bank of Israel on March 28 increased its benchmark
lending rate by a half percentage point to 3 percent, the
highest since November 2008, as inflation and growth
accelerated. The trade deficit has narrowed for two consecutive
months as exports climb. The Central Bureau of Statistics is
scheduled to release the figures at 1 p.m. in Jerusalem.  “In anticipation of good trade numbers the market may
already be pushing the shekel higher,” Eytan Admoni head of the
international department at Bank of Jerusalem, said by
telephone. “The prospects of the economy and the anticipation
of higher  interest rates  is driving the shekel.”  The shekel gained as much as 0.4 percent against the dollar
to 3.4206, the highest since September 2008, and was at 3.4243
per dollar at 12:14 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The benchmark Mimshal
Shiklit bond due January 2020 rose, pushing the yield on the 5
percent note down 2 basis points to 5.3 percent.  The economy is likely to expand 3.8 percent this year and
next, the  International Monetary Fund  said April 11, raising its
Jan. 25 estimate of 3.5 percent. Israel bounced back from the
global recession faster than many developed economies, with
growth accelerating to 7.7 percent in the last quarter of 2010,
the fastest pace in four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
