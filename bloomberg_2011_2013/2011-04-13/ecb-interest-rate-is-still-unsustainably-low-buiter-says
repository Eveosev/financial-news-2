The  European Central Bank ’s key
interest rate remains “unsustainably low” after the bank
raised it for the first time in almost three years last week,
Citigroup Inc. Chief Economist Willem Buiter said.  ECB policy makers led by President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
raised the rate to 1.25 percent from a record low of 1 percent
on April 7 and left the door open for further increases.  “Be prepared for normalization,” London-based Buiter, a
former Bank of England policy maker, said today at a conference
in Athens. “We will return to rates of 4 percent to 4.5 percent
and much more quickly than expected.”  “The coming problem globally is inflation, not
deflation,” he said. “Enjoy the low rates while they last,
they’re not going to last much longer.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
