Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
nation’s biggest lender by outlets, gained for a fifth day as it
appointed 500 agents to provide banking services across the East
African nation.  The stock rallied 25 cents, or 1 percent, to 26.25
shillings at 1:17 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the longest
winning streak since Oct. 7. A close at this level would be the
strongest since September 2008.  KCB, as the lender is known, plans to increase the number
of agents, which can facilitate deposit-taking and withdrawals,
to 2,000 by the end of the year, Chief Executive Officer, Martin
Odour-Otieno said in an e-mailed statement today.  “This will increase the penetration of the bank’s services
as it brings services closer to people,” Nairobi-based Sterling
Investment Bank Ltd. said today in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
