Asian stocks swung between gains
and losses, with the regional benchmark index near its lowest
since March 30, as  Japan â€™s carmakers advanced and commodity and
energy companies retreated.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 134.84 at
1:04 p.m. in  Tokyo , with about the same number of stocks
climbing as falling.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
