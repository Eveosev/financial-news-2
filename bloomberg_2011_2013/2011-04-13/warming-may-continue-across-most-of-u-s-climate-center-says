Most of the eastern U.S., including
 New York , has a good chance of being warmer than normal into the
end of April, according to long-term projections by the U.S.
Climate Prediction Center.  The latest 6- to 10-day and 8- to 14-day outlooks  from the
center  show a high probability for warming across the southern
half of the U.S. from California to Florida and up the East
Coast into New York and Massachusetts.  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for potential impact on planting
and yields.  From April 19 to April 23, the outlook calls for a chance
that the northern U.S. from the Pacific Northwest to the  Great
Lakes  will be cooler than normal. The potential for cooling
stretches as far south as Nebraska and northern Colorado.  In the April 21 to April 27 period, the area of potential
cooling pulls back to  South Dakota , according to the center in
Camp Springs, Maryland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
