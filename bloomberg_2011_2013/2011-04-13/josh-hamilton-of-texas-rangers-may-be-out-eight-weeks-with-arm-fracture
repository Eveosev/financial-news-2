Texas Rangers  outfielder  Josh Hamilton  may miss as many as eight weeks of the Major League
Baseball season after fracturing his arm sliding into home
plate.  Hamilton, 29, sustained a small fracture of the humerus
below his right shoulder during the first inning of the Rangers’
5-4 loss yesterday to the Detroit Tigers.  “Our medical staff said six to eight weeks is the general
rule of thumb on this injury,” Rangers General Manager Jon Daniels told MLB.com. “When he does come back, we expect him to
be 100 percent and not have any complications.”  Third-base coach Dave Anderson sent Hamilton home on a foul
popup near the Tigers’ bench when he saw no one was covering the
plate. Hamilton tried to slide head first and reached out his
right arm to touch the plate when catcher  Victor Martinez  went
for the tag and got him out.  The American League champion Rangers recalled infielder
Chris Davis from Triple-A  Round Rock  to take Hamilton’s place.
Davis was 9-for-21 with four home runs and 11 runs batted in.  “A stupid play,” Hamilton, the reigning American League
Most Valuable Player, told MLB.com. “I was thinking, ‘I don’t
want to do this, something is going to happen.’ I listened to my
coach.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
