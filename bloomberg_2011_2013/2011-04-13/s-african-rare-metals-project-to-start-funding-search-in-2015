South Africa ’s National Empowerment
Fund and its partners in a rare metals project may start raising
at least 11 billion rand ($1.6 billion) for the project in 2015,
said Setlakalane Molepo, a divisional director of the NEF.  The NEF, Industrial Development Corp., Magnesium & Metals
and Rare Metal Industries Ltd., the main investors in the
project, have spent 40 million rand to complete a pre-
feasibility study, Molepo said in a phone interview from
Johannesburg today. A follow-up study will start late this year
and take as much as 16 months to complete, he said.  “It’s too early to talk about approaching any institution
at this stage,” Molepo said. Funding will be raised
proportionality by shareholders in the project, he said.
“Between three to four years from now, we might start producing
some of these metals.”  The Rare Metal Industries project involves the
establishment of what the NEF says will be the world’s first
integrated light speciality metals plant, making titanium,
zirconium, silicon and hafnium. The preferred location for the
plant is Saldanha in South Africa’s Western Cape province.  The project, when completed, may generate sales of more
than $2 billion a year and create in excess of 2,800 permanent
jobs and another 5,000 indirect jobs, the NEF said in an e-
mailed response to questions yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
