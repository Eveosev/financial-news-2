Mateusz Szczurek, chief economist
at  ING Bank Slaski SA (BSK)  in Warsaw, comments on the consequences of
 Poland ’s higher-than-expected inflation data.  Inflation accelerated to 4.3 percent in March, the highest
rate since September 2008. The median estimate of 25 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 3.9 percent.  Szczurek commented in a note to investors today.  "The 4 percent year-on-year threshold has gained
significance of late, with two Monetary Policy Council members
openly speaking of a ‘bigger move’ to contain inflationary
expectations.  "The inflation increase makes the May central-bank rate
increase more likely, with the markets likely to contemplate a
50 basis-point increase.  "One word of caution: so far, we have a situation similar
to March this year, when after the shock January CPI jump,
Governor  Marek Belka  managed to successfully dampen rate-hike
expectations."  To contact the reporter on this story:
