Jordan, which imports almost all of
its energy supplies, is seeking to buy crude oil and natural gas
from  Azerbaijan , Petra news agency said, citing Azeri President
 Ilham Aliyev .  Azerbaijan is negotiating with  Turkey  about exporting gas
though Turkish territory and into the regional Arab Gas Network,
to which Jordan is linked, Aliyev said after talks in the Azaeri
capital, Baku. He met there with Jordan’s Minister of Industry
and Trade Hani al-Mulki, who said Jordan is seeking to diversify
its supply sources amid an increase in prices for oil and gas,
Petra reported today.  Jordan imports about 200 million cubic meters of gas each
year from Egypt to generate about 80 percent of its electricity
needs. These imports were interrupted for more than a month
after an explosion on Feb. 5 damaged part of  Egypt ’s pipeline
system during protests in the North African country.  A switch to alternative supplies during this halt in gas
imports cost Jordan about $28 million a week, Energy Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud al-Ees said on March 16.  Jordan forecasts that domestic fuel consumption will rise
to 10 million metric tons of oil equivalent by 2020, compared
with its current level of 7.5 million tons. The government
estimates that electricity demand will almost double over the
same period to 5,200 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
