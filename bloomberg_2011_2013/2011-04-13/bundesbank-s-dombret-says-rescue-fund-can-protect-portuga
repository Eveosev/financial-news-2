Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said the retooled European rescue fund and its successor
are big enough to bail out  Portugal .  “It is important to realize that these facilities are
bracing Europe even for the eventuality of further turmoil,”
Dombret said, according to the text of a speech delivered in  New
York  today. “At all events, protecting Portugal is not
overstretching the available resources.”  Dombret also said sovereign risk is the “main overarching
risk in Germany and Europe as a whole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
