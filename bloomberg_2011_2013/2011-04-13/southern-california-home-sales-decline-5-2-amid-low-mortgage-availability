Southern California  home sales fell
5.2 percent in March from a year earlier as buyers waited for
prices to drop and mortgages were hard to get, according to
 DataQuick Information Systems Inc.   A total of 19,412 houses and condominiums sold in Los
Angeles, Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties, compared with 20,476 in March 2010, the San
Diego-based data seller said today in a statement. Foreclosure
properties and homes purchased for less than the amount owed on
the loan, known as short sales, accounted for more than half of
transactions.  “We got off to a slow start with sales this year and it
doesn’t look like that will change anytime soon,”  John Walsh ,
DataQuick’s president, said in the statement. An increase in
mortgage availability and “another round of price corrections”
would help boost sales, he said.  The number of purchases last month was 21 percent below the
March average since 1988, DataQuick said. All-cash sales were
almost 31 percent of the total, up from a 28 percent share a
year earlier and more than double the 10-year average.  Sales fell in five of six counties, with San Bernardino
declining the most, 14 percent, and Riverside falling 7.5
percent.  Ventura  had the only gain, 2.4 percent.  The median price in Southern California was $280,500 last
month, up 2 percent from February, and down 1.6 percent from a
year earlier, the data firm said. Five of six counties had
declines from March 2010, with Riverside unchanged at $198,000.  Prices dropped 6.9 percent to a median $349,000 in Ventura
County, 2.7 percent to $320,000 in  Los Angeles , 1.5 percent to
$325,000 in San Diego, 1.3 percent to $150,000 in San
Bernardino, and 0.5 percent to $430,000 in Orange, according to
DataQuick.  The company compiles county records and supplies data to
public agencies, lenders and title companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
