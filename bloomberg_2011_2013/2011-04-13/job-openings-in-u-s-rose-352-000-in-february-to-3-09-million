Job openings in the U.S. increased
in February by the most since December 2004, a sign companies
are turning more optimistic about hiring.  The number of positions waiting to be filled rose by
352,000 to 3.09 million, the Labor Department said today in a
statement posted on its website. The number of people hired and
the number of workers fired also increased.  Private payrolls rose by 230,000 in March, capping the
strongest two-month gain since 2006, Labor Department data
showed April 1. Hiring must accelerate and continue to broaden
out across industries to restore the more than 8.75 million jobs
lost as a result of the recession.  “We have seen a pickup in job growth in the last couple of
months that has yet to be confirmed by higher job openings,”
 Jonathan Basile , a senior economist at Credit Suisse in  New
York , said before the report. “Private-sector surveys are
pointing toward some better outcomes.”  Job openings increased 13 percent in February from a
revised 2.74 million in January, the Labor Department report
showed. The level of job openings in February was the highest
since September 2008.  Retail sales rose in March for a ninth straight month,
indicating the improving job market is helping Americans cope
with higher food and fuel prices, Commerce Department showed
today. Purchases increased 0.4 percent after a 1.1 percent gain
February that was larger than initially reported.  Business Services  The gain was led by a 216,000 increase in openings at
professional and business services, which include accountants,
computer systems experts and temporary-help agencies. The
leisure and hospitality industry had an 81,000 increase in
openings in February. Government had 11,000 more openings.  Construction showed a 2,000 increase in job openings.
Retail trade posted a 28,000 decrease, transportation and
utilities had a 17,000 decline, and manufacturing had a 3,000
drop, according to the data.  Today’s report helps shed light on the dynamics behind the
monthly employment figures. Private payrolls rose in March after
a 240,000 gain the prior month, Labor Department figures showed
on April 1.  Employers took on 3.91 million workers in February, 138,000
more than the previous month, according to today’s report. Total
firings, which exclude retirements and those who left their jobs
voluntarily, increased to 1.59 million from 1.54 million a month
before.  Voluntary Leavers  An increase in the number of people voluntarily leaving
jobs may be one sign Americans feel more confident about finding
other work. About 1.92 million people quit their jobs in
February, representing 51 percent of all separations. That was
up from 1.68 million, or 46 percent, in January.  In the 12 months ended in February, the economy created a
net 1.2 million jobs, representing about 47.6 million hires
compared with about 46.4 million separations, today’s report
showed.  “The economic recovery continued to proceed at a moderate
pace, with a further gradual improvement in labor-market
conditions,” Federal Reserve policy makers said in minutes of
their March 15 meeting released last week.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest restaurant chain by
revenue, is seeking about 50,000 workers in the U.S. during its
National Hiring Day event on April 19, the company said in a
news release last week.  Compared with the 13.7 million Americans who were
unemployed in February, today’s figures indicate there were 4.4
people vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the
recession began in December 2007. The number of jobless fell to
13.5 million last month, pushing the  unemployment rate  down to
8.8 percent from 8.9 percent in February, the Labor Department
reported April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
