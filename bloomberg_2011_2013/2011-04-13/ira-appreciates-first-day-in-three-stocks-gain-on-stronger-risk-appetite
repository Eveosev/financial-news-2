The lira rallied, following the
biggest two-day decline in a month, and stocks rebounded on
optimism the country’s economy will benefit from the global
economic recovery.  The lira strengthened as much as 0.8 percent, the biggest
one-day gain in a week, and traded 0.4 percent higher at 1.5172
against the dollar at 5:36 p.m. in Istanbul. The  ISE National
100 index (XU100)  added 0.3 percent to close at 68,203.43.  Brazil ’s real and  South Korea ’s won led gains among
developing-nation currencies and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index
rallied as investors speculated the global economy will weather
a possible slowdown in  Japan . Emerging economies will probably
expand 6.5 percent this year, more than double the 2.4 percent
growth for advanced nations, the  International Monetary Fund 
said April 11.  “We expect the positive sentiment for emerging-market
currencies to continue at least in the medium term because of
the difference in growth projections between the developed and
emerging markets,” Henza Tukel, a currency trader at Turk
Ekonomi Bankasi AS, said in e-mailed comments.  Turkey ’s economic growth accelerated to 9.2 percent in the
fourth quarter, the government said March 31. Foreign investors
were net buyers of Turkish stocks and bonds every week in the
four weeks through April 1, according to the central bank.  The lira is expected to appreciate to 1.500 against per
dollar in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 1.480 in the first
quarter of 2012, a median estimate of 14 banks surveyed by
Bloomberg showed.  Bond Yields  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell 1 basis points, 0.01
percentage points, to 8.68 percent, according to the RBS
Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  “There is talk among some market participants that one of
the biggest sovereign investment funds is diversifying fixed-
income holdings by buying Turkish bonds,” Isik Okte, a trader
at Finans Invest, said in e-mailed comments.  The Treasury raised 3.51 billion liras ($2.3 billion) in
the sale of bonds due February 2013 yesterday, priced to yield
an average of 8.88 percent, the lowest borrowing costs in two
months and down from 9.01 percent at the previous auction of
two-year debt on March 8, according to the government’s website.  “People wanted to switch to the new benchmark and they had
sold the old benchmark bonds, but they could not buy as much as
they wanted in the auction,” Gurol Ozer, head of fixed-income
trading at Denizbank AS in Istanbul, told by telephone. Buying
from these investors is driving the yields down today, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
