European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Mario Draghi  said that Italy will need annual
economic growth of about 2 percent and a balanced budget to meet
the European rules on public debt.  “If the growth nears 2 percent yearly, the rule on debt
will be met, provided that the rule on balanced budgets is met
too,” Draghi, who also heads the  Bank of Italy , said today in a
speech in Turin, Italy.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday forecast that
Italy’s economy would expand 1.1 percent this year and 1.3
percent next year.  The European Union last month reached an agreement on
tougher economic oversight rules for member countries, including
fines for governments that don’t cut overall debt fast enough.
The accord came after  Italy , with debt of 118.9 percent of gross
domestic product last year, pushed for a broader definition of
government borrowing that may offer a better chance of avoiding
future sanctions for violators of the debt rules.  While countries with debt over 60 percent of GDP will be
required to make annual cuts equal to 1/20th of the excess,
progress will be judged against a range of “relevant factors,”
the ministers agreed. Italy has pushed for private debt levels,
which are low in Italy compared with the EU average, to be
included in the gauge.  “For Italians, the union is the essential condition for
further progress,” said Draghi, who is a possible successor to
 Jean-Claude Trichet  when the ECB president’s term expires later
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
