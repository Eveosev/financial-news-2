Treasury 10-year yields may climb
to a two-month high of 3.75 percent if they rise above so-called
resistance at 3.61 percent, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
said, citing trading patterns.  Benchmark rates increased to 3.61 percent on April 8, a
level that represents a 76.4 percent retracement of their
decline from a one-year high of 4 percent on April 5, 2010, to a
low of 2.33 percent on Oct. 8, based on a series of numbers
known as the Fibonacci sequence.  “Yields have had a tendency to peak in April-June in the
past five years, so they may rise toward 3.75 percent if they
breach the resistance level,” said Kenichi Imai, chief manager
of proprietary trading in  Tokyo  at the unit of  Japan ’s largest
financial group.  The benchmark 10-year note yielded 3.51 percent as of 9:23
a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
last time the yield was at 3.75 percent was on Feb. 9.  Ten-year yields are unlikely to rise as high as 4 percent,
given the assumption that Federal Reserve officials are
reluctant to tighten monetary policy and will not increase
 interest rates  this year, Imai said.  “With inflation expectations rising, this week’s price
reports and debt auctions are likely to spur gains in Treasury
yields,” Imai said.  The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities widened to 2.67
percentage points on April 11, the most since March 2008.  Ten-year yields will increase to 3.75 percent by the end of
September and 3.90 percent by year-end, according to the
weighted average forecasts of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance or below support indicates a currency may
move to the next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
