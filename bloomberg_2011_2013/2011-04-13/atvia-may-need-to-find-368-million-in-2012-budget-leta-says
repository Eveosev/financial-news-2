Latvia’s government may need to
find as much as 180 million lati ($368 million) in measures in
the country’s 2012 budget, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis
said, according to the  Leta  newswire.  The two-party governing coalition agreed today to find
between 150 million lati and 180 million lati, Dombrovskis said,
the Riga-based newswire reported.  The government will also be able to use an unspecified part
of the 600 million euros ($869.6 million) that has been set
aside for bank stabilization instead to finance the country’s
budget deficit, Dombrovskis said, Leta reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
