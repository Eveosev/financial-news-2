Latin American government spending
is expansionary and hasn’t adapted to a new phase of the global
recovery, putting the region’s future economic growth at risk,
the  World Bank  said.  Economies in Latin America and the Caribbean, which
rebounded from the 2009 recession by expanding about 6 percent
last year, will grow as much as 5 percent in 2011, the bank said
in a report today. Primary budget surpluses are lower than they
were before the 2008-2009 crisis, the lender said.  Fiscal policy has put a burden on Latin America’s central
bankers who are acting to contain inflation while also seeking
to prevent currencies from appreciating too quickly, the
multilateral lender said. Increased government savings would
better balance fiscal and monetary policy, allowing the region
to achieve longer term growth, the World Bank said.  “Fiscal policy has fallen behind the curve,” the World
Bank said in the report, titled “Success Put to the Test.”
“The policy mix has become unbalanced, with monetary policy
over-burdened and fiscal policy falling short of the
contribution it should provide.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
