The Ankara Bar Association called
for the abolition of  Turkey ’s special criminal courts, which are
leading investigations into alleged coup plots against the
government.  “Our request is that all political parties declare in
their elections manifestos that they will abolish the special
criminal courts and never again allow there to be two separate
legal processes in Turkey,” the association said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Prosecutors who have been granted special powers to raid,
imprison and investigate alleged crimes against the constitution
or the state are weakening the justice system and democracy in
Turkey, it said.  The investigations have ensnared dozens of military
officers as well as academics and journalists accused of joining
conspiracies to overthrow Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s
government.  “The existential reason for these courts is to solidify
state authority and the political thoughts of the administration
through the judiciary,” the bar association said. “Making the
courts partial to any political line of thinking is
unacceptable.”  Turkish parliamentary elections are scheduled for June 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
