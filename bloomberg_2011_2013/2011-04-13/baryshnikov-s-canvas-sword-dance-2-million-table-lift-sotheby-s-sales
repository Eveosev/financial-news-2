Sotheby’s  Russian sales in New York
yesterday saw their strongest results in three years, propelled
by a Soviet space capsule, a painting of  St. Petersburg  owned by
Mikhail Baryshnikov and an 1830s table.  The two-part auction of Russian paintings and works of art
tallied $16.1 million, surpassing the high presale estimate of
$15.8 million and was 18 percent higher than the equivalent sale
in 2010.  Shortly after the auction ended, the room filled up again
with adults and children who came to see the sale of the space
capsule that orbited the Earth as the final test before Yuri Gagarin’s flight on April 12, 1961.  The Vostok 3KA-2 sold for $2.9 million to Yevgeny Yurchenko, chairman of the Moscow-based investment fund AS
Popov. The price surpassed the low end of the lot’s presale
estimate of $2 million to $10 million. The prices include
buyer’s commission; the estimates don’t.  “I expected it to go a little bit higher,” said Manny
Demos, 12, a student at the  Cathedral School  in  Manhattan , who
attended as part of a field trip. “But I did expect it to be
bought by a Russian.”  The Russian sales showed a continued flight to quality.
More than 30 percent of lots failed to sell while exceptional
objects ignited strong bidding.  “No one wants the run-of-the-mill stuff, even if it’s
inexpensive,” said  John Atzbach , a Redmond, Washington-based
dealer in imperial Russian objects. “Collectors want unusual,
exciting things. And it’s not just in the Russian field. It’s in
every art and antique category.”  St. Petersburg  Baryshnikov’s painting, “View of St. Petersburg” by Petr
Vereshchagin attracted five bidders and sold for $746,500,
compared with a presale estimate of $300,000 to $500,000. The
buyer was identified as Boris Fuchsmann, a private German
collector. The proceeds will go to the dancer’s  Baryshnikov Arts
Center  in Manhattan.  A sun-drenched 1887 canvas by Henryk Siemiradzki titled
“The Sword Dance” fetched $2.1 million, more than doubling its
high estimate of $800,000. It set a record for the artist.  A micro-mosaic table made by  Italy ’s Barberi workshop for
the Russian court in the early 1830s soared to almost $2
million, up from the presale estimate of $400,000 to $600,000.  The trend continued at Christie’s sale of Russian art
today. Boris Grigoriev’s arresting portrait of two New York
sisters, “Les Enfants” (1922-23), fetched $1.3 million against
the estimate range of $600,000 to $800,000.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
