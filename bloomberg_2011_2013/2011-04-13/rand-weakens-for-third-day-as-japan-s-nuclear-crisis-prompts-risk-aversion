The rand declined to the weakest
level in almost two weeks after breaking through a key technical
level, suggesting the currency may extend losses.  South Africa ’s currency depreciated as much as 0.6 percent
to 6.7727 per dollar, the lowest intraday level since April 1,
and traded 0.5 percent weaker at 6.7710 at 4:28 p.m. in
Johannesburg. It depreciated 0.5 percent to 9.8062 per euro, a
fourth day of decreases.  The rand retreated for a third day after breaking through
6.6819 late yesterday, which represented a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement level, according to Johannesburg-based
Tradition Analytics. The currency tumbled the most in a month
yesterday on concern the crisis in  Japan  will damp demand for
South Africa’s exports. Japan is the third-biggest buyer of
South African goods, according to government data.  “Developments in Japan will probably restrict the extent
of rand strength,” Tradition Analytics analysts led by Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in a research report today. After weakening
beyond the key Fibonacci level, the currency may weaken to 6.85,
they wrote.  Fibonacci analysis uses ratios, which are based on the
sequence identified by an Italian mathematician in the 13th
century, to predict support and resistance levels for prices.
Support is where buy orders may be clustered, while resistance
is where there may be sell orders.  Government bonds  dropped for a third day. The 13.5 percent
security due 2015 slid 9 cents to 120.89, driving the yield up 2
basis points, 0.02 percentage point, to 7.80 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
