The franc fell against all but two
of its 16 most-actively traded counterparts as equities gained,
stoking demand for higher-yielding assets.  Switzerland’s currency snapped two days of gains versus the
euro as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares rose for the first
day in three, climbing 1 percent. The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index added 0.6
percent. A report showed Swiss producer and import prices rose
in line with forecasts last month. The  Swiss National Bank  sold
10-year bonds.  “The franc’s lower as equity markets have rebounded, and
we’ve had a correction in risk appetite,” said  Chris Walker , a
foreign-exchange strategist at UBS AG in  London . “Markets are
looking at data, and the PPI numbers were in line with
consensus.”  The Swiss currency depreciated as much as 0.4 percent
versus the euro, before trading 0.1 percent weaker at 1.3005 as
of 2:40 p.m. in London. It was little changed at 89.76 centimes
per dollar.  Prices for products ranging from factory to farm goods as
well as imports climbed 0.4 percent from a year ago, the Federal
Statistics Office in Neuchatel,  Switzerland , said in an e-mailed
statement today. In the month, prices also rose 0.4 percent, in
line with forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  The SNB sold 313.7 million francs of 2 percent bonds due
April 2021 at an average yield of 2.129 percent. Investors bid
for 2.55 times the amount of securities on offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
