China ’s government bonds gained,
with the yield dropping to the lowest level in three months, as
the Ministry of Finance sold debt at a lower rate than
predicted.  The finance ministry sold 34.74 billion yuan ($5.3 billion)
of five-year notes at 3.41 percent, according to traders at
firms required to bid at government debt auctions. That compared
with the 3.45 percent median forecast of 14 finance companies in
a Bloomberg survey yesterday. A central bank report this week
will show banks extended 2.2 trillion yuan of new loans in the
last quarter, 15 percent less than in the same period of 2010,
according to a separate survey.  “When banks are looking for alternatives to loans, medium-
term to long-term bonds are the best choices because they have
relatively high yields,” said Chen Liang, a bond analyst in
Shenzhen at Guohai Securities Co.  The yield on the 3.64 percent government bond due December
2015 dropped two basis points to 3.42 percent as of 9:36 a.m. in
 Shanghai , the lowest level since Jan. 13, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 2.01 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It touched 1.9 percent, the lowest
level since March 17.  Swap Rates  “The slowdown in bank lending leaves abundant cash in the
banking system,” said Pang Aihua, a bond analyst in Beijing at
China Citic Bank Co., a unit of the country’s biggest state
investment company. “The loose liquidity will provide a good
environment for the central bank to raise reserve-requirement
ratios.”  China has increased the reserve-requirement ratio three
times this year, and by 50 basis points in each instance, to
limit the risk of asset bubbles. The central bank has also
raised borrowing costs twice since the start of 2011.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, were unchanged
at 3.31 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The highest winning bid yield at the sale was 3.43 percent,
traders at the finance companies required to bid at the auctions
said. The  finance ministry  issued similar-maturity bonds at 3.6
percent at a sale on Feb. 16.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Ven Ram,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
