Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, the
investment bank that focuses on financial-services clients,
hired a team of five people for its fixed-income group in
 Chicago .  David Connelly, who will manage the company’s fixed-income
distribution in the Midwest; and  Scott Buchta , a strategist, are
both joining as managing directors from Braver Stern Securities
LLC, the New York-based firm said today in an e-mailed
statement. They previously worked at Guggenheim Securities,
which they joined from Bear Stearns Cos.  Sandler O’Neill expects that Connelly will help in
“further broadening the firm’s relationships with non-bank
financial companies such as insurance companies and money
managers,” according to the statement.  The investment bank also hired Brian Vanselow,  Kevin Smith 
and Michael Piper for fixed-income sales, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
