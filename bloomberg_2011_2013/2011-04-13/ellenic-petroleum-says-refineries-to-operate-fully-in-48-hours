Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE) , Greece’s
largest oil refiner, said full production is expected in two
days following the suspension of worker strikes that began on
April 3.  Full capacity is expected “within 48 hours,” the Athens-
based company said today in an e-mailed response to questions.
Oil-processing had been reduced because of the protests that
were initially expected to last 10 days.  Workers at Hellenic’s three refineries have resumed talks
with management over new collective work agreements. Labor
unions said on April 8 they were extending the  strike action  to
April 19 because of a breakdown in discussions.  The three plants can process 312,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
