Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  was
given a final fine of 10.2 million pounds ($16.6 million) by a
U.K. regulator for halting supplies of a heartburn medicine to
the  National Health Service  to block sales of a generic version.  The fine, disclosed and provisionally accepted in October,
was lowered from 12 million pounds after Reckitt, the world’s
biggest maker of household cleaners, admitted violating U.K. and
European competition law and cooperated in the case, the  Office
of Fair Trading  said today in a statement.  “This action demonstrates both our willingness to take
action against companies abusing dominant positions, and to
impose fines that will deter other businesses from engaging in
anticompetitive behavior,” OFT Chief Executive Officer John Fingleton said in the statement.  Reckitt, based in Slough,  England , admitted dropping the
drug,  Gaviscon Original Liquid , too quickly from the service’s
prescription channel in 2005 to boost sales of a version with an
active patent and before its generic name had been published,
according to the OFT. The move blocked doctors from prescribing
a cheaper generic version and ensured more prescriptions for the
newer product, Gaviscon Advance Liquid, which has a patent that
doesn’t expire until 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
