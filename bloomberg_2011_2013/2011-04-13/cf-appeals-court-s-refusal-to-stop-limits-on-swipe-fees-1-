TCF National Bank appealed a lower-
court decision rejecting its request to block forthcoming
federal rules limiting the amount of money the largest U.S.
banks can collect for debit-card transactions.  TCF, a unit of  TCF Financial Corp. (TCB) , sued Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and the Fed’s Board of Governors in
October, challenging the legislation included in last year’s
Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul bill. TCF claims the
rules, which aren’t final, are unconstitutional.  U.S. District Judge Lawrence L. Piersol, in  Sioux Falls ,
 South Dakota , on April 4 denied TCF’s request for a preliminary
injunction, while rejecting the defendants request to throw out
the suit.  TCF filed its notice yesterday.  The case is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke, 10-cv-04149,
U.S. District Court, District of South Dakota (Sioux Falls).  To contact the reporter on this story:
