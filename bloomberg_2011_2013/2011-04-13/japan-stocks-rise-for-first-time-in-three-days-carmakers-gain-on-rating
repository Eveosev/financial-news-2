Japanese stocks rose for the first
time in three days led by carmakers after Nomura Holdings Inc.
called the shares “oversold,” and  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.
jumped on a report other utilities may be asked to share the
cost of the Fukushima nuclear accident.  Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co., the Japan’s second-
and third-largest automakers, rose at least 2.9 percent.  Renesas
Electronics Corp. (6723) , a chipmaker that supplies the country’s
carmakers, advanced 7.6 percent after a report it will restart a
factory damaged in last month’s earthquake ahead of schedule.
Tokyo Electric surged 12 percent, while Kansai Electric Power
Co. and other utilities plunged.  “Some auto and electronics makers are getting ready to
restart manufacturing, which means the fog is starting to
clear,” said Naoki Fujiwara, who helps oversee $6 billion in
Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.9 percent to 9,641.18
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo, after earlier falling
as much 0.4 percent. The broader Topix index gained 0.7 percent
to 844.59 with more than twice as many stocks advancing as
declining. The Topix has lost 9.3 percent since a record
earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that devastated  Japan ’s
northeast coast and crippled a Tokyo Electric plant in
Fukushima.  Carmakers Rise  Honda advanced 3.3 percent to 2,957 yen and was the biggest
single support for the Topix. Nissan climbed 2.9 percent to 716
yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  rose 1.4 percent to 3,285 yen.  Nomura yesterday reiterated its “buy” rating on Honda,
saying the stock was oversold and the company’s earnings will
recover sharply in the second-half of the fiscal year. The
brokerage said Nissan’s earnings would also rebound after last
month’s disaster damaged supply chains and disrupted production.  Automakers also got a boost after the Nikkei newspaper said
Renesas Electronics, a supplier of chips used in cars, will
restart production in June, one month ahead of schedule, at a
plant damaged by the quake. The chipmaker gained 7.6 percent to
698 yen.  “It’s good news for the whole  auto industry ,” said Yutaka Yoshii, a strategist at Tokyo-based Mito Securities Co.  Tokyo Electric surged 12 percent to 502 yen after the
Yomiuri newspaper reported the government may ask other Japanese
utilities to contribute as much as 50 billion yen ($595 million)
for each nuclear plant they operate to compensate victims of
Tepco’s accident.  Kansai, Chubu Fall  While Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the
government has no such plan, shares of other power companies
fell. Kansai Electric slumped 4.1 percent to 1,779 yen. Chubu
Electric Power Co. dropped 3.1 percent to 1,860 yen. Kyushu
Electric Power Co. sank 3.6 percent to 1,575 yen.  Commodity-related companies declined after crude and metal
prices plunged.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest energy exploration
company, declined 1.6 percent to 610,000 yen.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. (1662) , the country’s second-biggest driller, retreated
2 percent to 3,930 yen.  Crude oil for May delivery fell yesterday for a third day,
dropping 3.3 percent to $106.25 a barrel in  New York , the lowest
settlement since March 30, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
forecast a “substantial” correction in prices of the fuel. The
 International Energy Agency  and  International Monetary Fund  said
 oil prices  above $100 are starting to hurt the global economy.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s largest commodities trader, lost
0.4 percent to 2,241 yen. Mitsui & Co., the second-biggest,
declined 1.4 percent to 1,451 yen.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 2.4 percent
yesterday, the most since March 9.  J. Front Retailing Co., a department-store operator,
tumbled 5 percent to 326 yen, the biggest drop on the Nikkei,
after the company reported net income that missed its forecast
by 8.6 percent. The Tokyo-based company also projected profit
will decline 49 percent this year amid lower consumer sentiment
following last month’s disaster.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
