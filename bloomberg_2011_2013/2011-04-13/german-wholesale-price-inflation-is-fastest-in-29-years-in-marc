German wholesale-price inflation
accelerated to the fastest pace in more than 29 years in March.  Wholesale prices rose 10.9 percent from a year earlier, the
most since October 1981, after increasing an annual 10.8 percent
in February, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said in
an e-mailed statement today. In the month, prices rose 1.3
percent.  Wholesale prices for grain, seed and animal feed soared
75.9 percent in the year, the statistics office said, while
coffee, tea and cocoa were 49.9 percent more expensive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
