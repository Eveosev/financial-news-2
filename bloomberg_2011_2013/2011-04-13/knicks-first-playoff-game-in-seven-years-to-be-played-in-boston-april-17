The  New York Knicks  will play their
first National Basketball Association postseason game in seven
years on April 17 in Boston.  The NBA released the dates, start times and television
coverage plans today for the opening games in each of the
Eastern Conference’s four first-round playoff series.  The  Boston Celtics  will host the Knicks at TD Garden in the
series opener at 7 p.m. local time. It will be shown on Turner
Broadcasting’s TNT network.  Boston, which lost in the NBA Finals last year, is the
third seed in the East, while the sixth-seeded Knicks are back
in the playoffs for the first time since 2004.  The first three games in the Eastern Conference playoffs
will be played on April 16.  The top-seeded Chicago Bulls host the  Indiana Pacers  at 1
p.m. Eastern time on Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN network, followed by
the Philadelphia 76ers visiting the second-seeded Miami Heat at
3:30 p.m. That game will be televised by ABC.  The final series-opener that day features the Orlando Magic
hosting the  Atlanta Hawks  at 7 p.m. on ESPN.  The NBA said its full playoff schedule will be released
later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
