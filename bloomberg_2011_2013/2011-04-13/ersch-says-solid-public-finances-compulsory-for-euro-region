European Central Bank Governing
Council member Yves Mersch said solid public finances are a
“compulsory prerequisite” for the stability of the euro.  “Discretionary stabilization measures” for  Greece ,
Ireland and Portugal “have provided time which must be used to
improve the economic and fiscal framework,” Mersch said in
Berlin today. Proposals to strengthen the Stability and Growth
Pact “fall considerably short of the ECB’s understanding of a
quantum leap,” he said. “True automatism to impose sanctions
in case of non-compliance would be needed.”  The region is not facing a crisis of the euro, rather a
crisis of public finances in some countries, said Mersch, who
heads Luxembourg’s central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
