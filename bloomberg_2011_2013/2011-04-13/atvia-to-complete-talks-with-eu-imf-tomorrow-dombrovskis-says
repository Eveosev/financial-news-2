Latvia  will complete talks with
international lenders tomorrow to unlock more money from its 7.5
billion-euro ($10.9 billion) loan, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said.  “It’s provisionally planned that we will complete talks on
Thursday, and now it looks as if the talks will be completed
successfully and the mission finished,” Dombrovskis said today
on  Latvian Independent Television’s  900 Seconds. Lawmakers will
vote on amendments to the 2011 budget tomorrow.  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  for a bailout in 2008 after its
second-biggest bank collapsed. The Baltic country, which has
passed austerity measures equal to about 16 percent of economic
output, saw its budget deficit fall to a preliminary 7.6 percent
last year, 1 percentage point less than the limit set by the
lenders, the statistics office said April 11.  The lenders may let Latvia shift some of the money set
aside for bank stabilization to deficit financing, and estimate
the size of additional spending cuts and revenue increases
needed in next year’s budget, Dombrovskis said. The country’s
memorandum of understanding with its lenders may be published at
the end of May or early June, he said.  The government expects to pass additional budget measures
tomorrow to cut the deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP this year.
Latvia plans to bring the gap below the EU limit of 3 percent in
2012 and adopt the euro two years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
