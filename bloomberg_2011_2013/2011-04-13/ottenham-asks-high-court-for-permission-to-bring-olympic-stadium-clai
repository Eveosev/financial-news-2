Tottenham Hotspur soccer club has
asked the U.K. High Court for permission to bring a claim over a
loan that will help West Ham United take over as occupant of the
London Olympic stadium after the 2012 Games.  The London Borough of Newham arranged the loan to finance
West Ham’s move to the facility, Tottenham said on its website.
The north London team said it wrote to Newham “asking it to
explain its reasons and justification for its decision, but
Newham has declined to respond to this request for
information.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
