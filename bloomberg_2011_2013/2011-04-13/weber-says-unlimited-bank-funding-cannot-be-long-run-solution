European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Axel Weber  said the unlimited refinancing of
banks in the euro region can’t be maintained for the long term.  “Unlimited provision of central bank liquidity to banks
without a sustainable business model cannot be a long-run
solution,” Weber said in a speech in St. Louis today.
“ Monetary policy  should not act as a substitute for tasks of
other policy areas. In particular, monetary policy should not
and cannot persistently replace the repair of banks’ balance
sheets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
