European banks are holding more
than 1.3 trillion euros ($1.9 trillion) of loans they are trying
to sell, a process that could take as long as a decade, a study
by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP found.  “Corporate loan books that aggressively expanded over a
short number of years will take the longest to unwind,” Richard Thompson, a partner at London-based PwC, said in today’s report.
“High levels of government support in some markets have allowed
the banks a more leisurely timescale for divesting their non-
core and non-performing loans.”  German banks held about 225 billion euros of bad loans in
2010, up from 210 billion euros in 2009, PwC said. U.K. lenders
had about 175 billion euros of such loans last year, compared
with 155 billion euros the previous year.  The amount of non-performing loans across  Europe  increased
by 15 percent, or 100 billion euros, in 2010, compared with the
prior year, PwC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
