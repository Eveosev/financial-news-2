Porsche SE has had a high
acceptance rate for its 5 billion-euro share sale and has not
extended the offer period, a person familiar with the matter
said.  Porsche is still tabulating the final results of the share
sale that ended at midnight, the person said, declining to be
identified because the results are not yet public.  Porsche will make a statement on the completion of the share
sale tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
