The German government stripped five
Libyan diplomats of their consular duties and ordered them to
leave the country within seven days, saying the envoys were
“exerting pressure” on Libyan citizens in  Germany .  Foreign Ministry spokesman Andreas Peschke didn’t specify
what activities the diplomats were engaged in, except that they
were “incompatible with diplomatic duties.” The Libyan
ambassador was summoned to the ministry today and told the five
were considered “persona non grata” with immediate effect.  “An expulsion of this nature is indeed the last means that
can be used against diplomats in a host country and is very
rarely implemented,” Peschke told reporters in Berlin. “The
fact that this is such a large group of diplomats is also very
rare. No such similar case comes to mind in recent times.”  The ministry has evidence that the diplomats working for
Muammar Qaddafi’s government in Tripoli were engaged in
violations, Peschke said, without elaborating. The diplomats
have a week to prepare their departure with their families.  An employee who answered the phone at the Libyan embassy in
Berlin was unable to confirm the expulsion and no staff members
authorized to speak to a journalist was available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
