African swine fever “may
potentially” spread from southern Russia to the Central and
Volga federal districts, where up to 70 percent of national pork
production is concentrated, Interfax reported.  The  news agency  cited Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik ,
who spoke at a veterinary congress today. Swine-fever outbreaks
were registered in eight Russian regions in 2010 and 57,800 hogs
have been slaughtered, Interfax said, citing a ministry
statement distributed at the congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
