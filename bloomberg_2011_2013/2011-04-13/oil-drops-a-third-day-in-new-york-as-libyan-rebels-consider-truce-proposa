Oil rose for the first time in
three days before an Energy Department report forecast to show
that gasoline supplies declined for an eighth week in the U.S.,
the world’s largest crude consumer.  Gasoline stockpiles probably declined 1 million barrels
from 216.7 million barrels in the longest stretch of declines
since the summer of 2008, according to a Bloomberg survey of
analysts before today’s data. Oil dropped as much as 0.6 percent
in  London  earlier as Libyan rebels said they would accept a
Turkey peace proposal if it includes an agreement for leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  to relinquish power.  “I’m not convinced we’ve seen the highs for the moment,”
said Gerrit Zambo, a trader at Bayerische of Landesbank in
Munich. “I’m more bullish for oil because we still see further
demand growth and the danger of unrest spreading to other oil-
producing countries.”  Brent oil for May settlement climbed as much as $1.27 to
$122.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, trading for $121.69 as of 12:57 p.m. Yesterday, the
contract declined $3.06, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $120.92,
the lowest since April 1.  Crude oil for May delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent to
$106.97 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, and was at
$106.69 a barrel at 12:58 p.m. London time. Yesterday, the
contract fell $3.67 to $106.25, the lowest close since March 30.  Brent Premium Widens  Brent, the European benchmark, traded at a premium of
$15.01 a barrel to U.S. futures today, compared with $14.67
yesterday. The difference between front-month contracts in
London and New York surged to a record $19.54 on Feb. 21 as
unrest spread in the Middle East and North  Africa  and stockpiles
climbed at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New York
futures. The spread averaged 76 cents last year.  Today’s Energy Department report, to be published at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , may show crude supplies increased 1 million
barrels, according to 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  New York futures plunged 3.3 percent yesterday after the
 International Energy Agency  reported signs of an oil-demand
slowdown and as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast a
“substantial” correction.  The U.S., the world’s largest economy, will expand 2.8
percent this year, down from 2.9 percent last year and a 3
percent growth rate for 2011 forecast in January, the IMF said
April 11. It cut  Japan ’s 2011 growth forecast to 1.4 percent
from 1.6 percent in a January forecast.  Libyan rebels said Qaddafi’s forces are stepping up attacks
on Misrata and firing rockets into the city, and appealed for
international help ahead of a meeting with their U.S.-led allies
in Qatar. The country has the largest crude reserves in Africa.  “A small pullback is to be expected if the Libya situation
is resolved but it would just be speculatively driven,” said
 Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London. “But
we don’t know the damage done to the oil infrastructure. Any
genuine return of Libyan supplies has been written off.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
