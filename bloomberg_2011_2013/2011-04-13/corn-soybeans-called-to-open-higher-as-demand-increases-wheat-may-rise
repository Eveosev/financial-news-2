What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that demand
from producers of livestock feed and grain-based fuel will
rebound following a 3 percent drop yesterday, said  Christian Mayer , a market analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
in  Minneapolis .  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on bets that demand from consumers and investors will
increase following the 4.5 percent price drop in the past two
days and the dollarâ€™s slide, Mayer said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.25 cent to 0.4 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open up $1 to $2 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as dry weather threatens to reduce yields of U.S.
winter grain, while areas that produce spring varieties face
planting delays from low temperatures and rain, Mayer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
