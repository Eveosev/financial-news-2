Sunil Mitra,  India ’s revenue
secretary in the finance ministry, comments on inflation at a
business conference held in the eastern city of Kolkata today.  “Supply side bottlenecks can’t be done away with in one
year. The rate at which commodity prices are increasing globally,
you have to learn to live with inflation or forget about growth.  The federal government’s “budget can’t tackle inflation.
All the budget can do is ensure that there’s nothing that would
further add to inflation. It’s the  monetary policy  that should
tackle inflation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
