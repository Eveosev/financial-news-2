Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  started an
alkylation unit at its Catlettsburg refinery in  Kentucky ,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation.  The unit was shut down so workers could fix a defective
weld that caused a leak last week, said one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the information isnâ€™t public.  Shane Pochard, a Findlay, Ohio-based company spokesman,
declined to comment.  The refinery shut a unit April 6 after a release of
hydrogen fluoride, according to a  filing  with the National
Response Center. The release occurred from a pinhole leak in
piping, according to the filing. The unit was shut, and workers
were isolating it at the time of the filing.  Hydrogen fluoride is used as a catalyst in alkylation
units, which produce blending components to raise the octane
value of gasoline.  U.S. refineries must notify the center if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  The refinery has a capacity of 240,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
