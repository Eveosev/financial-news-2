Incoming European Central Bank
Executive Board member Peter Praet said  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis won’t be helped by “looser  monetary policy ,” CNBC
reported, citing an interview.  Praet said the “biggest contribution” a central bank can
make is keeping inflation expectations anchored at a time of
commodity-price increases, CNBC reported on its website.  Praet, a National Bank of Belgium board member who will
succeed Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell at the Frankfurt-based ECB on
June 1, also said the euro is “very strong.”  “Sometimes you read apocalyptic stories about the euro
zone and then you see a currency which is very strong actually,”
he told CNBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
