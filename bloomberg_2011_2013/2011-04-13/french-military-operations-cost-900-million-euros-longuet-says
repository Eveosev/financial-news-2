France ’s military operations abroad
are costing more than the money set aside in this year’s budget,
Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said.  “This year’s budget for military operations is 630 million
($910 million) and we are heading toward 900 million,” Longuet
said during testimony to parliament in Paris today. “We will
have to have a meeting later this year to work it out.”  In addition to existing operations in Afghanistan and off
the Somali coast, France is now the largest contributor to
enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya, and its forces this week
contributed to ousting Ivory Coast’s former president,  Laurent Gbagbo , who had held onto power in defiance of world opinion.  Longuet said France’s troops in  Ivory Coast  will shortly be
reduced to about 950 from 1,700, now that  Alassane Ouattara , the
winner of last year’s election, has assumed power. Most of the
remaining troops will eventually leave, following negotiations
with the new government, he said.  Ivory Coast’s main city, “Abidjan will be a base for
cooperation, not for pre-positioning of forces,” Longuet said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
