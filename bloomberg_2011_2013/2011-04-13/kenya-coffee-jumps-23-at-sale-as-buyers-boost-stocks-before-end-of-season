Kenyan coffee prices rose 23
percent at the penultimate sale of the season yesterday as
buyers boosted their stocks, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all the coffee sold increased to
$300.16 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $244.40 a week
earlier, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Prices rallied because people were covering their short
positions since we only have one more auction left,” Mansukh Shah, a trader with Alanwood Ltd., said by phone today from the
capital, Nairobi. “Quality was low but prices rose because of
the high demand.”  Kenya  is trying to help small-scale farmers revive output,
which dropped from more than 100,000 metric tons in 1988-89
because of a slump in global prices and farm mismanagement. The
East African nation may produce about 40,000 tons this season,
James Wahome, quality manager at the  Coffee Board of Kenya , said
on Jan. 17.  The benchmark arabica AA declined 1.2 percent to an average
of $392.24 a bag, while supplies of the grade dropped 26
percent, it said. Total sales climbed 14 percent to 10,490 bags
worth $3.87 million, from 9,245 bags valued at $2.76 million at
the previous sale, the exchange said.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
