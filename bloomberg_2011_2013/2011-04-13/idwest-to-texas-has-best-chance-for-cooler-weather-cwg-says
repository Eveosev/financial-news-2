The best chance for cooler weather
in the U.S. from April 23 to April 27 remains in the Midwest,
said  Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather Group LLC .  “The models were a bit more aggressive with the southward
extent of the cooling reaching into north and west Texas,”
including  Dallas , Rogers said in a note to clients today.  The main focus of warmer weather is toward the Southwest
and California, he said.  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for potential impact on planting
and yields.  For the 6- to 10-day outlook, a warmer East Coast is
forecast, Rogers noted, referring to the period from April 18 to
April 22.  MDA EarthSat Weather predicts the north-central U.S. will
be colder over the same period.  Forecasting model agreement “has improved some today, but
confidence remains only moderate given the volatility we’ve seen
the past few days,” MDA said.  An unsettled pattern could return cooler conditions to the
South and East late in the period, according to the MDA
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
