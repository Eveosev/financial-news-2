The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
fell below its 50-day moving average for a second day, a sign
that its longest slump since July may not be over, according to
two analysts who use charts to make predictions.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities erased its earlier
gains today after U.S. President  Barack Obama  announced plans to
cut spending and raise taxes to reduce the deficit. It fell for
a fifth straight day, dropping as low as 1,309.19, compared with
the average price during the past 50 days of 1,314.84.  “It’s further confirmation this pullback has further to
go,”  Ryan Detrick , senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s
Investment Research in Cincinnati, said in an interview. “We
don’t suspect this is the end of the  bull market  or the end of
the world, but the pullback has more legs to it.”  The  S&P 500  slipped 1.6 percent since April 6 through
yesterday as a three-week rally starting March 16 failed to push
the index above its February closing high of 1,343.01. The
benchmark gauge yesterday closed below its 50-day moving average
for the first time since March 23 after Alcoa Inc.’s first-
quarter sales missed estimates.  “It indicates there is a lot more room to the downside,”
said Walter J. Zimmerman Jr., the  Jersey City , New Jersey-based
chief technical analyst at United-ICAP, in an interview.
“Presumably, if you haven’t sold by the time the 50-day moving
average is being crossed, you’d better get to it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
