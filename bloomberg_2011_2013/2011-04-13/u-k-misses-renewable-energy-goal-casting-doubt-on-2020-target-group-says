The U.K. will likely miss a goal
set by the European Union to derive 15 percent of its  energy
supply  from clean sources by 2020, a research group said.  A milestone, to get 10 percent of its electricity in 2010
from sources such as the wind and sun, was missed, the  Renewable
Energy Foundation  said today in a statement. That was a target
set during the former Labour party leadership.  “Failure to meet the much-discussed 2010 target, in spite
of very high levels of consumer subsidy, is a clear indication
that the EU 2020 goals are impractical and unaffordable,” John Constable, policy and research director for REF said today by
telephone. "We need an urgent rethink."  The U.K. generated 6.5 percent of its electricity from
renewable energy last year, according to the London-based
group’s research, which was based on data from the Department of
Energy and Climate Change and energy regulator Ofgem.  Subsidies to renewable power generators were 1.1 billion
pounds ($1.79 billion) for that year and about 5 billion pounds
during the 2002-2010 period, according to the group.  Charles Hendry , a junior minister in DECC, said in a
written parliamentary question in December that the 2010 goal
was a “non-legally binding target” that the U.K. will miss
because of a failure to make enough progress in past years.  “However, analysis of the pipeline indicates that the rate
of deployment is increasing and we estimate reaching 10 percent
in 2012,” he said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
