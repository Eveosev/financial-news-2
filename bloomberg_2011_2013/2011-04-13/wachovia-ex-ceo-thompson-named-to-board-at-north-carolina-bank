G. Kennedy Thompson, the former
chairman and chief executive officer at Wachovia Corp. before
being fired, has joined the board of a lender with $2 billion in
assets based in North Carolina.  Thompson joined the board at  BNC Bancorp (BNCN) , replacing R. Mark Graf as the lone representative of Aquiline Capital Partners
LLC, BNC said today in a filing. Aquiline, the New York-based
private-equity firm where Thompson is an executive adviser, got
the right to name a director as a condition of a June 2010
investment, according to the filing. Graf joined Discover
Financial Services at finance chief earlier this month.  Thompson was ousted by Wachoviaâ€™s board in June 2008 before
the lender reported an $8.9 billion loss tied to declining asset
values. Thompson led the 2006 purchase of option-ARM lender
Golden West Financial Corp. of Oakland,  California , a deal that
eventually led Wachovia to sell itself to  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ,
averting bankruptcy.  BNC had $2.1 billion of assets and $1.8 billion in deposits
at the end of the December, according to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Wachovia had about $812.4 billion in assets at
the end of June 2008. Thompson also sits on the board at
Hewlett-Packard Co., the Palo Alto, California-based maker of
computers and printers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
