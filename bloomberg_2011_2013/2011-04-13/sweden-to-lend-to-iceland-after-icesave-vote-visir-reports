Sweden has pledged not to stop the
flow of bailout aid to Iceland under the auspices of the
 International Monetary Fund  after the island’s rejection of a
depositors’ accord with the U.K. and the Netherlands, Visir
reported, citing Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir.  Sigurdardottir discussed Iceland’s economic outlook with
Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, who promised to
support Iceland, Visir said. Sigurdardottir told the Reykjavik-
based  news service  that she hopes the fifth review of Iceland’s
economic program can take place no later than the middle of May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
