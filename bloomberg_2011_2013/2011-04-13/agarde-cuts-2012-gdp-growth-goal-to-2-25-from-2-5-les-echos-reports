French Finance Minister  Christine
Lagarde  said the countryâ€™s economy will expand 2.25 percent in
2012, cutting an earlier estimate of 2.5 percent,  Les Echos 
reported, citing an interview with the minister.  She cited a weaker global demand for French products and
higher energy prices among reasons for the revised outlook, the
newspaper said. Her target is based on the price of oil of $101
a barrel, up from $77 earlier.  Lagarde sees 2011 inflation rate 1.8 percent and 2012 at
1.75 percent, the daily said.  France  maintains its target for
2012 deficit at 4.6 percent of gross domestic product and
confirms the target for 2013 of 3 percent, she told Les Echos.  She said public debt will peak at 86 percent of GDP for
2012 and will be at 85.6 percent for 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
