Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. (ERA) 
shares fell to the lowest since 2005 after the uranium producer
controlled by Rio Tinto Group forecast a first-half loss of as
much as A$50 million ($52 million) as rain curbs output.  Energy Resources dropped 11 percent to A$6.88 at the 4:10
p.m. close in Sydney, the lowest settlement since Jan. 10, 2005.
The Darwin-based company has slumped 63 percent the past year.
The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.3 percent.  Processing of ore was suspended in January at the  Ranger
mine  260 kilometers (162 miles) east of Darwin in the Northern
Territory because of heavy rain. Energy Resources extended the
halt until July to allow water to drain from storage ponds.
Mining operations have “recently ceased” after near-record
rainfall and will resume once the water level recedes, the
company said yesterday.  “Two consecutive years with substantially lower than
planned tonnages and associated revenues, along with one of the
heaviest wet seasons on record has had a very significant impact
on the business and will continue to do so in the future,”
Chief Executive Officer Rob Atkinson said in notes for a speech
to the company’s annual general meeting today.  Energy Resources forecast a first half loss of between A$30
million and A$50 million after the market closed yesterday. This
compares with profit of A$22.7 million in 2010. The company also
estimates output in 2011 at about 2,400 metric tons of uranium
oxide, compared with a previous projection of about 3,793 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
