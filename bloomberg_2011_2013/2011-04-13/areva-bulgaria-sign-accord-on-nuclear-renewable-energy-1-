Areva SA (CEI) , the world’s largest
producer of nuclear equipment, signed a memorandum of
understanding on cooperation in Bulgarian nuclear and  renewable
energy  projects.  The agreement envisages cooperation in future nuclear
energy projects in Bulgaria’s planned 2,000-megawatt Belene
plant project in which Areva is a subcontractor of Rosatom
Corp., Russia’s state nuclear company, and in the country’s
operating Kozloduy nuclear plant, Areva Chief Executive Officer
Anne Lauvergeon told reporters in Sofia today.  Areva and Bulgaria will also consider building off-shore
wind turbines in the Black Sea, she said.  Bulgaria is seeking to diversify energy sources to meet
growing demand as older utilities are decommissioned and reduce
dependence on Russian oil and natural gas imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
