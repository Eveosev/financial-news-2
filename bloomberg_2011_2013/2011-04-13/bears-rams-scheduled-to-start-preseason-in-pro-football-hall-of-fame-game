The  Chicago  Bears and St. Louis
Rams will open the National Football League  preseason  in the Pro
Football Hall of Fame game -- if owners and players settle on a
new collective bargaining agreement before then.  The Bears and Rams are scheduled to play the Hall of Fame
game Aug. 7 in Canton, Ohio. Week One of the preseason begins
Aug. 11 with San Diego hosting Seattle in a game televised by
ESPN. The preseason ends Sept. 2.  Players, led by quarterbacks Tom Brady, Drew Brees and
Peyton Manning, sued the NFL last month, alleging antitrust
violations after the collapse of labor talks. Owners of the 32
NFL teams declared a lockout after contract negotiations failed.  The NFL and players begin mediation tomorrow under a
federal judgeâ€™s order.  The  New York Jets  are scheduled to open their preseason at
Houston on Aug. 15, followed by a game at Cincinnati. The Jets
then play the Giants at their shared New Meadowlands Stadium
before hosting Philadelphia.  The New York Giants travel to the  Carolina Panthers  in Week
One, followed by a home game against Chicago on Aug. 22. The
game against the Jets is followed by a road trip to the  New
England Patriots .  To contact the reporter on this story:
