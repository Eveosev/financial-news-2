U.S. stocks may drop in the next
month after  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ’s lower-than-estimated sales drove down
its shares and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, Bespoke
Investment Group LLC said.  Alcoa tumbled 6 percent and the benchmark measure of U.S.
shares lost 0.8 percent yesterday. Four times since 2001, the
biggest U.S. aluminum producer slumped 5 percent or more after
posting quarterly results, with the S&P 500 declining at least
0.5 percent on the same day. The equity index fell during the
rest of earnings season every time, losing an average of 5.1
percent, according to data compiled by Bespoke.  “Ouch,” said a report yesterday from Bespoke, a Harrison,
New York-based research firm. This “wasn’t quite the start to
earnings season that investors were hoping for.”  S&P 500  earnings have topped the average analyst estimate
for eight straight quarters, helping fuel the index’s 94 percent
surge since dropping to a 12-year low in March 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 gained an average of 0.2 percent following the
first day of every earnings season since 2001, according to
Bespoke. The four earnings seasons that Bespoke identified in
its report began in January 2003, April 2004, October 2008 and
January 2010.  The index gained less than 0.1 percent to 1,314.41 at 4
p.m. in New York today, after slumping four straight days. Alcoa
slid 0.9 percent to $16.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
