AS’s chances of winning a contest to supply  New York  City with
taxis may improve when a draft law saying vehicles must be
wheelchair accessible is approved,  Hurriyet  newspaper reported.  The draft, which would impose the requirement on New York
taxis by September 2014, is expected to be approved by a
unanimous New York state assembly vote, the Istanbul-based
newspaper cited Assemblyman Micah Kellner as saying, without
specifying a time frame.  Karsan is the only one of the three finalists in the taxi
competition whose design offers a wheelchair-accessible vehicle,
New York’s Taxi & Limousine Commission said in November.  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  and Nissan Motor Co. are the other suppliers on the
commission’s shortlist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
