BP Plc (BP/) ’s talks with its partners in
the TNK-BP Russian venture have ended without agreement, the
Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people close to
the discussions.  AAR Group, which represents BP’s billionaire partners,
didn’t accept offers of cash or a premium on the market value of
their holdings, the people said, according to the newspaper.
TNK-BP blocked BP’s deal for a share swap with OAO Rosneft, and
the deadline for completing the deal is tomorrow, the paper
said.  Sheila Williams , a spokeswoman for BP, declined to comment
on the report, as did AAR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
