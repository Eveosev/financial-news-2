The outlooks on PetroChina Co.,
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  and Aluminum Corp. of  China 
Ltd.’s long-term local-currency credit ratings were revised to
negative from stable by Fitch Ratings.  The change was prompted by Fitch’s revision of the outlook
on China’s long-term local-currency credit rating on April 12,
the company said in a statement today.  The outlooks on the long-term foreign-currency ratings of
the three companies remain stable, Fitch said.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
