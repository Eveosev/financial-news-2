BP Plc’s Russian partners in TNK-BP
rejected an offer from BP and OAO Rosneft to purchase their 50
percent holding in TNK-BP because the partners, known as AAR,
put an “impossibly high” valuation on TNK-BP of about $70
billion, British Broadcasting Corp.’s Robert Peston  reported  on
his blog, citing an unidentified source at BP.  BP and Rosneft were prepared to pay “something over $25
billion” for the stake, based on a valuation of the company of
more than $50 billion, Peston said.  In addition, AAR wanted to be paid in BP and Rosneft
shares, which neither of the two companies would have agreed to,
Peston said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
