BP Plc’s Russian partners in TNK-BP
rejected an offer from BP and OAO Rosneft for $27 billion to
resolve the dispute over the proposed alliance between BP and
Rosneft, Sky News City Editor Mark Kleinman reported, without
saying where he got the information. The offer valued TNK-BP at
$54 billion, while the Russian partners see a value of about $70
billion, Sky said, without attribution. Discussions between the
three parties now appear to have collapsed, Sky said, without
citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
