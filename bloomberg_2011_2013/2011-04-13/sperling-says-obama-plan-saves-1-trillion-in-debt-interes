Gene Sperling , director of the
National Economic Council, said President Barack Obama’s
deficit-cutting plan would save $1 trillion in interest payments
on the national debt.  Obama today proposed $4 trillion cumulative deficit
reductions within 12 years through a combination of spending
cuts and tax increases, setting the stage for a fight with
congressional Republicans over the nation’s priorities. Sperling
said the administration’s plan achieves $3 in savings for every
$1 raised through tax code changes.  “One of the important reasons to have such a strong
comprehensive deficit reduction plan now is to reduce the amount
of interest we’re paying every year,” Sperling said in an
interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart.”  The plan raises about $1 trillion through a tax-code
overhaul that the administration wants to assemble through
bipartisan efforts, Sperling said. He also said it would save
about $1 trillion from Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement
programs, along with about $1 trillion from cuts to
discretionary domestic spending and the military and security
budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
