World champion  Spain  has declined
an offer to play in the Copa America, South America’s national-
team soccer tournament, citing a busy schedule.  The Spanish soccer federation made the announcement on its
website after a board meeting today. The tournament is scheduled
for July 1-24 in Argentina.  South American soccer officials traditionally invite two
national teams from outside the region. They asked Spain after
 Japan ’s participation became doubtful following the the March 11
tsunami that left about 27,500 people dead or missing and
crippled a nuclear-power plant.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
