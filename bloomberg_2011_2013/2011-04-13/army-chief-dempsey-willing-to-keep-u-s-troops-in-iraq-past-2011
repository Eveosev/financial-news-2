The U.S. Army’s new chief of staff
said he would support keeping American troops in  Iraq  beyond
December if requested by Iraqi leaders.  “It would certainly be in our interest to see Iraq remain
on its current path and become even more stable,” General
Martin Dempsey told reporters today during a briefing at the
Pentagon. “As a member of the national security team, that
would be my advice.”  Dempsey, who was sworn in April 11 as the Army’s top
military officer, didn’t say how many service members should
stay in Iraq if requested. The U.S. has about 47,000 troops
there, mostly advising and assisting Iraqi security forces. The
U.S. troops are scheduled to leave by the end of the year.  Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  has said the Iraqi
government should decide soon so the U.S. can plan effectively.
 Senator Lindsey Graham , a Republican from South Carolina, has
said Iraq “could go to hell” without a continued presence of
between 10,000 and 15,000 U.S. troops in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
