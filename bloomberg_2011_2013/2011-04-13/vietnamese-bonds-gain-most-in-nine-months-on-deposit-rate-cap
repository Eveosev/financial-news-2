Vietnam’s two-year bonds rose the
most in more than nine months on speculation a ceiling on dollar
deposit rates will help lower dong  interest rates .  Effective today, rates on deposits held in the U.S.
currency will be capped at 3 percent for individuals and at 1
percent for non-credit institutions, the central bank said on
April 9. The reserve ratio on these deposits will also increase
by 2 percentage points to a range from 3 percent to 6 percent
starting May, it said on the same day.  “Both moves would help reduce dollarization in the
economy, encouraging people to switch holdings to dong,” said
Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-income research at Ho Chi Minh
City Securities Corp. “Dong deposit rates may slowly drop,
bringing down short-term bond yields.”  The yield on the two-year bonds fell 22 basis points from
the end of last week, the biggest decline since July 7, to 11.45
percent, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  Vietnam ’s financial markets were closed for a holiday
on April 11 and yesterday.  The dong was little changed from April 8 at 20,928 per
dollar as of 3:35 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 20,930 today, a record low.  The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,723,
unchanged from April 11. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of that rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Ven Ram, Andrew Janes  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
