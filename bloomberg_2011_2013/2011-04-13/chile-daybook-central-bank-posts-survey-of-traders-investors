Chile ’s central bank discloses its
bi-weekly survey of traders and investors covering forecasts for
interest rates, inflation and the currency.  ECONOMY:
*Chilean policy makers raised the benchmark interest rate by a
half-point for the second straight month as economic growth
accelerates and consumer prices threaten to exceed central bank
targets this year. The five-member policy board raised the
overnight rate to 4.5 percent, matching the forecast of 19 of 21
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  EQUITIES:
*The Ipsa index fell 1.6 percent to 4,616.79.
*Cencosud SA retreated 4.8 percent to 3,333 pesos, the steepest
decline since October 2008. Latin America’s third-largest
retailer by sales will seek shareholder approval to sell as much
as $2 billion of new shares to finance expansion plans.
*Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA, Chile’s largest fertilizer
producer, lost 2.5 percent to 26,843 pesos, the most in four
weeks. A decline in global crop prices signaled lower demand for
Soquimich’s products.  MARKETS:
*Chile’s peso weakened as copper fell after earthquakes deepened
the nuclear emergency in  Japan , the second-largest customer for
Chilean copper. The peso slid 0.4 percent to 473.86 per dollar.
*The one-year swap rate climbed 1 basis point to 5.66 percent.
The six-month rate rose five basis points to 5.23 percent, the
highest since January 2009.
*Inflation expectations fell. Five-year breakeven inflation
declined 8 basis points to 3.73 percent and 10-year breakeven
inflation declined 10 basis points to 3.61 percent.
*Foreign investors in the Chilean forwards market had a $1.8
billion bet that the peso would fall against the dollar on April
8, according to the latest central bank data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
