Silgan Holdings Inc. (SLGN) , the
manufacturer of consumer-goods packaging products, may raise as
much as $4 billion of debt to purchase  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s
Graham Packaging Co.  The company’s net debt to adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will be 3.9 times
after the transaction, Stamford, Connecticut-based Silgan said
today in an investor presentation attached to a regulatory
filing.  “The transaction is supported by committed financing, with
the permanent capital structure expected to consist of
an optimal mix of bank facilities and bonds,” Silgan said
today in a statement.  Silgan offered 0.402 of a share and $4.75 in cash for each
Graham share in a transaction valued at about $4.1 billion,
including debt, according to the statement. The deal is
structured to help the company maintain a Ba2 rating from
Moody’s Investors Service and BB credit grade from  Standard &
Poor’s , the investor presentation shows.  Bank of America Corp. advised Silgan on the transaction,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
