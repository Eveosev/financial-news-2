Fortis Bank NV, the Belgian banking
unit of  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, fell victim to tax fraudsters and lost
more than 72 million euros ($104.5 million) in 2009 after buying
emission-permits from a criminal organization,  De Tijd newspaper 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The bank got an offer to buy carbon-dioxide allowances at a
price considered low and the fraudsters didnâ€™t pay the value-
added tax to the government, the newspaper said. Belgian
prosecutors are investigating the fraud, according to De Tijd.  Liliane Tackaert, a spokeswoman for BNP Paribas Fortis in
Brussels, declined to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
