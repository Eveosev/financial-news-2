Oil rose for the first time in
three days in  New York  on speculation that U.S. gasoline
stockpiles are shrinking as the summer driving season approaches
and  Libya ’s unrest worsens.  Futures climbed as much as 0.7 percent today as Libyan
rebels said Muammar Qaddafi’s forces are accelerating attacks
and appealed for international help. U.S. gasoline supplies
probably fell for an eighth week, the longest stretch of
declines since the summer of 2008, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before an Energy Department report today.  “Given the unresolved unrest in Libya and prospect of
unrest spreading to other countries in the region, we are likely
to see crude maintain above $100 a barrel in the forseeable
future,” said  Victor Shum , a senior principal at Purvin & Gertz
Inc. in  Singapore . “The API report showed product inventories
falling sharply, an excuse for people to start buying.”  Crude oil for May delivery rose as much as 71 cents to
$106.96 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , and was at
$106.89 a barrel at 2:39 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the
contract fell $3.67 to $106.25, the lowest close since March 30.  Brent oil for May settlement gained as much as $1.19, or 1
percent, to $122.11 a barrel, on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, the contract declined $3.06, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $120.92, the lowest since April 1.  New York futures plunged 3.3 percent yesterday after the
 International Energy Agency  reported signs of an oil-demand
slowdown and as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast a
“substantial” correction.  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S. crude stockpiles rose 1.19 million barrels to 355.5
million last week, the industry-funded  American Petroleum
Institute  said yesterday. Gasoline supplies dropped 4.6 million
barrels while middle distillates stocks fell 3.69 million.  An Energy Department report today may show supplies
increased 1 million barrels, according to 16 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Gasoline stockpiles probably declined 1
million barrels from 216.7 million barrels, the survey showed.  The U.S., the world’s largest economy, will expand 2.8
percent this year, down from 2.9 percent last year and a 3
percent growth rate for 2011 forecast in January, the IMF said
April 11. It cut  Japan ’s 2011 growth forecast to 1.4 percent
from 1.6 percent in a January forecast.  Gasoline use typically surges in the middle of the year
when Americans take to the roads for their summer vacations. The
peak demand period begins after the Memorial Day holiday in late
May and ends on Labor Day in early September. The holidays fall
on May 30 and Sept. 5 this year.  Brent Premium  The European benchmark traded at a premium of $15.24 a
barrel to U.S. futures today from $14.67 yesterday. The
difference between front-month contracts in  London  and New York
surged to a record $19.54 on Feb. 21 as unrest spread in the
Middle East and North Africa and stockpiles climbed at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for New York futures. The spread
averaged 76 cents last year.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton ’s early warning
that Libya may become a failed state risks turning into reality
as three weeks of western military intervention have failed to
stem the chaos that’s split the country in half.  Clinton and her NATO counterparts will meet tomorrow in
Berlin to discuss next steps for the Libya mission. Foreign
ministers and other officials from the “contact group” of
nations involved in Libya meet today in Doha, Qatar.  The Libyan conflict is the bloodiest in a wave of uprisings
that has toppled leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia  and spread to
Algeria,  Bahrain ,  Iran , Oman, Syria and Yemen.  Worldwide oil demand will rise by 1.4 million barrels, or
1.6 percent, this year to average 89.4 million a day, the IEA
said yesterday. The forecast was unchanged from March.  The U.S. increased its crude-oil price forecast for 2011 to
an average $106.38 a barrel from $101.77 last month, according
to the Energy Department’s Short-Term Energy Outlook yesterday.
It left its global consumption forecast unchanged at 88.2
million barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
