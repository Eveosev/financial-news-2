HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  signed a contract
to advise the Bulgarian government on financing a 2,000-megawatt
nuclear power plant being built by Rosatom Corp., Russia’s state
atomic energy agency.  Bulgaria  wants to build the plant at Belene on the Danube
River to meet growing energy demand as older utilities are
decommissioned. The project has been stalled since a 2005
contract because of lack of funding and demands by Rosatom Corp,
for higher construction costs.  “The contract with HSBC was signed today,” Bulgarian
Prime Minister  Boiko Borissov  told reporters in Sofia. “They
will advise us on the price and financing.”  The bank, which Bulgaria hired in November, will submit its
suggestions in two months, according to Energy and Economy
Minister Traicho Traikov. The government will decide in June on
whether to continue with the project, Traikov said.  Russia ’s Atomstroyexport ZAO, a unit of Rosatom, last week
agreed with Bulgaria’s National Electricity Co. to extend an
accord on building the plant until June 31 to conduct safety
studies, the Bulgarian utility said April 5.  Rosatom has increased the price to 6.4 billion euros ($9.3
billion) from 4 billion euros because of construction delays.
Bulgaria estimates the cost of building the plant at about 5
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
