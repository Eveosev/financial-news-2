Ukraine and Vanco Prykerchenska
Ltd. have reached a settlement on  Black Sea  oil exploration,
 Interfax-Ukraine  news agency reported, citing Justice Minister
Oleksandr Lavrynovych.  The document is to be approved in a Stockholm court,
Interfax cited Lavrynovych as saying.  Ukraine’s government, led by then-Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko , revoked Vanco’s permit to explore for hydrocarbons
in the Black Sea in April 2008. The government said the license
was issued illegally and that the company wouldn’t have enough
money to finance the project. Vanco appealed the decision in
Stockholm’s court.  To contact the reporters on this story:
