AS Tallinna Kaubamaja,  Estonia ’s
largest retailer, said sales advanced 2.5 percent in the first
quarter compared with a year earlier, led by cars.  Sales in the three months ending March 31 rose to 96.1
million euros ($139 million) from 93.7 million euros in the
year-earlier period, the Tallinn-based company said in a
regulatory statement today. Revenue at the vehicle unit, selling
KIA passenger cars, jumped 31.1 percent to 3.8 million euros.  Sales at the biggest unit, the Selver supermarkets, rose
1.5 percent as a positive effect from discount sales campaigns
outweighed the hit from “significantly” higher food prices,
the retailer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
