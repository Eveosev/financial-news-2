Silgan Holdings Inc. (SLGN)  agreed to buy
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s Graham Packaging Co. for about $1.3
billion in stock and cash to create what it says will be the
world’s largest maker of food and specialty-beverage packaging.  Silgan offered 0.402 of a share and $4.75 in cash for each
Graham share,  Stamford , Connecticut-based Silgan said today in a
statement, valuing Graham at $19.56 a share, or 17 percent more
than yesterday’s closing price. Silgan jumped 19 percent in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The takeover will allow Silgan to cut $50 million of costs
within three years and offer a broader range of products to
customers such as Campbell Soup Co., Chief Executive Officer
Anthony Allott said in an interview. Silgan sells metal cans and
closures to some of the same customers that use Graham’s plastic
food and beverage containers, he said.  “This is a business we have been aware of for a long time,
and had a lot of respect for,” Allott said.  The combined company will have net debt of almost four
times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, more than Silgan’s “optimal” range of 2.5 to 3.5
times Ebitda, he said. Silgan is comfortable with the level of
leverage and has operated with that much debt in the past,
Allott said.  Blackstone, the world’s largest private-equity firm, has
owned York, Pennsylvania-based Graham since 1998 and holds a 61
percent stake after taking the company public last year.  19 Countries  The acquisition will create a company with annual sales of
more than $6.2 billion and about 180 plants operating in 19
countries employing more than 17,000 people, the companies said.
Including net debt, the transaction values Graham at $4.1
billion, Silgan said.  The 17 percent premium compares with an average premium of
11 percent for global packaging-industry deals announced in the
past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Graham rose $5.51, or 33 percent, to $22.22 as of 4:15 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange. Silgan climbed $6.97 to $43.80.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch provided financial advice to
Silgan and Bryan Cave LLP provided legal advice. Silgan expects
the transaction to close in the third quarter.  Graham received legal advice from Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett LLP. The committee of Graham directors that recommended
the deal was advised by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and law firm Abrams
& Bayliss LLP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
