Natural gas futures slipped in  New
York  as forecasts showed warmer-than-normal weather in the last
week of April, reducing demand for the heating fuel.  Gas dropped 0.2 percent as forecasters including Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in the 11- to 15-
day outlook that the eastern U.S. will probably be warmer than
normal. Futures rose earlier after government data showed
industrial production increased more than forecast in March.  “The weather is not supporting the market,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta.
“In the short term, before the hurricane season starts, it
probably will be a pretty bearish market.”  Natural gas for May delivery dipped 0.8 cent to settle at
$4.204 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures gained 4 percent this week and
have dropped 4.6 percent this year.  There will be a “warmer eastern half” from April 25 to
April 29, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
Maryland.  The high in New York on April 26 will be 75 degrees
Fahrenheit (23 Celsius), 11 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas rose 1.7 percent yesterday after the Energy Department
reported inventories increased 28 billion cubic feet in the week
ended April 8 to 1.607 trillion cubic feet.  Supply Report  The stockpile increase matched the five-year average gain
for the week, leaving the storage surplus unchanged from the
previous week at 0.6 percent. A deficit to year-earlier supplies
widened to 7.9 percent from 5.2 percent.  Yesterday’s gain “was more technical than fundamental,”
 Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a consulting
company in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in a report today. “We
maintain our bearish bias for natural gas.”  Industrial output rose 0.8 percent last month, the fifth
straight gain, after a revised 0.1 percent gain in February, the
 Federal Reserve  said today in  Washington . Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a 0.6 percent increase, according to
the median estimate.  Gas consumption will rise 1 percent this year to 66.75
billion cubic feet a day “primarily because of the increase in
consumption in the industrial sector,”, the Energy Department
estimated on April 12 in  a monthly outlook .  Industrial demand will average 18.73 billion cubic feet a
day, up 3.6 percent from 2010.  Gas Rigs  The number of gas drilling rigs in the U.S. fell 4 to 885
this week, according to Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. The
total was 9 percent lower than a year earlier.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the most active U.S. oil and
natural-gas driller, agreed to buy Bronco Drilling Co. for about
$316.8 million in cash, adding 22 onshore rigs and increasing
capacity to produce oil and gas.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
219,047 as of 2:42 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 325,000. Volume was 431,564 yesterday. Open interest was
973,956 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
910,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
