The  U.S. economy  probably grew at a
2 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year as
the jump in food and fuel costs slowed  consumer spending ,
according to a revised forecast by economists at Barclays
Capital Inc. in New York.  The estimate is down from a 3.5 percent rate the group, led
by chief U.S. economist  Dean Maki , had penciled in before the
quarter began.  The downgrade reflects two elements, Maki wrote in a note
to clients today. The first is the surge in prices caused
inflation-adjusted consumer spending to cool to a 2.5 percent
pace from January through March from the 4 percent rate in the
previous three months, he said.  Additionally, Maki said bad weather contributed to the
growth slowdown, particularly in construction.  Saying some of the first-quarter headwinds would abate,
Maki raised the second-quarter growth forecast to 3.5 percent
from 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
