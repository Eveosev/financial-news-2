Michael Hussey ’s 108 from 91 balls
helped Australia beat Bangladesh by 66 runs to sweep their
three-game one-day cricket series.  Opener Shane Watson scored 72 as Australia reached 361-8 in
its 50 overs after winning the toss in Dhaka.  Michael Clarke , in
his debut series as captain, and  Ricky Ponting  added 47 runs
each. Mashrafe Mortaza and Abdur Razzak both claimed three
wickets for the host.  “Good start, good series,” Clarke, who replaced Ponting
as skipper after the World Cup, said in the post-game ceremony.
“I’m very happy how the whole squad has played this whole
tour.”  Mitchell Johnson took 3-67 as Bangladesh reached 295-6 in
response. Imrul Kayes top-scored with 93 and Mahmudullah was 68
not out.  Australia  won the series opener by 60 runs on April 9,
followed by a nine-wicket win two days ago.  “It’s been a great week or so we’ve had here,” said
Watson, named man of the series after finishing with 294 runs
and three wickets. “It’s nice to be able to play as we have.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
