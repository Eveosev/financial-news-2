Libya ’s opposition said it is
discussing with allies the possibility of borrowing $2 billion
in order to import food, medicine, fuel and possibly weapons to
combat Muammar Qaddafi’s forces.  “The short term loans is an option on the table that we
discussed with our friends” at a conference today in Qatar, Ali
Tarhouni, the National Transitional Council’s finance minister
said in an interview today in Benghazi. The borrowing may have a
term of as long as two years and would be backed by Libyan
assets frozen abroad, which could be used to reimburse the
lenders once unlocked, he said.  “We immediately are trying to access $2 billion and this
number could rise,” he said. “We should be able to access
these funds to import medicine, food, fuel, even armaments, but
we are concentrating on the first ones.” The council needs
reserves of commodities and medicine to help areas “liberated
from Qaddafi,” Tarhouni said.  The rebels’ transitional government is pressing the
international coalition, led by the U.S., that has joined its
struggle against Qaddafi to step up support. At the Qatar
meeting today, the host nation’s Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim Al-Thani said his country would “look into” supplying
equipment to help the rebels defend themselves.  The coalition also said it is examining a “temporary
financial mechanism” so the rebels can access government assets
frozen abroad as part of sanctions against Qaddafi’s regime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
