The  European Federation of Energy
Traders  appointed Javier Florez, EDP-Energias de Portugal SA’s
gas supply director, to lead a new working group aimed at
boosting liquidity and transparency in the Iberian gas market.  More trading is needed to align the Spanish and Portuguese
gas markets with  France  and the rest of  Europe , EFET Gas
Committee Chairman Colin Lyle said yesterday by e-mail.
Wholesale Spanish gas trading is mainly done through liquefied-
natural-gas accords in the transmission system and more
downstream trading is needed, he said.  The group, which includes companies including Morgan
Stanley and E.ON Energy Trading SE, will use the experience of
its member companies to promote trading in the region, EFET said
in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
