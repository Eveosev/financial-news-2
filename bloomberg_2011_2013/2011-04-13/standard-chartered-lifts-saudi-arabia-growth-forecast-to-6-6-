Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  raised its
2011 growth forecast for Saudi Arabia to 6.6 percent from 4
percent on higher  oil prices  and a boost in government spending.  “Higher oil prices make it easier for Saudi Arabian
authorities to increase government spending more or less at
will,” economist Shady Shaher wrote in a research report
released today. “Inflation is a concern,” he added, with the
2011 average expected to exceed 7 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
