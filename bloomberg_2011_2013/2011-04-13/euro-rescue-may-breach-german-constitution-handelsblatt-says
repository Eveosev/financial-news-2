Committing  Germany  to  Europe ’s
permanent rescue fund for debt-strapped euro countries risks
breaching the constitution, Handelsblatt reported, citing a
report by the German parliament’s research service.  The study, prepared for lawmakers in Berlin, warns that
German loan guarantees under the planned European Stability
Mechanism would set off a process that might force Germany to
make payments that push the deficit beyond constitutional limits
without giving parliament a say, the newspaper  reported  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
