Barry Bonds , Major League Baseball’s
home-run record holder, asked a federal judge to throw out his
conviction for making evasive statements to a grand jury in
2003, saying “unauthorized rambling is not a federal crime.”  Bonds was convicted of obstructing justice in federal court
in San Francisco in April for statements he made to a grand jury
when asked whether his trainer ever gave him anything that
required a syringe injection.  In a response of about 130 words, Bonds said his personal
doctor touched him, he didn’t talk baseball with his trainer and
because he was a “celebrity child with a famous father” he
didn’t “get into others people’s business.”  Federal prosecutors said the statement was evasive and
impeded the work of the grand jury. Bonds’s father,  Bobby Bonds ,
was a three-time All-Star who played for eight teams including
the Giants and the  New York Yankees .  “Even if some ‘truthful but evasive’ statements could
constitute obstruction, Mr. Bonds’s ‘celebrity child’ statement
was, at worst, a digression -- a bit of meandering from the
question that was explicitly encouraged by the questioner,”
Bonds said in a motion filed today in San Francisco federal
court.  Bonds answered the same question repeatedly elsewhere in
his testimony, according to the filing. If he isn’t acquitted,
Bonds should get a new trial on the obstruction charge,
according to the motion.  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
