Kenya ’s shilling weakened against
the dollar as demand for the U.S. currency by oil importers
outweighed inflows from the tea industry.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.2 percent to 84.10 per dollar at 5.09 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi. It closed at 83.95 yesterday.  "The local unit weakened marginally as dollar demand, which
has been high lately due to surging crude prices, was met by
inflows from the tea sale," Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading
at Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said in a phone
interview. The currency is expected to trade in a range of 83.50
to 84.00 "in the coming days," he said.  African tea prices rose for the first week in three to
$2.73 a kilogram from $2.65 a week earlier, Tea Brokers East
Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Kenya is
the world’s biggest export of black tea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
