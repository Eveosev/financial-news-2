Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor
Glenn Stevens said the longer there’s cheap money provided by
central banks around the world, the higher the risk it will be
used to do something “silly.”  “It’s a risky thing to keep the price of money really low
for a long period,” Stevens said in response to audience
questions after a speech in  New York .  “The overnight cost of money is effectively nothing in a
range of major jurisdictions,” Stevens said. Many emerging
nations around the world “are quite concerned” about capital
flows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
