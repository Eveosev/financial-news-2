Glencore International AG, which is
preparing a dual initial public offering aimed at raising as
much as $11 billion in London and Hong Kong, is being accused of
evading taxes at a copper mining operation in Zambia, the  Daily
Mail  reported, citing a complaint lodged with the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.  A group of non-governmental organizations say Glencore
manipulated accounts and financial statements at its Mopani
Copper Mines unit, failing to explain a big jump in operating
costs in 2007 while reporting “stunningly low” copper volumes
compared to other mines in the area, the newspaper said.  Swiss-based Glencore said it denied any wrongdoing and the
complaint was based on flawed statistical analysis, the Mail
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
