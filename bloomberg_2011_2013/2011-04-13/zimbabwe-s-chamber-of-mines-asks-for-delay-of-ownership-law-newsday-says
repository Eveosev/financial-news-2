Zimbabwe’s Chamber of Mines asked
Vice President Joice Mujuru to intervene and secure an extension
of a deadline for foreign companies to cut their stake in local
operations to 49 percent, Newsday reported, citing Victor
Gapare, the chamber’s president.  Miners should be given 5 to 10 years to comply with the
directive instead of six months, the Harare-based newspaper
cited Gapare as saying in a letter to Mujuru. The Indigenization
and Economic Empowerment Act may result in a decline in
production at the country’s mines and capital flight, it said.  Buyers of the shares won’t be able to raise the money for
the sale now given liquidity constraints in the country, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
