OAO Sberbank said net income almost
doubled in the first quarter after Russia’s largest lender
slashed reserves to cover loan losses.  Profit under Russian accounting standards surged to 83.9
billion rubles ($2.98 billion) from 43.2 billion rubles in the
same period a year earlier, the Moscow-based bank  said  on its
website today.  Sberbank said the quality of its loan book continued to
improve and the share of overdue loans fell to 4.83 percent from
5.04 percent at the beginning of the year. As of April 1, the
bank’s reserves for loans totaled 663 billion rubles, more than
double the overdue debt on its balance sheet.  Assets rose by 22 billion rubles to 8.57 trillion rubles,
according to the statement. Sberbank said ruble gains against
the dollar and euro had a “significant impact” on its
earnings. Consumer lending surged 18 percent in the period from
a year ago.  Sberbank advanced as much as 0.9 percent in Moscow before
reversing gains and trading down 0.7 percent at 104.08 rubles at
11:38 a.m. in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
