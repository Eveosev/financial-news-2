The Carbon  Markets and Investors
Association , a global trade group, backed calls by an
environmental lobby to refuse carbon credits to projects linked
with human rights violations.  “CMIA strongly urges all those who have a role in the
scrutiny” of applications for carbon credits “to continue
their efforts to discover such abuses, and if proven, have the
requests rejected from the United Nations approval processes,”
Miles Austin, director of the London-based group, said in an e-
mailed statement.  CDM Watch, a Brussels-based organization that monitors the
so-called Clean Development Mechanism projects overseen by the
UN,  said  in February a biogas project in  Honduras  was linked to
human rights violations. The U.K. government gave Electricite de
France SA’s EDF Trading authorization to buy the credits from
the Honduran project in June 2009, according to CDM Watch. The
project was backed by a $30 million loan from the  World Bank ,
the group said in a statement on its website.  “We are currently evaluating our position with respect to
this project,” Michele Reid, a London-based spokeswoman for EDF
Trading, said today in an e-mail.  Companies that work with a project found to be linked to
human rights violations and those that buy credits from them
should “immediately terminate their commercial relationship,”
Austin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
