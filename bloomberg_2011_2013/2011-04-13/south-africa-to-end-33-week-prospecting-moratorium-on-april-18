South Africa , the nation with the
largest mineral wealth, will end a 33-week moratorium on
prospecting applications on April 18 after installing an online
system aimed at avoiding repeats of maladministration.  “The new South African Mineral Resources Administration
system will be effective from April 18,” the Department of
Mineral Resources said on its  website . “The only method of
submitting applications will be in electronic format.”  The Sept. 1 moratorium was due to be lifted on April 14
after being extended twice from the original Feb. 28 end date.
Citigroup Inc. last year estimated mineral resources in the
country, where  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and Rio
Tinto Ltd. mine coal, platinum and diamonds, at $2.5 trillion,
larger than any other nation.  South Africa’s Minister of Mines Susan Shabangu will speak
to reporters about the subject on April 18, Zingaphi Jakuja, a
spokeswoman for the department, said by mobile phone today. She
declined to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
