Bolivia’s government plans to
expropriate zinc and silver mines,  La Razon  reported, citing
President  Evo Morales .  Bolivia’s state mining company  Comibol  may rescind
contracts with companies including Glencore International AG,
 Pan American Silver Corp. (PAA) , and  Coeur d’Alene Mines Corp. (CDE) , the La
Paz-based newspaper reported, citing Comibol President Hugo
Miranda.  Glencore spokesman Marc Ocskay, Coeur spokesman Tony Ebersole and Pan American spokeswoman Kettina Cordero didn’t
immediately return telephone calls and e-mails seeking comment.  Morales seized Glencore’s Vinto tin smelter in 2007, La
