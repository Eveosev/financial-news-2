U.S. nuclear-power output rose for
a third day as plants in Alabama and  Pennsylvania  boosted energy
production, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 514 megawatts, or 0.7
percent, from yesterday to 77,568 megawatts, or 76 percent of
capacity, according to an NRC report today and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twenty-four of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were
offline.  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  boosted Beaver Valley Unit 1 to 100
percent of capacity from 82 percent yesterday, the report
showed. FirstEnergy increased output at Unit 2 to 87 percent
from 61 percent. Each reactor can produce 940 megawatts at the
plant, which is located about 26 miles (42 kilometers) northwest
of Pittsburgh.  The Tennessee Valley Authority boosted output from the
1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor in  Alabama  to 98 percent
of capacity from 82 percent yesterday.  Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3, which have respective
capacities of 1,065 megawatts and 1,115 megawatts, are operating
at full power. The plant is located 84 miles north of Birmingham
on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee border.  Scana Corp. (SCG)  slowed the 966-megawatt Virgil C. Summer
reactor in South Carolina to 85 percent of capacity from 100
percent yesterday. The plant is located near Jenkinsville, about
26 miles northwest of Columbia.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
