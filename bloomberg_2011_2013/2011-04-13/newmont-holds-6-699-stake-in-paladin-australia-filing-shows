Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest
U.S. gold producer, took a stake in  Australia â€™s  Paladin Energy
Ltd. (PDN)  after completing the takeover of Fronteer Gold Inc., a
shareholder in the uranium producer.  The Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Newmont holds a 6.699
percent stake, or about 52 million shares, in Paladin Energy,
according to a substantial shareholder notice filed with the
Australian stock exchange today.  Newmont agreed on Feb. 3 to buy Fronteer Gold for C$2.3
billion ($2.4 billion) to gain exploration and development
projects in Nevada. Paladin shares have declined 24 percent
since March 11 when a magnitude-9 quake and tsunami struck
Japan, damaging the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant
operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co.  Paladin rose 1.4 percent to close at A$3.58 at the 4:10
p.m. close in Sydney, compared with a 0.3 percent gain in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
