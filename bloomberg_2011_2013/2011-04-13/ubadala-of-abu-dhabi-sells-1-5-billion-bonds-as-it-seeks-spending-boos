Mubadala Development Co., an Abu
Dhabi government-owned investor with stakes in  Carlyle Group  and
 General Electric Co. (GE) , sold $1.5 billion in bonds as the company
plans to boost spending to $16.3 billion this year.  It issued $750 million of 5-year bonds that were priced to
yield 180 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the offering,
who declined to be identified because terms aren’t set. It also
sold $750 million of 10-year debt yielding 210 basis points over
similar maturity treasuries, the person said. The issuer of the
debt is MDC-GMTN B.V. and Mubadala is the guarantor.  Mubadala is boosting spending fourfold this year as it
directs funds to companies such as Advanced Technology
Investment Co., Mubadala  GE Capital  and its Masdar project. The
group spent an average 16.4 billion dirhams ($4.5 billion) over
the last three years, according to the bond prospectus.  Borrowing costs in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council
fell 66 basis points, or 0.66 percentage point, to 5.32 percent
from this year’s high of 5.98 percent on March 18, according to
the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai GCC Conventional US Dollar Bond Index.  Abu Dhabi , home to more than 7 percent of the world’s
proven crude reserves, is seeking to diversify from oil by
investing in industries including real estate and aerospace.
Capital contributions of as much as 37.8 billion dirhams have
been approved by the government for 2011, Mubadala said in the
prospectus.  The company posted a comprehensive loss of 315 million
dirhams for 2010, because of declines in “mark-to-market”
investments. Mubadala said March 10 that it’s in talks with
state-owned Dubai Aluminium Co. to expand their partnership.
Gulf News reported that day, citing Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai’s deputy ruler, that Mubadala has offered to buy
a stake in Dubai Aluminium to create a new holding company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
