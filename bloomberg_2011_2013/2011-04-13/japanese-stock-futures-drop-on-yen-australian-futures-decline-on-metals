Asian stocks rose, erasing earlier
declines, as  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202)  led gains by exporters and
 Toshiba Corp. (6502)  climbed after saying profit may beat its earlier
forecast.  Isuzu Motors jumped 6.2 percent in Tokyo, even after it
denied a report Volkswagen AG is considering taking a stake or
purchasing the Japanese truckmaker outright. Toshiba, a nuclear
reactor supplier, advanced 2 percent. Sanrio Co., the maker of
Hello Kitty character goods, surged 11 percent after saying
full-year net income beat its forecast.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  jumped
after a report said its Indian unit will introduce two new
models a year there.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.2 percent to 136.29 as
of 7:58 p.m. in Tokyo, with about the same number of shares
gaining as falling. The measure has risen the past three weeks
as Japanese companies resumed production after last month’s
earthquake, and as an improving  U.S. economy  bolstered optimism
the global recovery can be sustained.  “Generally, expectations are for corporate activity to
increase,” said Melbourne-based  Tim Schroeders , of Pengana
Capital Ltd., which manages about $1 billion. “But we’ve still
got a few issues to deal with in the shorter term. Investors are
fairly cautious given what’s going on in the region”  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.1 percent,
reversing earlier declines of as much as 0.9 percent.
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.6 percent and  New Zealand ’s

today. In  New York , the index rose less than 0.1 percent to
1,314.41 yesterday as a Federal Reserve report fueled optimism
the U.S. economy can weather President Barack Obama’s plan to
cut spending and raise taxes.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.5 percent by the  S&P
500  and 0.9 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Isuzu jumped 6.2 percent to 310 yen, the biggest gain on
the  Nikkei 225. (NKY)  Volkswagen AG, Europe’s largest automaker is
considering taking a stake or purchasing Isuzu outright,
 Germany ’s Manager Magazin reported yesterday, without citing
anyone. Volkswagen said it won’t decide soon on whether to take
a stake in Japan’s largest maker of light trucks, while Isuzu
also denied the report was true.  Toshiba, Sanrio  Toshiba advanced 2 percent to 404 yen after its president
said net income may beat forecasts. Net income for the year
ended March 31 may exceed Toshiba’s January estimate, President
Norio Sasaki told reporters today in Tokyo.  Sanrio gained 11 percent to 2,565 yen. The company said
full-year net income amounted to 9.1 billion yen, 30 percent
more than its 7 billion yen outlook, citing its “favorable”
overseas license operations.  Hyundai Motor, South Korea’s largest automaker, advanced
4.5 percent to 222,000 won as the biggest support to the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index’s gains today. The automaker’s Indian unit
will introduce two new models a year until 2014 in the south
Asian country to retain its number two sales ranking there, the
Wall Street Journal reported, citing Arvind Saxena, the
company’s sales head.  Leighton Slumps  Among stocks that declined,  Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) ,
Australia’s biggest builder, tumbled 12 percent to A$24.93, the
biggest decline on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  The company expects a net loss of A$427 million in the year
ending June, compared with an earlier forecast for a profit, it
said in an April 11 statement. Leighton also sold new shares at
A$22.50 apiece after forecasting A$907 million in writebacks and
impairments in the year ending June because of project-cost
overruns and charges at its Middle East venture.  In Hong Kong, Chinese banks led declines as speculation on
speculation they will need to raise more capital. China
Construction Bank Co., the nation’s No. 2 lender, slid 1.5
percent to HK$7.35.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd.,
the nation’s biggest lender, dropped 1.2 percent to HK$6.51.
 Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , the nation’s third-largest lender by market
value, declined 1.1 percent to HK$4.36.  Inflation, Capital Raising  Chinese banks may have to raise about 860 billion yuan
($131 billion) of stock over six years to meet stricter capital
rules, according to estimates from the industry regulator, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. Lenders are likely to
need an additional 1.26 trillion yuan in supplementary capital
by the end of 2016, the person said, declining to be named
because the calculations aren’t public.  The country’s lenders wrote 679.4 billion yuan in new loans
in March, the central bank said today. That compares with the
600 billion yuan median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The new loans number will add more pressure on banks in
the short term,” said  Alex Au , managing director in Hong Kong
of Richland Capital Management Ltd., which oversees $300 million
of assets. “The banks will need to lower their loan growth in
the coming few months. If new loan growth is too fast, it will
create more inflationary pressure for the economy.”  Also, China’s inflation in March may have risen 5.3 percent
to 5.4 percent from a year earlier, Hong Kong-based Phoenix
Television reported on its website today, citing an unidentified
person. The National Bureau of Statistics is due to release
first quarter and March economic data, including for inflation
and economic growth, in Beijing tomorrow.  “People are still nervous about the Chinese economy in
terms of a policy-induced hard landing,” said Prasad Patkar,
who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus Asset Management
Ltd. in Sydney. “There’s a lot of talk about the inflation
numbers being released tomorrow. If it’s high, people are a bit
concerned about how policy setters might react to that.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
