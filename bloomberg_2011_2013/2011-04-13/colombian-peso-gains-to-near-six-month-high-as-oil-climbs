Colombia’s peso gained to the
strongest level in almost six months as oil, the country’s
biggest export, rose.  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 1,817.17 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:59 a.m. New York time from 1,819.43 yesterday. The currency
touched 1,812.40 yesterday, its strongest level since Oct. 21.
The peso has advanced 2.9 percent in the past month, the second-
best performance after the Brazilian real among the six major
Latin American currencies.  “Strong fundamentals point to a stronger peso,” said
Daniel Lozano, head analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota.
“FDI is rising, oil above $100 a barrel also implies
significant flows, and bets are for higher  interest rates  which
also attracts funds from abroad.”  The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020
rose 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.12 percent,
according to  Colombia ’s stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.153 centavo to 118.179 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
