Sales growth at major South Korean
department stores rebounded last month from an 11-month low as
economic expansion boosted demand, bolstering the case for
higher  interest rates  to curb inflation.  Outlays at the three biggest chains increased 13.1 percent
from a year earlier, after rising 5.2 percent in February, the
Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.
February’s gain was the smallest since March 2010.  Strengthening exports and recovering domestic demand last
year drove the fastest growth since 2002, stoking price gains
and prompting the central bank to raise interest rates from a
record-low 2 percent. Benchmark interest rates need to rise to
“at least” 4 percent this year from the current 3 percent to
rein in inflation and household debt, Kim Tae Joon, president of
Korea Institute of Finance, said in an interview yesterday.  The  Bank of Korea , which kept its benchmark rate unchanged
this week, raised its 2011 inflation forecast to 3.9 percent
yesterday from a previous 3.5 percent, citing higher oil and
food costs.  The finance ministry said in its monthly economic report
last week that the economy is facing “higher uncertainty” due
to volatile  oil prices , the effects of Japan’s earthquake last
month, and Europe’s debt crisis. Domestic private consumption
may slow, reflecting a decline in  consumer confidence  to the
lowest level in almost two years in March.  Discount-store sales rose 1.9 percent in March from a year
earlier after declining 10.9 percent in February as South
Korea’s Lunar New Year holiday fell in early February this year,
spurring shopping in January, the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
