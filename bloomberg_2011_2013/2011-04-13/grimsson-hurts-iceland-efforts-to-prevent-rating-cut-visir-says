Iceland ’s efforts to prevent a
credit downgrade suffered a blow after President Olafur R. Grimsson criticized the ability of Moody’s Investors Service to
assess credit risks, Visir reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  Grimsson told Bloomberg Television Moody’s has an
“abysmal” track record in judging credit risks, in an April 11
interview. The remarks may have stalled talks between the
government and Moody’s that Iceland hoped would prevent a
downgrade, the Reykjavik-based news service reported today.  Iceland’s government has been trying to persuade the rating
agency not to downgrade its debt after voters rejected a
depositor claims accord with the U.K. and  Netherlands  on April
9, according to Visir. Moody’s said on Feb. 23 it will lower
Iceland’s credit grade if the depositor accord is rejected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
