U.K. government bonds fell as stock
markets gained and a report showed retail sales in the U.S.
increased for a ninth straight month in March, boosting optimism
the global economic recovery will be sustained.  The losses pushed the two-year yield up from near the
lowest since March 22. The FTSE 100 Index of stocks gained 0.8
percent, rebounding from yesterday’s drop, which was the biggest
in four weeks. Gilts also declined as a government report showed
unemployment fell even as those claiming jobless benefits
increased. The government is scheduled to sell 2 billion pounds
($3.26 billion) of 2040 gilts tomorrow, after today’s sale of 5
billion pounds of debt maturing in 2016. The pound traded near
the weakest in almost six months against the euro.  “Stocks have regained their poise and that’s taken the
shine off gilts,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “We’ve got
another auction tomorrow.”  The two-year yield climbed one basis point to 1.26 percent
as of 5:21 p.m. in London. The 4.5 percent securities maturing
in March 2013 dropped 0.020, or 20 pence per 1,000-pound
($1,629) face amount, to 106.06. The yield dropped yesterday to
1.25 percent. The 10-year gilt yield also rose one basis point,
to 3.71 percent after falling 11 basis points yesterday.  Purchases at U.S. stores rose 0.4 percent following a 1.1
percent February gain that was larger than previously estimated,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington . U.K.
Unemployment measured by International Labour Organization
methods slipped to 7.8 percent in the quarter through February
from 7.9 percent in the three months through November, the
 Office for National Statistics  said today in  London .  Gilt Sale  The U.K. Debt Management Office sold 5 billion pounds of 2
percent notes maturing in 2016 today, part of 11.5 billion
pounds of debt issuances planned for this week.  The pound dropped against the 17-nation European common
currency earlier as reports showed inflation accelerated in
France and  Germany , bolstering the case for higher European
Central Bank interest rates.  “The BOE will sit tight until August at least,” said  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in London, who
lowered his three-month pound forecast against the euro to 92
pence from 89 pence today. “I’m still on the bearish side in
terms of U.K. data and the pound will continue to slide.”  Sterling was little changed at 88.93 pence per euro and was
0.1 percent stronger at $1.6276.  Rate Differentials  Sterling dropped 0.8 percent against the euro and gilts
rose yesterday as data showing inflation unexpectedly slowed and
retail sales tumbled, stoking speculation that the Bank of
England will raise  interest rates  later and at a slower pace
than previously expected.  The London-based central bank kept its main rate at an all-
time low of 0.5 percent on April 7, while the ECB raised its
main refinancing rate to 1.25 percent from 1 percent on the same
day to contain above-target inflation. Sterling is little
changed this year, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, which measure 10 developed-market currencies. It trails
behind the euro’s 4.2 percent gain on speculation that the ECB
will raise rates faster than the Bank of England. The pound has
gained 4.2 percent against the dollar since Dec. 31 and weakened
3.6 percent versus the 17-nation euro.  U.K. gilts have outperformed their German counterparts this
year amid bets the  Bank of England  will keep rates at a record
low to revive the economy. Gilts have lost 0.7 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. German bunds handed investors a loss of 2.7 percent. U.S.
Treasuries have returned negative 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
