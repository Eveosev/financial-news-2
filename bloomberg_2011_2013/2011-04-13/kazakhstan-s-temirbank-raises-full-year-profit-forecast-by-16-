Temirbank, the Kazakh lender taken
over by the government after it defaulted in 2009, raised its
profit forecast this year by 16 percent, saying it plans to
boost lending.  The lender expects to post a profit of 5 billion tenge ($34
million) this year, up from its October estimate of 4.3 billion
tenge, Chief Executive Officer Erzhan Shaikenov told reporters
in Almaty today. The bank plans to increase its loan portfolio
by as much as 4 percent this year, Shaikenov said.  The lender reported an 81 billion-tenge profit for 2010,
compared with a 95 billion-tenge loss in 2009, Shaikenov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
