Nigeria’s opposition  Labor Party 
said it will support President Goodluck Jonathan, the candidate
of the ruling People’s  Democratic Party , in the April 16
presidential vote.  Jonathan “is the most qualified candidate,” Dan
Nwanyanwu, national chairman of the Labor Party, told reporters
today in the capital, Abuja. The party, which won 11 seats in
last week’s parliamentary election, will not field a candidate
for the presidential vote, he said.  Eighteen candidates will challenge Jonathan in this week’s
poll, including Muhammadu Buhari, a northern Muslim and former
military ruler who is representing the Congress for Progressive
Change. Nuhu Ribadu, the former head of the country’s anti-
corruption agency, is standing as a candidate for the Action
Congress of  Nigeria .  The All Progressive Grand Alliance Party, Nigeria’s third-
biggest opposition group, will also back Jonathan in the vote,
Chairman Victor Umeh, said on Feb. 11.  Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and the
continent’s biggest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
