Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators fell for the first time in four days
on forecasts of moderating temperatures that may reduce air-
conditioning use. Shipments to the Southeast dropped for a
second day.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments declined 6.4 percent to 13.1
million dekatherms (12.8 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg as of 3 p.m. in New York. Shipments to
power generators in the Southeast slipped 12.3 percent to 2.52
million.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 1.2 percent to
27.2 million, the sixth consecutive decline.  High temperatures in Miami today are expected to hit 85
degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), down from 90 yesterday,
according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan.  Wholesale gas delivered at the Sonat-T1 hub, where gas is
delivered from Texas and Louisiana to the Southeast, rose 7.12
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $4.1617 per million British thermal
units on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
advanced 5.91 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $4.1417 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
