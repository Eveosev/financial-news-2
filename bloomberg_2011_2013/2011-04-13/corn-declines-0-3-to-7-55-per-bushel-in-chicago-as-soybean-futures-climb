Soybeans, corn and wheat rose in
 Chicago  on speculation the biggest declines in almost a month
are luring importers and investors.  Soybeans and wheat yesterday fell the most since March 15,
and corn dropped the most since March 16. Prices slid as
commodities retreated amid more earthquakes in  Japan  and
radiation leaks from the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. The
Japanese government raised the severity of the nuclear crisis to
the highest level, matching the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  “We wouldn’t be surprised to see a slight reversal of some
of those losses,”  Luke Mathews , a strategist at Commonwealth
Bank of  Australia , said by phone from Sydney. Yesterday’s
selling stemmed more from “ risk aversion  through the entire
financial markets” than a change in the fundamental supply-and-
demand balance outlook, he said.  Soybeans for July delivery gained 10 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $13.51 a bushel by 1:14 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The contract closed 2.8 percent lower yesterday.  Stockpiles of the oilseed in the U.S., the largest grower
and exporter, fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier to 1.249
billion bushels as of March 1, the  lowest  for that date since
2003, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said March 31. The
nation’s farmers will cut the area sown with soybeans by 1
percent to 76.609 million acres, the USDA said.  Soybean Harvests  Production from  Brazil , Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and
Bolivia will reach 132.7 million metric tons this year, 2.8
million tons more than previously forecast, researcher Oil World
said yesterday. The U.S. will export 42.5 million tons, or 1.1
percent less than the USDA’s estimate, it said.  Corn for July delivery gained 4.75 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $7.6225 a bushel. China will probably buy 1 million to 2
million tons of the grain from Argentina for shipment in June
and July, Oil World said yesterday.  Argentina  is the world’s
largest corn exporter after the U.S., according to USDA data.  Wheat for July delivery rose 6.25 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$7.985 a bushel. The grain is up 4.6 percent this month, partly
on speculation demand will increase amid declining world
stockpiles.  Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris gained 75 cents, or 0.3 percent, to 241 euros ($349.26) a
ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
