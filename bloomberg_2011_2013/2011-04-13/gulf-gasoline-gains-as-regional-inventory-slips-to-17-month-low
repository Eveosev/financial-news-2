Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast 
strengthened after inventories dropped to their lowest level in
the region since November 2009.  Inventories in the region, which contains more than 40
percent of U.S. refining capacity, dropped 3.13 million barrels
to 68.4 million last week, according to the Energy Department.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.25 cent to 11.63 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:41
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
gained 4.34 cents to $3.0888 a gallon.  The same fuel in  New York  Harbor was unchanged at a
discount of 9.75 cents a gallon.  Crude oil processing at East Coast refineries dropped
243,000 barrels a day to 621,000 barrels last week, according to
the Energy Department. It was the lowest level in at least 19
years.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  last week extended maintenance on a reformer
and associated units at its 355,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia
refinery. The company also found a pinhole leak in an expansion
joint associated with a fluid catalytic cracker in the Girard
Point section of the plant, two people with knowledge of the
situation said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
