Chemtura Corp., a maker of
specialty and farm chemicals, is seeking to acquire companies in
 India  that make industrial chemicals in a bid to quadruple sales
to $2 billion from the Asia-Pacific region by 2015.  The size of the acquisition will be “significant,” Chief
Executive officer Craig Rogerson told reporters in  New Delhi 
today, without elaborating. The company, based in Philadelphia,
imports fire retardant, automotive and other industrial
chemicals into India at present.  “That is not a long-term model for success,” Rogerson
said. “We can’t afford the time to grow the industrial
chemicals business from ground up.”  India currently accounts for about $100 million of the
company’s sales. Chemtura will spend as much as $250 million to
grow its Asia-Pacific business in the five years to 2015,
excluding acquisitions, Rogerson said.  Chemtura , which manufactures farm chemicals at its plant at
Gajuraula, in the eastern Indian state of  Uttar Pradesh , plans
to start exports from the country to Argentina,  Australia ,
Canada and Eastern Europe, said Bharat K. Pandey, director of
Chemtura’s South Asia operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
