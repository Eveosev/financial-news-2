Countries looking to trim their
budgets must stay focused on economic growth so they don’t make
unemployment permanently worse, International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said today.  Advanced economies need to put their budgets on
“sustainable medium-term paths,” Strauss-Kahn said in prepared
remarks for a speech at the  Brookings  Institution in Washington.
Countries also need “direct” policies to support the labor
market and address inequality, he said.  “Fiscal tightening can lower growth in the short term, and
this can even increase long-term unemployment, turning a
cyclical into a structural problem,” Strauss-Kahn said. “The
bottom line is that fiscal adjustment must be done with an eye
kept keenly on growth.”  The Group of 20 nations are looking to the Washington-based
fund to help monitor global imbalances and keep an eye out for
economic warning signs. Strauss-Kahn said the IMF would be
monitoring labor conditions more closely as part of these
efforts.  “As we understand the links with stability better, the
jobs issue is becoming more central in our surveillance,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
