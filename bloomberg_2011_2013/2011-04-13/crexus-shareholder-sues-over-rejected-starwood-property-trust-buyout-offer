CreXus Investment Corp. (CXS)  was sued by
a shareholder over the company’s rejection of a $254 million
buyout offer from  Starwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD)   Shareholder Norman Carey said in a complaint filed
yesterday in  New York  state court that CreXus, which invests in
commercial real estate loans, and its management breached their
fiduciary duty to the public shareholders. Carey seeks to
represent the company’s shareholders in a class-action lawsuit.  CreXus, based in New York, on March 28 said it had rejected
the Starwood bid, valued at about $14 a share. Instead the
company proceeded with the sale of 50 million shares to fund the
purchase of a real estate loan portfolio from  Barclays Plc. (BARC) 
Starwood had said it would withdraw its offer if the stock sale
went through.  “Rather than enter into discussions that will result in
increased value for the company and its shareholders, the board
has preferred to set obstacles to negotiations by completing a
disfavored-by-the-market equity offering in the guise of
advancing shareholder interests,” Carey said in the complaint.  CreXus representatives didn’t return a message left with
the company’s investor relations department after regular
business hours yesterday.  The case is Norman Carey v. CreXus, 650973/2011, Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
