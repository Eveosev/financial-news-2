Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said the U.S. central bank can ensure
appropriate monetary policy by encouraging independent research
and a wide range of opinions among Fed officials.  “The ability to question and reexamine conventional wisdom
leads to better policy,” Bullard said in prepared remarks today
in St. Louis. “The Fed’s ability to absorb and tolerate
multiple viewpoints helps prevent groupthink and leads to
superior monetary policy and, ultimately, to better
macroeconomic performance.”  Bullard has said since February that the Fed should trim
its plan to buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasuries amid reports of
stronger economic growth. He has also expressed concern about
the central bank’s commitment to keep  interest rates  near zero
for “an extended period.”  The  St. Louis  Fed has become “known for challenging
conventional wisdom with rigorous analysis and stubborn facts,”
Bullard said. “That maverick reputation has endured here ever
since.”  Bullard commented in an introduction of Bundesbank
President  Axel Weber , who is scheduled to speak at the St. Louis
Fed.  He didn’t comment on U.S. monetary policy or the economic
outlook in his prepared comments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
