France , the world’s second-largest
wheat exporter, raised its forecast for record sales outside
the European Union as countries in the Middle East and North
 Africa  boost stockpiles to ensure food supplies.  French wheat exports outside the EU will be 12.75 million
metric tons in the 12 months to June, up from 12.6 million tons
forecast last month, crops office FranceAgriMer said in a report
today. The estimate for total wheat exports was raised to 19.36
million tons from 19.26 million tons, it said.  An index of world food prices tracked by the  United
Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization fell from a record
last month as wheat and corn prices declined. Milling wheat
futures on NYSE Liffe for May delivery are little changed since
the end of last month.  Protests and riots erupted from  Bahrain  to  Morocco  in the
last few months in part because of rising food costs, toppling
leaders in the northern African nations of  Egypt  and  Tunisia .  Algeria , northern Africa’s second-largest grain buyer
after Egypt, purchased a total of 2.95 million tons of wheat of
all origins between Dec. 16 and Jan. 26, probably a record for
a five-week period, FranceAgriMer said in February.  Fourth Increase  The crops office in March had lifted the outlook for soft-
wheat shipments outside the EU by 500,000 tons, the fourth
increase in as many months, partially on Algeria’s buying.  France had loaded 10.6 million tons of soft wheat for
export out of the EU at the end of last month, up from 7.2
million tons a year earlier, the office said.  Full-year exports of soft wheat outside the EU amounted to
9.8 million tons in 2009-2010, according to FranceAgriMer.
Stockpiles at the end of June will be 2.279 million tons, up
from last month’s estimate of 2.166 million tons, because of a
larger-than-expected harvest in the country. The domestic wheat
harvest will be 32.9 million tons, up from 32.8 million
estimated last month, FranceAgriMer said.  French farmers will plant 5 million hectares (12.4 million
acres) of soft wheat for harvesting in 2011, the crops office
said, little changed from last month’s forecast. That would be
up from 4.92 million hectares harvested in 2010.  French exports of durum wheat, the hard variety used to
make pasta and couscous, are expected to be 1.85 million tons.
That would leave stockpiles at 233,000 tons at the end of June,
FranceAgriMer said.  The crops office forecast corn exports of 5.29 million and
ending stocks at 2.5 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
