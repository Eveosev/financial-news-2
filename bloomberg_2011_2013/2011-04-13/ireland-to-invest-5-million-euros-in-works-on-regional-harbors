Ireland’s Minister for Transport
and Tourism, Leo Varadkar, said the Irish government will invest
more than 5 million euros to carry out “remedial works” at
regional harbors in 2011, prior to their transfer from the
Department of Transport back to local control, the Department of
Transport and Tourism said in an e-mailed statement today. Eight
of 13 regional harbours have already been transferred, and work
is in progress to transfer the remaining five, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
