Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. raised
$1.25 billion in an expanded U.S. initial public offering, said
a person with knowledge of the situation.  Arcos priced 73.5 million shares at $17 each, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the details aren’t
public. The deal received more than 10 times more orders than
the amount of stock being offered, the person said.  The Buenos Aires-based McDonald’s operator raised 33
percent more than it sought. Arcos had planned to offer 62.5
million shares for $13 to $15 apiece, according to a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Arcos is one of
seven companies attempting to raise a total $1.89 billion in
U.S. IPOs this week, the biggest number of weekly deals in more
than two months.  Arcos, which operates 1,755 McDonald’s locations in Latin
America and the Caribbean, will use $150 million of the share
sale’s proceeds to open new outlets and remodel existing ones,
according to the filing.  The sale was led by Bank of America Corp., based in
 Charlotte ,  North Carolina ; JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley
and Citigroup Inc. of  New York ; and Sao Paulo-based Itau
Unibanco Holding SA.  The shares will list on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol ARCO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
