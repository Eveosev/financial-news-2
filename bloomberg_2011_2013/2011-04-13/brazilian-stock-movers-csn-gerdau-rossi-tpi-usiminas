The following companies had unusual
price changes in Sao Paulo trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time. Preferred
shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index fell 0.6 percent to 66,486.49.  Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3 BS), the Brazilian
steelmaker known as CSN, declined 3.4 percent to 24.55 reais,
its lowest price since September 2009, on mounting concern that
 Brazil ’s central bankers will be unable to rein in inflation or
stem gains in the real. Steelmaker  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas
Gerais SA (USIM5)  (USIM5 BS) dropped 3.7 percent to 17.82 reais, its
lowest price since July 2009.  Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  (GGBR4 BS), Latin America’s largest steelmaker,
fell 2.4 percent to 18.91 reais as the company and its
shareholders sold 68 million new common shares and may issue
additional shares to raise as much as 5.5 billion reais ($3.5
billion) in the region’s biggest stock sale in almost seven
months.       OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3 BS), the  oil
company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , fell 0.8 percent
to 19.15 reais after the company said it’s still analyzing
results from a well in an offshore Brazilian field after
finishing drilling earlier this month. The well is “not dry,”
OGX’s press office said in response to speculation that the
delay in reporting results was a result of not finding any oil.  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  (RSID3 BS) gained 1.3 percent to 14.12
reais after it said contracted sales increased 20 percent in the
first quarter from a year ago. Before today, Rossi had fallen
5.8 percent this year on concern inflation will limit growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
