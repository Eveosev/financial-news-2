Russian stocks rallied after their
steepest sell-off in five weeks as oil rebounded and a report
showed U.S. retail sales increased for the ninth month.  The Micex snapped two days of losses, advancing 0.6 percent
to 1,809.83 at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The gauge tumbled
2.5 percent yesterday. OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-largest gas
producer, led the advance, jumping 2.9 percent. OAO Sberbank,
the biggest lender, rose 1.3 percent.  Oil rallied for the first time in three days in  New York 
after an Energy Department report showed a larger-than-forecast
decrease in gasoline inventories. Crude for May delivery
advanced 0.8 percent to $107.11 a barrel, after earlier
declining as much as 0.8 percent.  OAO Raspadskaya jumped 1 percent after the coal producer
boosted first-quarter coal output by 39 percent from the
previous three-month period.  Retail sales in the U.S., the world’s largest economy,
increased 0.4 percent following a 1.1 percent February gain that
was larger than previously estimated, Commerce Department said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
