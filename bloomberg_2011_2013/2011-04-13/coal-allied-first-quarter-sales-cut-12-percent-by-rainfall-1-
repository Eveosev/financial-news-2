Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. (CNA) , the
Australian coal unit of Rio Tinto Group, said first-quarter
sales declined 12 percent after heavy rainfall slowed mining.  Coal sales were 4.8 million metric tons in the three months
ended March 31, compared with 5.4 million tons in the previous
quarter, Brisbane-based Coal & Allied said today in a statement.
Production declined 18 percent to 4.6 million tons.  Above average rainfall slowed mining and curbed output at
the companyâ€™s  Hunter Valley  operations, it said. Coal & Allied
expects 2011 production to rise by between 5 percent and 10
percent, it said today.  Demand from  Japan  may decline over the next 6 to 12 months
as some customers are affected by the earthquakes and tsunamis
that struck the nation last month. That may be offset by
increased demand from other parts of Asia, Coal & Allied said.  Coal & Allied declined 0.7 percent to A$123.26 at the 4:10
p.m. close of Sydney trading on the Australian stock exchange.
 Rio Tinto  owns 75.7 percent of the company according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales in the quarter were 22 percent greater than the first
quarter of 2010, Coal & Allied said. Total coal output in the
quarter was 6.352 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
