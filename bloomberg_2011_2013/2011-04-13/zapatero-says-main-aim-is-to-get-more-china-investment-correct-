(Corrects in second paragraph to show Zapatero said 12
percent is the share of outstanding debt in foreign hands.)  Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said his main aim on a trip to  China  was to
attract more investment from his hosts.  China had become “a main long-term investor” in Spanish
debt and had helped his country pay back its liabilities.
Zapatero, who spoke today during a visit to Beijing, said that
China holds more than 12 percent of the Spanish debt bought by
foreign investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
