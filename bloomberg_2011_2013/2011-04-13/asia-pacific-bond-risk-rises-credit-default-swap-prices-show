The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from non-payment increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 1.5 basis points
to 105.5 as of 10:05 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Credit
Agricole  CIB prices. The risk benchmark is headed for its
highest close since April 1, according to data provider CMA
prices in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose one basis point to 107 basis points
as of 8:05 a.m. in Singapore, according to Credit Agricole. The
index is on course for its highest close since March 31, CMA
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1.5 basis points to 136
as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. Contracts
insuring Japanese government debt against default rose one basis
point to 88 as of 9:12 a.m. in Tokyo, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
