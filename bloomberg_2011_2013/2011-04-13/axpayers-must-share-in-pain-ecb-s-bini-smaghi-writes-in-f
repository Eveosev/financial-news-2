European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi , writing in the Financial
Times, said taxpayers must share in the consequences of the
financial crisis as long as financial supervision remains
national.  While taxpayers benefited from the “benign environment”
the Irish and U.K. financial sectors enjoyed before the
financial crisis, afterwards it became a “heavy burden,” Bini
Smaghi wrote in the FT, and taxpayers may have to “bear some of
the costs of resolving the situation,” he wrote.  While the other members of the European Union, as an
integrated financial area, might potentially share these costs,
this would be feasible only if there were an “integration of
independent prudential supervision at the European, or at least
euro area, level to match the way burdens are shared when a
systemic crisis strikes,” Bini Smaghi said in the FT.  “As long as the accountability of supervisors to taxpayers
is primarily a national affair, and discretion in the
implementation of national financial regulation and supervision
is allowed, then there is a high risk that taxpayers will foot
the bill,” Bini Smaghi wrote. “They should not complain when
it happens,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
