Iranian official bodies are
withholding publication of economic indicators, preventing
analysis of the country’s performance,  Shargh  reported, citing
economists.  The central bank hasn’t announced gross domestic product or
economic growth in about two years and the last time Iran’s
statistics center published the  unemployment rate  was 12 months
ago, when it stood at 14.6 percent, the newspaper said.  The veracity of a recent Economy Ministry announcement that
unemployment now stands at 10 percent is questionable, as there
is no explanation for a “sudden” drop at a time of recession,
Shargh said. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s claim that 2.5
million jobs will be created this year will require economic
growth of about 20 percent, it said.  No one was immediately available to comment at the central
bank’s media affairs office or at the statistics center. The
 International Monetary Fund  has  predicted  zero economic growth
for Iran this year, compared with 1 percent in 2010. Iran’s
population is 75 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
