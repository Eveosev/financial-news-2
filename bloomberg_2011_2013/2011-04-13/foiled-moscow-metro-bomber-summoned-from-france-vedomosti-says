A Russian man arrested for trying
to bomb two Moscow subway stations was summoned from  France  for
the operation by rebel leader Aslan Byutukaev,  Vedomosti 
reported, citing unidentified investigators.  Federal Security Service agents arrested the man in a
Moscow park in November 2009 before he could attack the
Pushkinskaya and Belorusskaya stations, the Moscow-based
newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
