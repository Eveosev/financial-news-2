The Australian government will
offer A$34.9 million ($36.5 million) in funding to help build a
solar thermal plant on the site of an existing coal-fired power
station in the northeastern state of Queensland.  The Kogan Creek Solar Boost project, which will cost
A$104.7 million, is scheduled to start operating by 2013, Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  said today in a  statement .  The solar farm near the town of Chinchilla is being
developed by state-owned electricity generator  CS Energy . The
technology will be supplied by  Areva SA (CEI) ’s solar unit, which
plans to manufacture the hardware locally, Gillard said.  Solar-thermal electricity generation, called STEG in the
power industry, concentrates sunlight using mirrors to make heat
and steam that is then used to create power. The system is more
stable than making power directly from the sun using
photovoltaic cells because heat can be stored, and it’s more
suitable to be retrofitted onto a coal-burning plant.  The project will lead to the installation of an additional
44 megawatts of capacity to an operating 750-megawatt coal-fired
plant, CS Energy said on its website. The developer said it will
contribute A$70 million toward the project cost.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
