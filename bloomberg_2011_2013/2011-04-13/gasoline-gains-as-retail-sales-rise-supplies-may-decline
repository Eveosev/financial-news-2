Gasoline rose the most in three
weeks after a report that U.S. inventories declined the most on
a per-barrel basis since October 1998 as refinery rates and
imports of the motor fuel dropped while demand improved.  Futures gained 2.5 percent after the Energy Department
reported gasoline stockpiles sank 7 million barrels, or 3.2
percent, to 209.7 million barrels, the lowest level since
November. Supplies fell as gasoline imports slipped 17 percent
and refiners cut rates 3 percentage points to 81.4 percent, a
six-week low. Demand jumped to a 5-week high.  “It’s an immediately bullish report because it tightens
supplies,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security
Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “But this points to
something bearish in the next couple of weeks because the reason
for the big decline is refiners are staying out of the market
for economic or maintenance reasons.”  Gasoline for May delivery rose 7.83 cents to settle at
$3.2424 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
first gain in three days and largest since March 17.  The fuel traded at a 3.96 cent premium to heating oil, its
strongest performance since July 30.  Inventories were forecast to decline 1 million barrels in
the week ended April 8, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.
Supplies have shed 31.4 million barrels, or 13 percent, since
Feb. 11, when they were the highest in almost 21 years.  “The draw is the big driver today because it comes as
you’re going into gasoline season,” said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Refinery Rates  Last week’s decline in supplies and rates came as refiners
shut production units for repairs. Refiners in PADD 1, which
includes the East Coast, reduced crude inputs 28 percent last
week to an average 621,000 barrels a day.  PADD I refinery rates slipped to 39 percent from 60.4
percent as refiners, including Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia plant,
shut units and as the government’s estimate of operable capacity
increased by 183,000 barrels a day to 1.58 million barrels.
That’s about the same size as PBF Energy LLC’s Delaware City,
Delaware, refinery, which is scheduled to reopen this quarter
for the first time since it was closed in 2009 by former owner
Valero Energy Corp.  Production of gasoline rose 1.8 percent to 8.97 million
barrels a day even as refinery utilization fell 3 percentage
points to 81.4 percent, a six-week low. Refiners cut production
of distillates, including heating oil and diesel, by 5.9 percent
to an average 4.05 million barrels a day, the lowest level since
the week ended Feb. 18.  Gasoline Imports  Gasoline imports dropped to 889,000 barrels a day. Demand
for the fuel, as measured by deliveries to wholesalers, surged
3.7 percent to 9.18 million barrels a day, the highest level
since March 4. On a four-week average, consumption was 1.6
percent below a year earlier.  “I find it not credible to attribute the inventory decline
to strong demand,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading
and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas . “We’re
expecting demand destruction based on continued escalation of
retail pump prices.”  Regular gasoline at the pump increased 1.7 cents to $3.808
a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest
price since Sept. 18, 2008. Prices have risen 7.4 percent in
four consecutive weeks of gains.  Futures were up before the report’s 10:30 a.m. release as
Commerce Department figures today showed sales at U.S. retailers
increased in March for a ninth consecutive month.  Futures Volume  Gasoline volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
164,864 contracts as of 3:01 p.m. in  New York , 46 percent above
the average during the past three months. Heating oil volume was
101,882 contracts, 20 percent below the three-month average.  Heating oil for May delivery added 3.02 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $3.2028 a gallon on the exchange.  Stockpiles of distillates dropped 2.68 million barrels to
150.8 million, the lowest level in almost a year. Demand rose
3.5 percent to 3.8 million barrels a day. The four-week average
is 1.4 percent above a year earlier, according to the
department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
