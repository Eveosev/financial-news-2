Anders Svendsen, chief analyst at
Nordea Bank in Copenhagen, comments on  Poland ’s March inflation
data.  The inflation rate rose to 4.3 percent in March, the
highest in more than two years, and compared with a 3.9 percent
median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Svendsen spoke in a phone interview today.  On inflation:  "The number is significantly above expectations, and it
will move forward the expected rate hikes by the central bank of
Poland. This was a higher than expected number, mostly due to
fuel and energy prices.  "At least according to my calculations,  core inflation 
stayed flat at 2.1 percent, which could be a factor for the
doves."  On  interest rates :  "I wouldn’t say that a May hike is certain after this
number but it is certainly more likely than it was before."  To contact the reporter on this story:
