Argentina’s social security agency,
known as  Anses , may start to exercise larger voting powers on
company boards, Economy Minister Amado Boudou told reporters in
Buenos Aires.  The government has boosted in the past year and half its
 role  on  boards of companies  such as Telecom Argentina SA,  Pampa
Energia SA (PAMP) , Consultatio SA, Aluar Aluminio Argentino SAIC,  Banco
Macro SA (BMA)  and Distribuidora de Gas Cuyana SA, Boudou said today.  Boudou said that the agency will “exercise all of its
political rights” to name directors in the companies depending
on its stake in the companies, which range from 31 percent to
less than 1 percent, according to information on the agency’s
website.  Previously, under the private pension system that was
nationalized in 2008 by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the funds had been limited to a 5 percent stake in
companies, Boudou said.  “This allows us to better protect the interests of the
workers and pensioners’ funds that the government manages,”
Boudou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
