ConocoPhillips (COP)  had an upset in a
sulfur unit associated with processing natural gas liquids,
according to a person familiar with refinery operations.  The upset occurred on unit No. 34 and shouldn’t affect the
crude processing rate at the plant, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.  The refinery’s gross crude oil capacity is 146,000 barrels
a day, and the natural gas liquids fractionation capacity is
45,000 barrels, according to the company’s  website .  ConocoPhillips operates a 10-inch crude pipeline, with the
capacity of 59,000 barrels a day, to Cushing,  Oklahoma , from the
Borger refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
