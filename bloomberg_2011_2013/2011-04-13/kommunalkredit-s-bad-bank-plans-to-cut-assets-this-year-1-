KA Finanz AG, the state-owned bank
that took on the riskiest assets of  Austria ’s Kommunalkredit
Austria AG, plans to reduce its securities and credit default
swaps by 2.4 billion euros ($3.5 billion) this year.  KA Finanz plans to sell 1.5 billion euros of securities
with the rest of the reduction coming from redemptions, Chief
Executive Officer Alois Steinbichler told journalists in Vienna
today. The bank’s Tier 1 ratio will stay above 7 percent,
compared with 7.5 percent at the end of 2010, he said.  KA Finanz, which doesn’t produce new business, took on 27.7
billion euros of risky assets when it was spun off in 2009 from
nationalized lender, Kommunalkredit. Most of the bad bank’s 10.5
billion euros of credit default swaps expire between 2015 and
2017, Steinbichler said.  KA Finanz’s exposure fell to 24.7 billion euros by the end
of last year, he said. That included about 1 billion euros of
Greek bonds and credit default swaps, about 800 million euros of
Irish and the same amount of Portuguese securities, Steinbichler
said.  Net income according to Austrian accounting standards was
zero, he said. If all the bank’s assets were sold immediately
instead of waiting for redemptions and expirations, KA Finanz
would incur a 2 billion-euro loss for the Austrian taxpayer,
Steinbichler said.  Kommunalkredit, which lends mainly to Austrian
municipalities, will eventually be sold, Steinbichler said. The
bank’s net income rose to 24.7 million euros last year, from 2.9
million euros in 2009 when it was still combined with KA Finanz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
