Ghana ’s inflation slowed for the
first time in three months in March as the effects of a 30
percent increase in gasoline prices in January eased and the
cedi stabilized.  The inflation rate fell to 9.1 percent from 9.2 percent in
February,  Grace Bediako , a statistician at the  Ghana  Statistical
Service, told reporters today in the capital, Accra.  The increase in gasoline prices on Jan. 4 by Ghana’s
National Petroleum Authority pushed inflation up to 9.1 percent
in January from 8.6 percent the month before. Price-growth had
slowed in the previous 18 months from a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009.  The Ghanaian cedi has also stabilized, easing pressure on
the cost of imports. After falling as much as 5.7 percent
against the dollar this year, the cedi is now down 1.7 percent
against the U.S. currency.  Slowing inflation enabled the central bank to cut its key
interest rate by 4.5 percentage points last year. The last
reduction in July took the rate to 13.5 percent from 15 percent.
The rate was maintained for the third consecutive meeting at
13.5 percent on Feb. 18.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
