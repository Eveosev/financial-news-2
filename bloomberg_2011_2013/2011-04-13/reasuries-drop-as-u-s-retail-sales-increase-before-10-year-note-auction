Treasuries erased losses before an
auction of $21 billion of 10-year notes as U.S. equities
reversed an advance.  Government bonds  earlier dropped, reversing gains they made
yesterday, as stocks rose, retail sales increased and Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  wrote that
inflation may get out of control.  “There has been very good buying in the last couple of
hours as stocks are coming off, reversing earlier strength, and
the data wasn’t terribly inspiring,” said James Combias, New
York-based head of Treasury trading at Mizuho Securities USA
Inc., one of 20 primary dealers that trade Treasuries with the
U.S. central bank.  Yields on 10-year notes were little changed at 3.49
percent at 12:14 p.m. in New York after earlier rising as much
as five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.54 percent.
They fell nine basis points yesterday, the most since March 16.  Two-year note yields decreased less than one basis point to
0.73 percent after earlier gaining two basis points.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 500 was little changed
after rising as much as 0.6 percent.  Retail sales rose 0.4 percent following a 1.1 percent
February gain that was larger than previously estimated,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington . The
median forecast of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for a 0.5 percent rise. Sales excluding automobiles and gasoline
advanced 0.6 percent, more than projected.  10-Year Auction  The 10-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 3.490
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 3.499 percent the
last time the securities were sold on March 9.  Investors bid for 3.32 times the amount of debt offered
last month, versus the average of 3.11 for the past 10
offerings. Indirect bidders, including foreign central banks,
bought 53 percent of the amount sold at the previous auction.  Today’s offering is the second of three note and bond
auctions this week totaling $66 billion. The U.S. sold $32
billion of three-year debt yesterday at a lower-than-forecast
yield of 1.280 percent and will offer $13 billion of 30-year
securities tomorrow.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was 2.63
percentage points. It increased on April 11 to 2.67 percentage
points, the widest in three years.  ‘All the Risks’  “I see the risk that we won’t be able to keep inflation
under control,” Dallas Fed President Fisher wrote in a guest
commentary in the German newspaper Handelsblatt. “After the Fed
completed its job, I now see above all the risks of a too-
expansive monetary policy.”  The Fed bought $5.01 billion in Treasuries maturing from
January 2013 to June 2013 as part of its plan to purchase $600
billion of U.S. through June to spur economic growth. It
acquired today 11.7 percent of the $42.9 billion in securities
submitted by dealers, compared with an average of 25.3 percent
at the past 10 purchases.  The Fed’s Beige Book survey, an update on the state of the
economy, is due at 2 p.m.  New York  time.  President  Barack Obama  will outline a way to cut the
nation’s long-term debt in a speech today at George Washington
University in the capital, according to a person familiar with
the plan. Over the next five years, the cumulative deficit is
forecast by the administration to be $3.8 trillion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
