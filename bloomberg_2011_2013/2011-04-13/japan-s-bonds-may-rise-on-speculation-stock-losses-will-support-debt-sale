Japanese bond futures gained the
most in three weeks after demand increased a 2.4 trillion yen
($28.7 billion) auction of five-year securities.  Yields on five-year debt fell to the lowest in a week as
the sale drew bids for 3.56 times the amount on offer, up from
3.49 times at previous offering in March. Ten-year bonds rose
for a second day amid speculation the  Bank of Japan  will
maintain monetary easing to support the nation’s recovery from
last month’s record earthquake.  “Five-year notes were at a good level for banks to start
buying in the new fiscal year,” said  Satoshi Yamada , who helps
oversee about $12 billion as manager of fixed-income trading at
Okasan Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Monetary easing has held
down yields while the economic outlook has deteriorated. Yields
are unlikely to rise anytime soon.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell 2.5 basis
points to 1.29 percent as of 3:17 p.m. in Tokyo at  Japan  Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
price of the 1.3 percent security due March 2021 rose 0.219 yen
to 100.087 yen.  Ten-year futures for June delivery gained 0.33 to 139.08 at
the afternoon close on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange, the biggest
gain since March 23.  Debt Sale  The lowest price at today’s five-year auction was 99.84 yen,
matching the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. That
was 0.02 yen below the average price, compared with a difference
of 0.03 yen at the previous sale. The so-called tail is the
difference between the lowest and average prices. The shorter
the tail, the more bids are clustered around the average price.  Five-year yields fell two basis points to 0.525 percent.
They earlier reached 0.515 percent, the lowest since April 6.  The difference between two- and five-year yields narrowed
to 32.5 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The spread was 35.4 basis points on April 12, the widest since
Feb. 21.  The BOJ last week established an emergency 1 trillion yen
lending facility to help businesses affected by the march 11
earthquake and tsunami. In March, it doubled to 10 trillion yen
an asset-purchase program to inject liquidity into markets.  Japanese bonds were also boosted after Treasuries rose
yesterday as President  Barack Obama  vowed to cut $4 trillion in
cumulative deficits within 12 years through a combination of
spending cuts and tax increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
