Sugar for October delivery in  New
York  may become costlier than the July contract, a situation
known as contango, because of supply from  Thailand , the second-
biggest exporter, according to Castlestone Management Ltd.  Raw-sugar for July was 0.7 cent a pound more expensive than
October sugar at 9:46 a.m. in  London , according to data on
Bloomberg, compared with a gap of 1.36 cents a month ago. When
prices are higher for contracts maturing on earlier dates, the
opposite of contango, the situation is known as backwardation.  “Once the May contract expires in New York, a larger-than-
expected crop in Thailand will weigh on prices,” Connor Noonan,
an analyst at Castlestone Management, wrote in an e-mail today.  This season’s Thai crop reached 7.778 million metric tons
by March 23, up 13 percent from the previous year, according to
the  International Sugar Organization . The ISO said April 7 the
official forecast previously hadn’t exceeded 6.8 million tons.  “The only thing keeping the market in backwardation,
especially for the May contract, is the possibility of a delayed
harvest in  Brazil ,” Noonan said. Sugar for May is 1.22 cents a
pound more expensive than for July, data on Bloomberg show.  Prices will be supported in the “near-term” after rain
delayed the start of the cane harvest in Brazil, the world’s
largest producer, Morgan Stanley said in a report on April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
