China , the world’s largest cotton
buyer, is reducing purchases of the fiber as demand slows and
some mills delay orders, according to Eastern Trading Co., a
U.S. exporter.  Eastern’s exports may drop to 1,000 metric tons (4,400
bales) in April from its 4,000-ton monthly average, Chairman
Jordan Lea said yesterday in a telephone interview from
Greenville,  South Carolina . China accounts for about 30 percent
of sales at the closely held cotton merchandiser.  Overseas sales by all shippers in the U.S., the world’s
largest exporter, declined 9.2 percent to 251,501 bales in the
week ended March 31 from a week earlier, according to the
Department of Agriculture. Prices in  New York  have dropped 16
percent since reaching a record $2.197 a pound on March 7.  “Its dead out there,” said Lea, also the president of
American Cotton Shippers Association. “Our salesmen in China
say that they cannot find any buyers.”  Purchases in other Asian markets have slowed as Chinese
merchants re-export U.S. cotton to countries including Taiwan
and  Vietnam , he said.  China’s imports for March fell 15 percent from a year
earlier to 276,400 tons, Reuters reported, citing a website run
by the China National Cotton Reserves Corp.  Cotton futures for July delivery fell 5.34 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $1.8557 yesterday on ICE Futures U.S. The most-
active contract earlier touched $1.8391, the lowest since Feb.
25. Still, the fiber has more than doubled in the past year.  “Mill usage is bound to come down because of price
rationing,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in
Mandeville, Louisiana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
