Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 1:30 p.m. close.  The Taiex Index rose 47.60, or 0.6 percent, to 8,780.20.  Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. (2311)  (2311 TT) dropped
1.5 percent to NT$30.05, the lowest since Nov. 29. The chip
packaging and testing company was cut to “hold” from “buy”
at BNP Paribas, which said first-quarter sales and profit may
post a “sharp fall” from the previous three months. The
brokerage reduced its share-price forecast to NT$31.50 from
NT$42.50, analyst Szeho Ng wrote in a report.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317 TT), the flagship
company of Foxconn Technology Group, advanced 1 percent to
NT$106.50. Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  said Foxconn
Technology may spend $12 billion over five to six years to
expand production in the country, in what would be the Taiwanese
company’s biggest investment overseas.  Merry Electronics Co. (2439 TT) jumped by the 7 percent
daily limit to NT$48.15, the biggest advance since Oct. 6, 2009.
The Economic Daily News reported it may get orders from Apple
Inc., without saying where it got its information. Tseng Chin-
tang, a spokesman for Merry, wasn’t immediately available to
comment at his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
