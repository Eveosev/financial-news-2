Standard Bank Group Ltd,  Africa ’s
largest lender, will more than double profit and revenue from
China through 2013 as it advises Chinese companies wanting to
make investments in Africa, said Craig Bond, chief executive
officer of the bank’s Chinese unit.  “I would be very optimistic” about profits and revenues
more than doubling over a three year period as the bank’s
reputation for financing infrastructure projects grows, he said
in an interview in Sanya, China, where he is attending a summit
of so-called BRICS nations, which include  South Africa , China,
India, Russia and Brazil.  Bond, who is based in Beijing, said there were no plans for
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398) , which owns a 20 percent
stake in  Standard Bank , to increase its investment. Standard
Bank advises ICBC on investments, mostly in Africa.  “I don’t think they even have to consider that because the
partnership is working well for both sides,” Bond said. “The
short answer is there is no move at the moment for them to
increase their stake.”  Revenue from China, which was more than $80 million last
year, is “is still a small part of our puzzle” compared with
the company’s operations in Africa, Bond said. He said the bank
was on track to increase profit this year by 25 percent, a
forecast he made in January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
