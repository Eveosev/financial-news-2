Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  is unveiling the
next version of its Windows Phone software at a developer
conference today, laying the groundwork for the operating system
to appear on handsets later this year.  The company is showing programmers what sorts of
applications they can build for the operating system and will
release developer tools in May, Microsoft said today at the
conference in  Las Vegas . The new software adds features such as
multitasking and the ability to overlay computer data on top of
the view through the phoneâ€™s camera -- a concept known as
augmented reality.  Later today, the Redmond, Washington-based company plans to
show concept apps from companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Skype
Technologies SA and Spotify Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
