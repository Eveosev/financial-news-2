Brazil ’s real rose for the first
time this week after President Dilma Rousseff said the
government is discussing a $12 billion investment with Chinese
companies, boosting investor optimism that foreign inflows will
continue to appreciate the currency.  The real advanced 0.9 percent to 1.5810 per dollar at 8:58
a.m. in  New York , from 1.5947 yesterday.  Foxconn Technology Group, an electronic device producer,
may invest $12 billion to build a factory in Brazil in five to
six years, Rousseff told reporters in Beijing yesterday. The
company’s executives are holding talks with the government, she
said.  “It’s one more confirmation that money is going to
continue to enter the country,” said Hideaki Iha, a trader at
Fair Corretora de Cambio e Valores, in a telephone interview
from  Sao Paulo .  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in
January, the most actively traded in Sao Paulo today, rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.29 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
