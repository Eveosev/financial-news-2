Commodity-based industries offer
the most promising growth and profit prospects in the coming
decades, according to  Willem Buiter , Citigroup Inc.’s chief
economist.  “These industries include so-called soft commodities or
agricultural products,” London-based Buiter, a former  Bank of
England  policymaker, said today at a conference in Athens.  He foresees the “commoditization” of items that aren’t
now considered such. “Water, which at the moment is not priced
or underpriced, will become a commodity and then an asset class,
as oil is now,” Buiter said.  In India’s agriculture, 85 percent of water is wasted, he
commented.  To contact the reporters on this story:
