Gasoline futures extended their
gains after the U.S. Energy Department reported inventories fell
seven times as much as expected.  Stockpiles dropped 7 million barrels to 209.7 million, the
report showed. The median forecast of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a decline of 1 million barrels.  Gasoline demand rose 3.7 percent to 9.18 million barrels a
day. The four-week average added 1 percent to 8.99 million.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 3.34 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $3.1975 a gallon at 10:33 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, which settled yesterday at $3.1641, was
$3.1942 before the report was released at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
