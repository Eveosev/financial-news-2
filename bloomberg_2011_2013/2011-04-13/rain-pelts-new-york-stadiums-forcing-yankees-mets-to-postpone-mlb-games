Rain pelted  New York  and Pittsburgh
last night, forcing the Yankees, Mets and Pirates to postpone
their home Major League Baseball games.  The Yankees’ (5-4) game against the Baltimore Orioles (6-3)
and the Pirates’ (5-5) contest with the Milwaukee Brewers (5-5)
were postponed with no makeup dates announced. The Mets (4-6)
will meet the Colorado Rockies (7-2) in a doubleheader today at
Citi Field.  “Thunderstorms should begin moving out,” said Mike Pigott, meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc., in a telephone
conversation from  State College ,  Pennsylvania . “It will be
showery around  New York City , as opposed to this steady rain.”  The Mets, Yankees and Pittsburgh can expect to play
tonight. Boston’s home game against the Tampa Bay Rays tonight
may be postponed by rain, Pigott said. The Rays beat the Red Sox
3-2 last night at Fenway Park, dropping Boston to 2-9 this
season.  Fans attending games played in the mid-Atlantic states
through the northeast can expect “chilly” temperatures the
rest of the week, Pigott said.  “Spring has tremendous oscillations,” he said. “Very
seldom is it ever normal; it’s always 10 degrees above or 10
degrees below. We expect this temperature roller coaster to
continue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
