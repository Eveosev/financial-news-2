Rio Tinto  Group, the second-largest
mining company by sales, will deliver the gold, silver and
copper used for the  London 2012  Olympic medals.  As official mining and metals provider to the London
Olympic and Paralympic Games, Rio Tinto will help produce 4,700
medals, the London organizing committee said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The raw materials will come from Rio Tinto’s Kennecott Utah
Copper mine in  Salt Lake City  and its Oyu Tolgoi mine in
 Mongolia .  Rio Tinto, which has become a domestic sponsor of Games
organizing committee, also supplied the metals for the medals at
the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.  “All of us at Rio Tinto are excited to have the special
job once again of digging the ore that will become treasured
medals for the world’s elite athletes,” Tom Albanese, Rio
Tinto’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
