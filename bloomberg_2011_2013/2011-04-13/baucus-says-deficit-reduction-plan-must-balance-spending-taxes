Senate Finance Committee Chairman
 Max Baucus  said any attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit
should rely on a balance between spending reductions and revenue
increases.  “Everything must be on the table,” said Baucus, a Montana
Democrat. “Our deficit challenges are simply that
significant.”  Baucus’ comments come hours before President Barack Obama
is scheduled to outline his deficit reduction plan.  Many Republicans, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and Senator  Orrin Hatch  of Utah, say all
deficit reduction efforts should be accomplished without raising
income taxes.  Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Alan Blinder ,
testifying at the hearing, said the long-run deficit projections
are “huge” and “horrendous” and require finding ways to
reduce future health-care costs.  He also urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling, which is
scheduled to be necessary between mid-May and early July.  “There is no deficit crisis today, but of course we could
create one by letting the government crash headlong into the
national debt ceiling,” said Blinder, an economics professor at
 Princeton University . “We’ve got enough problems right now and
shouldn’t be shooting ourselves in the foot.”  David Walker, former comptroller general of the U.S., said
failing to raise the debt ceiling would be a “tactical nuclear
weapon” that would prevent Social Security checks from being
issued.  To contact the reporter on this story:
