Uganda ,  Africa ’s second-biggest
coffee exporter, slashed its shipment forecast for the 2010-11
season by 16 percent after a drought cut yields, the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority said.  Exports in the 12 months through September 2011 may drop to
2.6 million 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags, compared with a Sept.
20 estimate of 3.1 million bags, an official at the UCDA said by
phone today from Kampala, the capital. He declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The revised forecast is 2.6 percent lower than the 2.67
million bags exported last season.  Uganda ranks behind  Ethiopia  as the continent’s largest
exporter of coffee, according to the website of the
 International Coffee Organization , or ICO. The robusta variety
accounts for about 85 percent of the East African nation’s
annual production of the beans. ICO data shows Ugandan exports
from March 2010 to February 2011 were 12 percent lower than the
same period a year earlier.  The UCDA’s new forecast is based on the country’s export
performance from April 2010 through March, when 2.54 million
bags were shipped, the UCDA official said.  Robusta-coffee futures for July delivery climbed $8, or 0.3
percent, to $2,434 per metric ton at 9 a.m. in  London . The
contract has risen 15 percent so far this year.  Climate Change   Uganda, East Africa’s third-largest economy, has
experienced a dry spell since December that the government
attributes to climate change. More than 95 percent of the
country’s coffee is grown by small-scale farmers whose crop is
predominantly rain-fed, according to the authority.  Uganda earned $243.6 million from the sales of the beans
last season, down from $291.3 million a year earlier. Less than
3 percent of annual output is consumed domestically, according
to the Eastern African Fine Coffee Association.  The country plans to increase production to 4.5 million
bags a season by 2015 through a replanting program, after yields
declined since the 1996-97 season because of crop damage caused
by coffee wilt disease, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
