European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Mario Draghi  said monetary policy still remains
“accommodative” even after the bank raised its benchmark rate
last week for the first time in almost three years.  “We’re evaluating the timing and ways to exit from the
exceptional expansive policies that have characterized monetary
policy in the area after the crisis,” Draghi said in a speech
in Turin,  Italy , today. These policies “remain, even after the
interest-rate increase decided last week, very accommodative.”  Draghi, who is also governor of the  Bank of Italy , said
global leaders have reached a consensus on ending fiscal and
monetary stimulus. He added that “courageous” overhaul of the
international financial system is needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
