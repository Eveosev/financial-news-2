Sweden predicted a  budget surplus 
and raised its economic growth forecast for the next two years,
allowing  Europe ’s fastest-growing economy to cut taxes while the
rest of the region struggles through austerity cuts.  The largest Nordic economy will expand 4.6 percent this
year, compared with the 4.8 percent predicted last month, the
government said in its spring fiscal policy bill released today
in Stockholm. The government raised its forecast for growth in
2012 and 2013 and predicted a widening surplus over the next
four years as unemployment falls.  “In a situation when many other countries are experiencing
austerity and weak economies, Sweden’s economy is growing
stronger,” Finance Minister Anders Borg said. “We must use
this to ensure that more people find work and that welfare
initiatives can be implemented.”  Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt’s government, which won
another four years in office in September, said yesterday it
plans to reduce taxes for a sixth consecutive year in 2012 as
other nations such as the U.K. slash spending to pare deficits.
The Swedish economy grew 5.5 percent in 2010, the most since
1970, as exports recovered from the global financial crisis.  Krona Friendly  The krona strengthened 0.8 percent to 6.2507 per dollar and
0.7 percent to 9.0586 per euro at 11:26 a.m. local time.  “The government saying there is still room for further tax
cuts and growth-friendly reforms is positive for the krona for
the medium term,” said Anders Eklof, a currency strategist at
Swedbank AB in  Stockholm . The lender forecasts the krona to be
at 8.65 per euro in six months.  The economy will grow 3.8 percent in 2012 and 3.6 percent
in 2013, the government said, compared with estimates of 3.5
percent and 3.2 percent in March. Unemployment will fall to an
average 7.3 percent this year and 6.6 percent in 2012, while
consumer prices will rise 2.5 percent in 2011 and 2.0 percent in
2012, according to the government.  Borg said that gains in the krona, the best performer this
year against the euro and dollar among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, will likely be tempered by rising interest
rates outside the country. The government predicted the krona
will rise to 8.70 per euro at the end of this year and weaken to
8.80 per euro at end of 2012.  Rising Rates  Sweden ’s central bank has raised its key rate five times
since July, bringing it to 1.5 percent in February from a record
low of 0.25 percent. Governor Stefan Ingves has said he can’t
rule out raising rates at all five remaining policy meetings
this year. The bank will announce its next decision on April 20.  The government today forecast the central bank’s benchmark
rate would reach 2.25 percent this year, 3.25 percent next year
and level out at 3.75 percent in 2013.  Reinfeldt’s four-party government alliance had already
revealed it will invest more money in the country’s railway
infrastructure and that it wants to ease benefit rules for long-
term sick leave. It’s also considering next year cutting income
taxes for foreign nationals with “expert knowledge,” dividend
taxes for some small businesses and allowing bigger write-offs
for investments in research and development.  The government will also lower taxes for pensioners as well
as cut the value-added taxes for restaurants.  Fiscal Expansion  “Even though the government is somewhat optimistic on the
economic outlook, public finances seem very solid,” said Bengt
Rostroem, an economist at Nordea Bank AB, in a note.
“Furthermore, the government’s own calculations show that
expenditures are systematically overestimated by roughly 9
billion kronor at this forecast horizon. Thus we see the
possibility for an even more expansionary fiscal policy for
2012.”  The initiatives have been made possible by improving public
finances, which will show a surplus of 0.3 percent of gross
domestic product this year, and surpluses of 1.8 percent 2012
and 2.8 percent in 2013, the government said.  The spring fiscal policy bill outlines the government’s
ambitions for the next few years and additional measures for the
current year.  The government has cut income taxes by 70 billion kronor
($11.1 billion), or about 2.1 percent of the economy, since
coming to power in 2006. It has also reduced corporate and
payroll taxes and abolished a levy on wealth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
