Taiwan ’s dollar dropped for a
second day on concern the impact of Japan’s nuclear disaster
will curb export growth.  Overseas funds sold more local stocks than they bought for
the first time in 12 days yesterday as Japan raised the severity
rating of the accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant
to the highest level. Damage stemming from the crisis may reduce
Taiwan’s economic growth by as much as 0.2 percentage point,
Premier Wu Den-yih said on March 29. Domestic bonds were steady.  “There are some outflows, so the  Taiwan dollar  has got
some pressure,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader at
Cathay United Bank in Taipei. “We’ll wait until the  Japan 
situation gets more stable. No one wants to sell bonds and no
one wants to buy either.”  Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to NT$29.157 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 9:38 a.m. local time, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The local dollar has advanced 4.2 percent this year,
the best performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies.  The Japanese government cut its assessment of the economy
for the first time in six months today after the March 11
earthquake killed more than 12,000 and led to the worst nuclear
crisis since Chernobyl. The nation bought 5 percent of Taiwanese
exports in March, according to official data.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.375 percent bond due March 2021 was
unchanged at 1.344 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market, the island’s biggest exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
