China â€™s tax authorities will
tighten inspection and enforcement of rules against using
transfer pricing to avoid tax liabilities,  Shanghai Daily  said,
citing Chi Cheng, a partner at KPMG.  China retrieved 2.6 billion yuan ($398 million) of taxes
after 178 investigations of transfer pricing in 2010, a 24
percent increase from the previous year, the English-language
newspaper said today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
