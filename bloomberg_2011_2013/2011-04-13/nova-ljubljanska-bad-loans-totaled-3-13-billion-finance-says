Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. had
2.16 billion euros ($3.13 billion) last year of bad loans, or
14.5 percent of all outstanding loans, Finance  reported , citing
 Slovenia â€™s largest bank.  Bad loans surged 61 percent from 2009, the Ljubljana-based
newspaper said. In 2010, Nova Ljubljanska set aside 452 million
euros to cover bad loans, which was the main reason the bank
reported a 202 million-euro loss from last year, according to
Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
