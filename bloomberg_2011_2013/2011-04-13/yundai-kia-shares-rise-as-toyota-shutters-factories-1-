Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors
Corp. (000270)  rose in Seoul trading after Japanese rival Toyota Motor
Corp. said it would halt some vehicle production in  Europe  and
warned its U.S. dealers of a possibly tighter vehicle supply.  Hyundai rose 6.3 percent, the most since October 2009, to
close at 212,500 won in Seoul, while affiliate Kia advanced 4.6
percent to 73,500 won. South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index
gained 1.6 percent.  Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, will halt output at
five European plants for several days in late April and early
May because of a shortage of parts after last month’s earthquake
in Japan, the company said yesterday. Reduced availability of
Toyota cars may be boosting expectations for Hyundai and Kia’s
sales and profits, said Kim Byung Kwan, a Seoul-based analyst at
Mirae Asset Securities Co.  “Hyundai and Kia are expected to expand sales in the U.S.
as Toyota will likely continue to struggle with supply
shortage,” Kim said. “Toyota’s sales likely won’t normalize
until the first quarter of next year.”  Toyota shut most plants in  Japan  after the March 11 natural
disaster and has also announced output halts in  North America .
The Toyota City, Japan-based carmaker warned its U.S. dealers
earlier this week that vehicles may be in short supply into the
third quarter.  Hyundai has gained 13 percent in Seoul trading since March
10, the day before the earthquake, while Kia has surged 19
percent. Toyota has lost 10 percent in Tokyo trading in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
