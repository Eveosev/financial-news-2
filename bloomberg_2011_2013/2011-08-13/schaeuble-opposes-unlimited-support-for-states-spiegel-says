German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he is against unlimited aid for indebted
countries in the euro zone,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing an
interview.  “There is no collectivization of debt or unlimited
support,” he told the German magazine. “There are certain
support mechanisms that we develop under strict conditions,” it
cited him as saying.  Schaeuble also rejected euro bonds, saying that as long as
members of the euro zone have their own financial policies and
as long we need to use different  interest rates , there are
incentives and possibilities of sanctions to ensure fiscal
solidity, Spiegel said.  When asked if help would be suspended if some members do
not meet conditions, Schaeuble said “there is no rescue at any
cost,” Spiegel reported. He said the government will be
prepared for any eventuality even the most unlikely, the
magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
