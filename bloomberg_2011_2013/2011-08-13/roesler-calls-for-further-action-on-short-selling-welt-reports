German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler welcomed a short-selling ban in several countries in the
European Union, while calling for similar action among other G-7
countries,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing an interview.  Short-selling should be on the agenda of the next  World
Economic Forum , he told the German newspaper.  Belgium, France, Italy and  Spain  imposed short-selling bans
yesterday in an attempt to stabilize markets. The G7 nations, in
addition to France and Italy, are Germany, Japan, Canada, the
U.S. and the U.K.  Roesler also said he was against the introduction of euro
bonds and wanted to develop alternatives, Welt am Sonntag
reported. The German minister suggested the introduction of a
debt brake in every country in the  euro zone  to strengthen the
EU stability pact, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
