Canada ’s dollar dropped for a third
straight week in the longest stretch of losses since June as
concern the global economy is slowing encouraged demand for the
greenback as a refuge.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, slid on Aug. 9 to
parity with the U.S. dollar for the first time since February as
crude  oil prices  fell and Canada’s trade deficit widened.
Government bonds rallied, pushing the 10-year note yield on Aug.
11 to a record low before a report on Aug. 19 that is forecast
to show slowing inflation.  “Like most markets, we’re having a fairly volatile week,
and the Canadian dollar wasn’t excluded,” said  Camilla Sutton ,
head of currency strategy in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia’s
Scotia Capital. “Even though we’ve seen tremendous intraday
activity, we’re not that far from where we started five days
ago.”  The Canadian currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 98.73
cents versus the  U.S. dollar  from 98.20 on Aug. 5. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.01290. The loonie slid to C$1.0010 on Aug. 9, the
weakest level since Feb. 1.  One-month implied volatility on the loonie-greenback
exchange rate increased to 11.6 percent yesterday after reaching
13.4 percent on Aug. 10, the highest level since July 2010.  Canadian Bond Rally  “The whole risk unwind that we had over the last few days,
with equity markets falling heavily and flows back into U.S.
assets, hit all those activity-sensitive currencies,” said Tom Levinson, a currency strategist at ING Groep NV, by phone from
 London , referring to the dollars of Canada,  Australia  and  New
Zealand . “If you look at the many barometers of risk out there,
they still suggest that things are somewhat stressed.”  The advance in Canadian bonds pushed the 10-year yield down
18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 2.45 percent. The
price of the 3.25 percent securities maturing in June 2021
increased C$1.60 to C$106.89. The yield fell on Aug. 11 to 2.29
percent, the lowest in Bloomberg records beginning in 1989. The
two-year yield fell 14 basis points to 0.93 percent after
touching a record low 0.783 percent on Aug. 9.  Canada sold C$3 billion ($3 billion) of three-year debt on
Aug. 10, drawing an average yield of 0.965 percent. The
government received bids of C$6.55 billion for the 2.25 percent
securities maturing in August 2014.  Stock Drop  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of stocks in developed nations dropped
1.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.7
percent. The S&P/TSX Composite Index gained 2.9 percent. Futures
on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, fell 1.7 percent to
$85.38 a barrel in New York after decreasing on Aug. 9 to
$75.71, the lowest level since September 2010.  “The stocks are giving us more real-time description of
what’s transpiring in the market in terms of  risk aversion ,”
Sutton said.  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  has fallen 14 percent from a three-year
high at the end of April on concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis is getting worse, signs the global economy is slowing and
S&P’s downgrade of the U.S. government’s AAA credit rating.  Canada’s dollar fell yesterday after report showed  consumer
confidence  in the U.S., Canada’s largest trading partner, fell
to a three-decade low.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment slumped in August to 54.9 from 63.7
in the prior month. The gauge was projected to decline to 62,
according to the median forecast of 69 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Fed Stance  The  Federal Reserve  pledged on Aug. 9 to keep its target
rate for overnight lending between banks at a record low at
least through mid-2013 to revive a recovery that’s
“considerably” lower than anticipated.  Canada’s trade deficit widened in June to C$1.56 billion
($1.57 billion), the country’s fifth straight trade gap and the
widest in nine months, from a revised C$1.04 billion shortfall a
month earlier,  Statistics Canada  said Aug. 11 in Ottawa.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast the nation would
post an C$800 million deficit.  The nation’s annual inflation rate will fall to 2.8 percent
from 3.1 percent when Statistics Canada releases its report on
Aug. 19, according to the media forecast of 21 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Canada’s dollar has declined 4.6 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes,
which track the performance of a basket of 10 developed-market
currencies. The greenback has fallen 5.8 percent, and the yen
has gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
