Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s co-chief economist,
Joachim Fels, reckons there’s a 50 percent chance of the global
economy going into a recession,  Wirtschaftswoche  reported,
citing an interview.  The U.S. is no longer the “locomotive” of the world economy
but “the sleeping car,” Fels said, according to the German
magazine. The country’s expansive monetary policy is causing
inflation to soar worldwide, it cited the economist as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
