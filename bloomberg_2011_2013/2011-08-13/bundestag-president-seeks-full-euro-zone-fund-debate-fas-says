Germany ’s lower house of parliament
needs more than “a few days” to debate any measures regarding a
euro-zone rescue fund,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung 
reported, citing Bundestag President Norbert Lammert.  The Bundestag should be fully consulted on resolutions
concerning a bailout, as well as on the budget, and it will be
almost impossible to approve a decision in the three days
through Sept. 23, Lammert said of the government’s current
timetable, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
