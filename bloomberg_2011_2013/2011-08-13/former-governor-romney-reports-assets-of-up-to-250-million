Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, is
worth as much as $250 million, about the same as the last time
he ran for president.  Romney, 64, founder of the Boston-based venture capital
firm Bain Capital LLC, has assets of between $190 million and
$250 million, his campaign said today as he filed his personal
financial disclosure form with the U.S.  Federal Election
Commission . His assets are in a blind trust, said Gail Gitcho, a
campaign spokeswoman.  Four years ago, Romney disclosed assets of up to $247
million as he spent $45 million of his own money on his
unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He
hasn’t used any of his own money for his current race. He raised
$18.3 million through June 30, more than any other Republican
candidate.  Romney reported taking in close to $375,000 in speaking
fees, including $42,500 from London-based  Barclays Plc. (BARC)  A
Barclays lobbyist, Patrick Durkin, raised $167,800 for Romney’s
2012 campaign, FEC records show. He also received more than
$115,000 as a board member of Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott
International Inc.; he reported resigning that position in
January.  His holdings include between $50,000 and $100,000 apiece in
 Boeing Co. (BA) ,  Visa Inc. (V) , and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   Romney donated royalties from his book, “No Apologies,”
to charity, the campaign said.  Federal disclosure forms list assets and holdings within
ranges and don’t provide precise figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
