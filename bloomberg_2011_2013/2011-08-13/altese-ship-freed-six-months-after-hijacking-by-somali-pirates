A Maltese bulk carrier and its 21
crew have been released six months after the vessel was hijacked
off the coast of Oman by Somali pirates, Mumbai’s directorate
general of shipping said today in a statement.  The MV Sinin, a 52,000-ton carrier, is heading to Colombo,
 Sri Lanka , where it will be dry-docked for inspection, according
to the e-mailed statement. The ship was hijacked on Feb. 12, 315
nautical miles from the island of Masirah while en route to
Singapore from Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.  The statement didn’t say whether a ransom was paid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
