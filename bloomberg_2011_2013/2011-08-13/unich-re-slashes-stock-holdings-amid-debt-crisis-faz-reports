Munich Re  has almost halved its
holdings in stocks in recent weeks because of the debt crisis,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing an interview
with Chief Financial Officer Joerg Schneider.  The reinsurer reduced equities to 2 percent of its
portfolio from 3.5 percent at the end of June, or to about 4
billion euros ($5.7 billion) from 6 billion euros. Munich Re has
no plan to sell U.S. bonds, even after the countryâ€™s credit
rating downgrade, Schneider told the newspaper. Munich Re has
increased its bond holdings in  Scandinavia  and in emerging
markets, he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
