Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN)  will
retain its Italian and Spanish bond holdings,  Finanz und
Wirtschaft  reported, citing an interview with Martin Senn, the
Swiss insurerâ€™s chief executive officer.  A complete default is unlikely in either country, the
newspaper cited Senn as saying. Zurich Financial cut its Italian
bond holdings by about 20 percent to $8 billion in June and July
and also holds $18 million of Greek debt, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
