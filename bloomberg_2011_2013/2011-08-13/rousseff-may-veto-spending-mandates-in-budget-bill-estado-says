Brazil President  Dilma Rousseff  may
veto some portions of legislation written to limit the 2012

reduce the public deficit to 0.87 percent of GDP by the end of

from Congress before issuing debt to be injected into the state
development bank.  Rousseffâ€™s decision is scheduled to be released Aug. 15 in
