A tropical depression about 260
miles north of  Bermuda  is moving away from the U.S. East Coast
and may become a tropical storm by tomorrow, the National
Hurricane Center said.  The system has maximum sustained winds of 35 miles (55
kilometers) per hour and is moving east-northeast at about 16
miles (26 kilometers) an hour, the center said in an advisory at
about 5 p.m. New York time.  “Some strengthening is forecast and the depression could
become a tropical storm tonight or Saturday,” according to the
 advisory .  Another system, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) east of the
northern Leeward Islands has a 40 percent chance of becoming a
tropical cyclone in the next two days, the center said in a
 weather outlook  issued at about 8 p.m. New York time. The trough
of low pressure is moving west-northwestward at about 20 miles
(32 kilometers) per hour.  “Upper-level winds have become less favorable for
development during the past several hours,” the center said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
