Vontobel Holding AG (VONN)  Chief Executive
Officer Zeno Staub said he welcomes  Switzerland ’s agreement with
 Germany  to end a dispute over tax evasion by wealthy Germans
holding cross-border accounts,  Finanz und Wirtschaft  reported.  Implementing the measure may only require “limited”
additional investment by the Zurich-based bank, Staub told the
newspaper. Some Swiss banks may have to consider whether it
remains worthwhile to continue to operate in Germany following
the accord, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
