Russia  may lose as much as $3.8
billion of revenues from Syrian arms contracts after the U.S.
urged a halt to sales,  Kommersant  reported, citing estimates by
the Center for Analysis of Strategies & Technologies in Moscow.  Syria accounts for as much as 10 percent of Russia’s
military exports, Kommersant said. Russia planned to supply 24
fighter jets to the Arab country in 2012 and 2013 along with air
defense systems, according to the Moscow-based newspaper.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  yesterday urged
nations doing business with Syria to cut off trade and arms
sales to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and “get on
the right side of history.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
