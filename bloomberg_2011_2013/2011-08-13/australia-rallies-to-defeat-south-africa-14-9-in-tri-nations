Australia  came from behind to beat
 South Africa  14-9 in a Tri-Nations rugby Test in Durban to join
New Zealand at the top of the standings.  Pat McCabe scored the only try at King’s Park as Australia
rallied from a 6-0 halftime deficit. James O’Connor kicked three
penalty goals for the Wallabies, who sealed a fifth win in the
past six matches between the teams.  Australia, which last won the southern hemisphere’s annual
rugby championship in 2001, moved to nine points after three
games. South Africa hosts the All Blacks in Port Elizabeth next
week before Australia and New Zealand close the tournament Aug.
27 in Brisbane.  The Springboks, whose second-string squad lost 39-20 in
Australia and 40-7 in  New Zealand  last month, remain in last
place with one point.  Butch James kicked two penalties and Francois Steyn booted
one for the home team, which featured 11 players from its 2007
World Cup final win in the starting lineup. South Africa opens
the defense of its world title Sept. 11 against  Wales  in
Wellington.  Australian selectors will name their 30-man squad for the
Rugby World Cup on Aug. 18. The Wallabies open their campaign
for a record third World Cup title Sept. 11 against Italy in
Auckland.  To contact the reporters on this story:
