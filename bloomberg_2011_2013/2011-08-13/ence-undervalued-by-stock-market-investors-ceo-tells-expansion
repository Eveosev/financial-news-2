Grupo Empresarial Ence SA (ENC)  should be
valued at 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) by the stock market,
more than double current levels,  Expansion  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Ignacio de Colmenares.  Ence’s market valuation of 600 million euros is small for a
company with 200 million euros in earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, with large  cash flow  and
low debt, de Colmenares was cited as saying. The company is
Europe’s largest producer of pulp from eucalyptus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
