German banks may struggle with the
same problems as their French counterparts,  Welt am Sonntag 
said, citing  Barry Eichengreen , who teaches economics and
political science at the  University of California , Berkeley.  In  Germany , as in  France , banks lack sufficient capital,
Welt am Sonntag said, citing the economist. “If growth in
Germany gets weaker, those problems could be become visible very
quickly,” the newspaper reported Eichengreen as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
