The  European Central Bank  is buying
Italian and Spanish bonds with a maximum maturity of 10 years to
minimize its risk,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing unidentified
people in the financial industry.  The longer the duration of the bonds, the longer those
bonds are a risk in the balance sheet of the central bank and
the bigger the danger of writedowns, Welt said. The ECB declined
to comment, the German newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
