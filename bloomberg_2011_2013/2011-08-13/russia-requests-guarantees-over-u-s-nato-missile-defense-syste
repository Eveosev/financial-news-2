Russia has sought binding guarantees
that the U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization joint
missile-defense system wonâ€™t be directed at the country, the
Foreign Affairs Ministry said.  Deputy Minister Sergey Ryabkov held talks on the matter
with U.S. Undersecretary of State Ellen Tauscher in  St.
Petersburg  yesterday, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement. The two also discussed the non-proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
