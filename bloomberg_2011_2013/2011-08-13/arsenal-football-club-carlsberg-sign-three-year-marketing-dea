Arsenal Football Club agreed a
three-season marketing deal with Carlsberg A/S, the world’s
fourth-biggest brewer.  The agreement to make Carlsberg Arsenal’s “official beer
partner” provides the Danish company with “exclusive marketing
rights on a global basis,” Arsenal said in a statement on its
website yesterday.  Carlsberg’s own-brand and licensed beer, ale and cider
products will be available on an exclusive basis at the club’s
Emirates Stadium, Arsenal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
