Spain â€™s  Defense Ministry  is seeking
to renegotiate 26 billion euros ($37 billion) of defense debt,
 El Pais  reported, citing unidentified people at the ministry.  The government is asking for the repayments to be extended
by five years from 2025 until 2030, the newspaper said.  Spain has racked up around 30 billion euros of debt buying
defense systems, 23 billion euros of which was spent under the
previous administration of Jose Maria Aznar, El Pais said.
