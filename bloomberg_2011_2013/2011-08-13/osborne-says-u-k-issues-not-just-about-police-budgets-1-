The U.K. government is committed to
its plans to reform the police service, Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  said.  The social challenges raised by recent riots in several
English communities, including London, are “not just about
police budgets,” Osborne told the British Broadcasting Corp.’s
Radio 4 today.  Outbreaks of looting, criminal damage and arson started on
Aug. 6 in the north London suburb of Tottenham and spread across
the capital the following night. When a third evening of
disorder began, Prime Minister  David Cameron  broke off his
holiday in  Italy  to return to Britain. Rioting also broke out in
other English cities, including Manchester and Birmingham.  “There are very deep-seated social problems which we need
to tackle,” Osborne said. “There are communities that have
just been left behind by the rest of the country, there are
communities cut off from the economic lifeblood of the rest of
the country. This is not just about police budgets; this is
about a far bigger challenge for our society, which is dealing
with people who we have ignored for too long and helping them
feel they have a stake in society.”  A total of 1,222 people have been arrested in  London  in
connection with rioting in the city, police said today in an e-
mailed statement. Of those, 704 have been charged over the
disorder. In Manchester, northwest  England , more than 200 people
have been arrested, Greater Manchester Police said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
