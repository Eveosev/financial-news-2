Indonesia ’s expanding economy and a
growing middle class helped lead  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s decision
to start producing a new model at a plant in West Java, the head
of GM’s Southeast Asia division said.  “If you look the market economics, market dynamics and
look at demographics, you multiply those three things, and it
spells prosperity,” General Motors Southeast Asia President
Martin Apfel said told reporters late yesterday in Jakarta.  The world’s largest automaker plans to produce as many as
40,000 units a year of a seven-seat vehicle at the Bekasi, West
Java plant, starting in 2013, PT General Motors Indonesia
President Director Marcos A. Purty said.  GM sales in Indonesia rose 72 percent to 4,500 units last
year, Apfel said. In the first six month 0f 2011, its sales rose
18 percent t0 2,500 units from a year earlier, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
