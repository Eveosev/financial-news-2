Rainer Bruederle, floor leader of
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Free Democratic Party coalition
partner, said his party’s backing for an expanded European Union
rescue facility at the end of September will depend on clear
debt-limit rules in the euro zone,  Tagesspiegel  reported.  Euro-bonds would be “dangerous” because they wouldn’t
motivate individual countries to manage their economies
responsibly, the newspaper quoted Bruederle as saying in an
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
