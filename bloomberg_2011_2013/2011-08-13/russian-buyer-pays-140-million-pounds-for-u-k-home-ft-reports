An unidentified Russian buyer has
bought the U.K.’s most expensive home for about 140 million
pounds ($228 million), the Financial Times reported.  The 300-year-old Park Place country home near Henley is a
Grade II-listed property which once belonged to the eldest son
of George II, the newspaper said, without saying where it got
its information. The property was sold by developer Michael
Spink, the FT said.  The previous record property sale was in April for a 136
million-pound property at One Hyde Park in  London ’s
Knightsbridge, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
