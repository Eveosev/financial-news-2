Young people in the U.K. don’t
believe the police support them, the Financial Times said,
citing people who participated in the riots this week.  A “stop and search” routine used to control disruptive
behavior is a major source of contention and between teenagers
and the authorities, the newspaper said. Animosity toward the
police is common among the younger demographic in the U.K.
according to charity and social workers, the FT said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
