Switzerland’s  People’s Party  is
likely to gain the most votes in October general elections,
followed by the  Social Democrats ,  Blick  reported, citing a
survey conducted by the GfS polling institute.  The People’s Party may win 27.4 percent of votes, while the
Social Democrats could get 18.5 percent, the newspaper said
today. Some 15 percent of voters would back the Christian
Democratic Party, with the Free Democrats winning 16.1 percent.  All four parties are part of the governing coalition. The
margin of error is 2.2 percentage points, Blick said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
