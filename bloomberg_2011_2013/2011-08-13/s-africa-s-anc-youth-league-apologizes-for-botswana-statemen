The youth league of  South Africa ’s
ruling  African National Congress  said today it has withdrawn its
statement on the need for regime change in neighboring  Botswana .  “The ANC Youth League apologizes on and withdraws the
statement of the First National Executive Committee, which
committed to establishment of a Command Team,” the
Johannesburg-based youth league said in an e-mailed statement
today. “We withdraw the statement and apologize because we note
that the leadership of the ANC took serious exception on the
statement and classified that statement as transgression of ANC
constitution and policies.”  On Aug. 1 the ruling party criticized its youth league as
“extremely thoughtless and embarrassing” for calling for
regime change in  Botswana  and insulting President Ian Khama.
Youth league leader  Julius Malema , 30, had told reporters that
Botswana’s government posed a threat to security in the region
because of its close ties to the U.S. and said the league had
created a team of executive committee members to help opposition
parties in Botswana defeat the “puppet government” of Khama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
