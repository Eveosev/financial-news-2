Libyan insurgents said they gained
more ground yesterday, taking control of most of the town of Al-
Zawiya and shutting down the coastal road between the capital,
Tripoli, and neighboring Tunisia, according to a representative
of the Libyan transitional council in the U.K.  “Rebels have entered the Al-Zawiya town, controlling most
of it, sweeping the area,” said the council’s Guma El-Gamaty in
an interview with Al-Arabiya yesterday. Al-Zawiya is about 53
kilometers (33 miles) west of Tripoli.  Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim denied reports
that the town was captured, according to Libyan news agency
JANA. “The city is under our control,” he said.  Rebels on Aug. 12 captured most of the western town of
Tawarga after breaking through government lines around the
nearby city of Misrata.  The rebels said Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s forces
launched missiles from Tawarga into rebel-held Misrata, about 40
kilometers to the north. Two days of battle left five anti-
government fighters dead and 46 wounded on Aug. 12, according to
the Mujamma Aledad Hospital in Misrata.  Anti-government protests began in February and were met by
a crackdown by Qaddafi. A month later, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization began an air campaign aimed at protecting
civilians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
