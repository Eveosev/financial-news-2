Unilever aims to double sales
“eventually” to about 80 billion euros ($114 billion),  NRC
Handelsblad  reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Paul Polman.  There’s no guarantee Unilever will match each year the 7
percent growth pace reported in the first half of 2011, Polman
was cited as saying.  Unilever expects to be able to achieve 80 percent to 90
percent of its sales growth targets by strengthening its
existing brands in current markets, Polman said. The company
sets aside 1 billion euros to 2 billion euros a year for “bolt
on acquisitions,” the CEO told NRC.  A break up of Unilever along the lines of  Kraft Foods
Inc. (KFT) ’s decision to split itself up “is not under discussion,”
Polman said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
