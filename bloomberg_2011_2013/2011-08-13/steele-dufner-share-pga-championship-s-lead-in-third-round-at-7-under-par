Brendan Steele and  Jason Dufner 
share the lead at 7-under par after the third round of the U.S.
PGA Championship, golf’s final major tournament of the year.  Steele and Dufner are one shot ahead of Keegan Bradley and
two better than Scott Verplank.  Steve Stricker  is in fifth place
at 4-under par heading to tomorrow’s final round.  The top five players on the leaderboard are Americans, as
the U.S. seeks to end a run of six major championships without a
winner, the longest in history.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
