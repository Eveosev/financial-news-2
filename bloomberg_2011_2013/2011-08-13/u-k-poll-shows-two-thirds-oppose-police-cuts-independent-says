More than two-thirds of Britons
reckon Prime Minister  David Cameron  should reverse plans to cut
more than 30,000 police posts as he seeks to reduce the U.K.
budget deficit, the Independent said, citing an opinion poll.  Some 71 percent of people agree that Cameron should scrap
the strategy in light of the past week’s riots, according to a
ComRes Ltd. poll of 2,008 adults conducted on Aug. 10 and 11,
the newspaper reported. More than half of respondents said
Cameron had failed to provide the necessary leadership early
enough during the disorder, it said.  Cameron has rejected opposition demands for a review of the
police cuts after Britain’s worst rioting since the 1980s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
