The European Union is free to send
inspectors to  Zimbabwe ’s Marange diamond fields, the  Herald 
said, citing Obert Mpofu, the country’s mining minister  Reports from the British Broadcasting Corp. of torture
camps at Marange are fictitious and any EU attempt to ban
diamonds from the site might prompt a bar on London-based  Rio
Tinto Plc (RIO)  exporting gems from its own Murowa Mine, Mpofu said,
according to the state-controlled newspaper.  An invitation to tour Marange had been sent to the EU, the
Herald said, citing Aldo Dell’Ariccia, the European
organization’s ambassador to Zimbabwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
