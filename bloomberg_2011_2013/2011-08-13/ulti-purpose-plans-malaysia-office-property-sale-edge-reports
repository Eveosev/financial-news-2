Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd. (MPU) , a
Malaysian property and gaming company, is close to selling a
Kuala Lumpur development for as much as 400 million ringgit
($133 million) to the Malaysian Chinese Association, the Edge
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Menara Multi-Purpose, a 98 percent-tenanted office building,
could prove recurring income for the political party, the report
said. Multi-Purpose Holdings may be able to pay a higher
dividend with proceeds from the property sale, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
