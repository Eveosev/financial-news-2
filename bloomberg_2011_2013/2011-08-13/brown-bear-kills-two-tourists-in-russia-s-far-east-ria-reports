A brown bear killed two tourists in
the Kamchatka region of  Russia ’s Far East, the RIA Novosti
newswire reported today, citing a local wildlife organization.  Police are investigating at the site near the Paratunka
river as hunters seek to find and kill the aggressive animal,
the newswire said. It didn’t specify the victims’ nationality.  About 18,000 brown bears live in the remote and mountainous
Kamchatka Peninsula, which is becoming increasingly popular with
tourists eager to enjoy its abundant wildlife, RIA reported.
Bears killed one person last year and three in 2009, it said.  A polar bear killed a British teenager and mauled several
others in an attack on a school-party campsite in the Norwegian
Svalbard Islands on Aug. 5.  The bear was eventually shot by an expedition leader who
yesterday underwent reconstructive surgery on injuries suffered
in the attack, the  London  based  Guardian newspaper  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
