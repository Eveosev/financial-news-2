Two Russians were taken hostage by
workers at a shower factory in  China  for allegedly delaying
payments to their Chinese partners,  Itar-Tass  reported.  Vitaly Rudykh, chief executive officer of the Irkutsk,
Siberia-based company, was taken together with his translator at
the factory in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, on Aug. 8, the
newswire said, citing  Russia â€™s consular office in  Shanghai .  The pair had been visiting their Chinese partners to tell
them that the company faced financial problems and could not
order shower systems for sale in Russia anymore, Itar-Tass said.  The Chinese workers demanded the Russians pay 3 million
yuan ($470,000) of delayed salary and contract payments, the
newswire said. Russian consular officials managed to gain the
release of the two after five days of captivity, and arranged
for a flight home today, Itar-Tass said.  No one was immediately able to comment on behalf of Rudykh
or his company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
