Pitcher Carlos Zambrano will go
without pay or contact with the  Chicago Cubs  for 30 days after
being placed on the disqualified list, the Major League Baseball
team said on its website.  The 30-year-old right-hander was ejected from last night’s
10-4 loss in Atlanta after throwing two inside pitches to
Chipper Jones of the Braves. Before facing Jones, Zambrano
allowed back-to-back home runs by Freddie Freeman and Dan Uggla.
Zambrano gave up five home runs, matching the franchise record,
and eight runs on as many hits in 4 1/3 innings.  “His actions last night were totally intolerable,” Cubs
General Manager Jim Hendry told ESPN. “This was the most
stringent penalty we could enforce without a release.”  Zambrano was charged with the loss to drop to 9-7 with a
4.82 earned-run average in 24 starts this season.  During the 30-day period, the league and the  Major League
Baseball Players Association  will discuss statements attributed
to Zambrano regarding his baseball future, the Cubs said.
Zambrano cleaned out his locker and told clubhouse personnel
that he was “retiring,” ESPN reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
