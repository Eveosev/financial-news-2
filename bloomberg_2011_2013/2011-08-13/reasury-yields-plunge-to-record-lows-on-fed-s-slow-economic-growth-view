Treasury yields on debt maturing in
10 years and less fell to all-time lows as the  Federal Reserve 
said economic growth was “considerably slower” than forecast
and it would keep borrowing costs on hold through mid-2013.  The Treasury sold $72 billion of notes and bonds this week,
with yields on three- and 10-year notes at record auction lows.
The 10-year yield touched 2.0346 percent, an all-time low, amid
concern the risk of recession is rising after  Standard & Poor’s 
downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ and as the European
sovereign debt problems showed signs of spreading. Annual
consumer inflation slowed in July, a report may show Aug. 18.  “What we’re witnessing is a reassessment of the health of
the economy,” said James Collins, an interest-rate strategist
in the futures group at Citigroup Inc.’s Global Markets unit in
 Chicago . “We could take another run toward 2 percent.”  U.S. 10-year note yields fell 30 basis points to 2.26
percent from 2.56 percent on Aug. 5, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices, the biggest drop on an intraday basis since
December 2008. The 2.125 percent securities maturing in August
2021 finished the week at 98 27/32. It sold at a yield of 2.14
percent at the Aug. 10 auction.  The two-year Treasury yield dropped 10 basis points to 0.19
percent. The yield reached a record low of 0.1568 percent on
Aug. 9.  Auction Yields  The Treasury Department paid an average yield of 2.13
percent on the three-, 10- and 30-year securities, less than the
previous refunding auctions in May of 3 percent and below the
former record of 2.59 percent in February 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The government began selling 30-year
bonds on a regular schedule in 1977 as part of its so-called
quarterly refunding.  Treasury 30-year bonds tumbled Aug. 11, pushing yields up
the most since 2008, as speculation Fed policies would stoke
inflation sapped demand at the $16 billion offering of the
securities. The sale drew the lowest level of demand since
February 2009. Thirty-year bonds yields fell 12 basis points to
3.73 percent yesterday from 3.85 percent Aug. 5.  Volatility Treasuries trading has picked up. Merrill Lynch
& Co.’s MOVE index, which measure price swings in Treasuries
based on prices of over-the-counter options maturing in two to
30 years, touched 117.8 basis points Aug. 8, compared with the
89.4 average since the start of the year.  More Trade  The volume of Treasuries trading rose this week, averaging
$420.32 billion per day, compared with the $317 billion daily
average this year, according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a net-short position to a net-long position in 10-year note
futures in the week ending Aug. 9, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 9,814 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  Last week, traders were net-short 72,946
contracts.  The median third quarter forecast for the yield on the 10-
year note declined to 2.75 percent, according to a Bloomberg
News survey Aug. 10, down from 3.29 percent in a survey Aug. 2.
The security will end 2012 at 2.96 percent, from a previous
forecast of 3.50 percent, the survey found.  ‘Too Low’  “Treasury yields are too low for all but the most
pessimistic economic environments,” Brett Rose, interest-rate
strategist at Citigroup Global Markets in  New York , wrote in a
note to clients. “The Treasury market is pricing in a far too
pessimistic outcome for the  U.S. economy  and would expect that
10-year Treasury yields will be 50 basis point higher in the
medium term.”  New York Fed President  William Dudley  said yesterday policy
makers gave a “sober assessment” of the U.S. economy after
their Aug. 9 policy meeting.  “Economic growth so far in 2011 has been quite a bit
slower than we expected earlier in the year,” Dudley said in
the text of remarks given at the bank’s New York headquarters
yesterday. “In the last few months conditions in the labor
market have deteriorated again and the  unemployment rate  edged
up. Household spending has flattened out, and the housing sector
is depressed.”  Fed officials “discussed the range of policy tools”
available to boost growth and are “prepared to employ those
tools as appropriate,” the Fed said.  Fed Hold  “At the end of the day, the Fed is on hold for two
years,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at Bank
of Nova Scotia in New York. “The flight-to-quality trade is
still in vogue. Fear is still everywhere and Treasuries benefit
from the fear trade.”  Treasuries have returned 6.3 percent this year, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.  Japan ’s government bonds
have gained 1 percent, while German bunds have advanced 4.6
percent, according to indexes complied by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The 0.5 percent retail sales increase reported by the
Commerce Department in  Washington  yesterday matched the median
forecast of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and
followed a 0.3 percent increase in June that was larger than
previously estimated. Excluding auto sales, purchases rose more
than projected.  Consumer Mood  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
August index of consumer sentiment fell to 54.9, the least 1980,
from 63.7 a month earlier, the group reported yesterday. The
median forecast of 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected a reading of 62. Estimates ranged from 59 to 66.5.  The  consumer price index  rose 0.2 percent in July after a
0.2 percent decline in June, according to the median of 64
economists forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Year-over-year,
the CPI gained 3.3 percent, down from 3.6 percent, according to
the survey.  France ’s economy unexpectedly stalled in the second
quarter, data showed yesterday. Gross domestic product was
unchanged from the first quarter, when it increased 0.9 percent.
Economists forecast a 0.3 percent gain, the median of 15
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  “Data out of  Europe  may be having an impact on the
market,” said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income strategist at
UniCredit SpA in Munich.  Former Treasury Secretary  Henry Paulson  said he would
invest in U.S. government securities before other sovereign debt
even though the nation’s political process isn’t working at a
“AAA level.”  “I would take U.S. Treasuries over other sovereign debt,
other AAA sovereign debt, any day of the week,” Paulson, 65,
said Aug. 11 at  Dartmouth College  in Hanover,  New Hampshire .
“That’s not to say we don’t have important issues to deal with
in this country.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
