European stocks dropped for a second
day, to the lowest level in almost four months, as investors
awaited a resolution to the political impasse in Greece and as
Spanish credit risk surged.  Bankia SA led a selloff in Spanish banks. Kloeckner & Co.
and  Mediaset SpA (MS)  both plunged more than 8 percent after
reporting first-quarter results.  ING (INGA)  Groep NV and  Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) 
paced advancing shares.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  lost 0.3 percent to 249.73 at
the close of trading, the lowest since Jan. 13, as the euro
weakened for an eighth day. The Stoxx 600 has tumbled 8.3
percent from this year’s high on March 16, trimming this year’s
advance to 2.1 percent.  “The real concern isn’t about Greece, it’s about the euro
and whether it breaks up -- that is key,”  Mark Tinker , a  fund
manager  at AXA Framlington Investment Management said on
Bloomberg Television in  London . “We don’t make a big economic
scenario after a couple of days of moves, but I think there is a
lot of anxious market repositioning going on right now.”  The benchmark Stoxx 600 yesterday dropped 1.7 percent after
Antonis Samaras, the leader of  Greece ’s biggest political party,
failed to reach an agreement on a new government and the mandate
passed to left-wing leader Alexis Tsipras, who opposes austerity
measures required for the nation’s financial rescue.  The euro fell to 1.2948 against the dollar at 4:25 p.m.,
for its longest losing streak in 3 1/2 years, as Tsipras meets
with leaders of New Democracy and Pasok, the two Greek parties
that supported austerity.  Political Stand-off  Tsipras yesterday squared off with political leaders before
talks on forming a coalition, handing them an ultimatum to
renounce support for the European Union-led rescue if they
wanted to enter government.  The stand-off since the inconclusive May 6 election has
reignited concerns over Greece’s ability to comply with the
terms of its two bailouts negotiated since May 2010. The country
is again facing the risk of an exit from the euro.  National benchmark indexes fell in 14 of the 18 western-
European markets. France’s CAC 40 lost 0.2 percent and the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 declined 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX added
0.5 percent. Spain’s IBEX 35 Index sank 2.8 percent, its lowest
close since October, 2003.  The cost of insuring against a Spanish default surged to a
record on concern a bailout of  Bankia (BKIA)  won’t fend of a banking
crisis triggered by bad real-estate loans. Credit-default swaps
insuring Spanish government debt rose 13 basis points to 512
basis points a 10:55 a.m. in London, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  ‘Zombie Bank’  Bankia tumbled 5.8 percent to 2.13 euros, the lowest since
it listed its shares in July 2011, as JPMorgan Chase & Co.
downgraded the Spanish lender to underweight, the equivalent of
a sell recommendation.  “While there is no danger of an imminent collapse at
Bankia, there is a risk that it becomes a zombie bank, which has
to rely on the  European Central Bank  to fund it over the long
term,” said Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho International
Plc in London.  Spanish 10-year  government bonds  extended a decline,
pushing the yield on the securities above 6 percent for the
first time since April 27. The yield climbed 20 basis points, or
0.17 percentage points, to 6.04 percent.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s largest lender, dropped 4.5
percent to 4.64 euros and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
retreated 4.7 percent to 5.01 euros.  Kloeckner, Mediaset  Kloeckner tumbled 8.2 percent to 8.33 euros after  Europe ’s
largest independent steel trader reported a first-quarter loss
of 10 million euros ($13 million), wider than the average
analyst estimate for a 900,000 euro-loss. The company said its
2012 earnings will improve only if Europe’s economy recovers.  Mediaset lost 11 percent to 1.45 euros, the lowest since it
sold shares to the public in July 1996. The broadcaster reported
an 85 percent slump in first-quarter net income to 10.3 million
euros after the close of trading yesterday on lower advertising
sales. Analysts estimated net income of 6.5 million euros on
sales of 984 million euros, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Mapfre SA (MAP)  retreated 6.3 percent to 1.94 euros, the most
since April 2010. The Spanish insurer reported a 13 percent drop
in first-quarter net income to 271.4 million euros. That still
beat the average analyst estimate of 250.3 million euros in a
Bloomberg Survey.  ING, Carlsberg  ING paced advancing shares, climbing 1.7 percent to 5.08
euros. The biggest Dutch financial-services company reported
earnings excluding one-time gains and losses of 705 million
euros, surpassing the 632 million-euro estimate of analysts.  Net income sank 51 percent after a charge for a potential
settlement of a U.S. probe offset a gain from the sale of its
U.S. online bank.  Carlsberg jumped 3.8 percent to 490 kroner as the world’s
fourth-biggest brewer confirmed its full-year outlook. The
company reported a 43 percent drop in first-quarter operating
profit, excluding some items, to 574 million kroner ($100
million) as it sold less beer in  Russia . That missed the average
analyst projection for 845 million kroner.  Lanxess AG (LXS)  advanced 6.4 percent to 61.83 euros after the
maker of synthetic rubber said growth in earnings may touch 10
percent this year, outstripping analysts’ estimates, as demand
surges in  emerging markets  and the U.S. recovers.  For 2012, profit will probably grow 5 percent to 10 percent
from last year’s 1.1 billion euros. Analysts estimated growth of
about 6 percent.  ITV Plc (ITV)  rose 2.2 percent to 82.50 pence. The U.K.’s biggest
commercial broadcaster said it expects to outperform the TV
advertising market in the first half and forecast ad revenue to
increase by about 3 percent in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
