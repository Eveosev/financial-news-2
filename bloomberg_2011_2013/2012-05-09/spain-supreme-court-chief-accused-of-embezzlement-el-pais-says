The president of  Spain ’s Supreme
Court, Carlos Divar, was accused by a colleague on the country’s
judicial council of embezzlement, El Pais reported, citing a
report filed with the public prosecutors.  Jose Manuel Gomez Benitez alleges that Divar spent 5,658
euros ($7,340) of public money on six trips to a luxury hotel in
Puerto Banus on Spain’s south coast that were not related to
official business, the newspaper said.  Divar’s office declined to comment on the matter when
contacted by Bloomberg News and referred all queries to Agustin
Zurita, spokesman for the judicial council, of which Divar is
also president. Zurita didn’t immediately respond to two cell
phone calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman at the  Supreme Court 
declined to comment. The prosecutors’ office didn’t answer a
call.  Divar’s salary last year was 130,000 euros, according to
Spain’s official gazette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
