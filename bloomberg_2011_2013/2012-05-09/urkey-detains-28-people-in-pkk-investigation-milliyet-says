Turkish authorities detained 28 people
in a probe of what prosecutors say is the urban arm of the
Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK, Milliyet  reported .  Police carried out raids in six cities and detained people
for conducting illegal activities on behalf of the PKK and
organizing unauthorized demonstrations, according to the
Istanbul-based newspaper. A district chief of the pro-Kurdish
Peace and Democracy Party was among those arrested, it said.  Turkey  has arrested thousands of suspects on charges of
being members of the Union of Communities in Kurdistan, or KCK.
Prosecutors are seeking prison terms for almost 200 defendants
in one trial against the group. The government says the KCK is
the urban arm of the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist
organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
