Peruvian bonds fell, pushing yields to
a one-week high, as speculation  Greece  will be forced out of the
euro zone stoked concern Europe’s debt crisis will deepen and
curb demand for the Andean nation’s assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent
sol-denominated bond due in August 2020 rose two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.10 percent at 12:10 p.m. in Lima,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.15
centimo to 118.20 centimos per sol.  “Fear of the unknown could trigger a severe slowdown in
commodity prices, which would affect Peru,” said  Benito Berber ,
an emerging-market strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “The risk
premium is going up, and that’s being reflected in a lot of
markets.”  Copper and gold,  Peru ’s top exports, fell after elections
in Greece encouraged speculation that its European Union-led
bailout may be unraveling.  The sol depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.6465 per dollar,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
