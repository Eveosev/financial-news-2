Asian currencies fell, led by  India ’s
rupee and South  Korea ’s won, as concern Greece will leave the
euro prompted investors to favor safer bets than emerging-market
assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index and the MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of shares dropped to their lowest levels since
January. Alexis Tsipras, whose Syriza party placed second in
Greek elections on May 6, said he would try to form a coalition
government of left-wing parties that reject austerity measures
needed to secure a European Union-led bailout. The risk of
Greece leaving the euro by the end of 2013 has risen to as high
as 75 percent, Citigroup Inc. said May 7.  “The main driver of the market is the Greek political
situation, which creates a lot of uncertainties,” said Norawit Suparinayok, a foreign-exchange trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL) 
“Asian currencies may remain weak for now.”  The rupee slumped 0.8 percent to 53.585 per dollar as of
1:58 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The won declined 0.4 percent to 1,140.35, while the ringgit slid
0.3 percent to 3.0660. The Philippine peso dropped 0.4 percent
to 42.42 and Thailand’s baht weakened 0.1 percent to 31.04. The
Asia Dollar Index lost 0.1 percent.  The won reached a two-week low of 1,141.20 per dollar as
overseas investors  sold more  Korean shares than they bought for
a sixth day. The Bank of Korea will leave its benchmark  interest
rate  at 3.25 percent after a policy review tomorrow, according
to all 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Exporters Waiting’  “ Greece ’s political struggle is the main issue in the
market today, but declines in the won will be limited with
exporters waiting to sell the dollar once the won weakens,”
said Lee Yong Hee, a Seoul-based currency dealer at  Industrial
Bank of Korea. (024110)   The ringgit fell for a fifth day, the longest losing streak
since mid-March, as government data showed exports shrank for
the first time since 2009.  Overseas shipments fell 0.1 percent in March from a year
earlier, after increasing 14.5 percent in February, government
figures showed today.  “We may see some weakening” in exports and production in
the coming months, said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at RAM
Holdings Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “We will likely see greater
headwinds from the negative impact of elections in Europe and
that could cast negative sentiment over Asian currencies.”  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah was little changed at 9,246
per dollar while Taiwan’s dollar slipped 0.1 percent to
NT$29.400.  China ’s  yuan  traded at 6.3097, little changed from
6.3080 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
