The Czech Republic may adopt the euro
in eight to 10 years at the earliest, the  CTK  newswire reported,
citing Prime Minister Petr Necas.  Necas’s government has refused to set a target date for
entering  Europe ’s monetary union. Finance Minister Miroslav
Kalousek said on April 17 that he doesn’t expect a fixing of the
koruna to the euro in the European Union’s exchange-rate
mechanism during the terms of the current and the next
governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
