U.S. gasoline demand may rise 1.2
percent this year as the number of licensed drivers increases,
according  Lundberg Survey Inc .  Taxable gasoline sales in the U.S. may total 372.46 million
gallons a day, or 8.87 million barrels a day, this year, up from
368.04 million gallons daily in 2011, according to a report
yesterday. That contrasts with a government estimate that demand
at the wholesale level will fall 0.8 percent in 2012.  The projection is also based on demand growth reported by
the  American Petroleum Institute  and higher first-quarter sales
by retailers including  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,  Trilby Lundberg ,
president of Lundberg Survey, said today in a telephone
interview.  “That’s why we’re able to project with confidence there
will be growth,” Lundberg said.  The industry-funded API reported on April 20 that gasoline
demand through the first quarter was up 0.4 percent over the
prior year to 8.64 million barrels a day.  The Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration
yesterday projected that 2012 consumption will fall to 8.67
million barrels a day from 8.74 million in 2011. The forecast is
20,000 barrels a day higher than last month’s projection.  Lundberg said her company’s outlook for increased demand is
not based on falling prices at the pump.  “I’m not assured we will have the price crash that will
prevent this year from having an all-time record price
average,” Lundberg said. “We did not suppose it would in order
to support the idea that demand is growing this year.”  A survey of about 2,500 gasoline stations by the Camarillo,
California-based, company, shows the highest average pump price
this year was $3.9671 reached in the week ended April 6. The
average was down to $3.8542 a gallon as of May 4, according to
Lundberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
