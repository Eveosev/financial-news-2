(Corrects to yields from acres in headline and first
paragraph.)  Cotton output in the U.S., the worldâ€™s
largest exporter, will be bigger in the marketing year that
starts Aug. 1 as yields rise, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of five analysts.  Estimates for cotton output, exports and inventories for
the marketing year through July and the following season are
listed below. Estimates are in millions of bales, each weighing
480 pounds (218 kilograms). The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
will update its forecasts at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
