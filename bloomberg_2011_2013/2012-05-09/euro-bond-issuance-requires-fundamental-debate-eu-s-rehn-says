The issuance of public debt at the
European level still requires a “fundamental debate” among
member states, said European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn .  “What are the pieces of an economic, fiscal or political
union that are required to make the mutualization of public debt
rational from the point of view of all EU or at least the euro
area member countries?,” Rehn asked during a speech in
Florence,  Italy . That “would require a very fundamental debate
about the rights and responsibilities over respectively of the
member states and the community of the union.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  opposes the creation of
euro bonds to help Greece, Portugal and other distressed euro
nations lower borrowing costs.  Rehn also said that the EU must move beyond austerity and
policies to boost growth.  “We must compliment our structural reforms with targeted
investment to boost sustainable growth and jobs creation,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
