Ethanol  production  in the U.S. rose
0.3 percent last week to 897,000 barrels a day, the highest
level in more than two months, the Energy Department said.  Output climbed consecutive weeks for the first time since
Dec. 30, according to a department report released today.
Stockpiles sank 3.8 percent to 21.3 million barrels, the biggest
decline since Dec. 9 and the lowest level since Feb. 3.  Production of  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol 
advanced 1.4 percent to 5.3 million barrels a day, the
department said.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.19 a gallon at 10:48 a.m.  New York  time on the
