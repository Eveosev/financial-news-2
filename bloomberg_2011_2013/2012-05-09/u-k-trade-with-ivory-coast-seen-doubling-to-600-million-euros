Trade between the U.K. and  Ivory Coast 
is seen doubling to an annual 600 million euros ($778 million)
in three years, said Henry Bellingham, the U.K. Foreign Office’s
Minister for  Africa .  “Ivory Coast is a very strong country in Africa,” he said
in an interview yesterday in Abidjan, the commercial capital of
the world’s biggest cocoa producer. “We want U.K. companies not
just to buy goods and services, we encourage more investments
here.”  Cocoa is the main product shipped from Ivory Coast to the
U.K., Bellingham said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
