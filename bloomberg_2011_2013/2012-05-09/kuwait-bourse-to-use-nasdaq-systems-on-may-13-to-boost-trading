The  Kuwait Stock Exchange (KWSEIDX)  will start
using on May 13 trading systems provided by  Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc. (NDAQ)  to improve volumes in the Persian Gulf’s fourth-largest
bourse by market value, said director general Faleh al-Raqabah.  “The system will be a qualitative leap for Kuwait’s stock
exchange in terms of trading and surveillance,” al-Raqabah told
reporters today in  Kuwait City . “It would guarantee more
flexibility, transparency and is the gate towards the
introduction of derivatives and further developments in the
upcoming future.”  Kuwait signed in October 2009 a three-year 18.3 million
dinars ($65.7 million) contract with  Nasdaq  OMX to provide it
with the trading system and advisory services. The first phase
of the system will remove the fraction market and add five
industry sectors to the existing eight in line with Nasdaq’s
company classification rules, he said.  It will also include the start of a Kuwait 15 index that
will include the 15 biggest companies by market value and
liquidity, al-Raqabah said. “These companies will be revised
and changed every six months, and the index will kick off at
1000” points, he said.  The bourse also plans to introduce derivatives trading,
including options and futures, along with exchange-traded funds,
bonds and Islamic debt, al-Raqabah said.  Kuwait’s benchmark  stock gauge  has rallied 11 percent this
year compared with a 6.4 percent increase in the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
