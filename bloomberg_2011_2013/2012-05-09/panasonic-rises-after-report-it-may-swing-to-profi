Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,  Japan ’s largest
appliance maker, rose the most in two months in Tokyo trading
after the Nikkei newspaper said it may post a 50 billion yen
($626 million) profit this fiscal year.  Panasonic  advanced  as much as 4.9 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since March 9, to 605 yen and traded at 601 yen as
of 9:58 a.m. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1.3
percent.  The Osaka-based manufacturer, which has said it may post a
record 780 billion-yen loss for the year ended March 31, may
return to profit this year because of restructuring, the Nikkei
reported, without saying where it got the information. The 50
billion-yen projection compares with the 106 billion-yen average
of 18 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Operating profit  may rise to about 250 billion yen this
year from 30 billion yen in the previous 12 months, the Nikkei
reported. The projection compares with the 241 billion-yen
average of 19 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Yuko Hosaka, a spokeswoman for Panasonic, said the company
wasn’t the source of the report and that it will disclose its
earnings May 11.  Panasonic’s revenue may be unchanged this year at about 8
trillion yen while television sales will probably fall below
last year’s approximately 18 million units, the Nikkei said.
Solar-cell sales will be buoyed by a government subsidy program,
the report said.  Panasonic said in February it may post a 780 billion-yen
loss for the year ended March 31, the most since the company was
founded in 1918, after natural disasters disrupted production
while the surging yen eroded overseas earnings and the global
economy slowed.  President Fumio Ohtsubo, set to step down as president next
month, has said he’s eliminating jobs, shifting output overseas
and closing display factories in an attempt to transform
Panasonic into a leader in solar panels and rechargeable
batteries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
