Paul Crone, the former head of
commodity trading at Touradji Capital Management LP, left the
New York-based hedge fund earlier this year, according to a
spokesman.  Crone returned to  London  to spend more time with his
family, Bob Zito at  Zito Partners , a spokesman for Touradji,
said today in a telephone interview.  Prior to joining Touradji, Crone was head of trading for
industrial metals at Investec Bank U.K. and also worked for AIG
International Trading.  Touradji hired Peter Borish to replace Paul Touradji as the
commodity fundâ€™s chief executive officer, according to a letter
to investors obtained by Bloomberg News in January. Borish is a
former head of research at Tudor Investment Corp., the hedge
fund founded by  Paul Tudor Jones .  To contact the reporter on this story:
