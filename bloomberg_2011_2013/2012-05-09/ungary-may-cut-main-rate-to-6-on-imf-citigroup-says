Hungary  may cut the European Union’s
highest benchmark  interest rate  “significantly” once the
government obtains a bailout from the  International Monetary
Fund  and the EU,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  said.  Hungary may obtain IMF help by the fourth quarter “at the
latest,” cutting the  risk premium  on local assets, which will
open the way for rate cuts as inflation is set to slow to the
Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s 3 percent target by early 2014, Budapest-
based Citigroup economist  Eszter Gargyan  wrote in a note to
clients today.  Policy makers left the benchmark rate at 7 percent on April
24 for a fourth month as the government failed to meet
conditions to start bailout talks, which Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  requested in November. The next day, Hungary won the go-
ahead from the European Commission to start negotiations. No
date has been set.  The central bank may gradually cut its benchmark rate by as
much as 1.5 percentage points if global risk sentiment permits,
Gargyan said, adding that Citigroup lowered its year-end rate
forecast to 6 percent from 6.75 percent and sees “scope for
further potential 50 basis-point cuts to 5.5 percent in the
first quarter of 2013.”  Rate cuts may start in September, before the government
obtains an aid deal, Gargyan said, referring to comments by
central bank policy maker Ferenc Gerhardt to Reuters. Once aid
talks start and progress is made in negotiations, the central
bank can start lowering borrowing costs, Gerhardt said, Reuters
reported late yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
