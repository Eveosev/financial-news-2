Nigeria ’s naira fell for a fifth day,
the longest run of declines in a year against the dollar, as oil
company foreign-exchange sales were said to wane.  The currency of Africa’s largest oil producer retreated 0.1
percent to 157.665 per dollar as of 1:45 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil companies  are the second-biggest suppliers to the
market after the Central Bank of Nigeria, which manages the
currency by selling foreign currency to lenders in biweekly
auctions.  “It seems that the lack of foreign exchange sales from oil
companies in recent days and some pick up in corporate demand
have pushed dollar/naira higher,”  Samir Gadio , a London-based
 emerging markets  strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in
an e-mailed reply to questions today.  Yields on the West African nation’s Eurobonds due 2021 fell
10 basis points, or 0.10 percent, to 5.283 percent. Borrowing
costs on Nigeria’s naira debt due 2015 rose three basis points
to 15.05 percent, according to May 8 data on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website.  Ghana’s cedi was unchanged at 1.875 per dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
