Zon Multimedia SGPS SA (ZON)  rose as much as
1.3 percent after shareholder Isabel  dos Santos  increased her
stake in  Portugal ’s biggest cable-television provider to 14.9
percent.  Zon  rose  as much as 3 euro cents at 8:07 a.m. in Lisbon.
The gain was the biggest in Portugal’s benchmark PSI-20 Index,
which rose 0.1 percent.  Dos Santos agreed to buy 4.9 percent of the Zon through her
Amsterdam-based holding company Jadeium, adding to the 10
percent stake she already controlled through Kento Holding Ltd.,
Lisbon-based Zon said in a regulatory filing yesterday.  Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos, is now Zon’s biggest shareholder, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
