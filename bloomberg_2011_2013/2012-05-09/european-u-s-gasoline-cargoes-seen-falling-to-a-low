Gasoline shipments across the Atlantic
Ocean from  Europe  are set to fall to the lowest since July over
the next two weeks, a survey showed.  Traders and oil companies hired eight tankers for the two
weeks to May 23 and probably will charter six more, according to
the median estimate in a survey today of nine shipbrokers,
traders and owners who specialize in transporting gasoline.
That’s the lowest total number of shipments since the two-week
forward period from July 14, prior survey data show.  Returns for tankers carrying gasoline on the benchmark
Rotterdam-to-New York route gained 11 percent yesterday to
$8,407 a day, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange.
Still, earnings are down 62 percent this year, the exchange’s
data show. Some 35 tankers may be available to haul auto fuel
cargoes to the U.S. from northwestern Europe over the two-week
forward period, according to the survey. That’s the biggest
surplus since April 11, data show.  The 14 vessels booked or likely to be hired over the next
two weeks, known as Medium-Range tankers, would be able to haul
about 4.4 million barrels of the fuel, or 314,000 barrels a day.
That’s about 43 percent of the 727,000 barrels the U.S.  imported 
daily over the past year, according to the  Department of Energy .  The survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot,
charters and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
Europe. Each tanker would normally haul about 37,000 metric tons
of gasoline, or 315,000 barrels.  One of the survey respondents said it was unprofitable for
tankers to haul gasoline across the Atlantic Ocean. Four said
the price gap, or arbitrage, between Europe and the U.S. for the
fuel was profitable.  Following is a table of vessels chartered and likely to be
hired for the trans-Atlantic voyage loading over the two-week
periods from the dates shown. The table also displays the number
of ships available to be booked.  *T                              May 9    May 2    Change
