Canadian stocks  fell for a sixth day
after material and energy producers declined amid concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen, potentially curbing demand,
following an inconclusive Greek election.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer of the
metal, decreased 1.4 percent. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.,
the biggest fertilizer company, dropped 1.8 percent.  Suncor
Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas producer, sank 2.5
percent.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s third-
biggest energy company, declined 1.4 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  decreased 127.92
points, or 1.1 percent, to 11,576.82 at 9:55 a.m. in Toronto.
The six-day dip is the benchmark gauge’s longest since June
2011.  Canadian stocks are extending their slump following a
decline last week, when a U.S. industry report showed employers
added fewer jobs than forecast last month and commodity prices
dropped. Energy and mining shares account for 44 percent of
Canadian stocks by market value, compared with 20 percent in the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
