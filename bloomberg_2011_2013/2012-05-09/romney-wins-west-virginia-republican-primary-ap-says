Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee  Mitt Romney  won the West Virginia primary, the
Associated Press reported, one of three contests held today.  Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, also won the
Indiana and North Carolina primaries. He faced little opposition
in any of the states from his last remaining primary opponent,
U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas.  Romney began the day with 856 delegates of the 1,144 needed
for the nomination, according to an AP tally. The presidential
primaries conclude June 26 when Utah votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
