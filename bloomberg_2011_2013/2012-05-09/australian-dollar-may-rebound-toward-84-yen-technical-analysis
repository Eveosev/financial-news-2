Australia ’s dollar may rally 4 percent
after it touched a 3 1/2-month low against the yen yesterday,
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  The so-called Aussie may rise toward 84 yen, which is near
its 90-day moving average, according to Teppei Ino, an analyst
in  Tokyo  at the unit of  Japan ’s largest financial group.
Australia’s dollar is also supported above 80.35, the 50 percent
retracement of its advance from 72.06 on Oct. 4 to 88.64 on
March 19 on the Fibonacci chart, Ino said.  “Australia’s dollar has the potential to strengthen to
about 84 yen in the near term,” he said. “The focus will be on
whether the Aussie can stay above key levels on the Fibonacci
chart as the currency looks for a bottom. The 80 yen level is
also a significant psychological level.”  Australia’s currency slid 0.3 percent to 80.61 yen at 10:55
a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, when it touched 80.45, the lowest
since Jan. 23. The last time it touched 84 was April 30.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices tend
to drop or rise by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low. Support refers to an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to buy an asset are clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
