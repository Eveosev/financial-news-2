West Africa, the world’s largest
cocoa-producing region, will get rains over the next seven days,
potentially helping crop development, according to the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Most of top growers  Ivory Coast  and  Ghana  will get at least
50 millimeters (2 inches) of rain by May 16, data on the NOAA
 website  show. Large parts of Ivory Coast and some areas of Ghana
will get 75 millimeters, the data show. The two countries
accounted for 69 percent of global production last season,
according to the International Cocoa Organization in London.  Cocoa climbed 7 percent in the first quarter in London
trading on speculation dry winds blowing from the desert would
hurt output in West Africa. A lack of rainfall this year delayed
the start of the smaller of Ivory Coast’s two annual harvests,
according to Kona Haque, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
 London . The so-called mid-crop usually starts in April.  “With the mid-crop about to commence and reports of
irregular weather patterns, there is uncertainty surrounding the
size of the crop from West Africa,” the ICCO said in a report
e-mailed yesterday. “The nervousness among market participants
is reflected in the high volatility of cocoa prices.”  Rains in the region may help crop development. Global cocoa
supplies will be 14,000 metric tons higher than demand in the
2011-12 season ending Sept. 30, Rabobank International estimated
in a report last month. That contrasted with a previous forecast
for a shortage of 40,000 tons, data from the bank show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
