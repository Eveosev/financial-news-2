South Africa ’s plan to extend the
maturity of its debt is driving the yield premium on its
longest-dated bonds to the highest on record.  The South African Reserve Bank announced the terms today of
an offer to swap as much as 71 billion rand ($8.9 billion) of
two-year bonds for longer-dated, higher-yielding notes through a
series of so-called switch auctions starting on May 17. The
offering would be almost twice the size of the 37.9 billion rand
exchanged through the auctions last year, according to the
Treasury’s data.  The auctions and new bond sales will lengthen the maturity
of South Africa’s debt to an average of 12.5 years from 10.1
years, helping to ease pressure on short-term repayments,
according to Michael Grobler, an analyst at Afrifocus Securities
in Cape Town. Investors anticipating an increased supply of
longer bonds lifted the extra yield on 2031 debt over notes due
in 2014 by 18 basis points in the past month to 318 today, the
widest premium since the 2031 notes were first issued in 2010,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “This is already a very steep curve, and in that sense it
is attractive,”  Leon Myburgh , a Johannesburg-based analyst at
Citigroup Inc., said in a phone interview.  The yield on 7.5 percent notes due 2014, one of the
securities the Treasury is offering to swap, has dropped 41
basis points, or 0.41 percentage point, this year to 5.64
percent, while the rate on the 2031 notes declined 15 basis
points to 8.77 percent. The spread has widened from 260 basis
points in February, when the government announced its switch
auction program. The comparable spread for Polish bonds is 85
basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Sweetener’  “Essentially, you’re selling a bond yielding 5.6 percent
and replacing it with an asset yielding 8.7 percent -- that is
quite a yield sweetener,” said Myburgh.  In the first auction on May 17, the Treasury is offering to
replace 7.5 percent bonds due in 2014. The so-called destination
bonds are 13.5 percent bonds due 2015, 8 percent notes due 2018
and 10.5 percent securities due 2026, the central bank announced
on Bloomberg.  Destination bonds in future auctions, which will be held
twice a month through November, are likely to include notes
maturing in 2031, 2036 and 2041, Myburgh said.  Yield Concern  Investors are concerned long-term yields will rise as the
switch auctions together with planned new bond issuance flood
the market with longer-dated paper, Grobler said. In addition to
the switch auctions, the Treasury plans to sell new benchmark
fixed-rate bonds maturing in 2023 and 2049 this year and
inflation-linked securities due in 2025, 2038 and 2051.  “That will be in the back of the market’s mind,” Grobler
said in a phone interview yesterday. “That’s stock that the
market will have to absorb at the long end, and the curve will
steepen more. It is a concern.”  Switch auctions are an alternative to raising cash through
new bond sales to repay maturing debt, the Treasury said in its
budget review in February.  “You want to avoid a Greek situation, with a lot of debt
coming due in the short term,” Monale Ratsoma, an official in
the Treasury’s asset and liability management division, said in
an interview in  Cape Town  in February. “You want to smooth out
your refinancing risk and develop your yield curve.”  Africa’s biggest economy is cutting domestic bond sales by
2.5 percent this fiscal year to 151.4 billion rand, according to
the Treasury’s budget plan released in February.  South Africa is reining in debt after Moody’s Investors
Service and Fitch Ratings lowered their outlooks for its  credit
rating  to negative since November.  Standard & Poor’s  cut its
outlook to negative in March citing slower economic growth and a
risk the government may exceed its spending plans.  The nation will cut its  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of
gross domestic product in the year through March 2013, below the
government’s earlier forecast of 5.2 percent in October, Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  told lawmakers in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
