Germany’s Bundesbank said pushing
ahead with budget consolidation is the only way for euro-area
governments to regain access to  capital markets .  While public aid can help cover some capital needs, it
“cannot and must not replace private capital,” the Bundesbank
said in an e-mailed statement from Frankfurt today. “In light
of the still very high debt load in some countries and lack of
confidence in the sustainability of their public finances,
postponing budget consolidation would be cause for concern,”
particularly “in conjunction with a delay in implementing
structural reforms,” it said.  Voters in Greece and France last weekend challenged
austerity as Europe’s sole prescription for the financial
crisis, adding pressure on German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to
broaden her focus from debt reduction.  Greek elections left the two biggest parties short of the
clear majority to keep bailout efforts there on track. In the
French presidential election,  Francois Hollande  defeated  Nicolas Sarkozy , Merkel’s preferred partner for enforcing fiscal rigor.  The Bundesbank said it’s not “a given that a drawn-out
process will find more political acceptance than faster
consolidation” and that a “temporary slowdown in domestic
demand” is going to be “inevitable.”  The Bundesbank also reiterated that the  European Central
Bank  is not Europe’s lender of last resort and that the
unlimited purchasing of government bonds would breach the scope
its founding treaty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
