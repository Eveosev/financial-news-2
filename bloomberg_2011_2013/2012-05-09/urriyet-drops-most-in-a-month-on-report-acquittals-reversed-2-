Hurriyet Gazetecilik AS (HURGZ) , publisher of
the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, fell the most in almost a month
after Star reported the acquittal of some of executives in a
case involving alleged shareholder losses was overturned.  The shares retreated 5 percent to 96 kurus at the close in
Istanbul, the biggest drop since April 12.  Dogan Gazetecilik AS (DGZTE) ,
a sister company under the Dogan media group whose executives’
acquittal was also overturned, according to Star, retreated 1.9
percent to 1.53 liras, the lowest close since January.  The top court in Ankara overturned an Istanbul court’s
ruling which had acquitted the executives in the case on charges
of causing losses for minority shareholders by reducing profit
via paper imports, according to Star.  Hurriyet and Dogan Gazetecilik are units of media group
 Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL) , which fell 2.9 percent to 66 kurus. Banu Camlitepe, a Dogan spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to
requests for comment by phone and e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
