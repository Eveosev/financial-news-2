Jefferson County,  Alabama ’s creditors
should have a court-approved committee to represent them in the
biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, federal court official J.
Thomas Corbett said today in a court filing.  Corbett, bankruptcy administrator for the federal court in
Birmingham, Alabama, asked the judge overseeing the case to
appoint three unsecured creditors to a panel that would
participate in the case. The creditors are Beckman Coulter Inc.,
a biomedical testing company,  Bayerische Landesbank  of  New York ,
and UAB Health System, the medical center that is part of the
 University of Alabama  in Birmingham.  The three companies were the only creditors to respond to
Corbett’s request to form an official committee of unsecured
creditors. Such committees hire lawyers and financial advisers
who are paid by the debtor, in this case Jefferson County.  Committees are independent and can either work as allies of
a bankrupt entity, helping support a reorganization plan, or as
opponents.  Jefferson County entered bankruptcy in November after
government officials and creditors failed to implement a
tentative agreement that would have required the county’s sewer
debt, which was largely responsible for the filing, to be cut by
about $1 billion.  The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham).  To contact the reporter on this story:
