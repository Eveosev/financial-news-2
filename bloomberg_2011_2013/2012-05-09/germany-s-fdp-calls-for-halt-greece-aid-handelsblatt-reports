Germany’s Free Democratic Party, the
junior coalition partner to Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic
Union, says support payments to Greece should be stopped
immediately,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview with the
party’s parliamentary finance spokesman,  Frank Schaeffler .  A planned 5.2 billion-euro ($6.7 billion) payment to Greece
is “irresponsible”, Schaeffler told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
