Hog futures rose for the second time
this week on speculation that U.S. grocers are stepping up
purchases of wholesale pork after prices dropped to a 16-month
low in April. Cattle also gained.  Meatpackers processed about 1.243 million hogs in the first
three days of the week, up 1.1 percent from a week earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale  pork  tracked by
the USDA rose to a four-week high of 78.87 cents a pound
yesterday, up 3.1 percent from a low on April 18. Demand will
pick up before Memorial Day, on May 28, when consumers tend to
grill meat outdoors, said Jason Golly at Lynch Livestock Inc.  “The product may be firming up a little bit here,” Golly,
a vice president of risk-management marketing, said in a
telephone interview from Waucoma,  Iowa . “That’s what’s putting
a little bit of a bounce in.”  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.7 percent to settle
at 84.85 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, paring the decline during the past 12 months to 8.4
percent.  Cattle futures for June delivery advanced 0.7 percent to
settle at $1.166 a pound in  Chicago , after reaching $1.16975,
the highest for a most-active contract since April 13. Prices
lost 4 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.1
percent to $1.589 a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
