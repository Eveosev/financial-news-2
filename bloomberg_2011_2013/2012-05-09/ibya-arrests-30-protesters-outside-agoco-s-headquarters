Libyan security forces arrested 30
people who had encircled the headquarters of the Arabian Gulf
Oil Co., known as Agoco, during demonstrations that prompted the
state-run company to reduce production.  Employees will return to work at Benghazi-based Agoco
tomorrow, Abdul Jalil Mayuf, the company’s information
department manager, said by telephone. Agoco, a unit of National
Oil Corp., said last week it had cut daily oil output by 30,000
barrels after the government failed to intervene to end the
protest, though its parent said on May 6 that output had
remained unchanged at about 370,000 barrels a day.  Demonstrators were demanding jobs and greater transparency
over how government money was spent. Agoco said Libyan
authorities, not the company, should address their grievances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
