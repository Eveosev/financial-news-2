Wealthy Austrians are starting to
repatriate assets they had deposited in  Switzerland  after a tax
deal that forgives past tax evasion against a one-time payment,
the head of  Austria ’s Capital Bank AG was quoted as saying.  “Clients with smaller estates are legalizing their funds
in many cases,” Capital Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian
