Rudy Kurniawan, the California man
arrested in March for allegedly selling more than $1.3 million
in phony wine, was indicted by a grand jury in  New York .  Kurniawan is charged with mail and wire fraud related to a
scheme to sell counterfeit wine, according to a filing in
federal court in Manhattan.  The 35-year-old Indonesian national had “thousands of
printed wine labels to many of the most expensive wines in the
world, such as Domaine de la Romanee-Conti and  Chateau Petrus ,”
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Hernandez told a federal judge in
March while describing a search of Kurniawan’s home by  Federal
Bureau of Investigation  agents.  Kurniawan, who was arrested March 8 and accused of
consigning at least 84 counterfeit bottles of Burgundy to a New
York auction house, was ordered to remain in jail after
Hernandez warned that he might flee if released on bail.  Luis Li, a  Los Angeles  lawyer who represented Kurniawan at
the March 9 hearing, didn’t immediately return a call to his
office for comment on the indictment.  The case is U.S. v. Kurniawan, 12-606, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
