BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest
money manager, said Brazilian stocks remain “cheap” while
valuations in the Andean region are higher because of faster
economic growth.  Latin American “fundamentals” remain positive, Will
Landers, who manages $7 billion in Latin American equities at
New York-based BlackRock, said today at a conference in
Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
