Mapfre SA (MAP) , Spain’s biggest insurer,
declined as much as 11 percent on investor concerns over the
Bankia group and as earnings fell at its domestic business.  Shares in Mapfre were down 7.7 percent to 1.91 euros at
3:43 p.m. in  Madrid . The maximum intraday  decline  was the
biggest since March 2009.  Mapfre said today pretax  earnings  in the first quarter for
its Spanish direct insurance business fell 27 percent from a
year earlier as premiums at the division dropped 3.7 percent.
Investors are also worried about the Bankia group, a lender that
owns a 15 percent stake in Mapfre, as the government readies a
fresh bailout for Spain’s third-biggest bank, Raphael Caruso, an
analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. in Paris, said in a
phone interview.  “The market is very concerned about Bankia and the banking
sector in  Spain  generally,” said Caruso. Mapfre is “clearly
exposed” to Bankia and to the banking industry generally
through its bond portfolio, he said.  Banco Financiero y de Ahorros SA, the parent company of the
Bankia group,  owns  15 percent of Mapfre and the Mapfre
foundation in turn  owns  4.3 percent of Bankia.  Mapfre said today first-quarter net income fell 13 percent
to 271.4 million euros ($350.6 million) from a year earlier,
beating the average 250.3 million-euro estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 11 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
