Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR) , the third-
largest African miner of the metal, may boost output by 150,000
ounces in the fiscal year ending June 2013 as the company starts
new projects, Chief Executive Officer Graham Briggs said.  “There’s no doubt it will be better,” Briggs said today
in an interview in Johannesburg. So-called shaft pillar output
will begin at the Bambanani mine in South Africa while Doornkop
and Phakisa production will expand and the Hidden Valley mine in
 Papua New Guinea  “should be in a much better space.”  Harmony, based in Johannesburg, plans to increase output to
counter damage caused to profits by rising electricity and labor
costs in South Africa, where the company mines about 90 percent
of its metal. Government safety stoppages, lower-than-expected
gold content in rock mined and rainfall in Papua New Guinea
curbed output in the fiscal third quarter ended in March.  Production fell 18 percent to 281,415 ounces in the period
from the previous three months, Harmony said today in a
statement. The company will probably miss its 1.35 million-ounce
output target for fiscal 2012, Briggs said.  “We lost about 70,000 ounces during this past quarter”
ended March 31, he told reporters today on a call. “It’s
unlikely we’ll be able to recover those ounces during the
forthcoming quarter.”  Harmony Gold gained 2.4 percent to 74.73 rand by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, paring the decline this year to 21
percent. Larger rivals  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and Gold Fields
Ltd. have fallen 24 percent and 18 percent in the period.  Beats Forecast  Earnings excluding one-time items slid 3.3 percent to 2.34
rand (30 U.S. cents) a share in the quarter, beating the 72 rand
cent  median estimate  of six analysts Bloomberg surveyed. Harmony
had an unexpected deferred tax credit of 652 million rand.  Analysts who cover South African gold producers measure
quarter-on-quarter performance on an earnings excluding one-time
items basis. AngloGold, the world’s third-largest producer of
the metal, releases earnings tomorrow. Gold Fields, the fourth-
largest, will report results on May 17.  Gold was little changed at an average $1,689.14 an ounce in
the quarter compared with the prior three months. It may rise to
$1,850 an ounce by the end of the year, Briggs said.  Harmony is considering adding a second mine in Papua New
Guinea to diversify from  South Africa . A preliminary study to
determine whether a mine at the Wafi Golpu deposit in PNG would
be feasible will probably be completed in June and the results
released “during the September 2012 quarter,” Briggs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
