Spain is planning to part nationalize
BFA-Bankia, making the state the biggest shareholder in the
group, said a government official, who declined to be named
because the plan hasn’t been announced.  BFA, which is owned by the seven Spanish savings banks from
which the group was created, controls 45.3 percent of  Bankia SA (BKIA) ,
according to data on the stock-market regulator’s website.  A spokeswoman at the Economy Ministry declined to comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
