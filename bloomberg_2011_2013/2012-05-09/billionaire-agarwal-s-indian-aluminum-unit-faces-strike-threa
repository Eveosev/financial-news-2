Workers at  Sterlite Industries (India)
Ltd. (STLT) ’s aluminum unit plan to go on an indefinite strike this
month, demanding better conditions at its smelter in the state
of Chhattisgarh, a trade union leader said.  “The workers are supporting a plan to stop work later this
month if the authorities don’t heed our demand,”  G. Sanjeeva
Reddy , president of the Indian National Trade Union Congress,
said today in a phone interview. The union says 90 percent of
about 2,000 permanent workers at unit Bharat Aluminium Co. are
its members.  Bharat Aluminium , in which Sterlite bought a 51 percent
stake from the Indian government in 2001, operates a 345,000-
metric-ton smelter and two bauxite mines at Korba in the eastern
state. Workers at Balco, as the unit is known, in 2004 had gone
on strike in protest against the government’s plan to sell its
remaining 49 percent stake, the Times of  India  reported on July
23 that year.  Production was normal after the union’s call for a strike
yesterday failed, Balco spokesman Arun Bhatt said today in a
statement.  Shares of Mumbai-based Sterlite fell as much as 3.2 percent
to 95.75 rupees and traded at 96.85 rupees as of 2:08 p.m. in
Mumbai. The shares have risen 8 percent this year, compared with
a 6 percent gain in the key Sensitive Index.  Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Group, which owns
Sterlite, offered 170 billion rupees ($3.2 billion) to buy the
government’s remaining stakes in  Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ)  and Balco,
Vishwapati Trivedi, secretary at the ministry of mines, said
March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
