ITC Ltd. (ITC) , India’s largest cigarette
maker, rose the most in more than 14 months after analysts at
Antique Stock Broking Ltd. said the company may benefit long-
term from a government decision to scrap additional duties.  ITC’s  shares  rose 5.7 percent to 239.9 rupees at the close
of trading in Mumbai, the most since February 2011. The stock
was the biggest gainer in the benchmark  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  today,
which declined 0.4 percent.  The Indian government scrapped a proposal made in the March
16 budget to levy a 10 percent additional ad valorem excise duty
on cigarettes longer than 65 millimeters (2.6 inches) and
replaced it with a flat tax rate based on the length of the
cigarette, the  finance ministry  said in a statement on May 7.  “Removal of the ad valorem excise duty on cigarettes would
maintain ITC’s strength of pricing in the medium to longer term
and its ability to expand margins on a consistent basis,”
according to a note to investors from Antique today.  Some fixed duties on cigarettes will still be raised, the
government statement showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
