Greek Finance Minister Filippos Sachinidis said a decision on making a 435 million-euro ($564
million) bond payment due May 15 requires talks with political
leaders as they struggle to form a government.  “I can’t take any initiative and bind the next governments
without listening to the views of the party leaders,”
Sachinidis said, according to the transcript of an interview
with  SKAI TV  provided by the Athens-based  Finance Ministry 
today.  Sachinidis said  Greece  has a number of pending issues that
need to be solved requiring consultations. These include
completing the terms of a bank-recapitalization plan and dealing
with investors who refused to participate in the country’s debt
swap.  Talks among the country’s political parties on forming a
government continued for a third day in Athens. None secured the
151 parliamentary seats needed for a majority in the 300-seat
chamber in May 6 elections.  President Karolos Papoulias handed the mandate to build a
coalition to Alexis Tsipras, leader of Syriza, the second-
biggest party, yesterday after New Democracy’s leader Antonis Samaras, who won the election, abandoned his bid to forge a
government after six hours of talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
