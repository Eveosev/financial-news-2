PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) , the
seventh-largest U.S. bank by deposits, reached a tentative
settlement in a lawsuit over loans guaranteed by the U.S.
Department of  Veterans Affairs .  The settlement amount isnâ€™t material, and the accord is
subject to final documentation and U.S. approval, the
Pittsburgh-based lender said today in a quarterly regulatory
filing. Plaintiffs claimed National City Bank, which PNC bought,
made false statements to the department to obtain loan
guarantees, according to an annual filing by PNC in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
