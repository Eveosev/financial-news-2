Serbia  and  Alta AS , a Czech
engineering and energy company, signed a letter of intent to
develop a coal-fired power plant and a lignite mine in
southwestern Serbia.  The 500 million euro ($650 million) plant in Stavalj, 250
kilometers (155 miles) south of Belgrade will have 350 megawatt
installed capacity, Serbia’s Infrastructure and Energy Minister
Milutin Mrkonjic told reporters in Belgrade today. The plant
will use coal from a nearby lignite mine and the pit’s
development will require another 150 million euros, he said.  Building the plant will take three to five years and will
start after technical and financial details are agreed on, said
Jaroslav Zapletal, vice chairman of Alta’s board of directors.
Financing will come from a “consortium of banks,” he said
without elaborating.  “We have overcapacity in the Czech republic and Serbia is
interested in increasing power production,” Zapletal said
referring to the Balkan country’s plan to become a net exporter
of electricity by 2015.  There are 70 million tons of lignite deposits in the area,
sufficient for feeding the planned plant for more than 40 years,
Mrkonjic said, citing research supported by the Czech government
and the  World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
