The  Federal Reserve  began buying Treasury Inflation 
Protected Securities as part of its program to replace $400 billion of short-
term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasury Inflation Protected 
Securities in an effort to reduce borrowing costs further and counter rising 
risks of a recession.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York listed the securities it is 
considering for purchase during today's operation on its website.
