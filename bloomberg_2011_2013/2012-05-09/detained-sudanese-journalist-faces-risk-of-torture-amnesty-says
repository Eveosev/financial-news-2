Amnesty International  and the
Committee to  Protect Journalists  urged Sudan to free Faisal
Mohamed Saleh, a journalist who criticized President Umar al- Bashir last month and was arrested yesterday.  London-based  Amnesty International  said Saleh was arrested
at his home yesterday by agents of the National Intelligence and
Security Services and is “being held incommunicado and is at
risk of torture and other ill treatment.”  Saleh was detained after he gave an interview to Al-Jazeera
television on April 19 about a speech by al-Bashir, Amnesty said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  “The Sudanese security forces appear to have targeted
Faisal Mohamed Saleh because of his critical journalism,” the
New York-based  Committee to Project Journalists  said yesterday
in a statement.  Sudan ’s government shut down 15 newspapers, confiscated
more than 40 newspaper editions, arrested eight journalists and
banned two from writing since May 2011, Amnesty said in a report
on May 3.  Al-Obaid Murawih, the secretary-general of Press and
Publications Council and spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,
didn’t answer phone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
