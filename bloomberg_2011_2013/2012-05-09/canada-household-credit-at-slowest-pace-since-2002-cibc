Canadian household credit is rising at
the slowest pace since 2002, easing pressure on the  Bank of
Canada  to raise  interest rates , according to a report today by
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  Total consumer and mortgage credit was up by just over 5
percent in March from a year earlier, according to a report by
CIBC economist Benjamin Tal. Excluding mortgages, credit growth
of 2.3 percent in March from a year earlier was the slowest pace
since the early 1990s, the report said.  “The pace of growth in household credit is no longer a
reason for the Bank of Canada to move from the sidelines any
time soon,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
