Dexia SA (DEXB)  may announce a buyer for its
asset management arm in June,  De Tijd  reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Pierre Mariani.  The process for selling Dexia’s Denizbank unit is
continuing and Dexia is “doing everything to sell the bank at
the best possible price,” the newspaper quoted Mariani as
saying.  Separately, Mariani said there is no immediate need for a
capital increase, adding that keeping the current cost of
guarantees for the lender would make additional funds necessary,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
