Natural disasters, unstable weather
and global warming may have a “significant” impact on
economies, causing increased volatility and political
misjudgment, according to a report today from U.K. investment
manager Standard Life Investments Ltd.  The tsunami in Japan last year disrupted global supply
chains and shook the future of nuclear power worldwide, the  fund
manager  said in its Global Perspectives report.  Hurricane
Katrina , which hit  New Orleans  in 2005, caused property damage
of more than $80 billion, and direct losses associated with a
drought in  China  last year were more than $1 billion.  “Apart from natural disasters, rather less extreme weather
events such as bad winters, hurricanes and floods can also
complicate the economic landscape,” Douglas Roberts, senior
international economist at Standard Life, said in an e-mailed
 statement  today. Pollution and environmental damage costs China
about 4 percent of gross domestic product every year, the report
said, citing Chinese government estimates.  The U.S. National Science Foundation found that the
influence of routine weather variations is as much as 3.4
percent of U.S. gross domestic product, Roberts said.  “As the incidence of severe weather events increases so
too does the cost of insurance, impacting all sectors of the
economy,” he said.  Human behavior is contributing to weather fluctuations, and
if  climate change  continues it’s likely that the costs of
weather on global economies will also rise, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
