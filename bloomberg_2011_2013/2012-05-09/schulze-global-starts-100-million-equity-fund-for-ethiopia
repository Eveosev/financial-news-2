Ethiopia’s first private-equity fund
will see investments of $100 million in the Horn of Africa
nation, said Gabriel Schulze, chief executive officer of
Beijing-based Schulze Global Investments, which is managing the
fund.  “The market is ripe and ready for private equity
capital,” he told reporters in the capital,  Addis Ababa , today.
“We believe Ethiopia presents opportunities across the board.”  CDC Group Plc, the U.K.’s development finance institution,
will invest $15 million in the fund,  while the  Schulze  family
will commit $10 million, said Schulze. It will reach its limit
of $100 million by September, he said.  The $100 million will be put into as many as 22 Ethiopian
companies in agriculture, manufacturing, education, health care,
real estate, energy and tourism, Schulze said.  Government policy and development of private industries
makes Ethiopia ready for the investments, he said.  “In the past five years there’s been a noticeable
development in private sector support and foreign investor
support,” Schulze said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
