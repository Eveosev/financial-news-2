Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , a unit of Societe
Generale SA, led the Czech equity index to its lowest in almost
four months as a political impasse in Greece boosted concern the
euro area’s financial crisis will deepen.  The stock slumped 2 percent to 3,267 koruna by 12:12 p.m.
in Prague, a second day of declines. The 14-member  PX (PX)  index, in
which Komercni Banka has a 17 percent weighting, dropped 1.4
percent, set for its lowest close since Jan. 18. Austria’s  Erste
Group Bank AG (RBAG) , with a 19 percent weighting, fell 1.9 percent.  Bank shares were among the biggest decliners in Europe, the
euro weakened and Spanish default risk approached a record as
 Greece , which has 436 million euros ($566 million) of debt
coming due next week, struggles to form a government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
