Invenergy LLC , a closely held
renewable-power developer, completed three wind farms using
General Electric Co. turbines in  Poland  with the local company
 Enerco  and arranged financing for four other projects.  The Wiekowice, Jezyce and Dobieslaw projects, about 300
miles northwest of Warsaw, have a total capacity of 80 megawatts
Chicago-based Invenergy said in a  statement . They have 32 GE
2.5-megawatt turbines, and will help Poland reach a goal of
producing 15 percent of its power from renewable sources by
2020.  Invenergy and Enerco also completed financing for four wind
farms in northwest Poland that are scheduled to be finished next
year. Those wind farms will total about 95 megawatts and use 38
GE 2.5-megawatt turbines, according to the May 7 statement.
