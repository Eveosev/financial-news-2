The  New Jersey  Devils defeated the
host Philadelphia Flyers 3-1 to advance to the National Hockey
League’s Eastern Conference finals for the first time in nine
years.  The Devils won the best-of-seven playoff series by four
games to one and will face the  New York Rangers  or the
Washington Capitals for a place in the Stanley Cup finals. That
series resumes tonight in Washington with the Rangers leading by
three games to two.  “That’s a good team we just beat,” Devils coach Peter DeBoer told reporters. “We have a long way to go.”  Maxime Talbot opened the scoring for the home team at Wells
Fargo Center in Philadelphia last night after seven minutes, 18
seconds. Bryce Salvador tied it 2:09 later and David Clarkson
put the Devils ahead after 12:45 in the first period.  Ilya Kovalchuk  made it 3-1 five minutes into the third period.  New Jersey hasn’t played in the conference finals since
2003, when it won the  Stanley Cup  for the third time in
franchise history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
