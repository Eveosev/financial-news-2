Officials in the German port of
Hamburg discovered a container contaminated with radioactive
cobalt-60,  Hamburger Abendblatt  reported today, citing the
cityâ€™s health authorities.  The source of the radiation was empty tea boxes being
shipped in the container from  India  to a company in the German
state of Schleswig-Holstein, the newspaper said. The container
has been cordoned off in an isolated area of the port and will
eventually be sent back to India, Hamburger Abendblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
