House lawmakers pressed the U.S.  Air
Force  to ensure its planned new bomber can carry nuclear weapons
as soon as it is operational.  The House Armed Services Committee approved a nuclear-ready
requirement for the bomber today as it began acting on the
defense authorization measure to set spending targets and
military policy for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.  President  Barack Obama ’s revised military strategy calls
for development of a new long-range stealth bomber even as the
Pentagon seeks about $490 billion in reductions over a decade.
The bomber is part of the administration’s goal to have weapons
able to reach areas far from bases and where “our access and
freedom to operate are challenged,” according to the strategy
released in January.  The aircraft will be the first new bomber design since
 Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  was awarded the contract for the B-2 in
1981. The Air Force plans to spend $6.3 billion through 2017 on
developing the next bomber.  The Air Force expects to begin using the new bomber in the
mid-2020s. While the service envisions the bomber carrying
nuclear weapons eventually, House members want that possibility
sooner. The Air Force would have to certify the bomber to use
nuclear weapons no later than two years after it reaches initial
operating capability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
