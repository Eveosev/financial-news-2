The Blues Super Rugby team will
advertise the position of head coach for the 2013 season this
week to give the Auckland-based franchise time to recruit the
best available candidate.  The Blues, who’ve won the southern hemisphere’s top
provincial rugby competition three times, are in last place this
season after losing nine of their 10 games under coach Pat Lam,
who is eligible to reapply for his job.  “The reality is, the results of the Blues to date this
season have put considerable focus on the role and as those in
the rugby industry know, this is the time coaches look to secure
their coaching posts for next year and beyond,” Blues Chairman
Gary Whetton said in an e-mailed statement. “This position
needs to be advertised now.”  Applicants will undergo a recruitment process involving
representatives from the Blues and New Zealand Rugby Union,
which contracts the head and assistant coaches of the country’s
five Super Rugby teams in conjunction with each franchise.  The Blues, who won their most-recent title in 2003, are
last in the 15-team standings with 12 competition points and are
18 points adrift at the bottom of the New Zealand Conference.  “It’s obvious for all to see that the Blues are having a
very disappointing season so far in 2012 and this has brought
about the need for some action,” said Neil Sorensen, the NZRU’s
general manager of professional rugby.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
