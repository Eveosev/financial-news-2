Michael V. Dunn, a member of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission until last year, was named
non-executive chairman of the largest database of U.S. swap
information as regulators prepare to complete an overhaul of
financial regulations required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. today said Dunn,
who joined the commission in December 2004, would help the
database align the needs of participants in the markets and
regulators. Dodd-Frank intends for so-called swap data
repositories to provide regulators access to information about
the price and volume of trades in an effort to increase
transparency about the $708 trillion global swaps market.  “I’m just looking forward to taking the next step toward
fulfilling the Dodd-Frank Act,” Dunn, also a senior adviser at
Washington-based Patton Boggs LLP law firm, said in a telephone
interview. Dunn stepped down on Oct. 24 from the CFTC, the main
U.S. derivatives regulator implementing Dodd-Frank.  The 2010 financial-regulation overhaul was enacted after
largely unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.
 Gary Gensler , chairman of the CFTC, said last week that he wants
the agency to publish aggregate swaps-market information on a
regular basis that is publicly accessible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
