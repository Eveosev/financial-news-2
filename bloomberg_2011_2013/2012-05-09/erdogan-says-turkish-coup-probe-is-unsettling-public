Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said he is “disturbed” by raids targeting former and
serving military officials in an investigation into the so-
called postmodern coup of 1997, which ousted an Islamist-led
government.  Detentions ordered by prosecutors in the past month are
“unsettling the public,” Erdogan told reporters in Ankara late
yesterday. Seventeen officers were rounded up yesterday as part
of a fourth wave of arrests. More than 50 military men, mostly
retired and active generals, have been placed under surveillance
and about 30 of them jailed.  The investigation covers the four-month period that began
with a meeting of the National Security Council on Feb. 28,
1997, and ended with the resignation of the coalition government
of the time.  “The steps that need to be taken should be taken for this
to be done and over with,” Erdogan said. “If these waves keep
coming back to back, as they do, they will drown country.”  Erdogan, who was mayor of Istanbul at the time, was among
the Islamist politicians targeted by the military as potential
threats to  Turkey ’s secular constitution. The premier said he’ll
decide whether to join the case against the officers once there
is an indictment. Turkish law allows victims of a crime to take
part in criminal lawsuits as plaintiffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
