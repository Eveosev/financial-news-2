Siemens AG (SIE) , MAN AG and  ABB Ltd (ABB)  are
among some 80 companies affected by walkouts today and tomorrow
over a wage dispute with the  IG Metall  union.  This evening 7,400 workers walked off the late shift at
Siemens, Same Deutz and other companies and “tens of
thousands” will demonstrate tomorrow in the state of Bavaria,
IG Metall said in an e-mailed statement.  Since April 30, more than 420,000 workers across  Germany 
have participated in limited warning strikes, according to IG
Metall. The union is demanding a 6.5 percent wage increase for
its 3.6 million members, more say over temporary employment and
guarantees of permanent contracts for people completing
apprenticeships as German workers demand a bigger share in the
country’s economic rebound.  Other companies affected by the Bavarian strikes include
KUKA AG, Schaeffler AG,  Fujitsu Ltd (6702)  and BMW AG’s Dingolfing
plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
