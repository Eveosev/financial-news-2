ING Groep NV (INGA) , the biggest Dutch
financial-services company, doesn’t consider the firm’s stake in
 Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , received in exchange for the sale
of its U.S. online broker, as strategic.  ING will decide “over time” what to do with the 9.7
percent holding, Chief Executive Officer Jan Hommen told
analysts today. “I have no comments to make on that one at this
moment, but it’s clear this is not a strategic ownership
position.”  ING became the McLean, Virginia-based firm’s largest
shareholder after completing the sale of ING Direct USA to
Capital One on Feb. 17. The stake is subject to a lock-up period
of 90 days after that, said Raymond Vermeulen, a spokesman for
the Amsterdam-based company. ING received about $9 billion,
including $6.3 billion in cash and $2.7 billion in shares, in
the transaction.  ING’s Eli Leenaars, CEO of Retail Banking Direct and
International, has been added to Capital One’s board of
directors, Hommen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
