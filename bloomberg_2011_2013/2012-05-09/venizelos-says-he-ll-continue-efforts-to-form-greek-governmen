Evangelos Venizelos , the leader of the
Greek Pasok party, said he will continue attempts to form a
government when he receives the three-day mandate from President
Karolos Papoulias tomorrow.  Venizelos said he outlined his proposal for a national
unity government including Pasok,  New Democracy , Syriza and the
Democratic Left parties to Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras in their
meeting in Athens today. He also told Tsipras he would be
willing to support a government comprised of Syriza, Independent
Greeks and Democratic Left if that formation guaranteed Greece’s
future course in the euro.  “We appear to have not been able to settle on a
decision,” Venizelos said in statements to reporters in Athens
today. “I will continue these efforts when I receive the
mandate tomorrow.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
