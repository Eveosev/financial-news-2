Dexia SA (DEXB)  Chairman Jean-Luc Dehaene
said the bank has so far not found any judicial grounds to
recover pension payments to former chief executive officer
Pierre Richard.  Speaking to shareholders at the annual  shareholders’
meeting  in Brussels, Dehaene said that Dexia has no access to
the capital reserves of Richard’s pension as they have been
transferred to a third-party insurer. The contracts were drawn
up before 2008 and Dexia is still trying to find a way to
retroactively change the terms of the pension, Dehaene said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
