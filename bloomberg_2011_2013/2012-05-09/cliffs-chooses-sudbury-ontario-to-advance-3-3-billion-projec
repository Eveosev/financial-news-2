Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (CLF) , the
biggest U.S. iron-ore producer, selected Sudbury, Ontario as the
site for a chromite ore smelter it’s building as part of a
proposed $3.3 billion ferrochrome project.  The proposed mine and processing plant in northern Ontario
would bring thousands of jobs to the region, the provincial
government said in an e-mailed statement today. Chromite ore is
processed into ferrochrome, an ingredient used to produce
stainless steel.  Cliffs plans to spend about $75 million this year related
to the chromite project, which is being developed at the largest
known deposit of the mineral in  North America , the Cleveland-
based company said in April. Cliffs estimated the project’s
total cost at $3.3 billion, including mine development, a
concentrating plant, a processing facility and transportation
infrastructure, the company said on Jan. 19.  Cliffs must still receive provincial and federal
environmental assessment approvals, negotiate agreements with
First Nations communities and complete commercial and technical
feasibility studies, the company said today.  Infrastructure to be built includes an all-weather road
linking the mine site to existing railways and an airstrip, the
company said in a November  presentation .  To contact the reporter on this story:
