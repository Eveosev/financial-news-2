Vietnam ’s bonds rose, driving five-
year yields to the lowest level since September 2009, on
speculation a decline in interbank rates boosted demand for
 government securities . The dong was little changed.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  dropped 26 basis
points, or 0.26 percentage point, to 3.82 percent today, the
least since Bloomberg started tracking the data in June 2009.  “As interbank rates have fallen to very low levels, bond
yields have to drop as well,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a
fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based Ocean Commercial Joint-Stock
Bank. “ Government bonds  are still a very effective and safe
investment channel.”  The  yield  on the five-year notes fell nine basis points to
9.94 percent, according to daily fixing prices from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong held at 20,860 per dollar as of 3:15 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to data from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The central
bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to fluctuate
by as much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
