Sembcorp Marine Ltd. (SMM) , the world’s
second-biggest oil-rig builder, posted a 25 percent decline in
first-quarter profit as it built rigs won at lower prices after
the global credit crisis.  Net income  dropped to S$113 million ($90 million) from
S$151 million a year earlier, Sembcorp Marine said in a stock
exchange filing today. That was lower than the S$152.6 million
average of five  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 14 percent to S$943 million.  Shipyards are working more on orders they won at lower
prices as the 2008 global financial crisis pared purchases of
offshore products. Demand for drill ships and floating oil
production units have recovered as higher crude prices and
depleting reserves prompt companies such as Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and Petroleo Brasileiro SA to spend more on developing new
fields.  “Despite the mixed global macroeconomic outlook, the
fundamentals driving the offshore and marine activities remain
strong,” the company said in the statement. “Outlook continues
to be positive.”  Sembcorp Marine said its net orderbook reached S$7.4
billion, with deliveries extending to 2015. Orders for three
jackup rigs worth $639.5 million and a $1.75 billion contract
for semi-submersible rigs and a drillship have been added since
the beginning of this year, it said.  Sembcorp Marine dropped 1.2 percent to S$4.78 at the close
in  Singapore  before the earnings announcement. The stock has
climbed 29 percent this year, the  second-best performer  on the
30-member Straits Times Index.  Narrower Margin  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, fell 28 percent to S$120 million in the
first quarter. Operating profit margin narrowed to 13 percent
from 20 percent a year earlier.  Daily rates on ultra-deep water rigs may rise 28 percent to
a record $714,000 a day by the third quarter from about $560,000
currently, according to estimates by Ole Slorer, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley who dubs the move a “super spike.”  Sembcorp Marine aims to tap growing demand for offshore
drilling units as capacity at its new yard in Singapore will
almost double when it becomes operational next year. It is also
building a yard in  Brazil .  The shipyard in February won its first drill-ship order for
$793 million from Sete Brasil Participacoes SA  to develop oil
and gas fields discovered around the coast of Brazil. The vessel
will be delivered no later than the second quarter of 2015 from
the company’s Brazilian yard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
