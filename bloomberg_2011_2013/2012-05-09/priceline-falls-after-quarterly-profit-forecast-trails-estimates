Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the biggest U.S.
online travel agency by market value, fell after forecasting
second-quarter earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Profit, excluding some items, will be $7.20 to $7.40 a
share in the second quarter, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
company said yesterday in a statement. That missed the average
$7.43 estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Priceline gets about 60 percent of its revenue from
overseas, mostly in Europe, which is suffering from a deepening
debt crisis. While bookings in Priceline’s international
business are still expected to increase as much as 37 percent in
the current quarter from the prior year, that’s a slowdown from
54 percent in the first quarter. Smaller rivals  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  and
 Orbitz Worldwide Inc. (OWW) , meanwhile, are coming off better-than-
expected results.  Priceline fell 3.6 percent to $693.37 at 9:49 a.m. in  New
York . The  stock  had climbed 54 percent this year before today.  Net income in the first quarter increased 74 percent to
$182 million, or $3.54 a share, as revenue rose 28 percent to
$1.04 billion. Excluding some items, profit of $4.28 a share
topped the $3.95 average analyst estimate.  The company has grown faster in recent years than Expedia
and Orbitz because of acquisitions made in Europe and Asia.
Priceline bought Amsterdam-based Booking.com in 2005 and
Bangkok-based Agoda.com in 2007.  International sales increased 59 percent to $617 million in
the first quarter, Priceline said.  Recessions, Upheaval  In addition to recessions in some European countries,
political upheaval in Greece is creating added uncertainty
around the business, Chief Executive Officer Jeffery Boyd said
yesterday on the quarterly conference call.  Expedia, based in Bellevue,  Washington , is trying to catch
up. The company said on April 26 that its Hotels.com business
helped drive a  12 percent jump  in revenue to $816.5 million.
Expedia shares have surged 42 percent this year.  TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) , the recommendation service spun off from
Expedia in December, said last week that first-quarter  sales 
rose 23 percent to $183.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
