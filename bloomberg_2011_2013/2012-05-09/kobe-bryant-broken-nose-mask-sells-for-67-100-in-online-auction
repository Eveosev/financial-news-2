Los Angeles Lakers guard  Kobe Bryant 
raised $67,100 for his youth charity in an online auction for
the mask he wore after breaking his nose in the National
Basketball Association All-Star Game.  The clear mask, autographed by the 33-year-old-guard,
fetched the winning bid in an  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  auction that ended
yesterday, company spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a telephone
interview. All of the money will go to the  Kobe & Vanessa Bryant
Family Foundation ’s Youth Homelessness Initiative, according to
the auction  homepage .  The identity of the buyer is not available, Miller said.
The week-long auction received 129 bids, and was handled by
 Kompolt , a San Luis Obispo, California-based auction management
company.  Bryant wore the clear mask for 11 games during the NBA
regular season after Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade broke Bryant’s
nose with a hard foul in the All-Star Game in February. He
averaged more than 30 points a game while wearing the mask,
including a 34-point performance against the  Minnesota
Timberwolves  on March 9 when he scored his 29,000th career
point, according to the auction site.  The Kobe & Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation was formed in
2007 with the aim of improving the lives of young people. The
money from the mask’s sale will contribute to the foundation’s
projects directed at youth homelessness in the Los Angeles area.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
