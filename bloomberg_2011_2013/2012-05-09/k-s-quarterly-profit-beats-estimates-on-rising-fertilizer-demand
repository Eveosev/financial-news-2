K+S AG (SDF) ,  Europe ’s biggest potash
producer, reported first-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates after demand for fertilizer rose at the end of the
quarter, helping offset a decline in demand for de-icing salt.  Earnings before interest and tax excluding one-time items,
which the company calls Ebit I, declined 24 percent to 281.1
million euros ($364.8 million) in the quarter, Kassel, Germany-
based K+S said today in a statement. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had predicted 265.4 million euros.  Chief Executive Officer Norbert Steiner today reiterated a
forecast for operating profit to decline “moderately” and
sales to remain stable for the full year. Farmers ordered more
potash fertilizer at the end of March after the European
planting season started late because of dry and cold weather at
the beginning of the year, the company said today.  “Despite challenging framework conditions at the start of
the year, our potash fertilizer business achieved a very good
result,” Norbert Steiner. “We were thus able to significantly
mitigate the sharp decline for de-icing salts which was entirely
due to weather conditions.”  Quarterly sales dropped 12 percent to 1.44 billion euros,
compared with a 1.43 billion-euro estimate. Adjusted net income
fell 29 percent to 193.4 million euros.  K+S, which became the world’s largest salt producer after
buying  Morton Salt  from  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  in 2009, is holding its
annual shareholders meeting in Kassel today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
