Confidence among U.S. chief executive
officers in the first quarter climbed to the highest level in
almost three years, a private survey showed.  The Young Presidents’ Organization said today that higher
expectations for the economy, sales and labor market helped push
up its Global Pulse  Index  of U.S. sentiment to 65.1, the
strongest since the survey began in July 2009, from 62.2 in the
prior three months. Readings greater than 50 show the outlook
was more positive than negative. The Dallas-based group’s gauge
of sales in the coming 12 months advanced to 71, the highest
since records began, from 67.8 in the previous quarter.  Fifty-six percent of the executives surveyed said the
economy would improve in the next six months, up from 51 percent
in the prior period. More optimism among businesses may help
encourage faster growth in payrolls, which grew in April at the
slowest pace in six months.  “Confidence among U.S. CEOs shrank in the second and third
quarters of last year in response to a variety of factors, but
that has changed over the past two quarters,” Stephen Slifer,
YPO Global Pulse economic adviser and chief economist at
NumberNomics, said in a statement. “GDP is growing again.”  While the Labor Department’s data showed a weaker-than-
projected 115,000 gain in April employment, according to the
Bloomberg News survey median, the YPO’s employment index
increased to 61.6, also the highest since records began, from
59.8. A measure of capital spending plans climbed to 63 in the
first quarter from 60.5 in the prior three months.  The gain in the U.S. gauge helped boost it above the YPO’s
Global Confidence Index, which increased to 63.8 at the
beginning of 2012 from 61.2 in the fourth quarter.  The nonprofit service organization’s findings for the U.S.
were based on responses from 1,897 global chief executives,
including 931 in the U.S., to an electronic survey conducted
during the first two weeks of April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
