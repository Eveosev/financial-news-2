Lithuania plans to hold a preliminary
stake of 38 percent in the Visaginas nuclear power plant,
Economy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas said.  Estonia may hold 22 percent in the nuclear power plant,
which may cost as much as $6.5 billion, while Latvia and  Hitachi
Ltd. (6501) , a strategic investor in the facility and  Japan â€™s second-
largest builder of nuclear reactors, will hold 20 percent,
Sekmokas told reporters in Vilnius today.  The Baltic region is seeking to cut its dependence on
energy imports from  Russia  after closing the Soviet-era Ignalina
facility at the end of 2009. The government in Lithuania plans
to build the new 1,300-megawatt reactor in  Visaginas  by 2020.  Power production costs at Visaginas may average 7 centai
($0.03) to 10 centai per kilowatt hour, lower than current costs
in the country, Sekmokas said on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
