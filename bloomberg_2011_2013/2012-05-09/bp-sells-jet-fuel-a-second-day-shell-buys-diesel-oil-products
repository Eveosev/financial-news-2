BP Plc sold  jet fuel  on the cargo
market for a second day. Gasoil rose, snapping five days of
declines on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought diesel for delivery to  Turkey .
Gasoline rose for the first time in seven sessions.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded from $1,040 to $1,047 a metric ton, according to a survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin board.
That’s higher than deals at $1,029 to $1,038 yesterday.  BP and Cargill Inc. purchased the Eurobob grade, to which
ethanol is added to make the finished grade. Chevron Corp. and
Trafigura Beheer BV were among the sellers of barge lots, which
are usually 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , rose to $9.55
a barrel as of 2:20 p.m., compared with $9.14 yesterday,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based
broker. That was the most in more than a week.  Gasoline shipments across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe
are set to fall to the lowest since July over the next two
weeks, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Naphtha’s  crack , or discount to Brent, was little changed
at $8.68 a barrel, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Shell purchased the cargo of as much as 30,000 tons of
diesel from OAO’s Litasco for delivery to the Turkish port of
Mersin, a similar survey of the Platts pricing window showed.
The deal was partly priced at $11 more than June low-sulfur ICE
gasoil futures.  Repsol YPF SA sold a similar-sized shipment of diesel to BP
for delivery to Genoa in  Italy  at a $27 premium to the high-
sulfur June gasoil contract, the survey showed. That compares
with May 3 deals at $24 more than May gasoil.  On the barge market, Vitol Group bought two lots of diesel
at premiums of $16.50 and $17.50 to June gasoil, the survey of
Platts showed. That compares with trades at $10 and $10.50 more
than the May contract yesterday.  BP sold a cargo of jet-fuel to Vitol for delivery to
 France ’s  Le Havre  that was partly priced at a $66 premium to May
gasoil, the survey showed. That is lower than yesterday’s trade
at $67.  Total SA bought a 2,000-ton lot of  jet fuel  on the barge
market at $76 more than June gasoil, the survey showed.  Gasoil for delivery in May advanced 1.4 percent to $958.25
a ton as of 5:28 p.m. local time on ICE. The contract closed at
$945.25 yesterday, the lowest in more than three months.  June futures were at $950.50, widening the discount to
front-month contract to $7.75 a ton from $6 yesterday. That’s
the biggest spread since Dec. 12, excluding expiry day
anomalies. The market has been in backwardation, a structure
where near-term supplies are more expensive than later-dated
deliveries, since April 13.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability, rose
to $15.17 a barrel as of 4:30 p.m. London time versus $15.05
yesterday. Brent dropped 0.2 percent to $112.51 a barrel on the
ICE exchange.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $640 to $643 a ton, the
survey showed. That compares with May 2 deals from $679 to $689.
The low-sulfur grade changed hands from $690.25 to $692 a ton,
down from $736 to $737.  Tenders  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS is seeking to buy a
cargo of ultra-low-sulfur diesel for delivery in May, according
to a tender document.  The Turkish refiner plans to buy 30,000 tons of the
fuel for delivery from May 22 to May 24 to either Izmit or
Izmir, according to the document received today by e-mail. The
tender closes tomorrow and offers are valid until the following
day.  Refineries  OMV AG plans to shut part of its Petrobrazi refinery for
six weeks from May for scheduled works, the company said today.  The refiner will upgrade a crude distillation unit at the
plant in May, it said. The maintenance will reduce the its
capacity to 4.2 million tons a year and allow it to process all
of the company’s Romanian crude output. The plant can process
4.5 million tons a year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
