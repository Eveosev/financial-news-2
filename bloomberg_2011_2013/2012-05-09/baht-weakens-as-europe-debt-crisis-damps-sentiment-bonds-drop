Thailand ’s baht approached a three-
month low on concern  Europe ’s lingering debt crisis will deter
investors from buying higher-yielding assets.  Government bonds 
declined.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index dropped for a
second day after the Syriza party that was placed second in
Greek elections said it would form a coalition government of
left-wing parties, which reject austerity measures needed to
secure a European Union-led bailout. The baht has weakened 0.9
percent this month, along with 10 of Asia’s 11 most-traded
currencies.  “The main driver of the market is the Greek political
situation, which creates lots of uncertainties in the market,”
said Norawit Suparinayok, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok
Bank Pcl. “Importers may also buy the dollar today as they may
worry that the baht will weaken further.”  The baht declined 0.1 percent to 31.02 per dollar as of
3:24 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 31.10 on May 7, the weakest level since
Feb. 1. It may trade between 30.90 and 31.20 this week, Norawit
said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.59
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
