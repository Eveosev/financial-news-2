Demand Media Inc. (DMD) , operator of
eHow.com and domain-name business eNom.com, jumped after the
company boosted its annual forecast, citing content
improvements.  Demand Media  rose  8.1 percent to $8.57 at the close in New
York. The  Santa Monica , California-based company’s shares are up
29 percent this year.  The company, which said its worldwide unique users exceeded
104 million in March, is working to improve consumer experience
on its eHow sites. Changes include removing 600,000 pieces of
low quality or similar content and adding more premium text and
video, Chief Executive Officer Richard Rosenblatt said yesterday
on a conference call.  Mark Mahaney , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  San
Francisco , today upgraded the shares to buy from neutral.  “Demand has become a potentially material play on the
growth of online-video due to its YouTube channels,” Mahaney
wrote in a note to investors. “eHow appears on a path to
sustainable growth.”  Demand Media said it expects annual per share earnings
excluding certain items of as much as 35 cents, up from a prior
forecast in February of a maximum of 32 cents. That compared to
the 28 cent average  estimate  of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
The company projected revenue of as much as $367 million,
compared to its previous prediction of as much as $358 million.
Analysts had estimated sales of $341.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
