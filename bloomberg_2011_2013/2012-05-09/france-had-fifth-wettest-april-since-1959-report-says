France  had its fifth-wettest month of
April since 1959, after a dry March, weather forecaster Meteo-
France said.  Nationally, rain in April was 70 percent above normal, the
Saint Mande, France-based forecaster wrote in a monthly  report 
on its website today.  “Contrary to the month of March, this April month was well
watered with cumulative precipitation of generally more than 75
millimeters (2.95 inches) for the whole of France,” Meteo-
France wrote.  Last month’s rain has relieved drought stress for winter
grains and allowed for normal uptake of nitrogen fertilizer,
plant researcher Arvalis Institut du Vegetal reported last week.
France is the European Union’s largest grower of wheat.  Rainfall in the September-through-April period is close to
normal for almost all of France other than the north of the
Lower Rhine region and the very northeast of the Moselle, which
have precipitation deficits of 25 percent compared to normal
values, according to the report.  Shallow soils in a large part of the country are close to
saturation, except in parts of the Mediterranean region and
Alsace, where they’re dry to very dry, Meteo-France wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
