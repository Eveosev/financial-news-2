German solar-power companies expect
sales to decline by 50 percent this year because of subsidy cuts
in the world’s second-largest market for the industry, according
to a survey by the BSW-Solar lobby.  More than half the companies surveyed cut jobs in recent
weeks, the Berlin-based group said in an e-mailed statement
today. The lobby polled 555 producers, wholesalers and
installers of photovoltaic products between April 26 and May 8.  “Cuts to solar subsidies that are way too harsh have
poisoned the investment climate in  Germany , caused sales to
plummet and already cost more than 10,000 solar jobs,”  Carsten Koernig , the head of the lobby, said in the statement.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s plan to reduce solar incentives
after an installation boom is putting additional pressure on
domestic manufacturers such as  Solarworld AG (SWV)  as Chinese rivals
led by Suntech Power Holdings Co. grab market share.  Merkel’s government argues cuts are needed to match a drop
in solar-panel prices and curb rising electricity costs for
consumers. Subsidies also threaten to spur imports of equipment
from countries with overcapacity in solar manufacturing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
