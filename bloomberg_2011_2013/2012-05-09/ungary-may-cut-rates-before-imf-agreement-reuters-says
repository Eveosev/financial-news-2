Hungary  may start cutting  interest
rates  before the Cabinet reaches a bailout agreement with the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union, Reuters
reported, citing an interview with monetary policy makers Ferenc Gerhardt and Gyorgy Kocziszky.  “Once the talks set off, a rate-cut cycle can begin,”
Reuters cited Gerhardt as saying in an article published
yesterday. “Obviously, the talks will go on, there will be
economic data coming in, so we will have to feel market
expectations very precisely” for the timing of the rate cut,
Gerhardt said, according to Reuters.  Progress needs to be made in negotiations for borrowing
costs to start falling, Gerhardt said, according to Reuters.
“For example, even if the agreement is not signed yet, we
already know what it is about,” Reuters cited him as saying.
Rate cuts should be in quarter-point or half-point steps,
Gerhardt said, according to Reuters.  There is “no threat that would jeopardize meeting the
inflation target by the end of next year,” Kocziszky said,
according to Reuters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
