(Corrects name in headline.)  South Africa ’s crime intelligence unit
head, Richard Mdluli, has been relieved of his duties while he
is investigated for the misuse of state funds, nepotism and
meddling in politics, Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa said.  Mdluli will be reassigned, Mthethwa told lawmakers today in
Cape Town, without saying to what position. The Inspector-
General of Intelligence is carrying out one probe, he said,
while a team led by the State Law Adviser is investigating
whether Mdluli meddled in politics and caused divisions within
police management.  Mdluli was suspended last year over allegations that he
used a police fund to buy two new BMWs and appointed family
members as secret agents. He was reinstated to his post in March
after a decision was taken not to prosecute him.  Business Day, South Africa’s biggest business daily
newspaper, said in a front-page editorial on May 4 that the
decision to drop the case against Mdluli “points to political
intervention at the highest level” and would undermine the
integrity of state institutions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
