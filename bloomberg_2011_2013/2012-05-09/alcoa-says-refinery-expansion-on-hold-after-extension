Alcoa Inc. (AA) ’s plan to expand an alumina
refinery in  Western Australia  remains on hold because of
unfavorable economic conditions, the largest U.S. aluminum
producer said after gaining approval to increase capacity.  Alcoa received a five-year extension of an approval for the
expansion of the Wagerup refinery, the Western Australia state
government said in a statement today. The earlier five-year
permit expired in October.  “The extension gives Alcoa the opportunity to continue
evaluating market conditions and construction costs,” Alcoa’s
Australian unit said in an e-mailed response today. “The
project remains on hold because of the challenging economic
environment and the need to obtain competitive and secure energy
supplies in Western Australia.”  Aluminum  prices  in  London  have declined 21 percent in the
past year as a slowing global economy curbed demand. Alcoa cut
12 percent of capacity in January and Chief Executive Officer
 Klaus Kleinfeld  said April 11 the reductions “may not be the
end.”  The Wagerup refinery can produce 2.6 million metric tons of
alumina annually, Alcoa said on its website. Subject to
stringent environmental conditions, an expansion will enable as
much as 4.7 million tons a year to be produced, the Western
Australia state government said.  Alcoa suspended its proposed expansion of the refinery in
November 2008 after the global credit crisis curbed demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
