South  Korea ’s won fell to a two-week
low and government bonds rose as Greek politicians struggled to
form a new government after elections, damping investor appetite
for riskier assets.  Alexis Tsipras, whose Syriza party placed second in Greek
elections on May 6, said he would form a coalition government of
left-wing parties that reject austerity measures needed to
secure a European Union-led bailout. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  declined as
overseas investors sold more Korean shares than they bought for
a sixth day. The Bank of Korea will probably leave its benchmark
interest  rate  at 3.25 percent after a policy review tomorrow,
according to all 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Greece’s political struggle is the main issue in the
market today, but declines in the won will be limited with
exporters waiting to sell the dollar once the won weakens,”
said Lee Yong Hee, a Seoul-based currency dealer at Industrial
 Bank of Korea .  The won dropped 0.4 percent to 1,140.35 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,141.20, the weakest level since April 25. One-month
implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, gained 37 basis points, or 0.37
percentage point, to 7.90 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 fell three basis points to 3.37 percent, matching the May 7
level, which was the lowest since Feb. 1. Three-year debt
futures climbed 0.05 to 104.48 and the one-year  interest-rate 
swap slid one basis point to 3.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
