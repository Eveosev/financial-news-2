England soccer team manager  Roy
Hodgson  will name his provisional squad for the European
Championship on May 16, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported
on its website.  Hodgson, who was named England manager last week, can
change his roster until May 29, when the final 23-man list for
the tournament in Poland and Ukraine must be submitted, the  BBC 
said, without saying where it got its information.  England will hold a four-day training camp in Spain
beginning May 21, the BBC said. It will play exhibition games
against Norway and Belgium before opening Euro 2012 against
France on June 11.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
