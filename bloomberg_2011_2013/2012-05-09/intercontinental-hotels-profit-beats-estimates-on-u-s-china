InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG) , the
worldâ€™s largest provider of hotel rooms, reported profit that
beat estimates as revenue per available room climbed in the U.S.
and China.  First-quarter pretax profit rose 13 percent to $106
million, the Denham, England-based company said in a statement
today, more than the $102.4 million average estimate of seven
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased to $409
million from $396 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
