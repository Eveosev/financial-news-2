Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) ,
 Switzerland ’s biggest insurer, may say first-quarter profit rose
after recording fewer claims from natural catastrophes.  Net income probably advanced to $1.04 billion from $637
million in the year-earlier period, according to the average
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Zurich-based
insurer is due to report earnings tomorrow at 6:45 a.m. local
time.  Zurich Insurance, which saw insured losses almost quadruple
last year to $1 billion after floods and earthquakes globally,
plans to attain a business operating profit after-tax return on
equity of 16 percent over the long term, aided by growth in
 emerging markets . The firm bought 51 percent of  Banco Santander
SA (SAN) ’s Latin America insurance business and Malaysian Assurance
Alliance Bhd. last year.  Operating profit from general insurance probably almost
tripled to $767 million after the company didn’t repeat the $517
million in claims it recorded for the five natural disasters in
 Australia ,  New Zealand  and  Japan  in the first three months of
2011.  The following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and
year-earlier figures. The numbers are in millions of dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
