Gold dropped to a four-month low as
deepening political turmoil in  Greece  boosted the appeal of the
dollar as a safe haven and curbed demand for precious metals as
alternative assets. Silver fell to the lowest since January.  The euro weakened for an eighth session against the dollar
as Greek politicians struggled to form a new government, raising
concern that the nation may leave the currency bloc. Commodities
plunged to the lowest level this year yesterday as global
equities slid to a three-month low.  “Capital is going to where it’s safe, and it hasn’t been
safe in gold,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Currency markets tend
to rule in commodities, and right now the dollar is king.”  Gold futures for June delivery slid 0.6 percent to settle
at $1,594.20 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the metal touched $1,578.50, the lowest since Jan. 3.  The plunge has pared this year’s gain to 1.7 percent, after
the metal advanced for 11 consecutive years. Futures reached an
all-time high of $1,923.70 in September.  Holdings in bullion-backed  exchange-traded products   are at
2,382.4 metric tons, about 1.2 percent below the March 13
record, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The dollar has gained 1.6 percent this month against a
basket of six currencies, while the most-active gold contract
has declined 4.2 percent.  “Dollar strength is trumping any safety qualities of gold
at the moment,” Lesh said.  Silver futures for July delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$29.241 an ounce on the Comex, after falling to $28.615, the
lowest since Jan. 9.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery fell 1.5 percent to close at $613.65 an ounce,
after falling to a four-month low of $609. Platinum futures for
July delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $1,499.20 an ounce.
Platinum has gained 6.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
