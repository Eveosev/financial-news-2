Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  Chief Executive
Officer  Peter Sands  said the prospects for the euro region are
worsening after Greek politicians’ failed to form a government.  “The prospects for the euro zone have got even more
challenging,” Sands said on the sidelines of the bank’s annual
general meeting in  London  today. “It’s a very challenging
situation and we’re all going to have to watch how it unfolds
very closely.”  Greece is struggling to forge a coalition government after
May 6 elections called into question the country’s ability to
impose the austerity measures agreed with international
creditors in return for aid. The risk of Greece leaving the euro
by the end of 2013 has risen to as high as 75 percent, Citigroup
Inc. said May 7.  The Euro Stoxx Banks index dropped 3.3 percent to 85.73 in
London.  Standard Chartered , which earns about three quarters of its
profit in Asia, said in June that it doesn’t hold government
debt in troubled euro-area countries. The bank reported an
eighth year of record earnings last year.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Frank Connelly  To contact the reporter on this story:
