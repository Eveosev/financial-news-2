Egypt ’s central bank will use all
tools available to meet the liquidity requirements of local
banks, said Rania Al-Mashat, assistant sub-governor.  They include the seven-day  repurchase agreements  the
regulator started offering in March 2011 and local-currency
reserve requirement for lenders, she said in an interview at a
conference in Cairo.  The central bank on March 20 reduced by two percentage
points to 12 percent the reserve requirement ratio for banks to
help “ease credit conditions in the market.” That was the
first cut in 13 years, Al-Mashat said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
