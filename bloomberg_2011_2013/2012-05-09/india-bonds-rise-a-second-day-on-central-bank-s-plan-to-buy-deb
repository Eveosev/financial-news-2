India’s 12-year bonds rose for a
second day before the central bank purchases sovereign debt at
an open-market auction this week.  Yields on notes due 2024 fell to the lowest level in almost
three weeks as the  Reserve Bank  of India will offer to buy a
total of 120 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) of notes due in 2020,
2024, 2030 and 2032 on May 11, according to a statement on May
7. Bonds also gained on optimism a drop in  oil prices  this month
will help slow  inflation .  “The central bank’s plan is helping the slide in yields,”
said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at  Development
Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The oil-price drop is also a big
factor in the yields coming to the present levels.”  The yield on the 9.15 percent note due November 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.55 percent as
of 9:55 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level since April 19.  Crude oil in  New York  lost 8 percent this month to $96.53
per barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Inflation
in India, which imports almost 80 percent of the oil it uses,
averaged 6.9 percent in the first quarter.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
dropped one basis point to 8.02 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
