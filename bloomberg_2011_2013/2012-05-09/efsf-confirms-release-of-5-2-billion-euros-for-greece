The European Financial Stability
Facility’s Board of Directors confirmed the release of 5.2
billion euros ($6.7 billion) from a first installment of 39.4
billion euros by the end of June, the EFSF said in an e-mailed
statement today.  An amount of 4.2 billion euros will be disbursed May 10 and
the remaining 1 billion euros aren’t needed before June and will
be disbursed depending on  Greece ’s financing needs, according to
the statement.  The 4.2 billion euros will be transferred into a segregated
account to be used for debt service payments, the EFSF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
