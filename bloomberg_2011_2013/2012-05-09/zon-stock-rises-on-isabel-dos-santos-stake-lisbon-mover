Zon Multimedia SGPS SA (ZON)  rose 1.4
percent in Lisbon trading to the highest close in almost three
months after Isabel  dos Santos  raised her stake in  Portugal ’s
biggest cable-television provider to 14.9 percent.  Zon climbed 3.6 cents to 2.61 euros, the highest closing
price since Feb. 13. The stock gained as much as 3.5 percent
earlier in the day.  “Dos Santos’s decision to increase her stake in Zon
is bolstering shares,” Joao Vale, a trader at Oporto-based
Go Bulling, said by telephone. “It shows she wants to have an
important role in the company.”  Dos Santos agreed to buy 4.9 percent of Zon yesterday
through her Amsterdam-based holding company Jadeium, increasing
her total stake in Zon to 14.9 percent, the Lisbon-based company
said in a regulatory  filing  yesterday. Zon shareholders agreed
on Jan. 30 to eliminate a 10 percent limit on  voting rights  in
the company.  Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, is now Zon’s biggest shareholder, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. She also increased her stake in
Portugal’s  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  to 19 percent after agreeing to buy a
9.4 percent stake from  CaixaBank (CABK)  SA, according to a May 7
regulatory filing from CaixaBank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
