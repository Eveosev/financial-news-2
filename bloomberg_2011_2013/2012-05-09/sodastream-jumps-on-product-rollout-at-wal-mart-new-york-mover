SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA)  surged
the most on record in New York after the Israeli maker of soda
machines said it will roll out its products at  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  in the U.S. by the end of May.  Shares of the Airport City, Israel-based company climbed 26
percent to $36.90 by the close by in New York, the sharpest rise
since the company’s initial public offering in November 2010.  SodaStream will begin selling two of its products this
month at 2,900  Wal-Mart stores  in the U.S., Daniel Birnbaum,
chief executive officer of SodaStream, said in a conference call
with analysts today after the company reported earnings. Wal-
Mart is the world’s largest retailer.  “Wal-Mart is a bridge between their current sales in big-
box retailers to where they want to be selling, which is
supermarkets,” Jim Chartier, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt
& Co., who has a buy rating on the stock, said by phone from  New
York  today. “Wal-Mart has very high foot traffic. It’s a big
deal and will help them sell a lot more machines.”  SodaStream’s first-quarter profit rose to 55 cents per
share in the first quarter from 35 cents a year ago, beating the
44-cent median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
