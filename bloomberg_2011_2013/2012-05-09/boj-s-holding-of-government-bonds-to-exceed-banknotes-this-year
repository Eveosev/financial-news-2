The  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s holdings of
 government bonds  are likely to exceed banknotes this year, an
indication of the central bank’s growing stake in the  world’s
largest public debt  market.  The amount of government bonds held by the Bank of Japan
may reach about 92 trillion yen ($1.2 trillion) by December,
more than the estimated 83 trillion yen in banknotes in
circulation, according to a central bank report released
yesterday. The total includes purchases made under the bank’s
asset-purchase program as well as its monthly bond buys.  Pledged purchases of government debt under the BOJ’s asset-
purchase program have swelled to 29 trillion yen from the 1.5
trillion yen when the facility was unveiled in 2010, prompting
Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  to reiterate last month that the
increased commitment isn’t intended to finance fiscal spending.
The BOJ has expanded government bond buys twice this year under
the fund, its main policy tool.  “There is growing concern that we may be seeing the
beginning of monetization,” said  Hiroshi Shiraishi , an
economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo. “Cautious comments by BOJ
members reflect that they know they’re doing something
undesirable.”  The central bank buys 1.8 trillion yen of bonds a month.
The BOJ has a self-imposed rule that forbids those purchases
from exceeding banknotes in circulation. Buys made through the
asset-purchase fund are exempt from that cap.  To contact the reporters on this story:
