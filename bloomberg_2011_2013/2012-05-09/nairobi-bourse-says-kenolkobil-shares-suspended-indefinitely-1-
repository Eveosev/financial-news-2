The  Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSEASI)  said
shares in  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  will remain suspended indefinitely
after the oil-marketing company announced that its main
shareholders plan to sell a majority stake to Puma Energy BV.  The stock was halted yesterday, when the Nairobi-based
exchange said trading would resume today.  “The counter will remain suspended until we get further
communication from the regulators,” Carol Karugu, spokeswoman
for the bourse, said in an e-mailed response to questions.
 Kenya ’s Capital Markets Authority will issue a statement on the
matter later today, Antony Mwangi, a spokesman for the
regulator, said in a phone interview.  KenolKobil, Kenya’s biggest fuel retailer by market value,
said yesterday its shareholders plan to sell more than 25
percent of their stake in the company to Puma, a Geneva-based
subsidiary of Trafigura Beheer BV. The transaction, subject to
regulatory approval, may result in Puma making a takeover offer
to acquire all shares in the Nairobi-based company.  KenolKobil Chairman  Jacob Segman  said in an e-mailed
response to questions that he didn’t know when the stock would
resume trading, “but understand why it should be suspended.”
