CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s biggest
electricity producer, may lose as much as 10 billion koruna (514
million) in three years on its investment in Albania’s power
distribution company,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing the CEZ’s
annual report.  The power distributor is losing money because Albania’s
energy regulator increased tariffs the company pays to the
state-owned electricity producer without allowing it to raise
prices for its customers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
