U.S. 30-year municipal bond yields
dropped to the lowest since at least 2009 as supply in the $3.7
trillion market slowed and concern that  Europe ’s financial
crisis is worsening boosted demand for the safest assets.  The  yield  on top-rated tax-exempt bonds maturing in 30
years fell 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.24
percent at 10 a.m. in New York, according to a Bloomberg
Valuation index. That’s the  lowest  since January 2009, when the
index begins. Yields move inversely to bond prices.  Municipal debt joined  U.S. Treasuries  in rallying as Greek
politicians struggled to form a government. States and cities
may sell $6.4 billion this week, the least since March,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s a combination of everything -- not that much supply,
Treasuries going lower in yield, problems in Europe and fund
flows up in munis,” said Hardy Manges, head of municipal
trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities in  New York . “It’s like a
perfect storm.”  Investors added about $208 million to long-term U.S.
municipal-bond mutual funds in the week through May 2, the
fourth-straight week of inflows, Lipper US Fund Flows data show.  The 10-year tax-exempt  yield  dropped 2 basis points to 1.81
percent at 10 a.m. in New York, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
lowest in three months.  The muni market has returned 3.9 percent this year through
yesterday, beating a 0.6 percent increase for Treasuries,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
