The National Hockey League’s Board of
Governors approved the sale of the  St. Louis Blues  to a group
led by Tom Stillman, the chairman and chief executive of St.
Louis-based beer distributor Summit Distributing.  Terms of the sale weren’t disclosed in an NHL statement.  The  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  said Stillman, who has been a
minority owner of the Blues since 2007, heads a group of local
investors who will pay about $130 million for the Blues, the
American Hockey League’s Peoria Rivermen and a significant
interest in the Peabody Opera House.  The Blues, who were swept by the  Los Angeles Kings  in the
second round of the playoffs, had an estimated value of  $157
million , 27th out of the league’s 30 teams, according to Forbes’
2011 franchise valuations.  The Blues were sold in 2006 for $150 million to a group led
by Dave Checketts, the former president of  New York ’s Madison
Square Garden. Checketts now runs Legends Hospitality Management
LLC, the concessions, merchandising and management-services
company owned by the  New York Yankees , Dallas Cowboys and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
