Taiwan ’s government bonds gained,
pushing benchmark 10-year yields to the lowest level since
October 2010, as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening saw
investors favor safer assets. The local dollar weakened.  Global funds sold $1.1 billion more of the island’s stocks
than they bought in the past three days, according to exchange
data. Taiwan’s  exports  slumped 6.4 percent in April from a year
earlier, after a 3.2 percent drop the previous month, official
data showed this week. Alexis Tsipras, whose Syriza party placed
second in Greek elections on May 6, said he would form a
coalition government of left-wing parties that reject austerity
measures needed to secure a European Union-led bailout.  “Concern over Europe is pushing down yields again,” said
 James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei.
“Investors are worried about the strength of Taiwan’s economic
rebound.”  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 was 1.226 percent, compared with 1.230 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the lowest level
for benchmark 10-year rates since October 2010.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.4 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders
use to price options, rose 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage
point, to 4.53 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.513 percent
yesterday, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
