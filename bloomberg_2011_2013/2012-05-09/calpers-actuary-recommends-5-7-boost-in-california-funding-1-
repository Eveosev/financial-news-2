 The California Public Employees’
Retirement System’s chief actuary says state taxpayers should
increase contributions 5.7 percent, or $213 million, next year
to cover the cost of pensions after record losses.  California would pay $3.7 billion, or about 4 percent of
the state’s budget, for retiree benefits in the fiscal year
beginning July 1, actuary Alan Milligan recommended in a  report 
today. School districts would pay $1.2 billion. The fund’s
governing board will consider the increase at a meeting May 16.  Calpers, as the fund is known, is the largest pension in
the U.S., with $232.5 billion in assets. It’s still recovering
from the recession which caused it to lose 23 percent in fiscal
2009, its worst one-year decline on record.  The increase stems in part from that investment loss and
from a lower assumed rate of return adopted in March by the
fund’s board. That lowered the presumed annual gain to 7.5
percent from 7.75 percent. The rate is used to calculate how
much money the plan will need to cover promised benefits, and
what employers must contribute.  Last month, the board agreed to cut in half the amount of
the increase for the year that begins July 1 for state agencies
and school districts and in July 2013 for local governments. The
second half would take effect in the following year.  1.9 Percent Return  The fund earned 1.9 percent in the three quarters ending
March 31, according to a performance summary on its website.
That follows 20.7 percent in fiscal 2012, its best result in 14
years, led by stocks and private equity gains.  California’s state pensions in 2010 had about 81 percent of
what they need to cover the benefits they’ve promised, down from
87 percent in the preceding year, according to an annual study
by Bloomberg Rankings. The median for all states was 75 percent,
the data show.  Governor  Jerry Brown  last year proposed changes to public
pensions that would ask government workers to retire later and
contribute more. Democrats have balked at the plans, while
Republicans are seeking a voter initiative to enact them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
