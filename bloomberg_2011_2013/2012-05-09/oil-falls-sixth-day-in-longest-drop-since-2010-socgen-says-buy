Oil fell for a sixth day in New York,
the longest run of declines in almost two years, after crude
stockpiles increased in the U.S., the world’s largest consumer
of the commodity.  Futures slid as much as 1.3 percent after dropping 8.6
percent in the past five days. U.S. inventories climbed  7.8
million barrels  last week to 378 million, the highest level
since August 1990, the  American Petroleum Institute  said
yesterday. A government report today may show supplies rose 2
million barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Crude is
poised to rebound as global refiners increase purchases,  Societe
Generale  SA said in a report.  “U.S. inventory levels are preventing oil having the
traditional dead-cat bounce after such a steep fall,” said
 Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in
London who predicts prices will recover this month. “The lows
we’ve seen this week will probably hold, and crude will likely
rise as buying by funds and weakness in the dollar assist with a
recovery.”  Crude for June delivery fell as much as $1.23 to $95.78 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
and was at $95.82 at 1:34 p.m. London time. It slipped 1 percent
yesterday to $97.01, the lowest close since Feb. 6. Front-month
prices are down 3 percent this year. The six-day decline is the
longest since July 2010.  Brent for June settlement was at $111.49 a barrel, down 1.1
percent, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract’s  premium  to West Texas Intermediate
was at $15.80, little changed from $15.72 yesterday.  OPEC Basket  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said its
basket of crudes was at $109.58 a barrel yesterday, the first
time the grades have fallen below $110 since Jan. 3.  Investors should buy  Brent crude  at $110 a barrel and West
Texas Intermediate oil at $95 a barrel, according to  Societe
Generale SA. (GLE)   “The oil markets are still in correction mode but we don’t
expect it to last much longer,”  Mike Wittner , the head of oil
market research at Societe Generale in New York, said in a
report e-mailed today. “By the end of May, crude prices will
have turned north again.”  Relative Strength Index  Oil’s decline in New York may stall as the 14-day relative
strength index approaches 30, a threshold that typically signals
prices have fallen too far and further losses may not be
sustained. The measure was at 30.3 today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures also have yet to settle lower
than the 200-day moving average, signaling technical support,
after trading below it the past two days. That indicator was at
$96.29 a barrel today.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell 5 million barrels last week,
figures from the industry-funded API show. They are forecast to
drop  750,000 barrels , according to the median estimate of 12
analyst surveyed by Bloomberg News before a separate Energy
Department report today. Distillate supplies, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, slid by 2.7 million barrels
compared with a projected gain of 125,000.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  The Energy Department reduced its 2012 price projections
for crude and gasoline as supply is forecast to expand faster
than fuel consumption. New York crude will average $104.12 a
barrel this year, down 1.5 percent from the April forecast of
$105.72, the department’s Energy Information Administration said
yesterday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. The U.S.
benchmark grade will average $103.75 in 2013, down $2 from the
prior month’s estimate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
