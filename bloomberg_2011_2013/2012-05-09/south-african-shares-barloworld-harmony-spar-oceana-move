The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
declined for a fifth day, dropping 0.3 percent to 33,434.04 by
the close in Johannesburg, the lowest in more than a month.  The following were among the most active equities in the
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Barloworld Ltd. (BAW)  , the world’s biggest forklift
trader, dropped the most in three years on speculation that a 75
percent jump in fiscal first-half profit doesn’t justify a rally
in the stock this year. The stock fell 8 percent to 87.50 rand.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. (HAR)  , the third-largest
African miner of the metal, gained for the first time in three
days, adding 2.4 percent to 74.73 rand. The company may boost
output by 150,000 ounces in the fiscal year ending June 2013 as
it starts new projects, Chief Executive Officer Graham Briggs
said in an interview.  Oceana Group Ltd. (OCE)  , a South African fishing
company, advanced the most in two months after saying earnings
per share for the six months through March rose as much as 22
percent and after the company reached a settlement with  South
Africa ’s antitrust authorities. The shares gained 3.2 percent to
44.90 rand.  Sun International Ltd. (SUI)  , a South African hotel and
casino operator, rose for the first time in three days, adding
0.9 percent to 79.50 rand. First-quarter sales rose 10 percent,
boosted by the company’s operations in Chile, the company said
in a business update today.  The Spar Group Ltd. (SPP)  , a South African food and
liquor retailer, fell the most in more than three years,
dropping 4.9 percent to 112.50 rand. The company’s gross margin
declined to 7.9 percent in the six months through March as
operating expenses jumped 12 percent after fuel costs climbed 38
percent and a strike at its KwaZulu-Natal distribution center
cost the group 12 million rand ($1.5 million), the company said
today.  Trencor Ltd. (TRE)  , an investment company, increased to
a record, climbing 3.1 percent to 47.78 rand. Earnings per share
adjusted for one-time items as well as unrealized foreign-
currency gains or losses jumped 40 percent to 113 cents in the
three months through March from a year earlier, the company said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
