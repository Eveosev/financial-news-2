Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a second
day on anticipation of increased dollar demand by oil importers.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.1 percent to close at 83.32 per dollar after trading 0.2
percent lower at 83.45 earlier in the day.  “The Kenyan shilling could come under pressure in the days
ahead from demand for dollars from oil importers,”  NIC Bank
Ltd. (NICB)  a Nairobi-based bank, said in a note to clients.  The central bank stayed out of the money market, an
official in the bank’s money market department who asked not to
be identified citing policy, said in a phone interview.  The Ugandan shilling gained for the first time in four
days, appreciating 0.3 percent to close at 2,475 to the dollar,
while Tanzania’s shilling weakened as much as 0.1 percent to
1,582.25 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
