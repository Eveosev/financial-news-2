Freddie Mac (FMCC)  may announce this week
that Donald H. Layton, former chairman and chief executive
officer of  E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC) , will take over as head of
the mortgage-finance company, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  Layton will replace current CEO Charles E. Haldeman Jr.,
who is planning to retire this year. Layton, 62, didn’t return a
telephone call seeking comment about the appointment, which was
reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.  Layton was chairman of the online brokerage from 2007 to
2009, and the company’s chief from 2008 to 2009. Before that, he
was a vice president at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   Freddie Mac  and its larger rival  Fannie Mae  own or
guarantee almost half of U.S. home loans. They have been
sustained by Treasury Department aid since they were seized in
September 2008 amid losses tied to defaults and foreclosures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
