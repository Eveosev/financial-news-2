Some of Manchester’s best rock bands
are making a comeback.  The Happy Mondays and the Inspiral Carpets will reunite at
the O2 Brixton Academy to resurrect pop hits such as “Step On”
and “Caravan.” They aim to eclipse other 1980s bands such as
Stone Roses and members of New Order, also on the “Dadchester”
tour circuit in the next few months.  Tonight and tomorrow, 211 Stockwell Road, SW9 9SL.

Angelin Preljocaj. The son of a carpenter from the mountains of
Albania, Preljocaj grew up in the suburbs of Paris, studied in
Merce Cunningham’s company, and is now one of the hottest names
in choreography. At the Sadler’s Wells Theatre. Information:
 http://www.sadlerswells.com  or +44-844-412-4300.  Sadler’s Wells’s proximity to Exmouth Market, a street of
restaurants, means you are spoilt for choice when picking
somewhere to eat or drink. It’s still difficult to beat Moro,
which has been serving Mediterranean tapas there since 1997.

early-20th-century school, and you’ll be struck by how current
the buildings, furniture and graphics look, nearly a century on:
the box-shaped villas, the club chairs, the block letters.  The aesthetic embodied by Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and others set the stage for modernism, which dominates
design to this day.  Don’t miss the gorgeous Wassily Kandinsky canvas “Circles
in a Circle” (1923) while you’re there.  “Bauhaus: Art as Life” is at the Barbican Gallery through
Aug. 12. Information:  http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery  or
+44-845-120-7550.  Saturday Night  If you want to know what kind of company  London ’s just-
reelected mayor once kept, head for the Duke of York’s Theatre.  “Posh” is inspired by Oxford University’s all-male
Bullingdon Club, whose constituents were famous for wrecking
many venues they patronized. London’s Mayor  Boris Johnson  was a
member at one time, as was U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron .  In the stage version, the blue-bloods convene at a country
pub, drink themselves silly, and trash the place -- even as they
prepare to rule Britannia. If you think the plot begs belief,
just take a look at the guys ruling Britannia now.  “Posh” is at the Duke of York’s Theatre, St. Martin’s
Lane, London WC2N 4BG, through Aug. 4. Information:

is a Chinese restaurant serving spicy Xian and Sichuan dishes in
a series of charming, small rooms.  Information: +44-20-7287-3266. (No website.)  Sunday  A bunch of young artists are joining forces to do a  Damien Hirst : cut out the middleman and sell direct.  The up-and-comers -- handpicked by a panel of experts --
are flaunting their work all weekend at the second edition of
the Other Art Fair. Though their combined sales could never
match the 111.5 million pounds (then $199 million) pocketed by
Hirst in 2008 at Sotheby’s, it’s a chance for them to sell
direct, and for you to pay less than at a regular fair or
gallery.  The Other Art Fair is at Ambika P3, Marylebone Road, London
NW1. Information:  http://theotherartfair.com .  To contact the writer on the story:
