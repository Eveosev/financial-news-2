The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the
greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trade
partners, is poised to resume a yearlong rally as investors
increasingly shun risk, according to Bank of America Corp.  The gauge, which touched 80.272 today, will break out of
its range for 2012 if it closes above 80.17 to 80.18,  MacNeil Curry , a technical strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
wrote in a client note. The Intercontinental Exchange Inc. index
is weighted 57 percent to movements in the euro, and the shared
currency fell for an eighth day versus the dollar as Greek
politicians struggled to form a new government, fueling bets the
region’s debt crisis will worsen.  “A big part of this risk-off is being driven by what’s
transpiring out of  Europe ,” New York-based Curry said in a
phone interview. “The dollar should benefit as a safe haven.”  The Dollar Index was up 0.4 percent to 80.083 at 3:09 p.m.
 New York  time after rising earlier as much as 0.7 percent. It
has risen for eight straight days and closed yesterday at
79.738. The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.2944 and touched
$1.2912, the weakest level since Jan. 23.  If the index breaks out of its range, it may rise to the
area of 81.44 to 81.78, which it reached in January, and
further, Curry wrote in his note.  The 17-nation currency will probably test the $1.2621
level, its low for the year, Curry wrote. It reached that in
January.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
