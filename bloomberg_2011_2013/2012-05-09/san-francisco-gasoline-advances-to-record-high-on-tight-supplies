California-blend gasoline in San
Francisco strengthened to a record high against futures after
refinery work and exports from the U.S. West Coast tightened
supplies in the market.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  were
performing maintenance at three of the five refineries in the
San Francisco area, according to company spokesmen. Gasoline
supplies on the West Coast dropped last week to the lowest level
since December 2008 and the least for this time of year in at
least 10 years, Energy Department data showed.  Inventories of  non-California-blend gasoline  in the state
fell 34 percent, or 624,000 barrels, last month on exports to
 Latin America , exacerbating local supply shortages as refineries
shut equipment for work. A ship recently loaded gasoline off the
California coast bound for  Mexico , Bob van der Valk, an
independent fuel pricing analyst, said in a telephone interview
from Terry, Montana.  “It was already scheduled before all the refinery issues,
so there was nothing they could do about it,” van der Valk
said. “We dug ourselves a deeper hole, and now we’re at the
lowest supplies since 2008. That tells the story.”  California-blend  San Francisco  Carbob jumped 16 cents to 62
cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 4:14 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest premium for the fuel
in the Bay since at least Nov. 27, 2007, when Bloomberg began
assessing spot fuel prices there.  Los Angeles Carbob  Los Angeles Carbob advanced 12 cents to 48 cents a gallon
above futures, the highest since September 2009.  California gasoline inventories dropped 3 percent in the
week ended May 4, the state Energy Commission said today. Non-
Carbob supplies, for use outside the state, tumbled for the
fourth straight week, by 17 percent to 977,000 barrels, the
state said.  California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel, in  Los Angeles 
rose 0.75 cent to a 9.38-cent premium to Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in San Francisco slipped 0.5 cent to a
premium of 15.5 cents a gallon.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
gained 11.5 cents to a 61.5-cent-a-gallon premium versus
gasoline futures. That’s also the highest level for the fuel in
Portland since at least Nov. 27, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
