Western  Australia , the nation’s
biggest iron-ore exporter, began purchasing land for a deep-
water port in Pilbara capable of shipping 350 million metric
tons of the steelmaking material a year to meet global demand.  Anketell will be located 30 kilometers (17 miles) east of
the Karratha region and 10 kilometers from Cape Lambert,  Colin Barnett ,  Western Australia ’s premier and state development
minister, said today in a statement. The port will be built in
stages and include an industrial area for mineral processing and
other heavy industry, he said.  Australia, the world’s biggest exporter of iron ore, is
adding ports as global iron ore purchases are forecast by
Australia’s  Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics  to increase
40 percent to 1.5 billion metric tons by 2017. China will
account for half of that quantity, the bureau estimates.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company is
leading the expansion of the state’s biggest harbor at  Port
Hedland . The project will cost about A$14 billion ($14.1
billion), the state’s Department of Mines and Petroleum
estimated last year.  Aquila Resources Ltd. holds a 50 percent stake in the West
Pilbara  iron ore  project that plans to use the Anketell port,
the company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
