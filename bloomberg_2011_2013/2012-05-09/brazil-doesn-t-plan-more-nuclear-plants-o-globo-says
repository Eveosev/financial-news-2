Brazil doesn’t plan to start building
any nuclear power plant before 2020,  O Globo  said, citing Deputy
Energy Minister Marcio Zimmermann.  The country will complete the Angra 3 nuclear plant that is
currently under construction and will expand hydroelectric dams
and thermoelectric units to boost electricity supply, he said,
according to the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper.  The decision to postpone investments in nuclear power isn’t
related to safety concerns following the 2011 meltdown at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant in  Japan , Globo said, citing
Zimmermann.  To contact the reporter on this story:
