Iran  plans to build a 5-megawatt
geothermal power plant that will be fully operational in the
next Iranian year starting March 21, state-run  Press TV  news
reported, citing Iran’s  renewable energy  organization chief.  The power generation capacity of the pilot plant, “the
first of its kind” in the  Middle East , will reach 50 megawatts
when additional turbines are installed next year, the chief,
Yousef Armodeli, said, according to a Press TV report on its
website yesterday. The geothermal plant will be near the
northwestern city of Meshkin Shahr, it said.  The  Renewable Energy Organization of Iran  also plans to
build a solar plant in the southern city of Shiraz by 2015,
Armodeli said. Iran seeks to produce some 12,000 megawatts of
energy from renewable sources throughout the nation, he said
without elaborating on the projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
