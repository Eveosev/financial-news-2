A Ferrari SpA dealership employee took
a spin on Nanjing’s 600-year-old city wall, leaving  tire marks 
on the Chinese relic and prompting an apology from the
automaker.  The Ferrari dealer had rented a gate along the state-
protected cultural property encircling the former imperial
capital for a May 7 showing of the limited edition Ferrari 458
Italia, according to the official  Xinhua News Agency  and videos
on youku.com.  The car was lifted by crane onto the wall the night before
the show, then a driver gunned the engine and performed an
unauthorized donut spin that left tread marks, according to
Xinhua and youku.com videos, which didn’t identify the driver by
name. A news clip showed workers attempting to remove the marks
with a mop.  “Ferrari has always respected Chinese traditional culture
and values the protection of historical and cultural relics,”
the Maranello, Italy-based company said in the Chinese-language
 statement  posted on its blog and verified by Shanghai-based
spokeswoman Cathy Wen. “Ferrari deeply regrets the incident.”  The event promoting the car was canceled and Ferrari is
taking measures to ensure such actions are not repeated,
according to the statement.  Yang Houyin, who is in charge of the agency managing the
city wall, was removed from his position because of
“incompetent supervision and management,” according to a
Yangtse Evening Post report carried on Xinhua.  Built in the early Ming dynasty, Nanjing’s wall is the
oldest intact city wall in  China  today, according to China’s
submission to  UNESCO  in preparation for application for World
Heritage site status.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
