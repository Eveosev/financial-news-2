Spanish bonds slumped, pushing 10-year
yields above 6 percent, as Greek leaders struggled to form a new
government amid speculation they may decide to withdraw the
nation from the single currency bloc.  German bund yields dropped to records, with the 10-year
rate falling below 1.5 percent for the first time, as signs the
euro-area debt crisis is worsening boosted demand for the
region’s safest assets. The extra yield investors demand to hold
Spain's 10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity bunds reached
the widest in five months, while the spread between French and
Spanish yields expanded to the most since 1996. Germany got bids
for more than its maximum target at a five-year note sale today.  “Investors are worried about Greece, are worried about
political risk in the euro zone, which is obviously supporting
bunds,” said  Michael Leister , a rates strategist at DZ Bank AG
in  Frankfurt . “In turn we see widening spreads and higher
yields in the periphery as euro-zone investors put their funds
into German assets.”  Spain’s 10-year yield rose 24 basis points, or 0.24
percentage point, to 6.08 percent at 4:39 p.m. London time after
climbing above 6 percent for the first time since April 27. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 fell 1.695, or 16.95 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 98.32.  The extra yield investors demand to the securities instead
over 10-year bunds widened 26 basis points to 457 basis points
after reaching 459 basis points, the most since Nov. 23.  ‘Big Level’  “The big level for  Spain  10-years is clearly 6 percent,”
Leister said. “If we sustain a couple of sessions above 6
percent I can easily imagine yields at 6.25-6.50 percent.”  Italian 10-year  yields  climbed 14 basis points to 5.6
percent, with the spread over bunds increasing 16 basis points
to 407 basis points. The gap reached a record 575 basis points
on Nov. 9.  Alexis Tsipras of Greece’s Syriza party, said he expected
Antonis Samaras of  New Democracy  and  Evangelos Venizelos  of
Pasok, to send a letter to the EU revoking their written pledges
to implement austerity measures by the time he meets them today
to discuss a government alliance. Samaras and Venizelos rejected
the request.  Tsipras said he aimed to link up with parties that would
nationalize banks, place a moratorium on debt payments and
cancel the bailout and measures such as labor reforms and
pension cuts.  European Central Bank Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen
said  Greece  can’t renegotiate its fiscal reform program if it
wants to keep the euro, Handelsblatt newspaper reported, citing
an interview.  Bund Yields  Germany’s 10-year bond yield dropped two basis points to
1.52 percent after declining to a record 1.498 percent. The 30-
year yield fell to an all-time low 2.217 percent, while the  two-
year rate  declined to a record 0.062 percent.  French bonds declined, with the 10-year yield rising four
basis points to 2.86 percent.  The spread between France’s 10-year bonds and similar
maturity Spanish debt still expanded 19 basis points to 3.22
percentage points, the widest since March 1996, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg based on closing prices.  “Greece is driving spreads higher,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam. “The odds that Greece will leave the euro are
soaring due to the increased power of anti-euro political
parties.”  German Sale  Germany  got bids of 5.8 billion euros for the new five-year
notes it sold today, compared with a maximum target of 5 billion
euros. The government sold 4.032 billion euros of the securities
at an average yield of 0.56 percent.  German 10-year bund futures also reached a record. The
contract expiring in June gained 0.2 percent to 142.73 after
rising to 143.03, the highest since Bloomberg began compiling
data in 1990.  Volatility on Spanish government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today followed by Italian securities,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield
spreads and credit-default swaps. The change in the Spanish 10-
year yield was 3 times the 90-day average.  Credit-default swaps insuring Spanish debt rose 19 basis
points to a record 518, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Contracts on Italian debt climbed 18 basis points to 464 basis
points, while default swaps on  France  increased seven basis
points to 211 basis points.  German bunds have returned 2.1 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities slipped 1.1
percent, and Italian bonds gained 10.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
