U.S. Gulf Coast oils strengthened as
the gap between West Texas Intermediate and Brent widened after
the Energy Department reported record crude inventory levels in
Cushing,  Oklahoma .  Crude stockpiles at Cushing, the delivery point for the
U.S. benchmark oil, the grade traded in  New York , rose 1.16
million barrels to a record 44.1 million.  Brent crude’s premium to WTI, based on June futures prices,
widened 53 cents to $16.25 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. in New York.
When Brent rises versus WTI, it typically strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 15 cents to $16.40 a
barrel at 1:56 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 30 cents to
$17.40.  Mars Blend’s premium widened 45 cents to $11.80 a barrel.
Poseidon’s added 40 cents to $10.65, while Southern Green
Canyon’s increased 35 cents to $10.35.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 75 cents
against WTI to a premium of $15.75.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$16 a barrel. Syncrude’s premium was steady at $2.10.  Bakken oil’s discount to the U.S. benchmark widened 75
cents to $1.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
