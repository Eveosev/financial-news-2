Cocoa demand may exceed production by
1 million metric tons by 2020, creating a shortage of as much as
25 percent of the current global supply, according to Chicago-
based Blommer Chocolate Co.  Consumption of the chocolate ingredient is estimated to
rise by nearly 30 percent in the next 10 years, the company,
which according to its website is the largest cocoa processor in
 North America , said in a statement distributed by PRNewswire
today. Growth will be driven by rising population and rapid
development in  China ,  India  and  Brazil , Blommer Chocolate said.
Cocoa output is forecast at 3.96 million tons in the season
started in October, according to the  International Cocoa
Organization  in London.  “Cocoa farming is a challenging pursuit given the low
yields, high loss from pests and disease and low level of
training and inputs farmers have historically received,” the
company said in the statement. “This growing environment poses
a daily issue for farmers and a significant supply risk to the
industry.”  Blommer Chocolate said today it would invest $45 million in
cocoa sustainability projects by 2020. The company has already
invested nearly $13 million to date to help the cocoa sector
meet rising demand, it added.  “While land-based expansion is not feasible, more
environmentally desirable practices for existing cocoa farms are
required to address the looming supply crisis,” it said.  Blommer has more than 650 employees and four processing
facilities in North America, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
