Frankfurt  airport operator Fraport AG
said first-quarter profit rose 7.6 percent as  Europe ’s third-
busiest hub increased passenger numbers enough to offset a
decline in cargo traffic prompted by a ban on night flights.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization grew to 138 million euros ($180 million) from 129
million euros a year earlier, Fraport said in a statement. The
 average  estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 130
million euros. Revenue gained 5.8 percent to 538 million euros.  While Frankfurt’s passenger total rose 3.5 percent to 12.2
million in the three months, cargo volume shrank almost 12
percent to 489,000 metric tons after the block on flights at
between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. The ban, upheld last month by the
Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig, will curb competition
with rival airports in Amsterdam, Paris, London and Dubai,
 Germany ’s BDL aviation industry association has said.  Net income declined 36 percent to 15.4 million, held back
by investments in new projects, Fraport said, with a terminal
extension due to become operational at Frankfurt this year after
a fourth runway opened last October.  “Our operating performance is very good,” Chief Executive
Officer Stefan Schulte said. “The lower net income was expected
and is a consequence of our all-encompassing investments, with
which we are laying foundations in Frankfurt for the future.”  The number of passengers using all airports operated by
Fraport, which include Antalya in Turkey and  Lima  in  Peru ,
increased by 3.9 percent to 17.5 million, it said.  Fraport reiterated its forecast for full-year revenue of
more than 2.5 billion euros, a 5 percent increase in Ebitda and
a similar level of net income, while adding that the night ban
and a more costly collective wage agreement means Ebitda in the
ground-handling segment will be lower than once anticipated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
