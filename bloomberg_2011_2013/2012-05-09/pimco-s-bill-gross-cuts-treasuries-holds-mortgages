Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
biggest bond fund, cut his holdings of emerging-market debt to a
two-year low, selling assets from an area where the
 International Monetary Fund  says growth will slow.  Gross reduced the securities to 7 percent of assets in
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Total Return Fund in April
from 10 percent in March, according to  Newport Beach ,
California-based Pimco’s  website . He trimmed investment-grade
bonds to 13 percent from 14 percent. Treasuries were 31 percent
of holdings, versus 32 percent in March, the report showed.  Growth in emerging economies will slow to 5.7 percent in
2012 from 6.2 percent in 2011, the IMF said in April. Tumbling
Treasury yields have led investors to look for more attractive
rates, spurring a 9 percent gain this year for a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index of emerging-market sovereign and company
bonds. The  Federal Reserve  needs to do more to stimulate the
economy to preserve the rally in “risk” assets, Gross said.  “Risk  markets  need more ammo if they are to stay up,”
Gross wrote in a message on Twitter May 8.  Treasuries have returned 0.6 percent this year, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  Gross kept mortgage securities as his biggest holding at 53
percent of assets, according to the report posted yesterday on
the Pimco website. The Federal Reserve bank will probably shift
its focus to mortgage securities in its next round of purchases
to keep borrowing rates low, he said in March.  European Crisis  Gross increased the $258.7 billion Total Return Fund’s net
cash-and-equivalent position to negative 18 percent from
negative 23 percent. The fund can have a so-called negative
position by using derivatives, futures or by shorting.  Prospects for additional Fed asset purchases increased
after a Labor Department report May 4 showed U.S. employers
added 115,000 jobs in April, the least in six months.  Europe ’s fiscal crisis is threatening to slow global
growth. As  Greece  faces political paralysis following an
election, 57 percent of the 1,253 investors, analysts and
traders in a poll of Bloomberg subscribers said at least one
country will abandon the euro by year-end.  Ten-year Treasury  yields  rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.89 percent at 8:02 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent
security due May 2022 fell 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 face value,
to 98 24/32. The record low yield was 1.67 percent set Sept. 23.
The average over the past decade is 3.82 percent.  Fund Performance  The  Total Return Fund (PTTRX)  has handed a 4.9 percent gain to
investors this year,  beating  99 percent of its peers, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It is up 6.1 percent over the
past 12 months, better than 66 percent of its competitors. Pimco
is a unit of the Munich-based insurer  Allianz SE. (ALV)   The U.S. central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two
rounds from December 2008 to June 2011. The Fed is also
replacing $400 billion of short-term Treasuries in its holdings
with longer-term debt to keep borrowing costs down, under a
program scheduled to end next month.  Another set of purchases is “getting closer,” Gross said
in the Twitter post May 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
