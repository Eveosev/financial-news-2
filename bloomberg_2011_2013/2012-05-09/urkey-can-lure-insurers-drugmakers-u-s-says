Turkey  could attract billions of
dollars in U.S. investments if it changes regulations for
industries such as insurance and pharmaceuticals, a U.S.
official said.  Insurers are interested in expanding into Turkey, while U.S.
drugmakers could funnel as much as $1 billion annually in
research and development investments to the country, Assistant
Secretary of State Jose Fernandez said in an interview in Ankara
today. Fernandez, who is in charge of economic and business
affairs, spent yesterday in talks with Turkish officials.  Among the barriers to investment are high registration fees
for insurance companies and a lengthy application process to get
good-manufacturing-practice certificates for new drugs to enter
the market, he said.  Turkey needs investment to finance a  current account
deficit  of $75.3 billion or about 10 percent of  gross domestic
product , close to a record high. Boosting U.S. investment in
Turkey will also encourage trade between the countries,
Fernandez said. While Turkish trade with the world’s biggest
economy rose 28 percent last year, it accounted for just 5.5
percent of Turkey’s $376 billion total.  Fernandez said yesterday’s talks also addressed Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s ambition to turn Istanbul into a
financial hub. He said the U.S. will send experts to advise on
how the Turkish  tax code  can be tweaked to entice foreign
investment firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
