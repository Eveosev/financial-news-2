Mexican bonds linked to inflation
rallied on speculation increases in consumer prices will resume
after they dropped in April less than forecast.  Yields on the inflation-linked bonds due in December 2013,
known as Udibonos, fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 1.08 percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.13 centavo to
103.90 centavos per peso.  “If you need to own them at any point in time and you see
this point of inflation as the down point of the cycle, you need
to step in,” Alex Silva, a  fund manager  who oversees $800
million of assets at Silva Capital Management, including peso
bonds, said in a telephone interview from  Chicago .  Mexico’s peso dropped to the lowest level against the
dollar since January as political wrangling in  Greece  encouraged
investors to take refuge in the world’s main reserve currency.  The inflation-linked bonds rose after the  government  said
today that consumer prices fell 0.31 percent in April, compared
with a drop of 0.34 percent that was the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 18 analysts. Consumer prices rose at a
3.41 percent annual rate last month after a 3.73 percent pace of
increases in the previous month.  Consumer prices will rise 3.93 percent over the next 12
months according to the median forecast of 21 analysts in a
survey by Citigroup’s Banamex unit released May 7.  The inflation-linked bonds briefly slumped after the
announcement showed annual consumer price increases slowed for a
third month after touching a one-year high in January.  Peso Bonds  The yield on  Mexico ’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.26 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.46
centavos to 132.47 centavos per peso.  Investors sold the peso on speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis
will drag on global growth. Greece’s political turmoil looked
set to enter a fourth day with coalition talks deadlocked.  The currency slipped 1 percent to 13.4993 per dollar after
touching 13.5711, the weakest level since Jan. 17. The peso has
slid 4.2 percent over the past week, the most among the 16 most-
traded peers tracked by Bloomberg, paring its rally this year to
3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
