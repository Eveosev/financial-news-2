Gasoline fluctuated as a fire shut a
crude unit at  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) ’s Philadelphia refinery and after an
industry-funded report yesterday that U.S. crude supplies
climbed to the highest level since 1990.  Futures swung between gains and losses as crude in New York
slid a sixth straight day after the  American Petroleum Institute 
reported oil stockpiles rose 7.78 million barrels last week.
Gasoline’s premium over crude widened as Sunoco was in the
process of shutting the Philadelphia plant’s 200,000-barrel-a-
day crude unit No. 137, a person with knowledge of the situation
said.  “If the crude unit goes down, Sunoco has to go out and
purchase other feedstocks and intermediates in order to make
gasoline.” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston. “The API showed a very huge build in crude
oil.”  Gasoline for June delivery rose 0.26 cent to $2.997 a
gallon at 9:52 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices
fluctuated between $2.9823 and $3.0189.  June gasoline’s premium to crude oil, or the crack spread,
widened $1.06 to $29.82 a barrel. The June contract’s premium to
July futures widened to 6.54 cents a gallon from 5.5 cents
yesterday, indicating a concern that supplies may tighten.  The API reported that gasoline inventories fell 4.96
million barrels last week.  “The huge build in crude and a very large decline in
gasoline stocks contributed to the rally in gas cracks,” Lipow
said.  Sunoco Fire  The fire at the Sunoco refinery started at about 6:30 a.m.
and was extinguished by 6:50 a.m., Thomas Golembeski, a
Philadelphia-based spokesman for the company, said in a
telephone interview.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .  June-delivery heating oil declined 1.46 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.9755 a gallon.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.3
cents to $3.75 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. Prices are
down 18.6 cents since reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
