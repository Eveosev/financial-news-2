Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s Tarceva lung-
cancer medicine won the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency
after presenting data comparing the drug with  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s
Iressa, which is already recommended.  Tarceva is a cost-effective option for patients with
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose
disease has a certain gene mutation, the London-based  National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence , known as NICE,
said today in a statement. The Basel, Switzerland-based company
agreed to give the state-run National Health Service a discount,
and the amount is confidential.  NICE said in February asked Roche for information comparing
Tarceva, which without a discount costs 1,631.53 pounds
($2,629.86) for a 30-day supply of tablets, with Iressa. Iressa
won NICE’s  recommendation  for the same group of  lung-cancer 
patients in 2010, and London-based AstraZeneca also offers the
NHS a discount on the drug.  NICE advises the NHS on which treatments represent value
for money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
