The ringgit fell for a fifth straight
day ahead of data that economists forecast will show  Malaysia ’s
expansion is weakening.  Exports rose 3 percent in March after expanding 14.5
percent in February, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey before government figures due today.
Industrial production growth slowed to 3.3 percent in March from
7.5 percent, a separate poll showed before a report tomorrow.
Greece’s politicians struggled to form a new government, adding
to concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.  “We expect these March export and production numbers to
reflect the weakening in advanced economies,” said Yeah Kim
Leng, chief economist at RAM Holdings Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “We
will likely see greater headwinds from the negative impact of
elections in Europe and that could cast negative sentiment over
Asian currencies.”  The ringgit declined 0.2 percent to 3.0619 per dollar as of
8:35 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, held at 6 percent.  Government bonds  were little changed yesterday. The yield
on the 3.314 percent notes due October 2017 held at 3.31
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
