Westinghouse Solar Inc. (WEST) , a U.S. solar
company, fell the most in more than four months after agreeing
to be acquired by the Australian developer  CBD Energy Ltd. (CBD)   Westinghouse dropped 18 percent to 33 cents at the close in
New York, the biggest decline since Dec. 27. The company has a
market value of $5.5 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Westinghouse investors will receive 3.7 CBD shares for each
common share of the Campbell, California-based solar company
they own, according to a statement today. Preferred shareholders
will receive preferred CBD shares that may be converted to
common stock.  CBD, based in Double Bay, New South Wales, is seeking
access to the U.S. solar market. The company initially announced
its plans to buy Westinghouse in February.  Fully converted, Westinghouse shareholders will own about
15 percent of the combined company when the sale is completed in
the third quarter.  Westinghouse Chief Financial Officer Margaret Randazzo will
become interim chief executive officer of the combined company.
Barry Cinnamon, founder and CEO of Westinghouse, plans to leave
the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
