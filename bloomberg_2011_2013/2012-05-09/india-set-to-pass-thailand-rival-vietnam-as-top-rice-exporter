India , the largest rice grower after
 China , is poised to rival Vietnam as the world’s biggest
shipper, ending Thailand’s 30-year reign, after favorable
weather and higher government prices boosted the harvest to a
record.  Exports may climb to 7 million metric tons in the year
ending Aug. 31, said Samarendu Mohanty, a senior economist at
the International Rice Research Institute. That’s more than
double the 2.8 million tons shipped in 2010-2011, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Vietnam will export 7
million tons and Thailand 6.5 million tons, USDA data show.  Rice, the staple for half the world, has slumped 18 percent
since reaching the highest price since 2008 in September after
India ended a three-year ban on exports of non-basmati
varieties. Prices will probably stay under pressure in coming
months as global production outpaces demand for an eighth year.
That may extend a decline in global  food  costs, which fell for
the first time this year in April, United Nations data show.
 Thailand  was the top shipper last year with 10.6 million tons.  “There is a possibility of India emerging as the largest
exporter,” Mohanty said in a phone interview from  Manila . A
good harvest will allow the country to continue exports next
year, said Vijay Setia, president of the All India Rice
Exporters’ Association. The next crop may be even higher as
yields are increasing, he said.  Rough-rice futures for July dropped 0.2 percent to $15.27
per 100 pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade at 5:01 Singapore
time. Futures reached $18.54 in September.  Record Output  The harvest in India may climb 7.7 percent to 103.4 million
tons from 96 million tons a year earlier, according to the farm
ministry. State reserves of rice and wheat jumped 20 percent to
71.12 million tons as of May 1, said the Food Corp. of India.
The minimum purchase price of the common variety of raw rice was
increased to an all-time high of 1,080 rupees ($20) per 100
kilograms (220 pounds) in June from 1,000 rupees.  Exports of non-basmati varieties exceeded 4 million tons
since the ban was scrapped, according to government data. Indian
shipments this year will represent 21 percent of global trade
estimated at 33.9 million tons by the USDA.  Global paddy production in 2012 is expected to increase 1.7
percent to 732.3 million tons, equivalent to 488.2 million tons
of milled rice, exceeding consumption at 477 million tons and
boosting inventories, the Rome-based Food & Agriculture
Organization said May 4 in its first forecast for 2012-2013.  While the USDA predicts  Vietnam  will ship 7 million tons
this year, the country’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development on May 2 forecast exports of 5.42 million tons, 11
percent below its previous estimate.  Competitive Prices  Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s attempts to boost
farmer incomes through state purchases since taking power in
August has slowed exports and created opportunities for India,
said Mohanty. Indian rice is about $100 cheaper than supplies
from Thailand, which is paying above market rates to farmers, he
said. The Southeast Asian nation has bought 8 million tons from
growers so far, he said.  The free-on-board price of 25 percent broken long-grain
white rice in Thailand costs as much as $520 a ton compared with
$385 a ton in India, said Setia from the exporters’ association.
“We are very competitive compared with Thailand because of a
large surplus and a weaker rupee.”  The  Indian rupee  has weakened about 5.6 percent against the
dollar this quarter, making it the worst performing Asian
currency. The  Thai baht  has dropped 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
