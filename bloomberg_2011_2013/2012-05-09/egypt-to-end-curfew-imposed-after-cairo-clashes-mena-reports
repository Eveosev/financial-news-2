Egypt â€™s ruling military council will
not extend a nightly curfew in a Cairo neighborhood that was the
scene of deadly clashes last week, the state-run Middle East
News Agency said today, citing an unidentified armed forces
official.  The curfew, in effect for the past five nights, was imposed
after protesters calling for an end to military rule in the
country clashed with military police as they tried to advance on
the  Defense Ministry . One soldier was killed and almost 300
people wounded in the fighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
