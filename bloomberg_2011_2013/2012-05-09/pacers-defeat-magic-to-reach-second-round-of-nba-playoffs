The  Indiana Pacers  became the first
Eastern Conference team to reach the second round of the
National Basketball Association playoffs. Atlanta, Chicago and
Denver all won to force Game 6 in their first-round series.  The Hawks won 87-86 at home against the Boston Celtics, who
lead their best-of-seven series by three games to two. Game 6
will be tomorrow night in Boston.  The Bulls also remained alive, winning 77-69 against the
visiting Philadelphia 76ers, who lead 3-2 in the series and will
host Game 6 tomorrow.  The Nuggets overcame 43 points by Kobe Bryant and defeated
the Lakers 102-99 in Los Angeles. Game 6 is tomorrow in Denver,
which trails 3-2.  The  New York  Knicks will try to avoid elimination for the
second straight game tonight when they play at the  Miami Heat 
trailing 3-1 in their series. The Los Angeles Clippers will seek
to finish off the host Memphis Grizzlies, who trail 3-1 in that
series.  The Pacers beat the Orlando Magic 105-87 to join the San
Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder of the Western
Conference in advancing to the second round. The Pacers opened
the fourth period with a 20-9 run and went on to wrap up their
first-round series by four games to one.  Danny Granger scored 25 points for the Pacers last night at
Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.  Jameer Nelson  had 27
points for the Magic, who were missing center Dwight Howard
throughout the series following lower back surgery. Howard has
not played since April 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
