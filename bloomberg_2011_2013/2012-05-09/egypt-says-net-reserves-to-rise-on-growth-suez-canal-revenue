Egypt’s prime minister said he expects
net international reserves to climb in coming months on the back
of rebounding economic activity and tourism.  Kamal El Ganzouri said the gains reflect improved security
in the country. Revenue from the  Suez Canal  will also increase,
he said in an interview today after a Cabinet meeting.  Egypt’s net international reserves climbed by about $100
million in April to $15.2 billion, the first increase since the
removal from power of  Hosni Mubarak  last year. Reserves remain
more than 50 percent below levels at the end of December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
