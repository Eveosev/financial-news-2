The bonds of Caisse Centrale du Credit
Immobilier de  France , the residential mortgage lender, slumped
in the over-the-counter market after the securities were
suspended at Euronext Paris and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.  CCCIF’s 850 million euros ($1.1 billion) of 3.75 percent
bonds due 2015 fell 4.61 cents on the euro to 96.42, Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices show. The yield relative to the benchmark
swap rate jumped to a four-month high of 428 basis points from
241 yesterday.  Yields on the Paris-based lender’s debt jumped after the
securities were suspended on Euronext Paris at the request of
France’s financial markets regulator on May 8 “pending a press
release and until a new notice,” according to a NYSE Euronext
statement e-mailed by the Autorite des Marches Financiers.
Luxembourg’s financial supervisor  also  requested the suspension
of trading of the lender’s bonds.  The regulators also suspended trading in the securities of
CCCIF’s covered bond issuer CIF Euromortgage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
