Take-home pay growth at Britainâ€™s
largest publicly traded companies accelerated in April, VocaLink
Ltd. said.  Incomes after tax and other deductions climbed 1.8 percent
in the three months through April from a year earlier, compared
with 1.7 percent in the first quarter, the group said in a
statement in  London  today. Wage growth at manufacturers
accelerated to 3.9 percent from 3.7 percent.  Pay increases for public employees slipped to 1 percent
from 1.9 percent.  VocaLink, which processes 90 percent of British salaries
paid directly to bank accounts, uses salary-payment data from
more than 200 members of the FTSE 350 Index and more than 600
government-related organizations for the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
