New Enterprise Associates, the biggest
venture capital investor in  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , plans to raise $2.6
billion for its new fund, the largest raising of its kind in
more than 10 years.  New Enterprise Associates 14 LP already has raised $2.1
billion, the investor said in a  filing  today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. NEA, which has offices in
Menlo Park, California, and Chevy Chase, Maryland, increased the
new fund’s target size from $2.3 billion in March.  NEA was a  winner  among U.S. venture firms in last year’s
market for initial public offerings, thanks to a 14 percent
stake in Groupon, the daily-deal site, and a 15 percent holding
in flash-memory technology provider  Fusion-io Inc. (FIO)  The company’s
total ownership in those companies is worth about $1.2 billion.  Raising $2.6 billion would give NEA the largest venture
fund since at least 2001, said John Taylor, a researcher at the
National Venture Capital Association. NEA raising a large fund
signals they have satisfied investors in the past, he said.  “While the industry is said to be contracting, it really
is becoming a concentration at this point with large, successful
firms becoming larger,” Taylor said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
