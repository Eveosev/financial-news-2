Colombia ’s peso fell to its lowest
level in four weeks as Greek politicians struggled to form a new
government, adding to concern  Europe ’s fiscal turmoil is
deepening and damping demand for emerging-market assets.  The peso depreciated 0.1 percent to 1,767.65 per U.S.
dollar today after touching 1,782.63, the weakest since April
12. The drop pared the peso’s rally this year to 9.7 percent,
the best performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Renewed concern over Greece is driving a flight to
quality,” causing declines in Latin American currencies
including the Colombian peso, said  Camilo Perez , the head
analyst at Banco de Bogota, the nation’s second-biggest bank.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in July 2024 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 7.09 percent, according to the central bank. The price
fell 0.448 centavo to 123.21 centavos per peso.  Colombia sold its new peso bond due May 2022 to yield 7.03
percent at a government auction today, the  Finance Ministry 
said.  Colombia yesterday  announced  it will issue the 7 percent
fixed-rate bond in the three government debt auctions scheduled
for this month, including today’s, in offerings of 400 billion
pesos ($225 million) each. Investor demand in today’s auction
totaled 787 billion pesos.  “Increased issuance in the long end of the bond curve”
and reduced appetite for risk are helping drive declines in the
peso bonds due in July 2024, said Perez.  Global stocks dropped as Greece’s Syriza party squared off
with political leaders before talks on forming a coalition,
handing them an ultimatum to renounce support for the European
Union-led rescue if they want to enter the government. The
stand-off since the inconclusive weekend election has reignited
concern over  Greece ’s ability to comply with the terms of its
two bailouts negotiated since May 2010.  Stocks trimmed losses after a report that Europe’s bailout
fund will pay the next installment of aid to Greece, easing
concern that the nation won’t qualify for rescue funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
