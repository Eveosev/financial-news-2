FedEx Corp. (FDX)  agreed to sell the
Japanese operations of its Office unit, the retail business
formerly known as Kinko’s, to  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (4902)   The deal consists of 61 printing centers in  Japan , Jess Bunn, a FedEx spokesman, said today in a telephone interview
without giving a price. Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported
earlier that Tokyo-based Konica would pay 8 billion yen ($100.5
million).  FedEx, the second-largest U.S. package-delivery company,
stopped using the Kinko’s name and rebranded the division as
FedEx Office in 2008. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx acquired
Kinko’s Inc. in 2004 for $2.4 billion, adding storefront
businesses selling office products and printing services.  Dropping the FedEx Kinko’s brand had a quarterly cost of
$891 million to write down the value of that acquisition, the
company said in 2008. A year later, FedEx reported $885 million
in costs in its fiscal fourth quarter to write down the value of
Kinko’s and the 2006 purchase of Watkins Motor Line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
