European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said officials have “no
intention” to change  interest rates  any time soon.  With the key rate at 1 percent, it’s “the lowest we’ve
ever had and there is no intention to change this in the near
future,” Nowotny said at an event in Vienna tonight.  Nowotny, who heads the Central Bank of  Austria , said the
central bank’s “hotly disputed” government bond purchase
program is “limited” and that the ECB’s longer-term
refinancing operations are the “main” unconventional tool.  Regarding the “specific problem in  Greece ,” where voters
flocked to anti-bailout parties at May 6 elections, Nowotny said
that aid programs “can only work if there is cooperation with
the country concerned.”  “You cannot help someone who is not prepared to do his
homework,” Nowotny said. “This will be a decision for the
Greek population, for the Greek political parties, but I think
it is very obvious that this is not a one-sided affair.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
