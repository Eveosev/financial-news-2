Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , bolstering its expansion
into  Latin America , forged a licensing agreement to bring News
Corp.’s Twentieth Century Fox television shows and movies to
customers in Brazil and other parts of the region.  The multiyear deal will let Netflix users stream shows such
as “Glee,” “24,” “Prison Break” and “The X-Files” online
starting July 15, the Los Gatos, California-based company said
today in a statement. The agreement also includes films such as
“Wall Street” and “Office Space.” Terms weren’t disclosed.  Netflix, seeking to maintain growth after a price increase
angered U.S. customers, pushed into Latin America in September.
Since then, the company has more than doubled the number of
movies and TV shows available in the region over its streaming
Internet service.  Netflix rose 2.1 percent to $74.35 at the close in  New
York .  The shares  have climbed 7.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
