Merck KGaA (MRK) ’s Erbitux showed no benefit
in patients with stage-three  colon cancer  when given with
standard chemotherapy after their tumors were removed, compared
with chemotherapy alone, according to a study.  Patients in the clinical trial who were treated with
Erbitux and Folfox 4, a standard chemotherapy, showed no
improvement in their disease compared with those who took the
same chemotherapy treatment, the Darmstadt, Germany-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “We are disappointed not to see an improvement in disease-
free survival after 3.3 years of median follow-up,” Julien
Taieb, the lead investigator, said in the statement.
“Unfortunately, since the introduction of Folfox as standard
treatment, all attempts to further improve prevention of disease
recurrence have proved unsuccessful.”  The late-stage, European trial with 2,559 patients was
sponsored by the Federation Francophone de Cancerologie
Digestive, or FFCD, of Dijon,  France . The goal of the study was
to kill any cancer cells remaining after tumors were removed.
Patients were given the therapy over a six-month period and
followed up after a median time of 3.3 years.  Merck shares fell as much as 4 percent in  Frankfurt , and
were trading down 0.7 percent at 79.36 euros at 9:50 a.m.,
giving the company a market value of 17.3 billion euros ($22.4
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
