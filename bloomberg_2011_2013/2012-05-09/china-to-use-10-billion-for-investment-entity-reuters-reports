China ’s central bank plans to provide
$10 billion for a new entity that will help state-owned
companies make investments abroad, Reuters reported, citing four
unidentified people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The People’s Bank of China is in discussions with China
Reform Holdings Corp., a government entity controlled by the
State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, to
set up a joint venture, the news service said today on its
website.  China has accumulated $3.3 trillion in foreign-exchange
reserves, the most in the world, boosted by trade gains. The
second-largest economy has pledged to invest in  Europe ’s bailout
funds and sustain holdings of euro assets.  China Investment Corp., the nation’s sovereign wealth fund,
received $30 billion of capital from the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange by the end of last year, Executive Vice
President  Jesse Wang  said in March.  Chairman  Lou Jiwei  said earlier this year the sovereign
fund had received additional capital after having invested
almost all its cash in 2010. CIC was set up in 2007 with $200
billion from the Ministry of Finance. It had $410 billion of
assets at the end of 2010.  The central bank’s press office didn’t pick up phone calls
placed by Bloomberg News outside of regular business hours.  --Scott Lanman. With assistance from Zheng Lifei in Beijing.
