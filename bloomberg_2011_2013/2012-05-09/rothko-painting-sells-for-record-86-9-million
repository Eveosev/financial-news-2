Mark Rothko ’s fiery “Orange, Red,
Yellow” sold for a record $86.9 million at Christie’s in New
York last night in the biggest-ever postwar and contemporary art
auction.  Artist records were also set for  Jackson Pollock ,  Gerhard Richter , Barnett Newman,  Alexander Calder  and Yves Klein, among
others, in last night’s $388.5 million, 59-lot sale. It exceeded
Christie’s $384.7 million tally in May 2007, the previous
contemporary auction champ, as well as the high $330 million
presale estimate.  “Billionaires have gone global,” New York dealer Jack
Tilton said upon exiting the midtown salesroom. “It’s very
healthy for the market, obviously.”  The 8-by-7-foot Rothko surged past its $45 million presale
high estimate amid multiple telephone bids. Christie’s said it
was the highest price for a contemporary artwork, displacing an
$86.3 million  Francis Bacon  at Sotheby’s in May 2008.  Last night’s 1961 Rothko was one of 13 artworks from the
estate of David Pincus, the retired chairman of apparel
manufacturer Pincus Brothers-Maxwell, who died in December. It
was on loan to the  Philadelphia Museum of Art , where Pincus was
a trustee. Pincus and his wife, Gerry, bought it from  New York ’s
 Marlborough Gallery  in 1967.  Another Pincus trophy, Pollock’s canvas “No. 28,”
sold for $23 million, almost doubling the previous Pollock
record of $11.7 million, set in 2004. Newman’s 1952 painting
“Onement V” went for $22.5 million, surpassing the high
estimate of $15 million and the artist’s record of $5.2 million.  The Pincus 13 totaled $174.9 million.  Feeling Comfortable  “The art market is ignoring European woes,” said Randy
Slifka, a New York collector and money manager. “People feel
comfortable buying prime works by world-class artists.”  Richter’s 1993 painting “Abstraktes Bild” went for $21.8
million, besting the previous record by $1 million set six
months earlier at Sotheby’s. All six Richters offered last night
sold.  Klein’s 1962 fire-color painting “FC 1” soared to $36.5
million, surpassing the artist’s previous auction record of
$23.6 million, set at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in May 2008.  Estimated between $30 million and $40 million, the
painting’s sale was guaranteed by a third party. A portion of
the proceeds will be donated to  Oceana , an international
organization focused on ocean conservation.  Christie’s charges buyers 25 percent of the hammer price up
to $50,000, plus 20 percent from $50,000 to $1 million, and 12
percent above $1 million. Presale estimates don’t include the
buyer’s premium.  Calder ‘Lily’  Calder was another star of the evening. His standing mobile
“Lily of Force” (1945) sold for $18.6 million, topping the
Calder record by $8.2 million -- set minutes earlier in the
sale.  The first Calder to set a record, “Snow Flurry,” came
from the collection of the late architect and industrial
designer Eliot Noyes. It features white metal disks on thin
wires, and was bought by Xin Li, Christie’s vice president and
Asian business development director, who typically bids for
Chinese clients.  The last lot of the sale, Warhol’s “Reel Basquiat”
(1984), was purchased by Russian real-estate tycoon Vladislav Doronin, chairman of Moscow-based  Capital Group , seated next to
Warhol collector  Peter Brant . The work fetched $3.3 million,
above its high estimate.  “I’ve never seen people wanting to shop so badly,” said
Christophe van de Weghe, an Upper East Side art dealer. “People
didn’t want to be under-bidders. They wanted to win.”  Today’s Muse highlights include: Martin Gayford on  London
art , Ryan Sutton on  food .  To contact the reporters of this story:
