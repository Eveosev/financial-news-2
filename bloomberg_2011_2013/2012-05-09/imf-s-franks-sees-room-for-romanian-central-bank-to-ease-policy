Romania ’s central bank may have room
to ease monetary policy this year as inflation will probably
stay within the targeted band, said  Jeffrey Franks , the
International Monetary Fund’s mission chief to the country.  “There may be a small additional space for monetary
easing, but not much,” Franks said in an interview in Bucharest
today.  The Balkan country’s  Finance Ministry  will continue
borrowing money from domestic and international markets “on an
opportunistic basis” under a 7 billion-euro ($9.1 billion)
medium-term note program, Franks said.  Romania should wait with a plan to sell stakes in energy
companies as it will slow the sales timetable already agreed
with the IMF and the European Union under a 5 billion-euro
precautionary loan agreement, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
