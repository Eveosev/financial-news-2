World Trade Organization Director-
General Pascal Lamy called for a shift to growth in the euro
area and deeper integration to combat the region’s debt crisis,
Agence France-Presse reported, citing an opinion piece.  “In the months and years to come, the countries of the
euro zone are facing a major political and social crisis if they
do not go through an additional step in integration,” Lamy and
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development head Jacques Attali wrote in the article published yesterday on the website
of French newspaper Le Monde, according to AFP.  The  news agency  described both men as “closely linked with
France’s Socialists,” whose candidate Francois Hollande
defeated  Nicolas Sarkozy  on May 6 to become France’s president
and who has called for  Europe  to refocus on growth rather than
austerity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
