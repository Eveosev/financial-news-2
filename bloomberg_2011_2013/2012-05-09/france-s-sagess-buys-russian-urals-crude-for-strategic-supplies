France  bought 115,000 cubic meters, or
723,350 barrels, of Russian Urals crude via a tender to meet its
strategic supply requirements through July 1, the manager of the
country’s stockpiles said.  Societe Anonyme de Gestion de Stocks de Securite, or
Sagess, awarded the tender on May 5 for delivery to the northern
French port of  Le Havre  on May 10 to May 30, Jean-Marc Tenneson,
executive officer of Comite Professionnel des Stocks
Strategiques Petroliers, the body which controls Sagess, said
today by phone from Paris. He declined to reveal the supplier.  The country is obliged to store 17.8 million metric tons of
crude and oil products as of July 1 and the CPSSP was
responsible for 13.1 million tons of this, Tenneson said on
April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
