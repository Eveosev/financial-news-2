Jerry McMorris, who was part of the
 Colorado Rockies ’ ownership group that brought  Major League
Baseball  to Denver, died yesterday following a lengthy illness,
the team said. He was 71.  McMorris put together the partnership that purchased a
controlling interest in the Rockies in 1992 after the original
ownership group fell apart because of legal issues. He was
chairman and chief executive of the franchise until 2001 and
remained a member of the Rockies’ ownership until 2005.  “Without the efforts of Jerry, there may have never been
Major League Baseball in Denver,” Rockies owner Dick Monfort
said in a statement.  McMorris oversaw the opening of Coors Field in Denver and
also helped bring baseball back from the players’ strike that
canceled the 1994  World Series , as one of the lead negotiators
for owners in contract talks.  “Jerry quickly established himself as a leader within our
industry, playing a key role on a number of our committees and
serving not only the Rockies franchise but all of Major League
Baseball very well,” Commissioner Bud Selig said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
