Google Inc.’s $25,000 fine from the
Federal Communications Commission for impeding an investigation
of improper data gathering was less than a tap on the wrist for
a company worth $111 billion, U.S. Senator  Richard Durbin  said.  “How are you protecting our privacy with a $25,000 fine?”
the Illinois Democrat asked FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski  at a
hearing today in  Washington  on the agency’s budget.  The FCC found Google delayed its inquiry into whether
Street View, which sends cars equipped with Wi-Fi gear to
photograph buildings and homes in neighborhoods, collected
personal information including passwords and e-mail as it
scanned home networks.  Mountain View , California-based Google
said it acted in good faith and agreed to pay the FCC’s penalty
to conclude the inquiry.  The fine was consistent with precedent, Genachowski said.  “Clearly for the company compared to its revenue and
market cap, it’s a small amount,” Genachowski said. “On the
other hand, the educational purposes have been served by this --
educating them and other companies, educating Congress,
educating consumers.”  The FCC couldn’t find that Google violated the law because
the captured wireless data was unencrypted, Genachowski said.  “I find it hard to believe that encryption is the
threshold,” Durbin said. “How in the world would the average
person know that? Or be able to protect themselves?  ‘‘If it requires a change of the law I’d like to consider
that,’’ said Durbin, the Senate’s second-ranking Democrat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
