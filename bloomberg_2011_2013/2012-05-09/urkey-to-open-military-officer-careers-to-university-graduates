Turkey  is revising military
recruitment regulations, paving the way for civilians to become
officers and easing rules for mandatory service.  The proposed changes would allow men and women with
university degrees to apply and become commissioned officers, a
status currently reserved solely for military academy graduates,
according to a draft law summary by the state-run Anatolia news
agency. The officer candidates would be subject to military
training and a one-year trial period.  Turkey will also defer the military service of people in
higher education until age 29 as long as they are enrolled in an
institution, domestically or abroad. Citizens will have the
option of delaying enrollment in the military for as long as two
years if they complete university. The enlistment age is 18.  The parliament in Ankara is also proposing that the state-
run network of family doctors across the country conduct the
health examination of draftees and reserves. Currently military
doctors and select state hospitals are allowed to carry out
medical reviews.  To contact the reporters on this story:
