Oil options volatility fell on
speculation that underlying futures may find support today at
the lowest settlement since Feb. 2.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.45 percent at 4:25 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 28.17 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for June delivery declined 20 cents to settle at
$96.81 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices have dropped 8.8 percent in
six days, the longest losing streak since July 2010.  The contract dropped below the 200-day moving average in
intraday trading, touching $95.17 before rebounding to close 52
cents above the average. The contract last settled below the
technical level in December. Buy and sell orders tend to be
clustered near chart-support levels.  “It look like futures finally found a bottom, and that
kind of calmed the market a little,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $95 puts, which were up 1 cent to 97 cents a barrel at
4:30 p.m. with 4,555 lots trading. June $90 puts were the
second-most active options with 2,871 lots changing hands as
they fell 2 cents to 14 cents.  Puts Trading  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume.
