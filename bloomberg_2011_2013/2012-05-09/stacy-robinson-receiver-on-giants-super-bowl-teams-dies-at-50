Stacy Robinson, a wide receiver on the
 New York Giants ’ first two Super Bowl-winning teams, died
yesterday at the age of 50.  Robinson, who worked for the National Football League
Players Association following his playing career, was diagnosed
in 2009 with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood. He entered
 hospice care  on May 3, his family said in a  statement .  “He was a good man who was loved and respected by his
teammates and everyone in this organization,” Giants co-owner
John Mara said in an e-mailed statement. His work on behalf of
the Players Association was of great benefit to many players. He
will be missed.”  Robinson most recently was the NFLPA’s director of player
services & development, a position in which he helped players
prepare for life in and after professional football.  Robinson was taken by the Giants in the second round of the
1985  NFL draft  out of North Dakota State and spent his entire
six-year career with the organization.  He appeared in 43 games with the Giants, catching 48 passes
for 749 yards and seven touchdowns. When the Giants won their
first Super Bowl title after the 1986 season, Robinson caught
 three passes  for a team-high 62 yards in the 39-20 championship-
game win over the Denver Broncos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
