Luxembourg & Dayan gallery’s four
floors are filled with theatrical canvases that amuse and
intrigue in the show “Domenico Gnoli: Paintings 1964-1969.”  Gnoli’s large works, realized with acrylic and sand, show
bright, hyper-real details of everyday objects such as hairdos,
clothes and furniture.  “My themes are derived from current events, from familiar
situations, from daily life; because I never actively intervene
against the object, I can feel the magic of its presence,”
wrote Gnoli (1933-70).  There is magic here in the familiar. Wandering through the
show feels like being in a fairy world where everything you
encounter, from gray-striped trousers to a red dress collar, is
beautifully untouched.  “Due Dormienti” resists recognition up close. It’s only
as you move away that a patterned burgundy canvas reveals two
sleepers covered by a quilt, their presence marked by leg
outlines.  Do visit the “Monster Drawings” on the fourth floor,
temporary home to a winged rhino, a snail on a sofa and an owl
in a cupboard.  The works aren’t for sale. The most recent painting by the
artist sold at auction went for $3.7 million at Christie’s in
 London  last October.  The show is at 64 E. 77th St. through June 30. Information:

from the Sonnabend collection.  Created between 1956 and 1975, many of the works haven’t
been displayed publicly before and will return to storage after
the show, according to the gallery.  One of the first in  Europe  to acquire Twombly’s works,
Ileana Sonnabend “had the eye,” the artist once said. He died
last year.  For the rectangular 1956 “Untitled ( New York City ),” the
earliest piece on view, Twombly scribbled on the white-oil-paint
background at different levels, before the tint dried, and then
with wax crayon and pencil.  In “Untitled” (1975), he used a vivid green for part of
his scrawls, along with gray and black.  “Cy Twombly: Works from the Sonnabend Collection” is up
through May 19 at 23 E. 67th St. Information: +1-212-772-9425;

Mnuchin of L&M Arts. Galleries presenting art that can’t be
bought, but might enhance the prestige of the presenter, are
getting to be rather fashionable.  With loans from major institutions such as the Whitney
Museum of American Art and the San Francisco Museum of  Modern
Art , the show presents eight black paintings from 1958-1959,
three aluminums from 1960 and five coppers from 1960-1962.  Not fully black, aluminum or copper, the paintings are
covered with differently shaped lines, making each one singular.
One of the included pieces, the black “Bethlehem’s Hospital,”
fetched $4.4 million at Christie’s in New York in May 2003.  A precursor to minimalism, Stella created the works when he
was in his 20s, shortly after graduating from  Princeton
University . The three series were “involved with the problem of
establishing a painterly identity -- what it is to be a painter
and make paintings -- and with the subjective, emotional
responses to that situation,” Stella said, quoted in a catalog
essay.  “Frank Stella: Black, Aluminum, Copper Paintings” is at
45 E. 78th St. through June 2. Information: +1-212-861-0020;
