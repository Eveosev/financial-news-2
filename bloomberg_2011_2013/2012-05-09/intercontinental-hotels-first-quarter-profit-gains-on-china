InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG) , the
world’s largest provider of hotel rooms, reported a 5.4 percent
increase in first-quarter earnings, helped by increased revenue
per room in China and the U.S.  Operating profit rose to $118 million, the Denham, England-
based company said in a statement today. That beat the $114.4
million average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales climbed 3.3 percent to $409 million compared with a $407.3
million average estimate of 10 analysts.  InterContinental is benefiting from rising demand in
 emerging markets  such as the greater China region, which
accounts for about 13 percent of group revenue. Global revenue
per available room gained 7 percent in the quarter amid a
recovery in business and leisure travel. The company said it is
“confident” it will gain market share this year after revenue
per room increased 6.1 percent in April.  “Broadly the momentum is continuing in April,” Chief
Executive Officer Richard Solomons said on a conference call.  InterContinental Hotels  fell 0.1 percent to 1,464 pence at
8:49 a.m. in London trading. The shares have risen about 27
percent this year.  Revenue per room in the Greater China region climbed about
12 percent during the quarter, while sales in that market gained
10 percent to $54 million. The  company  says the region accounts
for about 30 percent of its global pipeline for expansion over
the next three to five years. The company currently has 174,554
rooms in its pipeline.  Intercontinental Hotels said it is “encouraged” by talks
with another company over the planned sale of its  New York 
Barclay site. The discussions are “exclusive” and there is
“no pressing need” to sell.  The impact of the Olympics being held in  London  this year
will be “broadly neutral,” Intercontinental Hotels said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
