The cost of insuring against a Spanish
default surged to a record on concern a bailout of  Bankia SA (BKIA) ,
the nation’s third-biggest lender, won’t fend off a banking
crisis triggered by bad real estate loans.  “While there is no danger of an imminent collapse at
Bankia, there is a risk that it becomes a zombie bank, which has
to rely on the  European Central Bank  to fund it over the long
term,” said Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho International
Plc in London.  There is growing speculation  Spain  may become the fourth
European nation to seek a rescue as its lenders become
overwhelmed by 184 billion euros ($239 billion) of what the
nation’s central bank terms “problematic” assets linked to
property. Of the 38 billion euros of real estate the Bankia
group held at the end of 2011, about half was classed as either
“doubtful” or at risk of becoming so, according to the
lender’s annual report.  Credit-default swaps insuring Spanish government debt rose
18.5 basis points to 517.25 basis points a 12:55 p.m. in London,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Spanish 10-year
 government bonds  extended a decline, pushing the yield on the
securities above 6 percent for the first time since April 27.
The yield climbed 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage points, to
6.02 percent.  Swaps on Valencia-based Bankia climbed nine basis points to
721 while contracts on  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , the largest Spanish
lender, increased 15.5 basis points to 411 and  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , the second biggest, was up 19 basis
points to 446.  Bad Loans  Bad loans as a percentage of total lending in the Spanish
banking industry hit 8.16 percent in February, the highest level
in 18 years, according to Bank of Spain data. Bankia Chairman
 Rodrigo Rato  said May 7 he was resigning as head of the banking
group to be replaced by BBVA’s former second-in-command, Jose
Ignacio Goirigolzarri, as the government weighs a second bailout
of the lender with the biggest Spanish asset base.  The Bankia group, formed in 2010 from a merger of seven
savings banks led by  Caja Madrid  and Valencia-based Bancaja,
last year listed its banking business on the stock exchange
after parking its worst real estate assets in the parent
company.  European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said today he
has “full confidence” in Spain to implement economic reforms
and that the government in Madrid has not requested financial
aid.  Sovereign Index  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments jumped 7.5 basis points to
282.5. A basis point on a swap protecting 10 million euros of
debt from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a
year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Contracts insuring Italy’s debt rose 18 basis points to
463, the highest since April 23, while contracts on  France 
increased 7.5 basis points to 211. Belgian swaps climbed eight
basis points to 252 and  Germany  jumped five basis points to
90.5, the highest since Jan. 30.  The cost of insuring corporate debt also climbed with
contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbing 21.5 basis points
to 698.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings increased six basis points to 156.75
basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers was up 13 basis points at 268 and the
subordinated index was 19 higher at 429.  To contact the reporter on this story:
