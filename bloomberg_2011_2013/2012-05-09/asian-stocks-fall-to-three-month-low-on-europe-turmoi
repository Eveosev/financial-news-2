Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional benchmark index falling to its lowest level in more

of its sales from Europe, dropped 2.3 percent in  Tokyo . Qantas

 Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the

going to be and the effect this is going to have elsewhere.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slipped 1.2 percent to 119.93

form a coalition following weekend elections, passing the
opportunity to Alexis Tsipras’s Syriza party. Tsipras said he
plans to form a government of left-wing parties that would
nationalize banks, repeal recent labor reforms and cancel the
bailout accords.  Mitsubishi Motors fell 2.3 percent to 85 yen in Tokyo.

biggest market, slid 2.8 percent to HK$14.02 in  Hong Kong .

Germany, lost 1.4 percent to HK$72.45.  Australia Budget  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.9 percent after

by four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Of the 466 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that

through yesterday, compared with a 8.4 percent gain by the  S&P
