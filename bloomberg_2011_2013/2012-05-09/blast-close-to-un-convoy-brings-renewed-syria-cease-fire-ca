A bomb exploded close to  United
Nations  truce observers as they entered a town in southern
 Syria , the organization said today.  The blast occurred “in the vicinity” of UN personnel
approaching Daraa, according to an e-mailed statement from Ahmad Fawzi, a Geneva-based spokesman for the world body. An
unspecified number of Syrian troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were wounded.  “All forms of violence must stop,” Norwegian Major
General Robert Mood, leader of the UN mission in Syria, said,
according to the statement. Mood cited the blast as an example
of what the Syrian people are “suffering on a daily basis.”  There are 59 observers to monitor a cease-fire brokered by
 Kofi Annan , the UN and the  Arab League ’s joint special envoy to
Syria. The UN Security Council authorized sending as many as 300
monitors to Syria, where Assad’s crackdown of dissent has
claimed more than 9,000 lives over the past 14 months.  Last week, the UN had recruited only about half the number
of observers required from member states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
