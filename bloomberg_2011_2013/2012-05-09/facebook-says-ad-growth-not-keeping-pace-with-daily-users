Facebook Inc. (FB) , the social networking
service that is preparing for an initial public offering, said
gains in daily users outpaced advertising growth in the second
quarter as more members accessed the site from mobile devices.  Facebook, which announced plans to sell mobile ads in
February, also saw advertising growth lag behind usage in the
first quarter, according to a regulatory  filing  today. The
company cited fewer ads on some pages, after saying it wouldnâ€™t
sacrifice user experience for short-term sales growth.  The social network, which uses its growing user base to woo
advertisers, plans to raise as much as $11.8 billion in an IPO
that could value the company at $96 billion. Facebook has more
than 900 million monthly users and had 526 million daily active
users on average in March, up 41 percent from the year ago
period.  Facebook is offering 337.4 million shares at $28 to $35
each, and is scheduled to price the offering on May 17, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  First-quarter sales climbed 45 percent to $1.06 billion, a
decrease from 55 percent in the December period. Profit fell 12
percent to $205 million as sales growth slowed and marketing
costs more than doubled, the  Menlo Park , California-based
company said in a filing last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
