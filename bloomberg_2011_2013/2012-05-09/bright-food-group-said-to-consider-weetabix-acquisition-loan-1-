Bright Food Group Co., a Chinese food
company, is in talks with banks for a possible loan to back a
purchase of a stake in Weetabix Ltd., according to two people
familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because
the details are private.  The provider of agriculture products including dairy cows
and pigs is seeking as many as four banks to arrange the
facility, which may be about $1 billion, the people said. Final
details of the loan have not been determined, they said.  “Bright Food has been raising capital by selling
commercial paper in recent years,” Pan Jianjun, Bright Food’s
Shanghai-based spokesman, said by telephone today. “We won’t
rule out borrowing from commercial banks this time,” though no
arrangement has been made yet, he said.  The company agreed to buy a 60 percent stake in British
cereal maker Weetabix from private equity firm  Lion Capital LLP ,
according to a statement e-mailed on May 3. Bright Food said
that Weetabix is valued at 1.2 billion pounds ($1.93 billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
