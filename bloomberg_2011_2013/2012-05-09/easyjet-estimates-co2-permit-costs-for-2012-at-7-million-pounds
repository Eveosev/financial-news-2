EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest
discount airline, estimates its costs of complying with the
European Union’s emissions trading system for the 12 months
through December to be about 7 million pounds ($11 million).  “We have completed forward purchase of permits that cover
our expected remaining requirement for calendar year 2012,” the
company said in its half-yearly financial report published
today. The airline received 74 percent of the permits it needs
for the year for free, according to the report.  Airlines whose aircraft land and depart within the EU were
included in the bloc’s cap-and-trade program this year. They
must purchase permits in order to cover emissions over their
allowance they are given for free.  To contact the reporter on this story:
