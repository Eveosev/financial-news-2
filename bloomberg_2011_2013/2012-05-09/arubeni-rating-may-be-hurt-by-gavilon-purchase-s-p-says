Marubeni Corp. (8002) ,  Japan ’s largest grain
trader, may have its credit ratings adversely affected if it
carries out a reported plan to acquire U.S. grain handler
Gavilon Group LLC,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  An acquisition of Gavilon, which has a lower credit rating,
would “weaken the balance between Marubeni’s risk volume and
capital,” S&P said today in a statement. Marubeni says it
hasn’t decided whether to pursue the purchase, according to the
statement.  The company has a BBB rating for Marubeni, the second-
lowest investment grade, with a stable outlook. Gavilon has a BB
rating with a stable outlook.  Marubeni is in exclusive talks to buy closely held Gavilon
for about $5 billion, including debt, a person familiar with the
situation said yesterday. A deal may be announced in the next
several days, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private.  To contact the reporters on this story:
