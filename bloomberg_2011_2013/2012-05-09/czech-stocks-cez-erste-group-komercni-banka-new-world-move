The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell 2.5 percent to 893.1 koruna at the close in Prague, the
fifth day of losses and the biggest drop in three months.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest utility, fell 1.4
percent to 710 koruna, its lowest since November. The company
may lose as much as 10 billion koruna ($515 million) in three
years on its investment in Albania’s power-distribution company,
Lidove Noviny newspaper reported, citing CEZ’s annual report.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , a unit of Societe Generale SA,
slumped 2.9 percent to 3,236 koruna, a four-month low. Austria’s
 Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   retreated 4.5 percent, the most in
more than a month, to 401 koruna. Lenders were among the biggest
decliners in  Europe  as a political impasse in  Greece  boosted
concern the euro area’s financial crisis will deepen.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, tumbled 6.3 percent to 113.4 koruna, its biggest
drop since September 2011 and the lowest close since July 2009.
