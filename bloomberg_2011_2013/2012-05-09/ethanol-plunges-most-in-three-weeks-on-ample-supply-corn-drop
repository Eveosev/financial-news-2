Ethanol futures plunged the most in
almost three weeks after a report showed higher inventories than
a year ago and as corn fell.  Futures sank after the Energy Department said stockpiles
were 21.4 million barrels last week, 4.6 percent more than a
year earlier. Corn, the primary feedstock used to make the
biofuel, dropped on speculation that drier weather in the U.S.
Midwest will help speed planting.  “There’s still no shortage of supply out there and we have
to whittle through,” said  Ian Jackson , a trader at SCB &
Associates in Chicago. “Corn sort of fell over.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery tumbled 3.7 cents, or
1.7 percent, to settle at $2.169 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the lowest price since April 26 and the steepest drop
since April 17. Ethanol has fallen 1.5 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  dropped 3.5
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.23 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive lost 4 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.20, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago declined 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$2.145 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 0.5 cent
to $2.34.  Corn for July delivery plunged 15.75 cents, or 2.5 percent,
to $6.0725 a bushel in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
