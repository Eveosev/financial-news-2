Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s Swiss private bank
reported a second consecutive annual loss last year as fee and
commission income declined.  The loss widened to 30.8 million Swiss francs ($33.3
million) from 13.2 million francs in 2010, the Geneva-based firm
said in its annual report.  Barclays is spending 350 million pounds ($564 million) over
five years on staff and infrastructure at its global  wealth-
management  business in a bid to compete with the world’s biggest
private banks. The result was “in line” with plans to focus on
investing in the business, the Swiss wealth unit said.  Administered assets increased 2 percent to 10.4 billion
francs as of Dec. 31 with customers adding 77,000 francs of net
new money over the year, Barclays said in the annual report.
Geneva staff help oversee almost 18 billion francs, including
some assets outside  Switzerland  that aren’t mentioned in the
report for accounting reasons.  Stripping out the cost of the investment program,
Barclays’s Swiss unit posted a full-year loss of 8 million
francs, according to the annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
