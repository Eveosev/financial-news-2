Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras failed to
find coalition partners in his attempt to form a government and
will hand back the mandate to President Karolos Papoulias
tomorrow, an official with the party told reporters in Athens
today.  Insistence by Pasok and  New Democracy , two of the three
biggest parties in the parliament, on sticking to the terms of
an international bailout makes it impossible for Syriza to
govern with them, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
