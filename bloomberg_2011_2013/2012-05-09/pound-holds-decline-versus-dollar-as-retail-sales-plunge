The pound fell the most in three weeks
against the dollar after a report showed  retail sales  slumped in
April, fueling speculation the central bank will consider more
stimulus measures at its policy meeting this week.  Sterling dropped for a second day versus the greenback as
eight of the 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the
Monetary Policy Committee will increase the size of its asset-
purchase program at its two-day gathering starting today. Ten-
year gilt yields fell to a record as a stalemate in  Greece 
following elections on the weekend boosted demand at an auction
of U.K. 30-year bonds.  “This morning’s retail sales data was soft,” said  Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London. “It’s still
unlikely” the Bank of England will increase asset purchases
this month “but it’s more likely than it was two or three weeks
ago as we’ve seen a moderation in economic data.”  The pound declined 0.3 percent to $1.6114 at 4:22 p.m.
 London  time after falling as much as 0.6 percent, the biggest
drop since April 13. Sterling strengthened 0.2 percent to 80.35
pence per euro, after reaching 80.24 pence, the strongest level
since November 2008.  Sales at U.K. stores open at least 12 months, measured by
value, declined 3.3 percent in April from a year earlier, the
biggest monthly drop since March 2011, the London-based  British
Retail Consortium  said in an e-mailed report.  Double Dip  With Britain suffering its first  double-dip  recession since
1975, the central bank will decide tomorrow whether to add more
stimulus to its existing 325 billion pounds of bond purchases.
Officials have to balance the need to bolster the economy with
the threat of inflation, which has been above their 2 percent
target for more than two years.  All 61 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predict the
 Bank of England  will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent.  Sterling has appreciated 4.6 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 2.5 percent, and the euro fell 0.5 percent.  Ten-year gilts advanced for a second day as Greek
politicians struggled to form a new government, increasing
concern the nation will withdraw from the common-currency bloc.  Gilts also rallied after the Debt Management Office sold 2
billion pounds of 30-year bonds at an average yield of 3.224
percent, down from 3.431 percent at a prior auction on March 15.  Investors bid for 2.22 times the amount of debt allotted,
up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.71 in March.  Record Low  The  10-year gilt  yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.91 percent after reaching 1.881 percent,
the lowest since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1989. The
4 percent bond due March 2022 rose 0.295, or 2.95 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 118.675.  The two-year gilt  yield  has dropped below its 100-day
moving average at 0.413 percent and may now head toward
resistance at the April 10 low at 0.357 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Resistance refers to an area on a price chart where
analysts expect orders to sell a security to be grouped.  The two-year yield declined one basis point to 0.4 percent.
The 100-day moving average is at 0.41 percent.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 0.1 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S.
Treasuries rose 0.6 percent and German bunds gained 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
