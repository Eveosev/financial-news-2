Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s largest
lender, doubled its sales this year of bonds that convert into
shares when a company’s stock plunges.  The bank has issued 1,224 reverse convertibles since the
start of the year, compared with 510 in the same period for
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that excludes U.S.
sales.  Most of the Frankfurt-based bank’s notes were linked to the
shares of Germany’s biggest companies, including  Siemens AG (SIE) ,
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. (BMW)   Buyers of reverse convertibles get their money back in full
at maturity if the shares of the reference company are above a
preset level on a specified date or during the life of the
security. If the stock is below the barrier, investors get
shares in the company instead of cash.  Deutsche Bank sold 100 million euros ($130 million) of 5
percent 10-month securities tied to  BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s largest
chemical maker, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The barrier for
the notes is 58 euros, or 0.5 percent below the current price of
58.32 euros at 12 p.m. in Frankfurt. The valuation date is March
26, 2013.  Deutsche Bank spokesman Nick Bone in London declined to
comment on the lender’s reverse convertibles sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
