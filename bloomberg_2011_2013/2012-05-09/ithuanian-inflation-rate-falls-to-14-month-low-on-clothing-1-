Lithuanian  inflation  slowed in April
to the lowest rate in 14 months as clothing prices and
communications costs fell.  Consumer prices rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.6 percent increase in March, the  statistics
office , based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The median estimate of four economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for a 3.1 percent advance. Prices rose 0.6 percent
from the previous month.  Inflation is decelerating, helping shore up domestic
consumption and economic expansion, which slowed to a
preliminary 3.9 percent from a year earlier in the first
quarter.  Lithuania  needs price growth to ease to qualify for
planned euro adoption in 2014.  “We expect inflation to continue moderating over the next
few months as food and energy inflation continues to ease, and
price pressure from the fragile domestic economy remains
moderate,”  Annika Lindblad , an analyst at  Nordea Markets  in
Helsinki, wrote in a research note. Lindblad predicts inflation
will average 3.4 percent this year, which may “be too high to
fulfill the Maastricht criteria.”  The yield on Lithuania’s 2022 dollar bond fell 0.07
percentage point to 4.89 percent, the lowest since March 13.  Clothing and shoe prices fell 0.5 percent from a year
earlier in April, while communications costs eased 1.9 percent,
the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
