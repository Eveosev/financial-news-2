Mozambique  President Armando Guebuza
said the government is working with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  on
plans for liquefied natural-gas developments in the east African
country.  Shell made a $1.8 billion bid for  Cove Energy Plc (COV)  last
month. Cove’s main asset is an 8.5 interest in a block off
Mozambique’s coast with as much as 30 trillion cubic feet of the
fuel, enough to justify an LNG plant for shipments to across the
Indian Ocean to Asian markets.  When asked how the country will develop the country’s gas
resources, Guebuza said, “We’re working with Shell on that
specific problem. We’re pleased with what’s happening.”  Shell raised its bid on April 24 to match a rival offer
from Thailand’s  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl. (PTTEP)  The board of
Cove has agreed to the Shell bid. Guebuza’s government told Cove
that it will face a 12.8 percent tax on capital gains from a
potential sale.  Shell said today that it received the consent of
Mozambique’s Minister of Natural Resources for the acquisition.  Speaking at an event at Chatham House, Guebuza said that
the development of the country’s coal and gas resources needed
to benefit Mozambique’s citizens. The country emerged from civil
war in 1992 and more than half the population lives in poverty,
according to the Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook.  “International partners are welcome to join us in this
journey so we can one day celebrate the end of poverty,” he
said. “Our vision is to turn our  mineral resources  into a
driving force for social transformation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
