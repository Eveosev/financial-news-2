Transnet SOC Ltd.’s 300 billion-rand
($37.9 billion) planned spending on infrastructure over the next
seven years won’t cover all the projects it would like to
undertake, Business Day reported, citing Anoj Singh, acting
chief financial officer of the state-owned ports and freight-
rail utility.  The planned spending excludes an estimated 50 billion rand
required to develop a second dug-out port in Durban in the
country’s KwaZulu-Natal province and 10 billion rand to expand
and develop internal terminal hubs, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper cited Singh as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
