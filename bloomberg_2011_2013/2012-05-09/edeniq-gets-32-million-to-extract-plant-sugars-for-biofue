EdeniQ Inc., a closely held
biotechnology company, received $32 million to make systems that
break down plants into sugars for processing into fuels and
chemicals.  The funding includes $23 million in equity as part of the
company’s Series B and C financing rounds and $9 million in
debt, Chief Executive Officer Brian Thome said today in a
telephone interview.  EdeniQ, based in Visalia,  California , will use part of the
funding to install equipment at ethanol plants, Thome said. The
financing will fund research and may support a “commercial
scale-up development with a partner” that’s expected to be
announced later this month, he said.  The company plans to sell its technology to producers of
so-called cellulosic biofuels, which are made from non-food
sources, Thome said. Edeniq’s pilot plant, partially funded by a
U.S. Energy Department grant in 2009, is testing its process for
making cellulosic ethanol from crop wastes like corn stalks and
cobs, energy crops such as switchgrass and woody biomass, he
said.  Comerica Inc. (CMA)  and Atel Ventures Inc. provided the debt
facility, EdeniQ said today in a statement. Existing backers
including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Draper Fisher
Jurvetson, Cyrus Capital Partners LP and Westly Group led the
equity investment, along with Flint Hills Resources LLC, a unit
of Koch Industries Inc., a new investor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
