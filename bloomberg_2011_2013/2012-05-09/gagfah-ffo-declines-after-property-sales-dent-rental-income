Gagfah SA (GFJ) , the biggest residential
landlord in Germany, said first-quarter funds from operations
fell after the company raised less money from property sales.  FFO declined to 26.4 million euros ($34 million), or 13
cents a share, from 54.1 million euros, or 24 cents, a year
earlier, the Luxembourg-based company said in a statement after
the market closed yesterday. Gagfah wonâ€™t pay a dividend for the
quarter.  Gagfah, controlled by  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , sold
about 4,800 apartments in Berlin to GSW Immobilien, another
German real estate manager, in November. The company plans to
sell as many as 38,000 apartments, about a quarter of its
holdings, two people with knowledge of the matter said May 3.
The homes are valued at about 1.8 billion euros.  First-quarter net income declined to 11.2 million euros, or
5 cents a share, from 24 million euros, or 11 cents, a year
earlier. Rental income dropped to 198.9 million euros from 209.4
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
