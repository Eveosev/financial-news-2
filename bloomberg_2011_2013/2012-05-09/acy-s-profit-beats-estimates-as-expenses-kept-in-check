Macy’s Inc. (M) , the owner of its namesake
and Bloomingdale’s department stores, fell the most in more than
eight months after keeping its forecast for profit this year
lower than analysts’ estimates.  The shares dropped 5.8 percent to $37.21 at 9:36 a.m. in
 New York  and earlier slid as much as 6.3 percent for the biggest
intraday decline since Aug. 18. Macy’s had climbed 23 percent
this year before today.  Profit this year will be $3.25 to $3.30 a share,
Cincinnati-based Macy’s said in a statement today, repeating a
forecast from February. Analysts  projected  $3.39, the average of
17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The forecast was unchanged after first-quarter profit
topped analysts’ estimates. Net income in the three months ended
April 28 rose 38 percent to $181 million, or 43 cents a share,
from $131 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Analysts
projected 40 cents, the average of 16  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  “They didn’t raise the annual guidance,”  Liz Dunn , an
analyst with Macquarie Group in New York, said in a telephone
interview today. “For me, it is just too early in the year to
do that, but the market seems like it is primed for any
disappointment on stocks that have had nice moves.”  Revenue climbed 4.3 percent to $6.14 billion in the first
quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year also advanced 4.4
percent, including a 34 percent jump in online sales.  Same-store sales will increase about 3.7 percent this year,
faster than a previous forecast for a 3.5 percent gain, Macy’s
said.  Marketing Spending  Chief Executive Officer  Terry Lundgren  has worked to keep
marketing spending little changed to keep expenses shrinking as
a percentage of revenue. The company’s “My Macy’s” program of
better tailoring merchandise to local tastes has helped boost
sales from its stable base of more than 800 locations.  Selling, general and administrative expenses shrank to 32.4
percent of sales from 33.5 percent. Dunn estimated 32.5 percent.
The costs rose 1.1 percent in dollar terms to $2 billion, or at
about a quarter of the pace of the revenue gain.  Dunn rates the shares outperform, the equivalent of a buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
