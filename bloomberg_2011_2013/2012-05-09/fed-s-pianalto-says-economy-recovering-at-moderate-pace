President  Sandra Pianalto  said the  U.S. economy  is recovering at
a “moderate” pace and that she expects growth of about 2.5
percent this year.  “We need more growth in order for more jobs to be created
and for that unemployment rate to come down to the 6 percent
rate which I view as maximum employment,” Pianalto, a voting
member of the  Federal Open Market Committee  this year, said
today in response to an audience question at Women Leading
Kentucky’s Business & Leadership Conference in Lexington.  In prepared remarks, Pianalto told women leaders that
taking risks is essential to career advancement, a lesson she
learned in being appointed to lead the  regional bank  in 2003 and
as a child when her family moved to the U.S. from  Italy .
Pianalto said she was “shocked” to be nominated for the post
over more senior managers, and that she learned the biggest
rewards come from stepping out of one’s comfort zone.  “Embrace those opportunities that come your way, whether
you feel ready or not,” she said. “Raise your hand for those
tough assignments. Get the job then figure out how to do it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
