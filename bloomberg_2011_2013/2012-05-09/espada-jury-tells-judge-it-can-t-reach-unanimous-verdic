The jury weighing criminal charges
against Pedro Espada Jr., the former Democratic majority leader
of the  New York  state Senate, told the judge that it couldn’t
reach a verdict.  The federal jury today sent a note to U.S. District Judge
Frederic Block in  Brooklyn , New York, saying they couldn’t come
to a unanimous decision after eight days of deliberations. The
judge told the jury to continue its deliberations.  U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in Brooklyn charged Espada, 58,
and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, of stealing more than
$500,000 from Soundview Healthcare Center, which the former
senator started in 1978 and which gets more than $1 million a
year in federal funding.  The Espadas were charged in December 2010 when the elder
Espada was still in the Senate. He had been defeated that
September in the Democratic primary for his Bronx seat. The
Espadas engaged in several illegal schemes from January 2005 to
February 2010, prosecutors said.  The Espadas were tried on eight counts. Five charged them
with stealing from Soundview, one count for each year from 2005
through 2009. They were also charged with conspiring to steal
from Soundview, to defraud the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and
to commit  wire fraud .  Each substantive count carries a maximum sentence of 10
years in prison. The conspiracy counts carry a maximum of five
years each.  The case is U.S. v. Espada, 10-cr-985, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
