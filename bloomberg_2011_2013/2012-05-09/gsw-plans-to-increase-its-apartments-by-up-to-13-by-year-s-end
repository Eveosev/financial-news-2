GSW Immobilien AG (GIB) , the German
residential landlord that first sold shares to the public last
year, will increase the number of homes it owns by as much as 13
percent this year to take advantage of rising rents in Berlin,
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Zinnoecker said.  GSW will buy as many as 7,000 homes, raising the total to
60,000, Zinnoecker said in an interview at the company’s
headquarters in the German capital. GSW purchased about 5,000
homes last year and plans to own 70,000 in the “medium term.”  “We won’t buy at any price, but there are some good
opportunities, especially for portfolios valued at more than 60
million euros,” Zinnoecker said.  Properties offered by companies that bought near the
market’s peak six years ago and need to generate cash are
particularly attractive, Zinnoecker said. GSW raised 190 million
euros in a secondary share sale last week and plans to use the
money for acquisitions. All of the company’s 53,000 apartments,
valued at about 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion), are in Berlin.  Residential rents in the city climbed 7.7 percent last
year, according to an index compiled by  Immobilien Scout,  an
online property broker. Berlin rents are still lower than those
in most large German cities and, according to Zinnoecker, will
be lifted by an improving jobs market and a scarcity of new
homes. Prices will also increase further, he said.  GSW shares have gained 27 percent since the company’s
initial public offering in April 2011, raising its market value
to 1.3 billion euros. The CDAX Performance Index declined 7.4
percent during that time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
