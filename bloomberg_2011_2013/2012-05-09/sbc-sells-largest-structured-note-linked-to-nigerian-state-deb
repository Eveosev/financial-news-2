HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  sold two structured
notes tied to Nigerian government debt, including the largest
credit-linked note referencing  Africa ’s most populous nation
since at least 1999.  The two 10-month securities, one for $33.5 million and the
other for $7.69 million, are tied to naira-denominated Nigerian
treasury bills due March 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The zero-coupon notes were issued at a 12.4 percent
discount to face value.  Banks have sold 108 credit linked-notes tied to  Nigeria 
sovereign debt since 1999, the earliest Bloomberg has data for.
Citigroup Inc. and Standard Chartered Plc are the only other
banks to issue notes tied to Africa’s biggest oil producer this
year, offering a total $51.8 million of the securities.  The largest notes tied to Nigerian sovereign debt prior to
HSBC’s note were two $25 million securities sold by Citigroup
and UBS AG in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks sold $15.5 billion of credit-linked notes this year
outside the U.S., data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Investors use credit-linked notes rather than underlying
bonds to enhance yields or get tailored maturities that may not
be available in the  bond market . Holders of the notes suffer
losses if either the bank that sold the note or the entity that
the note is tied to defaults.  Shani Halstead, an HSBC spokeswoman in  London , didn’t
comment on the structured notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
