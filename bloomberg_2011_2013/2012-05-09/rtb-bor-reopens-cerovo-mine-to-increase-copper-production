RTB Bor,  Serbia â€™s sole copper
producer, reopened an open-pit mine as part of efforts to
increase output this year by 50 percent.  The Cerovo mine will provide 2.5 million tons of ore a year
and with an average copper content of 0.35 percent, may produce
some 9,000 tons of the metal, said spokeswoman Gorica Toncev-
Vasilic in a phone interview from Bor, eastern Serbia.  This should help the state-run miner and smelter reach its
target of 45,000 tons of copper this year, she said. Cerovo,
abandoned in 2002 due to lack of funds when copper prices were a
fifth of their current level, was reopened with an 18 million
euros ($23 million) investment by RTB Bor, she said.  Cerovo deposits are seen at 150 million tons and mining
will rise to 5.5 million tons of copper ore a year in 2015 after
an upgrade of processing facilities and pit expansion, said the
company on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
