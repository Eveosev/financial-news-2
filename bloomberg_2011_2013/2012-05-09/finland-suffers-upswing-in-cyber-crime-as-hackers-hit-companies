Finnish companies are facing an
upsurge in cyber crime, with more than one in ten big companies
attacked by hackers, according to a study.  About 11 percent of the country’s large companies had
network security breaches over the past three years, compared
with 1 percent in 2008, the country’s Chamber of Commerce in
Helsinki said in a report published today. The report was based
on surveys of 1,681 corporate managers.  “The growth in information system crimes is absolutely
staggering,” Marko Silen, who heads the legal affairs unit at
the Helsinki Region Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
“It’s also worrying that fewer than half of companies have
guidelines regarding  trade secrets .”  Growth in cyber crime is a global trend as more people sign
up to online banking and use mobile devices to connect to
corporate networks. Personal information of more than 16,000
Finns was leaked on the Internet in November, sparking a probe
by the National Bureau of Investigation.  Citigroup Inc. and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation Network were
among hackers’ targets last year and more than 40 percent of
executive managers at  Finland ’s 500 biggest companies expect
cyber crime threats to increase in the next 12 months, according
to a survey commissioned by computer security software developer
Stonesoft last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
