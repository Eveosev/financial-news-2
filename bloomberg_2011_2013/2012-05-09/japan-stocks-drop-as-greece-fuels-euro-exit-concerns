     May 9 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index closing at a three-month low, as Greek political tension
fueled concern the debt-stricken nation will be the first to
exit the euro, dimming the earnings outlook for exporters.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) , an automaker that gets 27 percent
of its sales from  Europe , dropped 2.3 percent. NTT Data Corp.
slumped 12 percent after the network service provider forecast
net income that missed analyst estimates. Seasonings maker
Ajinomoto Co. jumped 7.4 percent after announcing a plan to buy
back shares.  The Topix declined 1.4 percent to 765.83 at 3 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
its lowest close since Feb. 3. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
dropped 1.5 percent to 9,045.06 with nine stocks falling for
each that advanced. Trading volume on the measure was 8.2
percent above the 30-day average.  “Investors are turning risk averse,” said  Soichiro Monji ,
chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which
manages the equivalent of $63 billion. “We don’t know what kind
of political coalition will be formed in  Greece . It remains
unclear if the nation will exit the euro and if that will
actually break up the euro.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The gauge declined 0.4 percent to a month low in  New York 
yesterday after Alexis Tsipiris, leader of Greece’s Syriza party,
was handed the mandate to form a new government. He has vowed to
nationalize banks and rip up the terms of the nation’s bailout,
raising doubt about the future of the monetary union.  Europe-Linked Stocks  Companies that do business in Europe fell as the euro
extended losses against the yen. Mitsubishi Motors slid 2.3
percent to 85 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31
percent of its sales in Europe, lost 1.7 percent to 3,485 yen.  Stocks also declined on negative earnings reports. NTT Data
forecast net income will rise 25 percent to 38 billion yen ($476
million) in the year ending March 2013, missing analysts’
estimate of a 47.3 billion yen gain. The stock fell 12 percent
to 242,400 yen.  Namco Bandai Holdings Inc., an operator of arcades and
theme parks, slid 2.7 percent to 1,028 yen after it projected a
9.3 percent drop in profit for the year ending March 31.  Among stocks that rose, Ajinomoto advanced 7.4 percent to
1,120 yen, the biggest rise on the Nikkei 225. The company said
it will spend as much as 50 billion yen to buy back up to 7.4
percent of its outstanding shares through Jan. 21. It also
forecast net income will rise 5.4 percent to 44 billion yen.  Stocks on the Topix were valued at 0.93 times book value,
compared with 2.17 for the S&P 500 and 1.38 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. A value less than one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 3.9 percent to 20.59,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.9 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
