Barloworld Ltd. (BAW) , the world’s biggest
forklift trader, dropped the most in three years on speculation
that a 75 percent jump in fiscal first-half profit doesn’t
justify a rally in the stock this year.  Shares of Johannesburg-based Barloworld fell 8 percent to
close at 87.50 rand in the city, the biggest one-day fall since
Feb. 27, 2009. Before today, the shares had gained 26 percent
this year compared with a 4 percent increase in the 162-member
 FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index. (JALSH)   Earnings before one-time items rose 65 percent to 75
percent in the six months through March, Barloworld said in a
statement today. Earnings a share increased 15 percent to 25
percent, lower than profit before items because of exceptional
gains in the prior year, the company said.  “The shares have run hard,” Rhynhardt Roodt, an analyst
at Cape Town-based Investec Asset Management, which manages more
than $90 billion, said by phone. Comments from BHP Billiton Ltd.
and Rio Tinto Plc that they may defer capital expenditure on
their mines could also be hurting the stock. “People were
certainly hoping for a higher number.”  While all operating units at Barloworld improved on their
results from the prior period, the company incurred further
reorganization costs at its Iberian unit, where “trading
conditions remain very weak,” it said.  To contact the reporters on this story: Stephen Gunnion at +27-
