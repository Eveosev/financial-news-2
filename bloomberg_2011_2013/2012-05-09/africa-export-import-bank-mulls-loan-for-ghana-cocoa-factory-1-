African Export-Import Bank, a lender
promoting trade among African nations, is in talks with a
Ghanaian company for a $54 million loan to build a plant to
process cocoa beans for export, said President Jean-Louis Ekra.  Afreximbank has already agreed to provide a five-year, $40
million facility to upgrade two cocoa processing factories in
southwestern  Ivory Coast  near the country’s second-largest port
of San Pedro, Ekra also said in an interview today in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, at the  World Economic Forum  on  Africa .  The loans are part of the Cairo-based lender’s plan to help
cocoa-producing western African states increase shipments of
processed cocoa beans, instead of exporting the commodity in raw
form, to increase revenue and create jobs, Ekra said.  “Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon produce more
than 70 percent of the world’s cocoa,” he said. “Because they
produce it they deserve to have a larger part of the value-
addition revenue than what they now have.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
