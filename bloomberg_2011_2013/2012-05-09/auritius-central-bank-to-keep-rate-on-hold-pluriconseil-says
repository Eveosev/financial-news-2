The Bank of Mauritius’s Monetary
Policy Committee will probably leave the benchmark interest rate
unchanged at its June 11 meeting, according to a PluriConseil
survey.  Out of 30 analysts, 22 expect the rate to be maintained,
the consultancy and advisory firm said in a survey published in
the Port Louis-based l’Express newspaper today, with seven
forecasting a cut and one an increase.  The bank has cut the repo rate by 0.6 percentage point
since December to 4.9 percent.  Editors:  Ben Holland ,  Francis Harris .  To contact the reporter on this story:
