Spanish stocks declined to the lowest
level in more than eight years amid concern the Mediterranean
nation may have to seek a financial rescue and Greece may leave
the euro currency union.  Bankia (BKIA)  SA led a selloff in banking shares as the country’s
10-year bond yield climbed above 6 percent.  Mapfre SA (MAP)  retreated
6.3 percent after reporting a 13 percent drop in first-quarter
net income.  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , a property developer, slumped
to the lowest price since at least October 1989.  The  IBEX 35 Index (IBEX)  dropped 2.8 percent to 6,812.7 in Madrid,
its lowest since Oct. 2, 2003. The benchmark gauge has plunged 
20 percent this year , the worst performance of 18 western
European markets. The volume of shares changing hands on IBEX 35
companies was 44 percent higher than the average in the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  “Investors worry about what will happen next, to the euro
and to  Spain ,” said John Plassard, director at Louis Capital
Markets SA in Geneva. “This should lead to increased market
volatility over the coming weeks. Spain, as the icing on the
cake, adds to concern with some voices fearing another revision
of its deficit targets this year.”  The IBEX 35 dropped 0.8 percent yesterday after Antonis Samaras, the leader of  Greece ’s biggest political party,
abandoned efforts to form a government, leaving the mandate to
pass to left-wing leader Alexis Tsipras, leader of the anti-
austerity Syriza group.  Spanish Bond Yields  The cost of insuring against a Spanish default surged to a
record on concern a bailout of Bankia, the nation’s third-
biggest lender, won’t avert a banking crisis triggered by bad
real-estate loans. Ten-year bonds fell, pushing the yield above
6 percent for the first time since April 27.  Bankia tumbled 5.8 percent to 2.13 euros, its lowest price
since it listed its shares in July. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
downgraded the Spanish lender to underweight, the equivalent of
a sell recommendation.  Meanwhile, Spain is preparing to “partially nationalize”
the parent company of the Bankia group today after European
markets close, ABC reported on its Website.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s largest lender, dropped 4.5
percent to 4.64 euros and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
retreated 4.7 percent to 5.01 euros.  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)  slid 4.7 percent to 2.15 euros
after KBW Inc. said the bank may post a 1.93 billion-euro ($2.5
billion) loss this year as a result of new real-estate
provisions required by the government.  Mapfre retreated 6.3 percent to 1.94 euros. The insurer
reported a 13 percent drop in first-quarter net income to 271.4
million euros. That still beat the average analyst estimate of
250.3 million euros in a Bloomberg survey.  Sacyr Vallehermoso slumped 5.8 percent to 1.17 euros, the
lowest price since at least October 1989, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) , Spain’s largest natural gas company,
declined 3.2 percent to 9.99 euros after Exane BNP Paribas cut
its price estimate for the stock by 15 percent to 14 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
