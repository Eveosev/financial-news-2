BlackRock Inc. said it reduced its
exposure to Brazilian equities in the last month and a half,
although the world’s largest money manager remains
“overweight” on the country.  BlackRock has lowered its relative holdings of financial
stocks and increased exposure to materials, Will Landers, who
manages $7 billion in Latin American equities at New York-based
BlackRock, said today at a conference in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
