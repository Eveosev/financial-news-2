Cooking-oil imports by  India , the
world’s biggest consumer after  China , may have surged for a
third straight month in April as crushing of the domestic crop
dropped and local prices increased.  Purchases probably gained 68 percent to 800,000 metric tons
from 475,123 tons a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of five processors and brokers surveyed by Bloomberg
News. Imports of crude and refined  palm oil  advanced to 515,000
tons from 350,469 tons, the survey showed.  The Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India  will release the data on May 14.  Rising imports may curb the 7.4 percent decline in palm oil
prices in  Kuala Lumpur  from a 13-month high in April, boosting
profits for producers including  Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  Futures have
dropped on speculation output may increase in Malaysia, the
second-largest producer after  Indonesia , while a worsening debt
crisis in  Europe  will hurt demand. Indian vegetable-oil imports,
80 percent of which constitute palm oil, climbed 67 percent to
727,706 tons in March, the association said last month.  “The crushing of soybeans has substantially decreased this
year, and there was a big margin in import of oils as domestic
prices were higher,” said Govindlal G. Patel, a managing
director at GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co. “This pace of
imports will continue for the next few months and we can see
imports of around 800,000 tons per month.”  Price Gains  Palm oil for July advanced 0.7 percent to 3,359 ringgit
($1,095) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange at 5:07 p.m.
Singapore time. Futures rose to 3,628 ringgit on April 10, the
highest price since March 2011 as drought cut soybean output in
Brazil and Argentina. Soybean oil, which competes with palm oil
for use in food and fuels, increased 1.3 percent to 53.49 cents
per pound on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Cooking-oil imports are set to increase 15 percent to as
much as 10 million tons this year as a decline in the domestic
oilseed harvest fuels demand, Anil Agrawal,  executive director 
of  Sanwaria Agro Oils Ltd. (SAO) , said on May 3. India bought 8.7
million tons in 2010-2011. Domestic oilseeds output may drop to
30.1 million tons in the year ending June 30 from 32.5 million
tons a year earlier, the farm ministry said April 23.  Buyers may boost purchases for June shipment due to the
drop in palm oil prices, Ashok Sethia, executive director at
Sethia Oils Ltd., said by phone from Kolkata. Palm oil
stockpiles in Malaysia fell 5.4 percent to 1.85 million tons in
April from a month earlier, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said in
a statement today. Output rose 5.1 percent to 1.27 million tons,
while exports were little changed at 1.33 million tons, it said.  Import Duty  “The current decline in prices helps the case for a hike
in  import taxes ,” said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer
of Mumbai-based Sunvin Group. “If prices continue to decline,
the government might think about it.”  Processors have sought an increase in the import duty to
protect domestic refiners from cheap supplies. India should
raise the duty on refined palm-oil imports to 16.5 percent from
7.5 percent, the Solvent Extractors’ Association said March 2.
The government has resisted such demands, saying that it will
fuel inflation, while a weaker rupee has made imports expensive.  “Importers may be discouraged to buy to an extent because
of a weak rupee,” said Davish Jain, managing director of
Prestige Group. The  Indian rupee  has lost 5.1 percent against
the dollar this quarter in  Asia ’s worst currency performance.  Soybean-oil  imports probably surged to 150,000 tons in
April from 31,250 tons a year earlier, while sunflower-oil
purchases may have risen to 115,000 tons from 76,400 tons, the
Bloomberg survey showed.  Edible-oil stockpiles at Indian ports were about 835,000
tons at the end of April, said Patel of GG Patel & Nikhil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
