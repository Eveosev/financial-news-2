An Egyptian court ruled that the
country’s election commission was wrong to challenge a law
barring officials from  Hosni Mubarak ’s administration from
running for the presidency.  The commission overstepped its authority by requesting a
review of the law at the constitutional court, the
administrative court in Cairo ruled late yesterday, according to
the state-run Middle East  News Agency .  The decision follows a dispute over legal decisions barring
some would-be candidates from the presidential vote, the first
since Mubarak’s ouster last year. The Muslim Brotherhood, whose
top candidate was banned from the May 23 contest, protested a
decision by the election commission to allow Mubarak’s last
prime minister, Ahmed Shafik, to enter the race, reversing an
earlier decision to disqualify him.  The Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, the largest in
parliament, has complained that the elected legislature has been
undercut by the ruling military council, its appointed
government and the election commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
