Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
fell as concern grew that Greece will be forced out of the euro,
weakening the outlook for Asian exporters to Europe.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest
consumer electronics exporter, slid 1.2 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , the
refiner known as Sinopec, may track a decline in its U.S. traded
shares as regulators cut fuel prices for the first time in seven
months. ADRs of Toyota Motor Corp., which yesterday forecast
profit will more than double this fiscal year, rose 2 percent.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 8,990 in Chicago yesterday, down from 9,040 in
Osaka,  Japan . They were bid in the pre-market at 8,990 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 0.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose
0.2 percent.  “The European crisis is going to be with us for some
time,” said Cameron Peacock, a Melbourne-based analyst at IG
Markets, a provider of trading services for stocks, bonds and
currencies. “There’s the chance of further elections in Greece
and the whole stability of Europe has been put into doubt.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The gauge slid 0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday, the
lowest level in two months. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
declined for a sixth straight day, its longest losing streak
since August.  Greek Impasse  Coalition talks in Greece have reached an impasse, raising
concern the country may not hold to the terms of its two
bailouts negotiated since May 2010. With parliament split and
policy makers in Berlin and Brussels urging Greece to stay the
course, the country at the epicenter of the debt crisis is again
facing the risk of an exit from the euro.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 5.3 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.7 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 2.1 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 12.9 for the
S&P 500 and 10.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of Chinese shares  lost
1.2 percent in New York, its weakest close since Jan. 31.
Sinopec and PetroChina Ltd., the nation’s largest oil refiners,
led declines.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum declined 0.7
percent yesterday. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
raw materials slid 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
