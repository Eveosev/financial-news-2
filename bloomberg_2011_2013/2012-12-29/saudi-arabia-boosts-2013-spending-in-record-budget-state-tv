Saudi Arabia raised its 2013
expenditure target by almost a fifth to a record 820 billion
riyals ($219 billion) as the world’s biggest oil exporter pushes
ahead with expansion plans to diversify away from oil.  The government expects 2013 revenue of 829 billion riyals,
giving it a surplus of 9 billion riyals, the Finance Ministry
said in a statement on its website today. The kingdom posted
revenue of 1.24 trillion riyals in 2012 as the price of Brent
crude held above $100 a barrel for a second year. Expenditure
came in at 853 billion riyals, exceeding the 690 billion-riyal
budget target announced a year ago, ministry data show.  King Abdullah pledged more than $500 billion on social
welfare and to build projects to ensure that the country remains
unscathed by the kind of political unrest that swept through
other Arab countries in the past two years. He is using oil
money to fight high unemployment -- about a quarter of Saudis
between 20 and 30 don’t have jobs -- and to build schools and
hospitals. The budget has more than doubled in size since 2006.  “Budget appropriations will continue to focus on
investment programs that enhance strong long-term sustainable
economic growth and employment opportunities for citizens,” the
Finance Ministry said. “The focus will be on education, health,
social services, security services, municipal services.”  Faster Growth  The nation’s $727 billion economy grew 6.8 percent in 2012,
including expansion of 7.2 percent for non-oil industries, the
Finance Ministry said. That beat the 5.6 percent median estimate
of 16 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The oil sector grew 5.5
percent, it said. Saudi Arabia, whose economy expanded 7.1
percent in 2011, derives about 90 percent of revenue from oil
sales.  Next year’s budget includes 285 billion riyals of capital
expenditures on investment projects, up 8 percent from last
year, Finance Ministry data show.  The biggest proportion of spending will go toward
education, with the allocation gaining 21 percent to 204 billion
riyals, the ministry said. This includes 3.9 billion riyals to
build 539 new schools in the country of about 28 million, the
most-populous in the Gulf Cooperation Council.  “The budget will focus very much on social infrastructure,
as well as wider physical infrastructure,”  Monica Malik , Dubai-
based chief economist of EFG-Hermes, said by phone. “A further
focus of the government is to create job opportunities for its
nationals.”  Oil Windfall  The government is spending 22 billion riyals to allow
120,000 Saudi students to pursue studies abroad under a
scholarship program, the ministry said. It’s also allocating
funds to build new technical colleges.  Saudi Arabia is able to finance its growing budget via oil
sales, which helped the nation’s central bank boost its net
foreign assets by 21 percent in the year to October to 2.35
trillion riyals. Total exports from the kingdom advanced 9
percent this year to $396 billion, about 88 percent of which was
from oil, ministry data show.  The government uses conservative crude price estimates when
planning its budget. This year it needed oil at around $75 a
barrel to break even, according to Fahad al-Turki, senior
economist at Jadwa Investment Co.  Earlier this month, Saudi Petroleum Minister  Ali al-Naimi 
said the kingdom was content with current oil prices. Brent
crude futures traded at $107 when he spoke in Doha. They
declined 0.2 percent to $110.62 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange on Dec. 28.  Hospitals, Roads  After popular uprisings toppled leaders in Tunisia, Libya
and  Egypt  in 2011 and sparked a civil war in  Syria , King
Abdullah promised to spend $130 billion on extra subsidies for
housing and benefits. The government has allocated 100 billion
riyals for the coming year on health care, including building 19
hospitals and five so-called medical cities.  The budget also sets aside 36 billion riyals for municipal
services, including new roads, bridges and public transportation
projects in Mecca and  Riyadh , the ministry said. It increased by
16 percent to 65 billion riyals projected spending on
infrastructure and transportation.  The kingdom’s public sector debt fell to 98.8 billion
riyals, or 3.6 percent of projected gross domestic product, this
year, from 135.5 billion riyals a year ago, the ministry said.  Saudi Arabia’s  stock exchange , the Arab world’s biggest,
has  advanced 7.2 percent  this year after declining 3.1 percent
in 2011. The gauge rose the most in a week today on expectations
the record budget will support economic growth.  “The market will react if there is an above-expectation
indication that money will keep flowing into the system,” Asim Bukhtiar, senior analyst at Riyad Capital, said by phone. “The
idea is about putting more disposable income with the end
consumer and giving projects to businesses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
