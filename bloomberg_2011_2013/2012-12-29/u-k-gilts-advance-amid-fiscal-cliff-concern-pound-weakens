U.K. 10-year gilts rose this week,
with yields falling the most in a month, as speculation U.S.
lawmakers will fail to reach agreement in time to avoid the so-
called fiscal cliff boosted demand for safer assets.  Ten-year bonds snapped two weeks of declines as doubt grew
whether U.S. leaders will find a way to avoid more than $600
billion in spending cuts and tax increases that will start in
January. The pound depreciated to the lowest level against the
euro in more than eight months.  “Gilts and other core-market bonds are being boosted by
uncertainty in the U.S.,” said Dagmar Dvorak, a director of
fixed-income and currencies in London at Baring Asset
Management, which oversees $50 billion. “The gain was probably
exacerbated by choppy and illiquid market conditions at the end
of the year.”  The benchmark 10-year yield dropped six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 1.82 percent as of 5 p.m. in London
yesterday, the biggest weekly decline since the period ended
Nov. 30. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 gained 0.55
from last week, or 5.50 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,616) face
amount, to 99.36.  U.S. congressional leaders met with President  Barack Obama 
yesterday and House Republicans are due to convene tomorrow as
lawmakers seek to avoid the spending cuts and tax gains.  Bond Returns  Gilts returned 3 percent this year through Dec. 27,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
4.4 percent and Treasuries earned 2.2 percent.  The pound slipped 0.4 percent this week to 81.83 pence per
euro. It dropped to 82.25 pence yesterday, the weakest level
since April 18. It was little changed at $1.6161.  If sterling closes stronger than 83.34 pence per euro on
Dec. 31, this will be the fourth year of gains, the longest
winning streak since the introduction of the single currency in
1999.  The pound has risen 1.5 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 0.6 percent and
the dollar fell 2.8 percent.  Economists predict reports next week will show improvement
in U.K. house prices and mortgage lending.  Mortgage approvals  rose to 54,000 last month from 52,982 in
October, according to a median forecast of 17 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey, before the data is released on Jan. 3.  The Nationwide Building Society will say U.K.  home prices 
fell 0.9 percent in December from a year ago, less than
November’s 1.2 percent drop, according to a separate Bloomberg
survey. The data is also due on Jan. 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
