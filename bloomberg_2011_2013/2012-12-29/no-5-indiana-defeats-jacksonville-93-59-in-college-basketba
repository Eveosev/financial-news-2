Jordan Hulls scored a season-high 20
points to lead the fifth-ranked  Indiana University  to a 93-59
college basketball victory over Jacksonville University.  The Hoosiers, winning their 10th straight game at home this
season, improved to 12-1. Jacksonville, which is 1-6 on the road,
fell to 5-8 overall.  Hulls scored 17 of his points during the first half as
 Indiana  took a 48-33 lead at halftime on their home court at
Assembly Hall in Bloomington.  “I’ve been pretty passive and they’ve been telling me to
shoot more,” Hulls told reporters. ‘Growing up I was always a
pass-first guy, but I felt good today and I felt good all this
week.”  Cody Zeller had 16 points while Victor Oladipo and Will
Sheehey each added 14 for the Hoosiers.  Dylan Fritsch had 15 points for the Dolphins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
