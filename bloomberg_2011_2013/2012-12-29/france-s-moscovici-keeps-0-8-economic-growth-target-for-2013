French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said he is maintaining an economic growth target of
0.8 percent for 2013 even after the French economy grew less
than initially reported in the third quarter.  “I have no reason to change our growth outlook,”
Moscovici said on Europe 1 radio late yesterday.  Reaching that goal will depend in part on how economic
actors react to changes in banking regulation and on other
efforts to try to halt the crisis in the euro zone, as well as
on growth in the U.S., Moscovici said.  In France, gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent in the
third quarter, half the pace estimated on Nov. 15, statistics
institute Insee said yesterday. Insee said on Dec. 20 that
France’s economy will shrink 0.2 percent this quarter and begin
a “slight” recovery in the first half of next year.  France is also maintaining its plan to shrink the  budget
deficit  to 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2013,
Moscovici said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
