The  Brooklyn  Nets, playing their
first game since their coach was fired, won 97-81 to hand the
Charlotte Bobcats a 17th straight National Basketball
Association loss.  Brook Lopez had 26 points and 11 rebounds under the
direction of P.J. Carlesimo, 63, who was named two days ago to
replace Avery Johnson. Johnson was fired when the Nets lost 10
of 13 games after starting the season 11-4.  “Your head’s spinning a little bit, you’re trying to think
of all the things that were second nature,” said Carlesimo, who
last coached his own team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, to a 1-12
start in the 2008-09 season before he was fired. “I’m old, but
hopefully I haven’t forgotten.”  Deron Williams had 19 points for the Nets (15-14), while
Joe Johnson added 16 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.  Hakim Warrick scored 13 points for the Bobcats who fell to
7-22.  Charlotte  trailed 56-38 at halftime.  Nets owner Mikhail D. Prokhorov declined to discuss his
plans for Johnson’s successor. Former Los Angeles Lakers coach
Phil Jackson is said to top the list.  “P. J., he is the head coach,” Prokhorov told reporters
last night. “I think we have a lot of trust in him. And really,
I want him to lead the team.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
