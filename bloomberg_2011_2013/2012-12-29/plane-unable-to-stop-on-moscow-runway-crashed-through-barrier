A plane landing at Moscowâ€™s Vnukovo
Airport was unable to stop on the runway and crashed through a
barrier, setting the wing on fire, Interior Ministry spokesman
Gennady Bogachyov said by telephone.  Rescue workers are trying to determine how many casualties
there may have been and how many people were on board, he said.
Preliminary findings were that only the crew was on board,
according to Bogachyov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
