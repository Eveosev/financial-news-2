Saudi Arabian shares rose the most
in a week on expectations the government’s record budget
expenditure for 2013 will support economic growth.  Samba Financial Group (SAMBA) , the kingdom’s the second-largest
publicly traded lender, rose the most since Dec. 19.  Kingdom
Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , an investment company controlled by Saudi  Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal , closed at the highest level since March
2008.  The benchmark Tadawul All Share Index gained 0.2 percent,
the most since Dec. 22, to 6,877.06 at the close in  Riyadh .  Saudi Arabia raised its expenditure target for next year by
19 percent to 820 billion riyals ($219 billion), the Finance
Ministry said in a statement. The kingdom is embarking on an
investment program valued at more than $500 billion to build
infrastructure, industry and create jobs. The Saudi index has
gained 7.2 percent this year after falling 3.1 percent in 2011.  “Although external factors might seem negative due to the
U.S. fiscal cliff, Saudis are enthusiastic about the Saudi
fiscal budget for this year which is affecting the market in a
positive manner,” said Mohammed Al-Omran, financial analyst and
president of the Gulf Center for Financial Consultancy in
Riyadh.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index dropped 1.9 percent last
week, the biggest such decline in almost two months, as
investors await the outcome of weekend budget talks by U.S.
lawmakers to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, referring to more
than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts set to take
effect in January.  Samba Financial Group, the biggest mover in terms of
percentage points on the Saudi gauge, increased 1.1 percent to
45.5 riyals. Kingdom Holding advanced 6.3 percent to 20.2
riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
