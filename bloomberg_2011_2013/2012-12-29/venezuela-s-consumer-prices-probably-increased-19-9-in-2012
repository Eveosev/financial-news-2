Consumer prices in  Venezuela  rose an
estimated 19.9 percent this year, less than the 27.6 percent
increase recorded in 2011, the central bank said, citing
preliminary figures.  Inflation slowed, in part, due to price controls enacted by
the government, according to bank President Nelson Merentes’
end-of-year  message  dated today and posted on the bank’s
website. Venezuela’s economy probably grew 5.5 percent in 2012,
the bank said Dec. 27.  Venezuela sold $40.5 billion in foreign currency through
November, up from $38.9 billion in the same period in 2011, the
report said. The central bank said it sold $7.86 billion this
year on its currency exchange known as Sitme. Imports increased
to $56.4 billion this year from $46.8 billion in 2011.  Venezuela’s current account surplus narrowed to $14.57
billion from $24.6 billion in 2011, Merentes said, according to
the report. Oil exports increased 4.7 percent to $92.2 billion.  Final economic numbers for the year are expected in January
and February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
