Australia ’s  Michael Hussey  will
retire from international cricket, playing in his final Test
against  Sri Lanka  next month.  The 37-year-old will finish Australia’s summer season, with
the Sri Lanka Test being the 79th time he’ll have appeared for
his country. He first played for the national Test side as a 30-
year-old in 2005.  “Michael has had a fine career -- he has been a great
player, a great team player and has always been a great person,
on and off the field,” Cricket Australia Chairman Wally Edwards
said in an e-mailed statement. “To debut as a Test cricketer at
30 and to go on and achieve what he has done has been absolutely
terrific.”  The left-hand batsman averaged 51.52 in his 78 Tests, and
has 19 100s, including a 115 not out against Sri Lanka earlier
this month. He debuted against West Indies in November 2005.  Hussey will continue to play for the WA Warriors and Perth
Scorchers, and review his availability for the clubs at the end
of the 2012-13 season, according to the statement from Cricket
Australia.  The retirement means Australia has lost two of its top
batsmen this month.  Ricky Ponting , the team’s record run-scorer
and former captain, retired Dec. 3 after Australia lost a
series-deciding match against South Africa by 309 runs. Ponting,
38, played in 168 Tests in a 17-year career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
