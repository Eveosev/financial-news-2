Manchester United is close to
signing Everton defender  Leighton Baines  for 15 million pounds
($24 million), seeing off interest from Chelsea and Paris Saint
Germain, the Daily Mail said.  The 28-year-old will replace left back Patrice Evra, who
may leave United, the newspaper said. Chelsea’s Ashley Cole, who
is nearing the end of his contract with the London club, is also
an option for United manager  Alex Ferguson , the Mail said.  Chelsea and PSG are interested in Baines, who has played
for England, and Arsenal sent a scout to watch the defender
during Everton’s 2-1 victory over West Ham, the Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
