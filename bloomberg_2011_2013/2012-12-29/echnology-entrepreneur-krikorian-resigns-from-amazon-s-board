Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  said Blake Krikorian
has resigned from its board effective immediately.  Krikorian, the technology entrepreneur behind the Internet
television product Slingbox, informed the online retailer he was
stepping down as director on Dec. 26 with immediate effect, the
company said in a  regulatory filing .  Krikorian, 45, who joined the board of Seattle-based Amazon
last year, is the former chairman and chief executive officer of
Sling Media Inc. The company, which was  sold  to EchoStar Corp. -
- now Dish Network Corp. -- makes the Slingbox, a device that
lets users watch their home television programming over the
Internet.  Amazon’s  Instant Video  service lets users rent or buy TV
shows and movies over the Internet, and watch them on mobile
devices or their televisions. Krikorian -- who is also the
founder of home automation technology startup Id8 Group
Productions Inc. -- departed Sling Media in 2009. His
resignation brings Amazon’s current  board  to nine members.  Craig Berman, a spokesman for Amazon, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  Shares of Amazon fell 1.3 percent to $245.18 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 42 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
