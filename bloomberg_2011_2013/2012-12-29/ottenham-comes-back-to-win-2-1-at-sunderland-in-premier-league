Tottenham got two second-half goals
to come back to win 2-1 at Sunderland to move into third place
in English soccer’s Premier League.  The hosts led 1-0 after 40 minutes when captain John O’Shea
scored. Tottenham got back into the match when Carlos Cuellar
headed in an own goal in the 48th minute, and Aaron Lennon
scored three minutes later.  The three points put Spurs in third place with 36 points, a
point ahead of Chelsea, which has played two fewer games. The
European champions play at Everton tomorrow.  League leader Manchester United is hosting sixth-place West
Brom this afternoon, while second-place Manchester City travels
to Norwich. United has 46 points, six points better than City.
