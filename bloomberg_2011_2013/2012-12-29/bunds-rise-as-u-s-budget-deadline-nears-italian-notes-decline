German 10-year bunds advanced,
pushing yields to the lowest in more than two weeks, as concern
that U.S. lawmakers won’t agree a deal to avert $600 billion in
spending cuts and tax increases fueled demand for safety.  Bund yields  were also set for their second straight monthly
decline as President  Barack Obama  summoned congressional leaders
to a White House meeting yesterday before the Dec. 31 deadline
to reach an agreement that would avoid the so-called fiscal
cliff. Italian five-year note yields had the biggest weekly
increase in two months as borrowing costs rose at an auction of
5.9 billion euros ($7.8 billion) of government debt maturing in
2017 and 2022 yesterday.  “The fiscal cliff has dominated the markets over the past
few days,” said  Philip Marey , a senior market economist at
Rabobank Groep in Utrecht, the Netherlands. “Italy came back on
the radar.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, this week to 1.31 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday, after slipping to 1.29 percent, the least since
Dec. 11. That was the first weekly drop in yields since Dec. 7.
The 1.5 percent bund due September 2022 rose 0.6, or 6 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.715.  President Obama returned early from his holiday as
lawmakers disputed which party would be responsible for missing
the deadline for a debt deal, a failure that could hurt the U.S.
credit rating and cause an economic recession.  Italian Auctions  Italy  sold 2.87 billion euros of notes due in November 2017
at an average yield of 3.26 percent yesterday, compared with
3.23 percent at a Nov. 29 auction. The Rome-based Treasury also
allotted 3 billion euros of 10-year bonds at 4.48 percent.
That’s up from 4.45 percent the last time the securities were
sold on Nov. 29,  Bank of Italy  data showed.  Yields on Italy’s five-year notes climbed 13 basis points
this week to 3.31 percent, the biggest increase since the period
ended Oct. 26. Those on 10-year bonds rose three basis points to
4.50 percent.  A rally in Italian bonds this year that pushed the 10-year
yield to as low as 4.35 percent on Dec. 19 from a 2012 high of
7.18 percent on Jan. 6, is stalling ahead of elections in
February.  Monti Candidacy  Prime Minister  Mario Monti , who has overseen austerity
measures and declines in bond yields since taking office in
November 2011, said on Dec. 23 he would consider being the
candidate for a party backing his economic agenda even as he
said he won’t run.  Trading in euro-region government bond futures will be
closed from Dec. 31 through Jan. 1, according to the  website  of
Eurex, a derivatives-exchange unit of Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Boerse AG.  Germany is scheduled to sell an additional 5 billion euros
of two-year notes on Jan. 2, while  France  is due to auction as
much as 8 billion euros of debt maturing between 2019 and 2032 a
day later.  German bonds returned 4.4 percent this year through Dec.
27, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds earned
21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
