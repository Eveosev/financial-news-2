The  Solomon Islands , located about
2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) northeast of  Australia , are
bracing for floods as Tropical Cyclone Freda brought strong
winds in the second major storm to hit the South Pacific region
this month.  The category 3 storm was about 102 nautical miles (117
miles) south of Rennell Island, moving south-southeast and
intensifying, the Solomon Islands meteorological service
division said on its  website . Winds as strong as 98 miles per
hour are expected near the center, it said.  The division has issued a tropical cyclone warning with
moderate to heavy swells, rain and thunderstorms that will cause
flooding in coastal and low-lying areas.  Freda follows tropical cyclone Evan, a category 4 storm
that left at least two people dead and more than 8,000
sheltering in emergency centers in Samoa. In neighboring Fiji,
at least 13,900 people sought shelter in evacuation centers,
according to Australia’s foreign aid agency.  There have been no reports of death or injuries in the
Solomon Islands, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported
today. Freda is expected to steer clear of the neighboring
islands of  Vanuatu  and  New Caledonia , the ABC said, citing the
Bureau of Meteorology in Brisbane.  Off Australia’s western coast, Tropical Cyclone Mitchell, a
category 1 storm, is weakening, the Bureau of Meteorology said
on its  website . Mitchell is moving south at 15 kilometers (9.3
miles) an hour, and isn’t expected to affect Western Australia
in the next 48 hours, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
