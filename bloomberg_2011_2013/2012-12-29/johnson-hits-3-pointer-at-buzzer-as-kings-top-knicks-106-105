James Johnson hit a 25-foot three-
pointer at the buzzer to give the Sacramento Kings a 106-105
victory over the  New York Knicks , who had fought back from a 27-
point deficit.  The Knicks were kept scoreless in the final two minutes, 50
seconds as Isaiah Thomas hit two free throws to bring the Kings
within two points before Johnson got the winning basket on his
home court at Sleep Train Arena.  The Kings had a 27-point lead with one minute, 22 seconds
left in the second quarter. They ended the half with a 71-50
lead. Marcus Thornton had 18 points and Johnson contributed 17
for the Kings (10-19).  The Knicks dominated the second half as they rallied to
take the lead, 97-95, on  Jason Kidd ’s 25-foot 3-point jumper
with just under six minutes left in the game.  Reserves J.R. Smith had 28 points, Chris Copeland scored 23
and  Tyson Chandler  added 21 for the Knicks, who lead the Eastern
Conference’s Atlantic Division with a 21-9 record. Kidd scored
16 points.  The Knicks were playing their second straight game without
 Carmelo Anthony , who leads the National Basketball Association’s
Eastern Conference with an average of 28.5 points per game.
Anthony has a hyperextended left knee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
