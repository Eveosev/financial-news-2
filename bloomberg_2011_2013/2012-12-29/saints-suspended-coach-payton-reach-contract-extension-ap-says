The  New Orleans Saints  have reached
a contract extension with coach  Sean Payton  who missed the past
season in connection with the National Football League’s bounty
probe, the Associated Press reported, citing people familiar
with the deal.  Final details of the length of the contract and financial
compensation are still being discussed, AP reported.  Payton, who took the Saints to a Super Bowl victory at the
end of the 2009 season, would have started his seventh season as
the team’s coach in 2012 before he was suspended by NFL
Commissioner  Roger Goodell  for failing to exert proper control
over a bounty program that paid cash for hits on opposing
players.  The new agreement must be approved by the NFL, which
rejected a 2011 extension that would have kept Payton with the
Saints until 2015, AP said.  Payton is 62-34 in regular-season games as Saints head
coach and 5-3 in the postseason. During the three seasons before
his suspension, the Saints won 41 regular-season and playoff
games combined, more than any other team in the NFL.  Payton is expected to return to the Saints after the  Super
Bowl  on Feb. 3, unless Goodell allows him to return earlier, AP
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
