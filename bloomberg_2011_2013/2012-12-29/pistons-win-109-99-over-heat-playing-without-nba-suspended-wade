Will Bynum came off the bench to get
25 points and 10 assists for the  Detroit Pistons  who ended the
six-game win streak of the Miami Heat with a 109-99 National
Basketball Association victory.  The Heat, atop the Eastern Conference with a 20-7 record,
were playing without  Dwyane Wade , who was suspended for one game
by the NBA when his flailing leg connected with the groin of a
Charlotte Bobcat player.  Charlie Villanueva scored 18 points and Kyle Singler added
12 for the Pistons who improved to 10-22 last night at the
Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit. Four reserves contributed 64
points of the Pistonsâ€™ total score.  LeBron James had a game-high 35 points and  Chris Bosh  added
28 for the Heat, who fell to 6-5 on the road.  Miami started the game with a 32-17 lead in the first
quarter and then were outscored 41-20 in the second period by
the Pistons who had a 58-52 halftime advantage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
