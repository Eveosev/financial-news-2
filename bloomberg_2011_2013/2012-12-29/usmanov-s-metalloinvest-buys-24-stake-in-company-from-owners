Metalloinvest, the Russian iron-ore
producer partly owned by billionaire  Alisher Usmanov , agreed to
buy back a 24 percent stake from its owners, a statement from
the company shows.  Metalloinvest Ltd., a subsidiary of Metalloinvest Holding
Co. bought the stake after OAO VTB sold its shares in the
holding company, the Moscow-based iron ore producer said in an
e-mailed statement today, without giving any financial details.  Metalloinvest Ltd. now owns a 24 percent stake in the
holding company, which is 100 percent owned by Usmanov’s USM
Holdings, the statement shows.  VTB,  Russia ’s second-largest lender bought a Metalloinvest
stake from billionaire Vasily Anisimov last year for $2.5
billion. Metalloinvest had started preliminary talks to buy back
shares in the mining company held by VTB, Usmanov said in April.  The company, the nation’s largest iron ore producer,
planned to exchange $2.48 billion in VTB promissory notes for
the stake, Vedomosti reported in May, citing people it didn’t
identify.  Metalloinvest is yet to decide what to do with the shares,
once they are repurchased from VTB, Eduard Potapov, chief
executive officer, told reporters this month. An initial public
offering is unlikely next year or in 2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
