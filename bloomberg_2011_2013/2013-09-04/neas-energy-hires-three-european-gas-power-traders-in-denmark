Neas Energy A/S  said it hired one
gas trader and two junior power traders as the Danish company
seeks to build its energy-trading business in Europe.  Kristian Junker, 32, will trade German and Danish gas
markets after joining from  Jyske Bank A/S (JYSK) , the company said in
an e-mailed statement.  “The company’s gas-trading desk is expanding activities
rapidly across Europe,” Rasmus Buhl Moller, a spokesman for the
company in Aalborg,  Denmark , said in the statement.  Mehmet Kuyucuoglu, 26, joined the short-term power-trading
desk as a junior trader, while Todor Dimov, 26, will be a
trainee trader on the short-term desk, Neas said.  Neas hired Henrik Bystrup in July to co-head the short-term
power desk with Jesper Johansen. Neas Energy trades electricity,
gas and carbon emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
