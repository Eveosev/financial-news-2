Sprint champion  Usain Bolt  said he
plans to retire after the 2016  Olympic Games  in Rio de Janeiro.  Bolt, who is world record holder in both the 100 and 200
meters, along with sharing the 4x100 relay mark with his
Jamaican teammates, told a news conference today in Brussels he
wants to add to his tally of six Olympic gold medals before
bowing out.  “After the 2016 Olympics,” Bolt, 27, said in comments
posted on the  website  of the International Association of
Athletics Federations, track’s governing body, when asked about
his retirement plans. “That seems to be a good idea, retiring
when I’m still on top of my career. Now that I’m getting a bit
older, I know that I have to stay injury-free, maintain focus
and act responsible.”  Bolt, who was speaking before the Diamond League Meet in
two days, won three gold medals -- in the 100, 200 and 4x100-meter relay -- at both the 2008 Beijing Olympics and last year’s
 London  Games. He pulled off the same triple at the world
championships in Berlin in 2009 and repeated the feat last month
in Moscow.  Bolt set the 100-meter mark of 9.58 seconds and the 200-meter standard of 19.19 in Berlin. While the 100 record will be
tough to break, he said he can challenge the 200 mark.  “The 100-meter world record is the hardest to break
because it is more technical,” he said. “In the 200 meters, if
I can master the bend and stay injury-free, there is room for
improvement.”  Bolt will run the 100 meters in Brussels in a field which
includes American Justin Gatlin and fellow Jamaican Nesta
Carter, who finished second and third at last month’s world
championships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
