Egypt  scrapped import tariffs on raw
and white sugar, applied last year as a measure to protect its
domestic industry, after finding lower capacity utilization and
profitability weren’t caused by increased imports.  The country dropped a duty of 17 percent on imports of raw
sugar, based on cost, insurance and freight and with a minimum
of 591 Egyptian pounds ($84.62) per metric ton, and a 20 percent
duty on white sugar, with a minimum of 713 pounds per ton, an
 online filing  to the  World Trade Organization  showed.  Egypt is  Africa ’s third-largest sugar importer, behind
Algeria and Nigeria, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
data. The country introduced the  import duties  in December,
after a preliminary investigation indicated a rise in imports
was hurting domestic sugar producers, and scrapped them again
after a probe that ended Aug. 20.  “The injury suffered by the domestic industry is not due
to the increased imports, but due to other causes,” Egypt wrote
in a filing dated Aug. 30 and published on the WTO’s website
yesterday, without providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
