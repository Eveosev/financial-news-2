ConocoPhillips, the largest
independent U.S. oil and natural gas producer, said an
international arbitration body ruled  Venezuela ’s seizure of its
crude oil projects in 2007 was against the law.  The Washington-based  International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes  said the South American nation’s actions
amounted to an unlawful expropriation, Houston-based
ConocoPhillips said in a statement on its website.  ConocoPhillips, which participated in the Petrozuata and
the Hamaca projects in Venezuela’s Orinoco heavy-crude belt as
well as the Corocoro offshore project, had rejected terms laid
out by the government of then President  Hugo Chavez , who forced
overseas oil producers to form ventures as minority partners in
2007. ConocoPhillips’ portion of the initial investments in the
Petrozuata and Hamaca projects completed in 2001 and 2004,
respectively, amounted to $3.1 billion.  “We welcome this decision by the tribunal,” Janet Langford Kelly, senior vice president, legal, general counsel
and corporate secretary at ConocoPhillips, said in the statement.
“This ruling sends a clear message that countries cannot
expropriate their investments without fair compensation.”  ConocoPhillips has earlier won and lost cases related to
disputed production cuts enforced by Venezuela’s state oil
company Petroleos de Venezuela. The Paris-based  International
Chamber of Commerce  in 2012 awarded ConocoPhillips a $66.8
million settlement related to Petrozuata and rejected a $102.9
million claim related to Hamaca. The ICC’s arbitration was
separate from  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s arbitration through the ICSID.  Petroleos de Venezuela spokesmen in Caracas declined to
comment on the ConocoPhillips announcement when contacted on
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
