Defending U.S. Open champion Andy
Murray completed the men’s quarterfinal lineup with a four-set
win over unseeded  Denis Istomin .  Murray, the No. 3 seed from Scotland, lost the first set in
a tiebreak and then rallied for a 6-7 (5-7), 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 win
at the National Tennis Center in New York. Istomin, of
Uzbekistan, was the last unseeded player left in the men’s draw
at the season’s final Grand Slam tournament.  Murray advances to face No. 9 seed Stanislas Wawrinka of
Switzerland, who beat No. 5 Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic
in four sets. Top-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia lost only
three games in a straight-set rout of Marcel Granollers of
Spain, while Mikhail Youzhny of Russia, the 21st seed, outlasted
2001 U.S. Open champion  Lleyton Hewitt  in five sets.  Defending women’s champion  Serena Williams  reached the
semifinals with a 6-0, 6-0 win over Carla Suarez-Navarro of
Spain, the first such shutout win in the U.S. Open quarterfinals
since 1989.  Williams will play fifth-seeded Li Na of China, who won in
three sets against No. 24 Ekaterina Makarova of Russia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
