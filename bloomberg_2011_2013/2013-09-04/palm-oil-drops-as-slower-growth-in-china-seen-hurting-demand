Palm oil fell to the lowest level in
more than a week after China’s leadership indicated that it
chose slower economic growth, boosting concern that demand from
the second-largest consumer may be hurt.  Palm for November delivery retreated as much as 1 percent
to 2,392 ringgit ($725) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the lowest level for the most active contract since
Aug. 23, and ended the morning session at 2,414 ringgit in Kuala
Lumpur. Palm for physical delivery in September was at 2,440
ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  President  Xi Jinping  said that the government opted for
slower growth this year to allow it to adjust the structure of
the economy, according to a transcript of a written interview
distributed by the official Xinhua News Agency. Growth was 7.5
percent in the second quarter, extending the longest streak of
sub-8 percent expansion in at least two decades and putting the
government at risk of missing its 2013 goal of 7.5 percent.  “If China slows down for longer than expected, then palm
oil demand may also be affected,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an
analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. “In the short term, the
 Mid-Autumn Festival  will boost demand temporarily.”  Exports to  China  from Malaysia gained 15 percent to 2.07
million tons in the first seven months of this year from the
same period in 2012, according to data from the nation’s palm
oil board. Malaysia is the largest producer after Indonesia.  Refined palm oil for January delivery lost 0.8 percent to
5,580  yuan  ($912) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  fell 1.2 percent to 7,198 yuan a ton. China’s
markets will be closed on Sept. 19 and 20 to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.  Soybeans for November delivery dropped 1 percent to
$13.7325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
delivery in December lost 0.5 percent to 43.96 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
