Canola futures declined for the
sixth straight session, heading for the longest slump in almost
a year, on signs that farmers in Western Canada will harvest a
bigger crop as yields rise.  Warm, wet weather across the Prairies in the last half of
June and early July boosted prospects for crops, and yields may
climb 19 percent from a year earlier, Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada said in an Aug. 13  report . Yields in  Saskatchewan , the
largest grower, are seen as high as 36 bushels an acre, and
those in  Manitoba  may reach 60, provincial reports show.  “The crop is looking pretty big,” Bobby Leavins,
operations manager for Rayglen Commodities Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Elrose, Saskatchewan. “Everyone is
talking about a record crop.”  Canola futures for November settlement fell 1.3 percent to
C$515.50 ($491.80) a metric ton at 11:15 a.m. on ICE Futures
Exchange in Winnipeg, heading for the longest slide since Sept.
27, 2012. Prices were down 11 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
