Investors withdrew the most money
from U.S. equity exchange-traded funds since January 2010 last
month amid concern about the  Federal Reserve ’s plans for
stimulus and possible military action against Syria.  About $13.5 billion flowed out of U.S. equity ETFs in
 August (SPX) , the first decrease since October, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from about 1,500 funds. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slid 3.1 percent last month as the  SPDR S&P 500
ETF Trust (SPY) , which tracks the benchmark index, lost $14 billion in
August, more than any other U.S. equity ETF.  The reversal in flows came after the  S&P 500  gained almost
153 percent since its 12-year low in March 2009, outlasting the
average length of bull markets since 1946. The S&P 500’s drop in
August, the worst in 15 months, was triggered as Fed policy
makers signaled they support stimulus cuts this year and the
U.S. considered an attack on  Syria ’s government.  “Headlines around Syria and a general negative tape during
the month contributed to outflows,” said  Walter Todd , who
oversees about $950 million as chief investment officer of
Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood,  South Carolina .
“Syria just adds more uncertainty to many other issues on the
table.”  About $76.7 billion went into U.S. equity ETFs in 2013,
more than twice the amount at this time last year. July saw $32
billion come into securities tracking American equities, the
second-most on record. ETFs are baskets of equities and other
assets that trade on exchanges throughout the day like stocks.  Syria Concern  The S&P 500 posted its biggest drop in nine weeks on Aug.
27, sliding 1.6 percent, after Secretary of State  John Kerry 
said the U.S. will hold Syria’s government accountable for
allegedly using chemical weapons.  Funds tracking larger U.S. companies in August erased 58
percent of inflows for the year as $14.1 billion was taken out
of those securities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The August deposits pushed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF to one of
the 100 worst-ranked funds as measured by flows after July
lifted it to the best, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
PowerShares QQQ, which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100
Index, saw $1.1 billion in outflows for the month.  Mutual funds that invest in U.S. shares had about $790
million of outflows for the first three weeks of August, after
more than $13 billion was sent to the funds in first seven
months of 2013, according to data from the Washington-based ICI
released Aug. 28. Data for the last week of August is not
available yet. Almost $400 billion was withdrawn from March 2009
to the end of last year, even as the S&P 500 more than doubled.  To contact the reporters on this story:
