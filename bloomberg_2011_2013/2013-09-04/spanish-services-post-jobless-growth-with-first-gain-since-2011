Spain ’s service industries expanded
for the first time in more than two years in August, even as
companies continued to cut jobs amid concerns over the strength
of the recovery.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 50.4 in August from
48.5 in July, the first reading above the 50-point mark that
separates expansion from contraction since June 2011, London-based Markit Economics said in a statement on its website.
Still, the rate of  job  cuts quickened in the month, Markit said.  “Panelists reported a reluctance to take on extra staff
given the fragility of economic conditions,” Markit said.  Spain’s economy has been in and out of recession since 2008
and a squeeze in bank lending threatens to undermine the latest
recovery. While the government forecasts the economy will expand
in the last six months of this year, it continues to battle the
euro region’s second-highest unemployment rate, which stood at
26 percent at the end of June.  The export-fueled recovery in the manufacturing industry,
flagged by Markit’s PMI on Sept. 2, has also failed to translate
into employment as factories cut jobs at the fastest pace in
four months. Spanish  unemployment claims  were unchanged at 4.7
million in August, the Labor Ministry said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
