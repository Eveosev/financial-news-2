Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which
generates about 95 percent of  South Africa ’s electricity, said
it’s weighing the sale of equity-type debt to fill a 225
billion-rand ($21.9 billion) funds gap as it builds new plants.  “Our next challenge is probably to go and find investment
that is going to bolster the balance sheet” with “equity-like
debt,” Caroline Henry, the acting chief financial officer, said
in an Aug. 26 interview. “That is not something that has been
discussed or agreed upon, but given the huge funding gap of 225
billion rand there is no doubt we need to consider everything.”  The company, which is spending 500 billion rand retooling
old plants and building new ones to avoid a repeat of blackouts
that halted output at factories and mines for five days in 2008,
faces the cash-flow shortfall because regulated power-price
increases don’t cover its expansion costs. The National Energy
Regulator on Feb. 28 allowed Eskom to raise tariffs by an
average 8 percent in each of the next five years, half the
amount it requested.  On June 13, demand for electricity outstripped supply by
1.5 percent, forcing Eskom to ask some of its biggest customers
to reduce consumption. The power shortage is hampering the
growth of South Africa’s economy, which the central bank
forecasts will expand 2 percent this year, the slowest rate
since a 2009 recession.  Eskom issued $1 billion of debt on Aug. 6 maturing in 2023
and paying a coupon of 6.75 percent. The yield on the
investment-grade notes has risen 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, since then to 7.04 percent by 111:53 a.m. in
Johannesburg.  Eskom has outstanding debt of 231 billion rand, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Debt that resembles equity may
include payment-in-kind notes and project financing.  The company anticipated it would improve its credit ratios
over the next five years, Henry said.  “We can’t deliver significant improvement now with the
current 225 billion rand taken out of the base,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
