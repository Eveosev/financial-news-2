Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
swelled on speculation the corn harvest will lower costs to make
the biofuel and boost supply.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 8.57 cents to
$1.0073 a gallon at 11:27 a.m.  New York  time as corn prices
declined and a day after the corn crush spread, or the
difference between the cost of the grain and a gallon of
ethanol, reached the highest level this year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “That October ethanol contract is just getting hammered,”
said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC
in Galena,  Illinois . “Today is brutal. The risk-premium is
blowing out of the market. We’re seeing a good Southern
harvest.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 8.9 cents, or
3.9 percent, to $1.854 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The September contract, which expires tomorrow, fell 3.5 cents
to $2.445.  Gasoline for October delivery decreased 0.33 cent to
$2.8613 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. Production of the
grain will raise to 13.676 billion bushels this year from 10.78
billion last year, Allendale Inc., a McHenry, Illinois-based
research company and broker said today in a statement, citing a
survey of farmers from Aug. 19 through Aug. 30.  Corn Sinks  Corn for December delivery slumped 6.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.6875 a bushel in  Chicago . September corn slumped
7 cents to $4.91.  The corn crush spread, based on September contracts, was
65.86 cents, down from 66.91 cents yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The spread for December is minus 5 cents, and
every month through July 2016 also shows a loss from making the
biofuel.  Refiners are required to use 13.8 billion gallons of
ethanol this year. Each batch of ethanol is attached a Renewable
Identification Number, or RIN, to help the government track
compliance and that can be traded among companies.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  climbed 1 cent to 72 cents, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, added 2 cents to 76 cents
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
