Wirecard AG (WDI) , a provider of software
for online payments, rose to the highest price since its initial
public offering in 2000 after Goldman Sachs predicted the stock
will gain as the company builds business in Europe and Asia.  Wirecard  jumped  as much as 5.2 percent and was up 3.1
percent at 25.08 euros at 1:36 p.m. in  Frankfurt , for the
biggest gain among the 110 stocks on the  HDAX Index. (HDAX)  Trading
volume was almost double the three-month daily average.  “There is a 65 billion-euro mobile commerce related
opportunity for Wirecard spread across mobile carriers,
retailers and other verticals,” S.K. Prasad Borra, a London-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a note today. “We
expect Wirecard to augment its strong presence in  Germany  and
across Europe with continued expansion in Asia.”  Goldman raised its recommendation on Aschheim, Germany-based Wirecard to buy from neutral, and put the stock on its
“conviction buy list.” Prasad Borra predicted the shares will
rise to 38 euros in 12 months, a potential 56 percent gain from
the closing price yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
