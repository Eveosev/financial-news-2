Volkswagen AG (VOW)  will target potential
buyers of  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s battery-powered i3 city
car with its first pure-electric model as German carmakers bet
that emission-free vehicles are ready for the mainstream.  “We deliberately positioned the electric Up! against the
i3,” Rudolf Krebs, VW’s head of electric-powertrain technology,
said today at a press conference in Wolfsburg. “The time is
ripe to introduce electric mobility on a large scale.”  VW, which has a goal of becoming the world’s biggest
carmaker, will present the e-Up! and a battery-powered version
of the Golf hatchback at the International Auto Show in
 Frankfurt  next week. The e-Up! will go on sale in October for
26,900 euros ($35,500) in  Germany , 23 percent less than the BMW
i3. The e-Golf will hit showrooms next spring.  The new models enter a segment that has struggled to win
customers because of the high cost of the vehicles and driving
ranges that are about one quarter of conventional models.  Carlos Ghosn  -- the chief executive officer of  Renault SA (RNO)  and Nissan
Motor Co., the global leader in electric cars -- said in a
Bloomberg interview that the two companies won’t reach a target
to sell a total of 1.5 million electric cars by 2016 as planned.  Volkswagen can manufacture the vehicles in the same
factories as cars with conventional engines, thereby saving
costs and giving it an edge over competitors in the segment,
Krebs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
