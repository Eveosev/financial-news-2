Yanchang Petroleum International
Ltd. (346)  agreed to buy  Novus Energy Inc. (NVS)  for C$232 million ($220
million) cash, in China’s biggest purchase of a Canadian oil and
gas company since  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s takeover of Nexen Inc.  Yanchang will pay C$1.18 a share for Novus Energy, 42
percent more than its closing price yesterday, the Alberta-based
company said in a statement. Yanchang said it will help fund the
purchase by selling HK$1.6 billion ($206 million) in convertible
bonds to its parent Shannxi Yanchang Petroleum Group Co.,
China’s fourth-largest producer.  Buying Novus will give Yanchang assets in Western Canada
that produced 3,452 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the three
months ended June 30, 20 percent more than a year earlier,
according to Novus’s quarterly report. The Canadian company also
has expertise in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing,
according to its website.  Novus had said on Aug. 23 that it was in exclusive talks on
a potential transaction after completing a strategic review.  Cnooc, China’s biggest offshore oil and natural gas
producer, completed the $15.1 billion takeover of Nexen Inc. in
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
