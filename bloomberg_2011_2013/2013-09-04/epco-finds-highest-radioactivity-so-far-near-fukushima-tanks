Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  detected
the highest radiation levels found so far near tanks holding
contaminated water used to cool reactors at its wrecked
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, the company said.  Readings of 2,200 millisieverts per hour were found
yesterday in an area where levels of 1,800 millisieverts had
been detected on Aug. 31, Mayumi Yoshida, a spokeswoman for the
utility known as Tepco, said today by phone. The increase could
be due to a slight difference in where where the measurement was
taken, she said.  “It fluctuates when you move a little bit,” so the higher
reading doesn’t necessarily indicate rising radioactivity
levels, Yoshida said.  Yesterday’s hourly reading is equivalent to the amount of
radiation that 44 plant workers may be exposed to in a full year
under government guidelines.  The reading was at one of four radiation hot-spots near
 storage tanks  reported by Tepco over the weekend, one of which
led crews to a leaking pipe that was repaired on Sept. 1.
Investigators will now deploy more advanced sensors to locate
the source of yesterday’s reading, Yoshida said.  Tepco reported a 300-ton leak last month from a tank used
to store contaminated water in what the country’s nuclear
regulator designated the worst accident since the March 2011
earthquake and tsunami caused reactors to meltdown.  Tepco has subsequently boosted the number of tank-inspection patrols from twice to four times a day and increased
its inspection staff to 60 members from 10, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
