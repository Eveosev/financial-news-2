Hungary ’s economic growth slowed in
the second quarter as imports outpaced exports, raising pressure
on Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  to boost expansion after a
recession last year and before elections in 2014.  Gross domestic product advanced 0.1 percent from the
previous three months after rising 0.6 percent in the first
quarter, the Budapest-based statistics office said today. GDP
expanded 0.5 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter.
The revised data matched preliminary estimates.  Hungary’s growth slowed even as the euro area snapped six
quarters of contraction in the three months ended June.  Germany ,
 Europe ’s largest economy and Hungary’s biggest export market,
expanded 0.7 percent from the first quarter.  “The contribution of” net “exports to growth was lower
compared with earlier periods” as rising investments and
consumption fueled imports, statistician Pal Pozsonyi told
reporters today.  The forint gained 0.4 percent to 301.17 per euro by 10:34
a.m. in Budapest. It’s weakened 3.3 percent this year, the
ninth-best performance among emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  Imports rose 2.7 percent from the first quarter compared
with a 2.1 percent increase in exports. Agricultural output
dropped 2.6 percent after a 22.4 percent advance. Government
investments in roads, railroads and stadium-building contributed
to a 1.1 percent increase in fixed-capital formation. Household
consumption rose 0.4 percent.  Agriculture production jumped 17.2 percent from a year
earlier, while construction output rose 6.9 percent. Industrial
production dropped 0.8 percent. Household consumption rose 0.3
percent, the first expansion since 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
