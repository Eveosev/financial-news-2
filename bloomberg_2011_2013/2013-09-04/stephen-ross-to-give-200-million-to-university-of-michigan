Real estate developer Stephen Ross
will give $200 million to the  University of Michigan  to benefit
the business school and athletics.  The gift is the largest in the Ann Arbor-based school’s
history and brings Ross’s lifetime gifts to the institution to
more than $313 million, the university said today in a
 statement .  Ross is chairman and founder of Related Cos., developer of
the Time Warner Center in New York and the Hudson Yards project
under way on Manhattan’s west side. He also owns the Miami
Dolphins. The donation will expand career services, research and
scholarships at Michigan’s Stephen M. Ross School of Business,
named for the developer after a previous gift, according to the
statement. It will also improve facilities and academic services
for student athletes.  “The University of Michigan had a profound impact on my
life and I have received enormous satisfaction from being able
to give back to the institution that played such a critical role
in my success,” said Ross, who earned a bachelor’s degree in
business administration in 1962.  The previous record for a donation at the University of
Michigan came in April, when Charles Munger, vice chairman at
 Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , pledged $110 million
in securities to fund fellowships and a graduate-student
residence.  Ross also has a law degree from  Wayne State University  and
a master of law in taxation from  New York University .  To contact the reporter on this story:
