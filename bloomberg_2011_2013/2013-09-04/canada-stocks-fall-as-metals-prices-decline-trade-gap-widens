Canadian  stocks  advanced as
BlackBerry Ltd. rallied along with utilities and industrial
companies, offsetting losses in commodity producers amid concern
about a U.S. military strike on  Syria .  BlackBerry jumped 4.9 percent after a report the mobile
phone maker aims to find a buyer by November.  Air Canada (AC/B) , the
nation’s largest airline, climbed 2.5 percent for a fourth day
of gains. Niko Resources Ltd. lost 9.5 percent as crude slipped
for the third time in four days. Torex Gold Resources Inc. slid
5.6 percent and Silvercorp Metals Inc. sank 4.2 percent as the
prices of both metals fell.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 17.31
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,757.81 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark Canadian equity gauge has risen 2.6 percent this year.
Trading volume was 2.1 percent lower than the 30-day average at
this time of the day.  “The oil price and gold price are reflecting geopolitical
risk,” said Jeffrey Burchell, a  fund manager  with Aston Hill
Financial Inc., in a telephone interview from Toronto. His firm
manages about C$8 billion ($7.6 billion). “People are getting
settled in and trying to figure out what to do next.”  Gold and silver futures fell the most in eight weeks. Torex
Gold sank 5.6 percent to C$1.53. Silvercorp Metals fell 4.2
percent to C$3.85.  The S&P/TSX Materials Index lost 0.1 percent as 35 of 55
members retreated. The group has plunged 24 percent this year,
the worst performer among 10  industries  in the S&P/TSX.  Chemical Weapons  The international community’s credibility is on the line
after Syria used chemical weapons against civilians, U.S.
President  Barack Obama  said at a news conference today in
 Stockholm , repeating a claim the Syrian government has denied.  The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to
authorize a limited U.S. military operation in Syria, the first
step toward congressional endorsement of the effort.  Torex Gold Resources Inc. slid 6.1 percent Silvercorp
Metals Inc. sank 4.2 percent as the prices of both metals fell.  Canada’s trade deficit widened to C$931 million in July
from C$460 million in June,  Statistics Canada  said. The gap
exceeded the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Exports fell 0.6 percent to C$39.2 billion on a 7.3
percent drop in shipments of metal and non-mineral products.  “The hearty gain in energy exports that the street was
expecting didn’t quite materialize,” Emanuella Enenajor, an
economist with CIBC World Markets Inc., said in a note to
clients today. “Overall a disappointing figure.”  Interest Rates  The  Bank of Canada  today kept its main interest rate
unchanged at 1 percent for the 24th meeting. Policy makers
reiterated that current monetary policy remains appropriate as
an expected rotation of demand to exports and investment is
being delayed.  BlackBerry advanced 4.9 percent to C$11.28. The mobile
device maker has held talks with bidders and plans to begin an
auction process soon, Dow Jones said, citing people familiar
with the situation.  Niko Resources declined 9.5 percent to C$4.29 and Bankers
Petroleum Ltd. slipped 0.3 percent to C$3.60. Crude for October
delivery lost 1.2 percent to $107.23 a barrel in  New York .  Air Canada, the nation’s largest airline, rose 2.5 percent
to C$2.89. The stock has jumped 8.7 percent in the past four
sessions, the longest winning streak since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
