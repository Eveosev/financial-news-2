Crystal Palace manager Ian Holloway
will serve a two-game suspension for his conduct following his
team’s Premier League soccer match against Tottenham on Aug. 18.  Holloway was also fined 18,000 pounds ($28,000) over two
separate incidents after Palace lost the season opener 1-0,
 England ’s Football Association said in a  statement  on its
website. Palace notified the F.A. yesterday Holloway wouldn’t
appeal the ban, which was handed down Aug. 28.  Holloway was suspended and fined 10,000 pounds for his
language and behavior around the officials’ changing room after
the match, the F.A. said. He was also fined 8,000 pounds for his
post-match media comments, which the F.A. said questioned the
integrity of the officials.  Newly promoted Palace lost its first Premier League game in
eight years on Robert Soldado’s second-half penalty kick.
Holloway was upset with the call awarding the spot-kick, along
with a foul he thought should have been called for his team
prior to the penalty.  “If the referee didn’t see that, the assistant should
have,” Holloway said after the match in an interview with the
British Broadcasting Corp. “You have to ask if he’s good enough
if he didn’t see that. I don’t see how he can miss it. Certain
clubs get fouls and others don’t. Do I think I would have got
that at Tottenham? No I don’t. I just want a bit of fairness.”  Holloway will miss the league match at Manchester United on
Sept. 14 and a home game against Swansea seven days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
