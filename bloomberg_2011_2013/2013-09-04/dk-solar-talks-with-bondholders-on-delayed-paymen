LDK Solar Co., the second biggest
maker of solar wafers, said it is in talks with noteholders of
its 2014 securities to delay interest payments that were due on
Aug. 28.  The semiannual payment due was about 80 million  yuan  ($13
million), Peng Shaomin, director of media at LDK, said today by
phone. “We have a one-month forbearance agreement,” he said.  The yuan-denominated 10-percent notes tumbled to a record
low of 25.6 yuan per 100 yuan face value last week after the
manufacturer said a payment on the notes would be delayed. The
missed payment along with  Suntech Power Holdings (STP)  Co.’s attempts
to renegotiate its obligations have unsettled investors as $8.4
billion in renewable energy bonds come due by the end of 2014.  LDK failed to fully repay $23.8 million of convertible
bonds that matured April 15 and is restructuring another $240
million of securities that were due in June. The company ended
the second quarter with $2.8 billion in debt and $85.1 million
in cash, the least since 2009.  China’s 10 biggest photovoltaic companies had debt of more
than 100 billion yuan, the Ministry of Industry and  Information
Technology  said on Aug. 15.  Shares of LDK fell 1.3 percent to close at $1.48 in  New
York  trading yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
