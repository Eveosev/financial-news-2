Rupiah forwards slumped to a four-year low on concern a U.S. strike against Syria will push up  oil
prices  and worsen Indonesia’s record trade deficit. Stocks fell
on speculation there will be more interest-rate increases.  One-month non-deliverable contracts slid 0.9 percent, the
most since the 2.5 percent plunge on Aug. 27 that was the
steepest since September 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The contracts traded at 11,620 per dollar as of 4:12 p.m. in
Jakarta, 4.3 percent weaker than the spot rate, and reached
11,788 earlier, the lowest level since April 2009.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  won support yesterday from
Republican and Democratic leaders on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on a draft resolution authorizing military
force in Syria after the alleged use of chemical weapons.
Indonesia’s trade  shortfall  widened to $2.3 billion in July and
oil and gas imports rose 50 percent, accounting for almost a
quarter of overseas purchases, official data show.  “There’s ongoing depreciation pressure on the rupiah after
the trade numbers,” said Khoon Goh, a senior currency
strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in
Singapore. “The NDFs are a better reflection of rupiah’s broad
direction. We will probably see continued divergence between the
spot and NDFs in the near term until the spot converges with
what offshore rates are implying.”  Brent crude prices climbed 1.3 percent this week to $115.55
per barrel and are up 13 percent this quarter. The cost reached
$117.34 on Aug. 28, the highest since February.  Negative Sentiment  The rupiah fell 0.5 percent in the  spot market  to 11,125
per dollar, after touching 11,170 earlier, the weakest level
since April 2009, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. The spot rate should weaken toward 12,000 per dollar
before year-end, ANZ’s Goh said. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, climbed 69 basis points, or 0.69 percentage point, to
18.93 percent.  “Negative sentiment from the record trade deficit and
external factors continue,” said Rully Nova, a currency analyst
at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “Conflict in Syria
is boosting oil prices, which will further weigh on the  trade
balance  and subsequently the rupiah.”  The  Jakarta Composite (JCI)  index of shares fell 2.2 percent to
4,073.455 and is down 15 percent this quarter. Trading volumes
were 31 percent above its 30-day average.  Bank Indonesia  raised
its  reference rate  by 50 basis points to 7 percent at an
unscheduled meeting last week, following an increase of 75 basis
points over the June and July meetings.  Interest Rates  PT Bank Central Asia (BBCA) , the nation’s biggest lender by market
value, declined 3.4 percent and PT Astra International lost 3.4
percent. PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, the country’s biggest
telecommunication company, fell 4.6 percent.  “The rupiah has failed to stabilize after the latest
interest-rate increase,” said Jeffrosenberg Tan, portfolio
manager at PT Sinarmas Asset Management in Jakarta, which
oversees 6 trillion rupiah. “The market will speculate there
will be more increases in  interest rates .”  A  fixing  used to settle the rupiah forwards was set by the
Association of Banks in Singapore at 11,491 per dollar, compared
with 11,293 per dollar yesterday. The rupiah lost 11 percent
this quarter, the second-worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Improving data in the U.S. are also weighing on the rupiah
amid concern the  Federal Reserve  will pare stimulus that’s
boosted demand for assets in  developing countries .  Bonds Drop  The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index
for the U.S. rose to 55.7 last month, exceeding the median
estimate of 54 economists in a Bloomberg News survey, a report
showed yesterday. The Fed will start reducing its stimulus in
September, according to 65 percent of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey conducted last month.  “Concern over the Fed tapering gives little breathing room
for the rupiah until there’s more certainty,” Nova said.  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent government bonds due
May 2023 rose 16 basis points to 8.77 percent, highest level
since Aug. 28, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
