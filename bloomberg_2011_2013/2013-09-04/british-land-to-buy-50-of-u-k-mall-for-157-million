British Land Co. (BLND) , the U.K.’s second-largest real estate investment trust by market value, agreed to
buy 50 percent of a shopping center in the English city of Bath
for 101 million pounds ($157 million) to gain tenants including
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Hennes & Mauritz AB. (HMB)   British Land is acquiring the stake in the Southgate mall
from Multi Southgate (LP) Ltd., according to a statement today.
Aviva Investors owns the rest of the property, which has 430,000
square feet (40,000 square meters) of space and is 93 percent
rented out.  British Land in July said an improvement in the economy
caused fewer of its retail tenants to go into administration, a
U.K. form of  bankruptcy protection , in the second quarter. The
Southgate shopping center has 55 retail units, 25,000 square
feet of office buildings and Bath’s biggest parking lot, British
Land said in today’s statement.  The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of
the month, the REIT said. The first part of the mall was
completed in 2009 and the final construction phase ended this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
