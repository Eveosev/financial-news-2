Salvatore Ferragamo SpA (SFER)  Chief
Executive Officer Michele Norsa quashed speculation of a buyout,
saying the luxury shoemaker has the financial resources to fund
expansion as growth accelerates in China and North America.  “I don’t see any reason” for a sale, Norsa said today in
an interview on Bloomberg Surveillance with  Tom Keene . A 2011
initial public offering gave financial freedom to members of the
Ferragamo family, and the Florence, Italy-based company is
generating greater-than-expected free cash flow, he said.  “If you become big enough you can survive alone,” Norsa
said.  Ferragamo is likely to be among the next targets for cash-laden luxury-goods companies in search of growth, analysts at
Equita Sim SpA predicted in July. Luxury buyouts will accelerate
as smaller companies turn to buyers instead of lenders for
capital, according to Milton Pedraza, CEO of the New-York based
researcher Luxury Institute LLC.  Ferragamo’s revenue is increasing “stably double-digit”
in North America, driven by local and tourist demand, Norsa
said, adding that he sees more room to expand in the U.S.  While sales growth has slowed in Shanghai and Beijing
because of a government clampdown on corruption and extravagant
spending among officials, there are “great opportunities” to
expand in  China , the CEO also said.  “China is growing more abruptly in second- and third-tier
cities where you can see 20 to 30 percent growth,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
