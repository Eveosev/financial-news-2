Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  co-Chief Executive
Officer Anshu Jain said lenders will have to comply with a
 leverage ratio  as the debate over stricter capital standards has
concluded.  “We’ve had the debate about the leverage ratio,” Jain
said of the banking industry at a conference in Frankfurt today.
“At this point, frankly, that decision is done and we’re moving
on. We have to comply.”  Deutsche Bank announced a plan at the end of July to shrink
its balance sheet by 250 billion euros ($329.3 billion), or 16
percent, by 2015 to meet stricter standards for the leverage
ratio, which shows the relation of equity to total assets.  Jain has previously criticized the gauge as potentially
restricting lending and increasing the readiness of some banks
to take risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
