Middlesbrough in northeast  England  had the highest proportion of jobless households last year, according to  government figures  that highlight Britain’s north-south divide.  A total of 30.9 percent of households in the town of 140,000 people had no one of working age in employment, data from the  Office for National Statistics  published yesterday showed. Glasgow in Scotland followed with a rate of 30.2 percent. Woking in Surrey had the lowest rate at 5.1 percent.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  took office in 2010 pledging to spread growth more evenly across the country. With the economy gaining momentum, the figures show he faces the biggest challenge in former industrial centers hit hard in recent years by government job cuts to narrow Britain’s budget deficit.  Cameron told Parliament in London yesterday that the number of workless households had fallen by 425,000 to 3.5 million since the election thanks to policies aimed at helping people off benefits and into work. “Each one of those statistics tells a story about people who will be able to get into work, provide for their family and make something of their lives,” he said. “We should be proud of our welfare reforms.”  Long-term and temporary sickness was the main reason given for not working by people aged 16-64 living in workless household, the ONS said.  The plight of towns such as Middlesbrough partly reflects the decline of heavy industry in Britain over the past half a century as manufacturing migrated to countries with cheaper labor costs. Services now account for three-quarters of the British economy.  Budget Cuts  It also shows the impact of budget cuts that will see about 1 million government jobs eliminated by 2018. At the end of 2010, the state employed more than one in four workers in the northeast, the highest proportion of any English region, according to the ONS. Middlesbrough ranked  least resilient  to austerity in a survey commissioned for the British Broadcasting Corp. shortly after the Conservative-led coalition took office.  “These regions had historically high unemployment even before the recession,” said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London . “The recovery we’ve seen in manufacturing does not mean that companies have been taking on more workers.”   Unemployment  in Middlesbrough was more than 15 percent last year, double the national average and the highest after Hull in northeast England and Blaenau Gwent in  Wales , ONS data show.  House Prices  In July, 7.7 percent of working-age adults in the town were claiming  jobless  benefits, with the figure for 18-24-year-olds at more than 12 percent. Almost 25 percent of its working-age population receive social-security payments. Weekly pay is a fifth below the U.K. average and  house prices  more than 50 percent below.  “No member of Parliament wants to see their constituency, their home town, at the top of these tables of deprivation,” said Andy McDonald, the town’s lawmaker and a member of the opposition  Labour Party . “I do not say the current coalition created the problems in my area, but they have made them worse.”  Middlesbrough grew into a town after the Darlington to Stockton railway, the world’s oldest public passenger line, was extended in the early 1830s as mining boomed. A decade later, an ironworks opened to make rails for Britain’s burgeoning network By the latter half of the 19th century, the town was producing steel later used to make the  Sydney Harbour Bridge .  North-South Gap  After World War II, Middlesbrough and surrounding areas on the River Tees became a hub for chemicals production, and the area still hosts companies including  Saudi Basic Industries Corp.  and  Dow Chemical Co.  But  new businesses  never filled the gap left by the demise of heavy industry in the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1997 and 2010, the previous Labour administration pumped thousands of public-sector jobs into the region in an attempt to prop up the local economy.  The five areas with the highest proportion of workless households are in  Scotland , northern England and the English midlands, according to the ONS. They are Glasgow City, Liverpool, Kingston upon Hull, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. The five areas with the lowest rates are in southern England: Hampshire, North Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, West Sussex and Surrey. The U.K. average was 18.1 percent last year.
