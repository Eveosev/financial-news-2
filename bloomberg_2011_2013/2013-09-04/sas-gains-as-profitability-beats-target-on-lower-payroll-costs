SAS Group (SAS)  gained the most in seven
months after the Nordic region’s largest airline exceeded its
profitability target in the third quarter, helped by lower
payroll costs and higher passenger revenue.  The shares rose as much as 11 percent to 14.90 kronor in
 Stockholm  today, where the company is based. That’s the steepest
intraday jump since Jan. 24. They traded at 14.40 kronor, up 7.5
percent, at 2:10 p.m., valuing the company at 4.74 billion
kronor ($720 million).  Earnings before taxes rose 54 percent to 1.12 billion
kronor in the three months through July, SAS said in a
statement. Nordea Equity Research had estimated 1.05 billion
kronor. Profitability as measured by earnings before interest
and taxes, or Ebit, as a percentage of sales, widened to 11.6
percent, exceeding the company’s 8 percent target. SAS, which is
cutting about 1,000 jobs at its headquarters, reduced payroll
expenses by 7 percent as it also introduces new wage and pension
plans.  “We have made substantial progress” in restructuring,
Chief Executive Officer Rickard Gustafson said in the statement  Passenger revenue rose 5.3 percent in the quarter, adjusted
for currency swings. The company is selling 2.7 billion kronor
worth of assets, including its Norwegian unit  Wideroe
Flyveselskap AS, and  aircraft engines .  The company reiterated a goal for the full-year Ebit margin
to exceed 3 percent and a profit before taxes. SAS last earned a
profit before taxes in 2007.  The Bloomberg EMEA Airlines Index fell 5.8 percent today,
led by a drop in  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  after the discount airline
said full-year earnings may miss its target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
