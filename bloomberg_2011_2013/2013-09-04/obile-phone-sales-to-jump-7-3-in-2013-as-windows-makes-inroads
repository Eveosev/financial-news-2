The surging popularity of
smartphones will fuel a 7.3 percent gain in mobile-phone
shipments this year, rebounding from 1.2 percent growth in 2012,
according to research firm IDC.  Smartphone shipments will top 1 billion units this year for
the first time, helping the broader industry grow more quickly
than expected, IDC said today in a report. The firm had
previously projected a 5.8 percent expansion in 2013.  While the smartphone business remains a two-horse race
between  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android and Apple Inc.’s iOS, the Windows
Phone platform will make inroads over the next four years, IDC
predicted. The  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  operating system will account for
more than 10 percent of shipments in 2017, up from less than 4
percent this year, the research firm said.  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB) ,
meanwhile, is projected to slip to 1.7 percent in 2017.  “Android and iOS will remain the clear No. 1 and 2
platforms, respectively, throughout our forecast,”  Ramon Llamas , an IDC analyst, said in the report. “Windows Phone has
inched ahead of BlackBerry during the first half of 2013, and we
believe that will extend into the future.”  Microsoft agreed this week to acquire  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s mobile-phone operations for $7.2 billion, giving the Redmond,
Washington-based company a manufacturing business to support the
Windows Phone software. Nokia was already using the operating
system under a 2011 partnership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
