Alfonso Soriano’s two-run single
sparked a five-run eighth inning for the New York Yankees, who
rallied to a 6-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox.  The Yankees (74-64) moved into third place in the American
League East, eight games behind the Boston Red Sox (83-57) and a
half-game ahead of the Baltimore Orioles (73-64), who lost 4-3
to the Cleveland Indians last night.  The Red Sox defeated the Detroit Tigers 2-1 to deprive
pitcher Max Scherzer of his 20th win this season. Scherzer, who
started the season 13-0, lost for the first time since July 13
when the Texas Rangers beat the Tigers 7-1.  The result leaves  Roger Clemens  as the only pitcher to
start the season 20-1, with the Yankees in 2001. Rube Marquard
also had a 19-1 record until he lost his next decision in 1912
with the New York Giants.  At Yankee Stadium last night, the White Sox had a 4-1 lead
going into the eighth inning.  After Soriano’s single left the Yankees trailing 4-3,
 Curtis Granderson  hit a run-scoring single to tie the game and
 Eduardo Nunez  doubled to send home Granderson and  Alex Rodriguez .  Shortstop  Derek Jeter , who was 2-for-3, collected his
3,314th career hit to surpass Eddie Collins for sole possession
of ninth place on Major League Baseball’s all-time hits list,
the Yankees’ game notes said, citing Elias Sports Bureau.  Yankees starter Hiroki Kuroda gave up all four runs on
seven hits in 6 1/3 innings, while  Boone Logan  (5-2) struck out
one in one inning for the win. Mariano Rivera got his 40th save
with a perfect ninth inning.  Nate Jones (4-5), who relieved Chicago starter Chris Sale
with one out in the eighth inning, took the loss after allowing
two runs on two hits before he was replaced by Donnie Veal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
