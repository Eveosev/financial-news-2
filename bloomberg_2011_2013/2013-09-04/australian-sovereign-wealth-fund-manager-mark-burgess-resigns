Mark Burgess resigned as managing
director of  Australia ’s  Future Fund , the country’s A$89 billion
($81 billion)  sovereign wealth manager .  Burgess, 50, will remain in the role he took up in 2011 to
ensure a “smooth transition” to his successor and then return
to the private sector, the fund said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Future Fund assets under management have expanded about 19
percent to A$89 billion as at June 30, the fund said in a
statement on Sept. 2. The fund has achieved an average annual
return of 6.2 percent since it was established in May 2006,
according to the statement.  “I respect Mark’s decision to return to the private sector
at this time and we look forward to announcing a replacement to
his position as the fund enters the next phase of its
development,” chairman of the Future Fund Board of Guardians,
David Gonski, said in the statement.  The Future Fund also manages assets totaling A$11.4 billion
from three other government funds, taking total funds under
management to more than A$100 billion.  Before joining the Future Fund, Burgess was chief executive
officer of listed funds management company  Treasury Group Ltd. (TRG) 
in Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
