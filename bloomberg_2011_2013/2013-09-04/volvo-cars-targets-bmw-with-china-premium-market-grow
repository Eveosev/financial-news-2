Volvo Car Group will upgrade the
model line-up with the aim of winning Chinese customers away
from luxury-vehicle market leaders Bayerische Motoren Werke AG
and Audi AG.  “We’re presuming a premium strategy, as we only have a
future as a high-price car producer,” Chief Executive Officer
Hakan Samuelsson said today in a phone interview from Volvo
Cars’ headquarters in Gothenburg,  Sweden . Growth in the Chinese
market will be helped as the carmaker, owned by Zhejiang Geely
Holding Group Co., adds three factories in the country this year
and next, he said.  Volvo has been struggling to restore earnings since Geely
bought the manufacturer from Ford Motor Co. in 2010 for $1.8
billion. The Swedish company set a target of breaking even at an
operating level in 2013 as new models attract buyers, making up
for a first-half loss before interest and taxes of 577 million
kronor ($87.1 million) caused by volume declines and price cuts.  The break-even goal “is a very challenging and tough, but
realistic, target,” Samuelsson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
