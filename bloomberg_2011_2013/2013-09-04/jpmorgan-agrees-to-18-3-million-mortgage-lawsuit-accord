JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  agreed to pay
$18.3 million to settle claims that its Bear Stearns Cos. unit
failed to disclose the actual interest rates on adjustable-rate
mortgage documents.  U.S. District Judge S. James Otero in  Los Angeles  will
consider whether to approve the agreement at a Oct. 7 hearing,
according to a court filing.  The lawsuit was filed in 2007 by plaintiffs who refinanced
their home loans with adjustable-rate mortgages. JPMorgan
acquired Bear Stearns in June 2008. The loans were acquired by a
Bear Stearns unit, EMC Mortgage, based in Lewisville, Texas,
that specialized in buying and servicing troubled mortgages.  JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon , 57,
is contending with criminal investigations of its energy-trading
and mortgage-backed securities operations. The firm also faces
U.S. probes of its anti-money-laundering safeguards,
foreclosures, credit-card collections, and $6.2 billion in
losses last year on botched derivatives bets by a U.K. trader
known as the London Whale.  Brian Marchiony , a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the ruling.  The case is Monaco v. The Bear Stearns Companies Inc., 09-cv-05438, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
