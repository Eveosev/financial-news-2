Italy ’s 10-year government bonds
declined after a report showed the nation’s service sector,
based on a survey of  purchasing managers , shrank more last month
than economists forecast.  Italy’s 10-year  yields  approached a six-week high as the
Repubblica newspaper reported former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  may consider withdrawing his support for the
coalition government before a vote on whether to oust him from
the senate following his conviction for  tax fraud .  Portugal (GSPT10YR) ’s
10-year yield reached a six-week high as a report said European
Union and International Monetary Fund officials are discussing a
precautionary program for the country.  “The big thing today is Italy underperforming,” said
 Vincent Chaigneau , global head of rates and foreign-exchange
strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris. The PMI data “is
quite worrying for Italian growth. We don’t see reforms in
Italy, and without reform it’s hard to see any real recovery.”  Italian 10-year yields rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.42 percent at 4:17 p.m. London time. The
rate reached 4.48 percent on Aug. 28, the highest since July 18.
The 4.5 percent bond maturing in May 2023 fell 0.545, or 5.45
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,320) face amount, to 100.99.  Italy’s services  index  was at 48.8 from 48.7 in July,
Markit Economics said. Analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast a reading of 49.9. A figure below 50 indicates
contraction.  Yield Spread  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold 10-year Italian bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds
widened eight basis points to 248 basis points. It reached this
year’s low of 227 basis points on Aug. 19.  The spread has narrowed about 113 basis points since
reaching this year’s high of 361 basis points on March 28 as
improving economic data in the euro area boosted demand for
riskier assets.  The rate on Spanish 10-year bonds increased four basis
points to 4.51 percent after climbing five basis points
yesterday.  Spain  plans to sell as much as 4 billion euros of
securities maturing in 2018 and 2023 tomorrow.  Spain last sold its benchmark 10-year securities on July 18
at an average yield of 4.723 percent, compared with a rate of
4.765 percent at a previous auction on June 20.  A precautionary program for  Portugal  is one of the topics
that Portuguese Vice Premier Paulo Portas and Finance Minister
Maria Luis  Albuquerque  are discussing in meetings with EU and
IMF officials, Diario Economico reported, without saying how it
got the information.  Portugal’s 10-year yields climbed seven basis points to
6.77 percent after rising to 6.79 percent, the highest since
July 22.  German Auction  German bunds were little changed before the  European
Central Bank  announces its policy decision tomorrow.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yielded 1.94 percent. The Finance
Agency sold 4 billion euros of five-year notes at an average
yield of 1 percent, the highest level since December 2011. That
compared with a rate of 0.64 percent at the previous sale on
Aug. 7. Investors bid for 1.5 times the amount of securities
allotted versus 1.61 times last month.  The ECB will leave its key  interest rate  at a record-low
0.5 percent tomorrow, according to the median of 56 economist
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Spain and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  The yield spread between  Sweden ’s 10-year bonds and
similar-maturity German bunds widened to 66 basis points, the
most since 2003, as the Scandinavian nation sold 3.5 billion
kronor ($529 million) of securities due in November 2023.  Italian bonds earned 3.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish
securities returned 7.9 percent, while Germany’s lost 2.6
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
