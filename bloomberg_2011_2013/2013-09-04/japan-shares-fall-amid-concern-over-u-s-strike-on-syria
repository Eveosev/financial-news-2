Japanese  shares  rose a third day,
with the  Topix (TPX)  index headed for the longest winning streak in
almost seven weeks, as shipping lines advanced.  Olympus Corp. (7733) 
tumbled after saying it will be prosecuted in the U.K.  Nippon Yusen K.K. climbed 2.8 percent as shippers gained
the most among the Topix’s 33 industry groups after Nomura
Holdings Inc. raised its outlook on the sector. Toyota Motor
Corp. rose 0.5 percent as the yen weakened. Olympus sank 2.9
percent after saying U.K. authorities will charge the endoscope
maker with misleading auditors.  The Topix climbed 0.6 percent to 1,156.30 at the close in
Tokyo after falling as much as 0.8 percent amid mounting concern
the U.S. will strike  Syria . The gauge yesterday added 2.8
percent, the most since Aug. 2. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained 0.5 percent to 14,053.87, its highest in almost a month.  “If the U.S. does take military action against Syria,
there’s a chance it won’t end quickly and  oil prices  will remain
high,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , a Tokyo-based equities manager at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest
lender by market value. “Optimism for increased earnings
because of the weaker yen, stronger oil prices and hopes that
Japan will get chosen to host the Olympics is supportive for the
stock market, so there will be some buying on dips.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1
percent. The gauge added 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday as
the  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.  manufacturing index

Readings above 50 percent indicate growth.  Syria Situation  U.S. stocks pared gains after Speaker of the House  John
Boehner  and Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  backed President  Barack
Obama  on strikes against Syria. The head of state urged Congress
to take a prompt vote authorizing military strikes. Leaders of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed on a draft
resolution permitting force against Syria that would set a 90-day limit on any action.  Shippers gained the most on Japan’s broader equity gauge,
with the Topix Marine Transportation Index rising 2.7 percent.
 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , Japan’s biggest shipper by market
value, added 2.2 percent to 416 yen. Nippon Yusen, the second-biggest, gained 2.8 percent to 296 yen.  A recovery in the euro-region economy and an increase in
iron-ore freight rates will support shares, Nomura analyst
Masaharu Hirokane wrote in a report.  Sales Tax  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will announce his decision on
Oct. 2 on whether to raise the  sales tax ,  Kyodo News  reported
today, citing an unidentified person in the government. Japanese
shares could plunge 10 percent or more if the levy isn’t
increased as planned, according to 22 of 32 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Japan is set to lift the 5 percent
consumption tax to 8 percent in April 2014 and to 10 percent in
October 2015 to curb the world’s heaviest debt load.  The  Bank of Japan  began a two-day policy meeting today. The
central bank will probably refrain from adding to the
unprecedented easing unveiled in April, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  “Some investors are hopeful that should they increase the
sales tax, they will also add some additional monetary easing or
an extra budget as a package,” said Yoshihiro Ito, chief
strategist at Okasan Online Securities in  Tokyo .  Yen, Exporters  The yen lost 0.1 percent to 99.72 against the dollar, after

2,798 yen. The stock lost as much as 6.3 percent after saying
the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office alleged that Olympus’s Gyrus
Group Ltd. unit misled auditors in 2009 and 2010. The endoscope
maker was fined 700 million yen in  Japan  for covering up losses.  The Topix traded at 1.21 times  book value  today, compared
