China Merchants Bank Co. (3968)  raised 27.5
billion  yuan  ($4.5 billion) in the  Shanghai  portion of a rights
offer, paving the way for it to complete the world’s third-largest share sale this year.  Investors holding 96.4 percent of the Shanghai-traded
shares subscribed to the offer, Merchants Bank said in an
exchange filing yesterday. The Shenzhen-based lender said last
month it planned to raise 34.8 billion yuan by offering 3.07
billion Shanghai-listed shares at 9.29 yuan and 680.4 million
traded in  Hong Kong  for HK$11.68 each. The result of the Hong
Kong sale will be announced Sept. 26, the bank said last month.  Merchants Bank kicks off a new round of fundraising by
Chinese lenders, who this year have announced equity and bond
sales seeking as much as 327 billion yuan amid more stringent
capital rules. The sale will help Merchants Bank, the nation’s
sixth largest, meet financing needs over five years, speed up
growth and cope with growing competition from smaller rivals
such as  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988)  and  Industrial Bank Co. (601166)   “We will see a wave of supplementary capital raising in
the next two years as subordinated bonds are being disqualified
as capital,” said Cheng Jiaoyi, a Shanghai-based analyst at
Qilu Securities Co. “China banks are boosting their internal
capital generating ability and the interval between each round
of fundraising has been prolonged.”  Lower Subscription  The subscription rate for Merchants Bank’s Shanghai offer
was lower than the 97.8 percent received by Bank of
Communications Co. in a June 2010 sale that raised 32.7 billion
yuan in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In the same month, domestic
investors bought 99.3 percent of Industrial Bank’s offer,
allowing it to raise 17.9 billion yuan.  Shares of  Merchants Bank  rose 1.8 percent to HK$14.70 in
Hong Kong as of 9:38 a.m. local time. The firm’s stock in
Shanghai added 0.2 percent to 10.68 yuan as it resumed trading
after being suspended starting Aug. 28.  Merchants Bank’s capital adequacy ratio fell to 10.72
percent as of June 30 from 11.41 percent at the beginning of the
year, and its core Tier 1 ratio dropped to 8 percent from 8.34
percent, according to its first-half earnings report. While both
measurements are higher than the minimum regulatory requirement,
they are the second-lowest among Hong Kong-listed mainland
lenders.  Capital Adequacy  Merchants Bank plans to improve its Tier 1 ratio to 9.5
percent and total ratio to 11.5 percent by the end of 2015,
President Tian Huiyu told investors at an online roadshow on
Aug. 26. The lender in June applied to issue 11.3 billion yuan
of new capital instruments to replace subordinated bonds that
mature this month and to boost supplementary capital, Vice
President Li Hao said during the roadshow.  The Chinese bank reported last month a 13 percent increase
in second-quarter profit to 13.3 billion yuan. Its earnings
growth for the full-year of 2013 may slow to 4.8 percent from an
average 36 percent increase in the past three years, according
to consensus analyst  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  Larger lenders  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. ,
China Construction Bank Corp. and Bank of China Ltd. have
announced plans to raise as much as 60 billion yuan each from
new tier-2 capital instruments with a writedown mechanism
triggered by a drop in their  capital ratios .  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  plans to sell 50 billion
yuan of similar debt, and raise another 40 billion yuan to boost
tier 1 capital. Industrial Bank said Aug. 12 it plans to raise
20 billion yuan of supplementary capital and China Citic Bank
Corp. said Aug. 28 it plans to raise as much as 37 billion yuan
with tier-2 capital instruments.  The Japanese government’s 747 billion-yen ($7.5 billion)
offering of  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  shares in March is the largest
stock sale this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
