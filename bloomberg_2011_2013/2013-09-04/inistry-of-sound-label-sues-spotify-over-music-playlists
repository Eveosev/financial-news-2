Record label Ministry of Sound Ltd.
said it sued Spotify Ltd. for copying its dance music albums.  Spotify, an online music provider, made playlists available
to its users that mirrored Ministry of Sound compilation albums,
the label said in a statement. The company said a lawsuit was
filed in  London  on Sept. 2.  “We aim to ensure that our creativity is protected and
respected,” said Lohan Presencer, Ministry of Sound’s chief
executive officer, in the statement.  Angela Watts, a spokeswoman for Spotify in London, declined
to comment on the lawsuit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
