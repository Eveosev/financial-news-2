A chemical plant discharged ammonia
into a river in central  China , killing fish along a 40 kilometer
stretch and prompting the company responsible to suspend trading
of its shares.  Authorities have cleared about 100,000 kilograms (110 tons)
of fish from the Fuhe River in Hubei province since Sept. 2
after the spill at a factory owned by  Hubei Shuanghuan Science
and Technology Stock Co. (000707) , the official Xinhua News Agency
reported today, citing local authorities.  The Shenzhen-based company’s spill underscores the
challenges that Chinese leaders face in fulfilling their
promises to no longer sacrifice the environment for the sake of
economic growth. Severe water pollution affects 75 percent of
China’s rivers and lakes, according to Judith Shapiro, a
professor at American University in  Washington .  The factory was ordered to halt operations after local
environmental protection department found ammonia exceeding
national standards in samples from its drain outlet, Xinhua
reported. Trading on the company’s shares were halted in
Shenzhen.  Hubei Shuanghuan manufactures chemicals including soda ash,
ammonium chloride and industrial salt.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
