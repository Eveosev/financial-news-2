Brazil ’s real gained for a third
day, its longest winning streak in two months, as signs the
global economy is recovering bolstered the central bank’s
efforts to strengthen the currency.  The real appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.3537 per dollar at
9:55 a.m. in Sao Paulo after gaining 1.1 percent the past two
days. Swap rates on the contract due in January 2017 fell eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 11.74 percent.  The central bank sold 10,000 foreign-exchange swap
contracts today worth $498 million, part of a $60 billion
intervention program announced last month and scheduled to
continue through December. The currency intervention is gaining
traction after data yesterday showed manufacturing in the U.S.
at a two-year high. A gauge of U.K. services growth expanded at
the fastest pace in six years, a report showed today.  “A more positive picture is being formed for the global
economy,” Carlos Kawall, the chief economist at Banco J. Safra
SA, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “Here in in Brazil, the
message from the central bank has been very incisive.”  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini said Aug. 31 he is
ready to provide liquidity to reduce volatility as needed and
that Brazil has a “cushion” of more than $370 billion in
international reserves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
