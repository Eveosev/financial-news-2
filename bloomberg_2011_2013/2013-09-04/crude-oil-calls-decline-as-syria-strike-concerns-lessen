Crude oil calls fell as underlying
futures retreated on speculation that supply disruptions from a
U.S. strike against  Syria  would be minimal if any.  Implied volatility of calls protecting against a 10 percent
increase in October futures prices on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange fell to 32.67 percent at 4:40 p.m. from 34.44
yesterday.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
November $140 calls, which fell 1 cent to 11 cents a barrel with
3,226 lots trading as of 4:41 p.m. December $145 calls were the
second-most active, rising 1 cent to 14 cents a barrel on volume
of 2,122 contracts.  At-the-money volatility for October options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was 27.38
percent, down from 28.58 yesterday, which was the highest level
this year. Volatility for puts covering a 10 percent drop was
little changed at 30.3 percent.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery fell 1.2
percent to $107.23 a barrel on the Nymex as the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee voted to authorize President  Barack Obama  to
conduct a limited U.S. military operation in Syria, the first
step toward congressional endorsement of the effort.  “The shock value of an imminent strike has gone away and
the market is getting less fearful of a disruption of supply,”
said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
 Chicago .  Calls Active  Calls accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume
today. In the previous session, bullish bets made up 61 percent
of the 113,874 lots traded.  June $120 calls were the most-active options yesterday with
8,450 contracts changing hands as they gained 11 cents to $1.08
a barrel. October $115 calls, the next-most active, rose 3 cents
to 63 cents on 6,325 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
40,597 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 37,015 lots
and December $105 calls with 34,814.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  -- With assistance from Kathleen Hunter and Laura Litvan in
