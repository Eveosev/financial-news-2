Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s
biggest investment bank, is exiting its real estate and
leveraged-finance investment-banking businesses in  Canada ,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the change.  Macquarie Capital Markets Canada cut “a very small
number” of jobs today in areas that aren’t considered
essential, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information hasn’t been made public. The Sydney-based firm is focusing on oil-and-gas, resources, infrastructure
and related equity capital markets in the country, the person
said.  A telephone and e-mail message left with David Fleck, who
heads Macquarie in Canada, wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
