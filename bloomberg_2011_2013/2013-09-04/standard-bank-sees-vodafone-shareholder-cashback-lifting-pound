Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) ’s $130
billion buyout of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s stake in their wireless
venture will be positive for the pound as the windfall it offers
stockholders may help support the recovery,  Standard Bank  said.  “At a time when monetary easing is running at full pelt
and governments have little cash to handover in the form of
lower taxes, any benefit stock owners can get from such
cashbacks, could make the difference between sustaining recovery
momentum or not,”  Steve Barrow , the London-based head of Group-of-10 currency research at the bank, wrote in a report to
clients. The transaction “could have positive repercussions”
for the pound.  Verizon will pay Newbury, England-based Vodafone $58.9
billion in cash and issue $60.2 billion in stocks. Of that,
$23.9 billion will be distributed to Vodafone shareholders in
cash.  The pound has gained 0.7 percent against the dollar and 1
percent against the euro since the deal was announced this week.
The U.K. currency was at $1.5607 and 84.43 pence per euro at
2:55 p.m. London time.  The deal will also benefit the currency as it “won’t be
paid with cash held abroad and hence it could well be positive
for sterling,” Barrow said.  Sterling has strengthened 6.3 percent in the past six
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 3.9 percent and the dollar climbed 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
