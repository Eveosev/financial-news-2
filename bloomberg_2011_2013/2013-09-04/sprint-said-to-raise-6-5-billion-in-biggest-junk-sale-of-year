Sprint Corp. (S)  raised $6.5 billion
yesterday in the biggest high-yield offering since 2008 as sales
of speculative-grade securities surpass last year’s record pace.  Sprint’s $4.25 billion of 7.875 percent, 10-year notes
priced to yield 498 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and its $2.25 billion of 7.25 percent, eight-year
debt pays a spread of 466 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Proceeds from the issue by the third-largest U.S wireless
carrier will be used for general corporate purposes, Bloomberg
data show. The securities are rated B1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, four levels below investment grade, and one step higher
at BB- at Standard & Poor’s.  Sales of dollar-denominated junk-rated debt this year of
$242.5 billion exceed the $202.9 billion sold in the
corresponding period of 2012, Bloomberg data show. Borrowers
issued a record $357.3 billion of high-yield debt last year.  The sale is the largest high-yield offering since June
2008, when Intelsat priced $7.1 billion of bonds through three
units, Bloomberg data show.  Yields on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield
index have declined to 6.86 percent as of yesterday from a
record high 22.65 percent during the credit crisis in December
2008 and reached an unprecedented low of 5.98 percent on May 9.  Offering Increased  The size of Sprint’s sale was earlier set at a minimum of
$4 billion, a person familiar with the transaction said
yesterday. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest underwriter of junk
debt, led the offering.  Sprint was bought by SoftBank Corp. in July for $21.6
billion in founder Masayoshi Son’s bid to make the Overland
Park, Kansas-based company a stronger rival against Verizon
Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., owners of the two biggest
U.S. wireless carriers.  Tokyo-based SoftBank’s takeover included a $5 billion cash
infusion, giving Sprint money to bolster its network and pursue
acquisitions.  Verizon is planning to sell as much as $50 billion of
investment-grade bonds to fund its purchase of Vodafone Group
Plc’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, a person briefed on
the company’s plans said Sept. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
