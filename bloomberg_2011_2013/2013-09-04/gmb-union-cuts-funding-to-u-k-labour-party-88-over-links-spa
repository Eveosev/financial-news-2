Britain’s GMB union said it will cut
the funding it gives the opposition  Labour Party  in membership
dues to 150,000 pounds ($234,000) from 1.2 million pounds a year
in a dispute about the links between the party and the unions
that founded it.  Labour leader  Ed Miliband  said in July he no longer wanted
unions to act as intermediaries between their members and his
party and that he was seeking a direct relationship instead.  The GMB said in a statement on its website that its Central
Executive Council met yesterday and “expressed considerable
regret about the apparent lack of understanding that the
proposal mooted by Ed Miliband will have on the collective
nature of trade-union engagement.”  The union, which has 620,000 members, is also cutting the
size of its political fund, which will reduce the money it has
available to support Labour directly.  Miliband proposes that, rather than every union member
being automatically affiliated to Labour unless they opt out,
they should have to opt in to supporting the party. That will
give Labour the right to their contact details, information
unions currently refuse to share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
