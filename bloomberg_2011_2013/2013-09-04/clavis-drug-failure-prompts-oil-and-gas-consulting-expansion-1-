Clavis Pharma ASA (CLAVIS) , a Norwegian
biotechnology developer, is to expand into consulting for the
offshore oil and gas industry after its experimental leukemia
treatment failed in a late-stage trial.  Clavis Pharma, whose shares have slumped almost  97 percent 
during the last 12 months, has agreed to buy Aqualis Offshore
Ltd., a marine and engineering consultant, for 70 million kroner
($11.5 million), it said in a statement today. The company will
carry out a 54 million kroner share issue to raise funds for the
acquisition, it said.  “The proposed acquisition represents a change in strategic
direction for Clavis to include a new business area of
specialist marine and engineering consultancy services,” the
company said. “The existing pharmaceutical activities of Clavis
will remain as a separate business area.”  Aqualis, based in  London , has operations in  Norway , the
U.S, Brazil, Singapore, Dubai and  Saudi Arabia , according to its
website. Durig the last three months it’s signed contracts
valued at more than $7 million, Clavis Pharma said.  Ferncliff, which is owned by Norwegian investor Oeystein Stray Spetalen, controls a 51 percent stake in Aqualis. Spetalen
is also a board member of Clavis Pharma.  Shares in Clavis Pharma gained as much as 18 percent, the
most in  almost five months , and traded 8.2 percent higher at
1.97 kroner as of 9:35 a.m. in the Norwegian capital. That gives
the company a market value of 66.5 million kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
