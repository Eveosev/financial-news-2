Iron ore shipments from  Australia ’s
 Port Hedland , the world’s biggest bulk terminal, climbed in
August as cargoes increased to  China .  Exports totaled 27.4 million metric tons from 26.6 million
tons in July and 22.8 million tons a year earlier,  data  on the
Port Hedland Port Authority’s website show. Shipments to China,
the biggest buyer, were 22.3 million tons from 20.4 million tons
the previous month and 16.7 million tons in August 2012.  China’s manufacturing resumed growth in August, indicating
the world’s second-biggest economy is strengthening after a two-quarter slowdown. The country will reach the government’s 7.5
percent growth target this year and maintain that pace in 2014,
a Bloomberg News survey of economists indicates. Strength in the
 iron ore  price, which rose for a third month in August, suggests
a mild rebound in China, according to Morgan Stanley.  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin fell 0.5 percent to $138 a dry ton today,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices have climbed 25 percent
from a low in May, reducing this year’s loss to 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
