Two Democratic House members who
oppose the authority President  Barack Obama  is seeking for a
military strike against Syria offered an alternative resolution
that would  prohibit use of U.S. troops in that country.  Representatives  Chris Van Hollen  of Maryland and Gerald
Connolly of Virginia said in a statement Obama’s request “could
open the door to large scale military involvement in Syria.”
Their resolution would ban “any American forces on the ground
in Syria” and limit the authority of Obama to take military
action to 60 days.  Obama has stressed he doesn’t want to commit ground troops
to Syria.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
