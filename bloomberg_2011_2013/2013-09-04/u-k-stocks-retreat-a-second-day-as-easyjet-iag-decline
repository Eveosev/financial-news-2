U.K. stocks  were little changed, as
travel companies declined on the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  and U.S.
officials voiced support for President  Barack Obama ’s call to
take action against Syria.  Ryanair (RYA)  Holdings Plc slumped the most in more than five
years in London trading as it said full-year profit may be at
the lower end of its forecast.  EasyJet (EZJ)  Plc lost 5.1 percent and
 International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  slipped 1.3
percent. Vodafone Group Plc gained 2.2 percent, limiting losses
on the benchmark gauge.  The FTSE 100 Index added 6.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to
6,474.74 at the close. The gauge reversed a loss of as much as
0.7 percent as Citigroup Inc. recommended investors buy U.K.
equities. The gauge fell 3.1 percent in August on concern that
the Federal Reserve will start reducing stimulus measures this
year, while the U.S. and its allies threatened military action
against Syria. The broader FTSE All-Share Index gained 0.1
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 1.6 percent.  “Does it make sense to take action in Syria and risk
making it a bigger regional issue? I would think not,” said Tim Rees, who helps oversee 255 billion pounds ($399 billion) at
Insight Investment Management Ltd in London. “You look at U.K.
and European economic data and you’d assume companies to be
participating more in the uptick.”  In the U.S., Majority leader  Eric Cantor  joined Speaker of
the House John Boehner in saying he will support Obama’s call
for the use of military force against the regime of President
Bashar al-Assad. The Senate’s foreign relations panel will vote
today on a resolution that sets a 90-day limit on military
action against Syria.  Ryanair Tumbles  Ryanair slumped 11 percent to 6.03 euros. Europe’s biggest
discount carrier said that full-year net income may be at the
lower end of its 570 million euros ($753 million) to 600 million
euros range. If yields, a measure of fares, continue to weaken,
profit may fall short of that target, the carrier said.  EasyJet lost 5.1 percent to 1,215 pence and British Airways
parent IAG slid 1.3 percent to 291 pence. A  measure  of travel
and leisure companies listed on the broader FTSE 350 Index fell
0.9 percent.  U.K. homebuilders slipped, with  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  declining 2.7
percent to 1,111 pence, and  Taylor Wimpey Plc  losing 2.5 percent
to 100.5 pence. Barratt Developments Plc dropped 4.9 percent to
299.5 pence as a measure of U.K. housing-linked stocks dropped
to its lowest level since April.  Vodafone, the  second-heaviest  stock on the FTSE 100, added
2.2 percent to 207 pence, as it rebounded from yesterday’s
biggest decline in more than 11 weeks.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  rose 1.9 percent to 1,271 pence, its highest
price in 10 months as a gauge of European oil and gas stocks
 posted  the third-biggest advance of 19 industry groups on the
Stoxx 600.  The volume of shares traded in FTSE 100-listed companies
today was 7.9 percent higher than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
