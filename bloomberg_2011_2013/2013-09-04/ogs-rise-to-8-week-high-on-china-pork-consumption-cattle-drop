(Corrects first paragraph of story published yesterday to
remove erroneous reference to  China  import ranking.)  Hog futures climbed to an eight-week
high on signs of improved demand for pork in China, the world’s
biggest consumer. Cattle prices dropped.  Prices in China for marbled pork meat rose 0.7 percent to
26.29  yuan  ($4.30) a kilogram Aug. 21 to Aug. 30, compared with
the previous 10 days, the National Bureau of Statistics said in
a statement on its website today. Wholesale pork in the U.S.,
which exports the meat to China, rose yesterday for the first
time since Aug. 23, government data show.  “There’s talk that you’re seeing more demand come in from
China,”  Christian Mayer , a market analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investments in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview. “When their price gets too high, they look for
cheaper alternatives, and that is currently the U.S.”  Hog futures for October settlement climbed 1.3 percent to
close at 89.125 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 89.475 cents,
the highest for the October contract since it began trading in
May 2012 and the highest for a most-active futures since July 9.
Prices are up 7 percent since the end of July.  Wholesale  pork  increased 0.6 percent to 95.49 cents a pound
yesterday, while  hogs  for immediate delivery at slaughtering
plants added 0.5 percent to 87.23 cents a pound, the first gain
since Aug. 15, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Bets on higher hog prices by  hedge funds  and other large
speculators totaled 76,198 contracts as of Aug. 27, government
data show. That’s more than four times the number of bullish
wagers a year earlier.  Cattle futures for October delivery slid 0.2 percent to
settle at $1.26 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for
October settlement rose 0.1 percent to $1.5925 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
