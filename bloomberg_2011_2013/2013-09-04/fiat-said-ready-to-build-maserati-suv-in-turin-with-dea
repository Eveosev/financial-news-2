Fiat SpA (F)  Chief Executive Officer
Sergio Marchionne may announce as early as today plans to move
forward with building a Maserati sport-utility vehicle in Turin,
two people briefed on the proposal said.  Marchionne, 61, is ready to build new models, including the
Levante SUV, as part of an investment plan for the main
Mirafiori factory, provided unions agree to concessions such as
extending layoffs, said the people, who asked not be identified
because the negotiations are currently taking place. A Fiat
representative declined to comment.  The Fiat CEO, who also runs Chrysler Group LLC, is meeting
with unions in  Rome  today to discuss the carmaker’s investments
in  Italy , Fim Cisl leader Giuseppe Farina said before the talks.  The Italian carmaker plans to extend temporary layoffs for
about 5,300 workers at Mirafiori, Fiat’s oldest and largest
factory, amid slumping car demand in Europe, three people
familiar with the matter said last week. Fiat wants workers to
stay home for most of the next year after an existing agreement
expires at the end of September, the people said.  Marchionne said in January that he was considering
assembling Maserati’s first SUV and Alfa Romeo models at
Mirafiori. Fiat halted new investment in the country in July as
it pushes Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s government to adopt
reforms that would help manufacturers with clearer work rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
