Co-Operative Bank Plc’s former chief
executive officer, Neville Richardson, said the lender’s owner
ignored his warning about the “disastrous” consequences of
buying 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  Giving evidence to U.K. lawmakers today, Richardson, said
he told the board of parent Co-Operative Group of the risks of
the transaction, yet then-group CEO  Peter Marks  wanted to
proceed. Richardson, 56, left the bank in July 2011.  “The deal as such was one which I could understand,”
Richardson said. “The problem that I have talked about is about
the timing of the deal and the capability of Co-Op Bank at that
time.”  Co-Op Bank must raise 1.5 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) to
plug a capital hole after the failure of its bid to buy the
Lloyds branches this year exposed a shortfall that stems from
acquisition of Britannia Building Society in 2009.  Richardson, who is also a former head of Britannia, said
Co-Op Bank was in “good shape” when he stepped down. Only a
third of the lender’s losses in 2012 and the first half of 2013
were linked to Britannia, he told lawmakers.  “We strongly disagree with Neville Richardson’s view
regarding the Britannia loan book situation,” the  Bank of
England  said in a statement.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Edward Evans  To contact the reporter on this story:
