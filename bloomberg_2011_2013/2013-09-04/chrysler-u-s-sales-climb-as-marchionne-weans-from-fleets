The pace of the comeback in U.S.
auto sales exceeded already rosy estimates in August, with a
total surpassing any month in more than six years and a sales
rate that was the fastest since 2007.  The superlatives rolled out throughout the day:  General
Motors Co. (GM)  had its best month since 2008 and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  its
best month of retail sales since 2006.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) 
deliveries surged 23 percent, while Honda Motor Co. and Nissan
Motor Co. each had their best August ever. Chrysler Group LLC
sales rose for the 41st straight month.  U.S. car and light truck sales rose 17 percent to 1.5
million units, the most since May 2007, according to researcher
Autodata Corp. That exceeded the 14 percent rise to 1.47 million
that was the average of 10 analyst estimates in a survey by
 Bloomberg News . The sales rate for the month was 16.1 million,
the most since October 2007, Autodata said.  “In 2007, we were achieving that sales level by giving
cars away because the auto companies had too many factories,”
 John Casesa , senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners
LLC, said today on  Bloomberg Radio . “Today, there’s real demand
for that product. It’s a fundamentally different industry.”  GM, Ford and Chrysler have closed unneeded factories and
rolled out better cars that are drawing demand from both retail
and fleet buyers, lifting the average prices paid for new
vehicles to record highs. That means today’s industry is much
healthier than automakers were last selling this many cars and
trucks.  Beating Estimates  GM deliveries rose 15 percent, topping estimates for an 11
percent rise. Toyota sales increased 23 percent, compared with
estimates for 15 percent. Ford deliveries gained 12 percent to
beat the 10 percent average estimate. Honda deliveries soared 27
percent, exceeding analysts’ projected 20 percent increase.  GM rose 5 percent to $35.85 at the close in  New York , while
Ford advanced 3.5 percent to $16.91. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index increased 0.8 percent.  Deliveries for Chrysler, majority-owned by  Fiat SpA (F) ,
climbed 12 percent, trailing the 13 percent average of 10
analysts’ estimates. Nissan sales surged 22 percent, exceeding
seven analysts’ average estimate of 17 percent.  The annualized industry  sales rate , adjusted for seasonal
trends, had been projected to accelerate to 15.8 million, the
average of 17 analysts’ estimates, from 14.5 million a year
earlier.  F-Series Pace  Ford deliveries of F-Series pickups surged 22 percent to
71,115, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said in its
statement. The company exceeded the 70,000 mark for the second
month this year, a feat it last accomplished in 2006.  “At August’s pace, we were selling one F-Series pickup
every 42 seconds,”  Ken Czubay , vice president of U.S.
marketing, sales and service, said on the conference call.  Sales of the Ram pickup surged 31 percent to 33,009 and
 Jeep Grand Cherokee  jumped 40 percent to 17,976, Chrysler said
in its statement. The  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company
reported gains for all five of its brands.  Deliveries of GM’s Chevrolet Silverado rose 14 percent to
43,603 and GMC Sierra gained 24 percent to 18,017. The Detroit-based automaker introduced revamped versions of the full-size
trucks this year.  “There’s no question that we’re still looking at lower
incentives and a richer mix with the new trucks,” Kurt McNeil,
GM’s vice president of U.S. sales operations, said during its
conference call.  Toyota-Honda  Toyota outsold Ford and Honda exceeded Chrysler deliveries
for the second consecutive month. Before July, Toyota City,
Japan-based Toyota last topped Ford in March 2010 and Honda last
beat Chrysler in April 2011.  Sales of Toyota’s Camry sedan rose 22 percent to 44,713,
and its Prius hybrid line gained 30 percent to 27,358.  Deliveries of Honda’s Civic compact surged 58 percent to
39,458 and its CR-V utility vehicle climbed 45 percent to
34,654, driving a record August for the Tokyo-based company in
the U.S.  Nissan (7201)  also recorded its best-ever August, driven by 20
percent increase in Altima deliveries and 37 percent gain for
the Rogue SUV. The Yokohama, Japan-based company is introducing
a new version of the compact utility vehicle late this year.  The largest Japanese automakers are increasingly contending
with Detroit Three competitors for retail buyers, as GM, Ford
and Chrysler reduce their share of sales to fleet customers.
Rental fleets used to be a dumping ground of sorts for the U.S.
companies that had too much production and not enough demand for
their cars.  American Cars  That changed after the Detroit Three shed  29 percent  of
their combined capacity to build cars and trucks in  North
America  from 2004 to 2012. They’ve also rolled out their most
competitive passenger cars in a generation, led by GM’s Impala
and Ford’s Fusion.  Fusion sales rose 14 percent last month. Ford plans to
boost North American production in the fourth quarter by 6.8
percent to 785,000 vehicles. Third-quarter production plans were
unchanged.  Auto output has contributed more than 15 percent of the
growth in gross domestic product since the second quarter of
2009, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, Ford’s chief economist, said during
the company’s call today. The U.S. economic recovery began in
2009’s third quarter. Spending on cars and housing helped
maintain “modest to moderate” economic expansion even as
borrowing costs increased, the  Federal Reserve  said today.  Hyundai-Kia  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s combined
deliveries rose 6.3 percent, trailing the 9.2 percent average
estimate of seven analysts. The Seoul-based carmakers have
trailed industrywide sales growth in every month since
September.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  posted a 3.4 percent increase in combined
August sales for its VW and Audi brands, according to separate
statements. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker trailed the
average of four analysts’ estimates for a 4.4 percent gain.  For consumers with stable employment and income, it’s a
“great time to be out there buying automobiles,”  Jonathan
Browning , the CEO of Volkswagen’s U.S. unit, said on a
conference call with reporters. “There are good vehicles in the
marketplace and great offers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
