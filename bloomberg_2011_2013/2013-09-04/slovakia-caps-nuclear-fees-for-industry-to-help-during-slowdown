Slovakia’s government agreed to
limit the amount that the largest industrial electricity
consumers have to pay into the state nuclear fund to help
businesses in the face of an economic slowdown.  The biggest electricity users will pay a maximum 2 million
euros ($2.6 million) per year into a fund designed for
decommissioning plants and disposing of nuclear waste, Economy
Ministry spokesman Stanislav Jurikovic said by phone.  “This will have a positive impact on the business
environment,” Jurikovic said.  Prime Minister Robert Fico’s government is trying to boost
competitiveness and revive economic growth, which it expects to
slow to 0.5 percent this year, from 2 percent in 2012.  Slovakia was forced to shut down two reactors at its V1
plant at Jaslovske Bohunice as a condition to its 2004 entry
into the European Union. The deactivation, partly funded by the
EU, will cost a total 1.14 billion euros, of which 130 million
euros remain outstanding, according to Slovak nuclear
decommissioning company Javys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
