Uganda , Africa’s biggest robusta
shipper, exported 3.36 million bags of coffee in the first 11
months of the year, surpassing the forecast of 3.2 million bags
for the full year, the Uganda Coffee Development Authority said.  Total shipments for the 2012-13 season, which goes until
the end of September, may rise to around 3.4 million bags,
Norman Mutekanga, UCDA spokesman, said by phone in Kampala
today. The country shipped 2.55 million bags in the October
through August period last season, according to UCDA.  The East African nation exported 318,338 60 kilogram (132
pound) bags in August, according to the UCDA. That compares with
232,453 bags a year earlier and 395,224 bags in July, following
the end of the main harvest for the southern and southwestern
regions.  Uganda mainly ships beans to the European Union, the U.S.,
Sudan, Switzerland, India, Singapore and  Russia . Robusta, which
is used to make instant coffee, accounts for around 70 percent
of the nation’s exports, the authority said.  The East African nation, which is the continent’s second-biggest coffee producer after  Ethiopia , consumes about 3 percent
of its annual crop, according to the African Fine Coffees
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
