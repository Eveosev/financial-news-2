Australia’s dollar rose to a two-week high after data showed second-quarter gross domestic
product grew at a faster pace than economists had predicted.  The Aussie added to gains from yesterday which came after
the  Reserve Bank  of Australia left  interest rates  unchanged at a
record low and omitted mention of further scope to ease policy.
The nation’s three-year bond yield, which is influenced by RBA
expectations, rose to its highest level since July 8.  “The Aussie has jumped up on the GDP news because the
number was a little better than markets were anticipating,”
said  Besa Deda , the chief economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in
Sydney. “The data is still supportive of our view that the RBA
may need to do more, and we think that one more rate cut in
November is likely.”  The Aussie rose 0.7 percent to 91.28 U.S. cents as of 4:57
p.m. in Sydney, after climbing 1 percent yesterday. It touched
91.28, the most since Aug. 20. The currency gained 0.8 percent
to 90.98 yen and earlier reached 91.05, the most since July 29.  New Zealand ’s kiwi dollar added 0.8 percent to 78.58 U.S.
cents and rose 0.9 percent to 78.34 yen.  The Aussie may extend gains after rising above its 10- and
21-day moving averages and will face selling pressure toward
91.20 cents, Deda said.  Australia ’s GDP rose 0.6 percent in the  second quarter  from
the first quarter, compared with the 0.5 percent expansion
predicted by the median economist estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. From a year ago, it gained 2.6 percent versus a 2.4
percent forecast.  Aussie Support  “The move back above 90 cents now turns into near-term
support and it looks like a lot of traders are happy to ride it
a little higher in the short term,” said Stan Shamu, a
strategist at IG Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The RBA did sound a little
less dovish and seem to have a wait-and-see approach given
they’ve already put a lot of cuts through the system.”  The central bank yesterday kept its benchmark rate at 2.5
percent following 2.25 percentage points of reductions since
since November 2011. In a statement following the decision,
Governor  Glenn Stevens  said the RBA will adjust policy “to
foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes
consistent with the target.”  Australia’s  10-year bond yield  rose three basis points to
4.02 percent today. The three-year rate climbed seven basis
points to 2.87 percent and touched 2.90, the most since July 8.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
