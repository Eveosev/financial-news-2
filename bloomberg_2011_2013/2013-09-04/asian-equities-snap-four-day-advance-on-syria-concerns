the  Bank of Japan  and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will boost
stimulus to offset an expected increase to the  consumption tax .  “The fact that Japan’s leaders are looking to counter the
impact of the  sales-tax  hike suggests that they are on top of
the situation and we should hear more about how they plan to do
so over the next week,” Stan Shamu, a Melbourne-based market
strategist at IG Ltd., said in an e-mail. “This could even mean
further stimulus might be on the way.”  Japan’s Topix index rose 0.6 percent as financial shares

unprecedented easing unveiled in April, according to a Bloomberg

this year, while the  S&P 500 Index  surged 15 percent, as
