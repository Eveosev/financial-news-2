Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the top
global merger adviser this year, named Stuart Bernstein as head
of a group that focuses on venture capital investors.  Bernstein, a partner who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986, will
remain global head of the clean technology and renewables group,
according to a memo from investment banking co-heads Richard J. Gnodde, 53,  David Solomon , 51, and John S. Weinberg, 56.  David Wells , a spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed the
contents of the memo.  “The venture capital community has become a strategically
important constituent of the division’s client franchise and is
critical to our ability to serve the needs of our emerging
growth clients,” according to the memo.  Bernstein, 49, previously ran the equity underwriting group
that serves financial institutions, according to the memo. He
became a managing director in 1999 and a partner the next year.
As head of clean technology, Bernstein has led Goldman Sachs’s
effort to finance $40 billion of renewable energy in a decade,
which began last year.  Frank L. Walters led the venture capital group before
taking the same role at  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. earlier this year.  Goldman Sachs is the top adviser on announced global
mergers this year and the leading equity underwriter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank is the third-ranked
adviser on global technology deals, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
