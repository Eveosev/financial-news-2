The trust for the United Nations
Clean Development Mechanism, the operator of the world’s biggest
greenhouse gas credit program, had an operating surplus of $82
million in the 18 months through June 30, as offset supply
increased.  Fees and other income amounted to $141 million in the
period, compared with expenses of $59.2 million, according to
data in a  statement  on the website of the UN Framework
Convention on  Climate Change . The Bonn-based trust was holding
$201 million, including funds carried over from the previous
period, the UN said.  The CDM receives registration fees from carbon-cutting
projects that apply for approval to issue credits, and issuance
fees when projects request supply.  Certified Emission Reduction credits from the program
closed unchanged yesterday at 58 euro cents ($0.78) a metric
ton, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe . They’ve plunged
97 percent since reaching a record high of 22.54 euros a ton in
July 2008, as issuance advanced and demand from factories and
power stations was crimped by the European Union’s economic
recessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
