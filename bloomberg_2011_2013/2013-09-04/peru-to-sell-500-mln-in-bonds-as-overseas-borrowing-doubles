Peru plans to issue debt overseas in
2014 after a two-year absence as the government boosts spending,
Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said.  The government will sell $500 million in bonds in the
international markets to pay for infrastructure projects as part
of a plan to raise $2.4 billion of financing abroad, twice this
year’s target, Castilla said in Congress.  President  Ollanta Humala ’s government is boosting spending
to offset slower private investment after metal exports slumped.
The economy expanded 4.4 percent in June, the second-slowest
pace in more than three years. A decline in mining royalties
won’t affect public works, Castilla said.  “We have lower levels of debt compared with countries like
Brazil,  Colombia  and  Mexico , which allows us to adopt counter-cyclical policies,” he said during a presentation of the 2014
budget.  The government is proposing to increase spending 9.7
percent to a record 119 billion soles ($42.4 billion). Local
bond issuance will reach as much as 2.65 billion soles,
including 1 billion soles to partly finance a $6.5 billion
subway project for  Lima , according to government’s 2014 debt
bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
