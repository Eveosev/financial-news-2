The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  increased 2 basis points to 154 basis
points as of 8:30 a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The measure, which jumped 16.9
basis points last month, is poised for its first advance in
three days, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to
120.5 as of 10:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The benchmark is on track for its highest level
since Sept. 2, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 0.5 of a basis
point to 90 basis points as of 9:27 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The gauge, which has ranged from 90 to
110.2 basis points this quarter, is set for its first rise since
Aug. 28, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
