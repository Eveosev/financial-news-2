Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  led gains
among U.S. life insurers after Barclays Plc  recommended 
investors buy the shares, citing rising interest rates.  Prudential, the No. 2 U.S. life insurer,  gained  3.7 percent
to $78.70 at 11:03 a.m. in New York. Larger rival  MetLife Inc. (MET) 
rose 3.5 percent to $48.72. CNO Financial Group Inc., Unum Group
and Lincoln National Corp. each climbed more than 2 percent.  Higher yields can bolster profits at life insurers, which
invest in bonds to back future payouts to policyholders,  Jay Gelb , an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a research note today. He
raised his ratings on MetLife and Newark, New Jersey-based
Prudential to overweight from equalweight.  “Life insurance fundamentals are likely to improve over
the next several years as a result of higher yields, a steeper
yield curve, and a recovering economy,” Gelb said in the note.
“Rising interest rates benefit life insurers because this eases
pressure on revenue and policy guarantees.”  Bond yields have risen this year as investors weigh the
prospect that the U.S. Federal Reserve will scale back its
stimulus measures. The  10-year Treasury (USGG10YR)  yields 2.86 percent,
compared with as little as 1.61 percent in May.  Prudential and New York-based MetLife advanced 48 percent
this year. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  is up 16 percent.  Barclays estimates that the 10-year Treasury yield will end
the year at 3.1 percent and reach 3.75 percent by the third
quarter of next year, Gelb said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
