The average pension pots of FTSE 100
directors rose about 10 percent to 4.7 million pounds ($7.4
million) in the year to April 2013, a survey of company accounts
found.  Pensions Watch 2013 , published by the  Trades Union Congress 
and based on data for the pensions of 294 directors, found the
average accrued pension was 259,947 pounds a year, or 25 times
the average employee’s occupational pension of 10,452 pounds.  “They are adding to the country’s growing inequality with
their platinum-plated pensions,” TUC General Secretary Frances
O’Grady said in an e-mailed statement. “For decades, companies
have been telling employees that decent pensions are an
unaffordable luxury. But these rules clearly don’t apply to
those at the top.”  The average pension fund increased by 410,000 pounds from
4.3 million pounds the previous year, the report found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
