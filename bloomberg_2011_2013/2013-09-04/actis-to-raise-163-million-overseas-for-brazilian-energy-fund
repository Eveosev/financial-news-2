Actis LLP,  the London-based
private-equity firm that invests in  emerging markets , plans to
raise 385 million reais ($163.4 million) for a new Brazilian
energy fund.  The Actis Brasil Energia Fundo de Investimento em
Participacoes fund will raise capital from investors outside of
South America’s largest economy, according to a statement filed
to Brazil’s securities regulator Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios
yesterday. The fund will invest an unspecified amount in
renewable-energy developer  Atlantic Energias Renovaveis SA ,
according to a separate filing. Actis declined to comment.  Atlantic Energias owns two wind farms in the northern state
of  Rio Grande  do Norte each with 30 megawatts of capacity, the
Curitiba, Brazil-based developer said on its  website . It owns
five small hydroelectric plants in the south with a total of
41.5 megawatts. A company official, who can’t be named because
of internal policy, declined to comment.  Actis may invest in  Latin America  about half of the $1
billion the fund is raising through the end of this year, Sergio Brandao, who leads the firm’s energy group in the region, said
in an interview in February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
