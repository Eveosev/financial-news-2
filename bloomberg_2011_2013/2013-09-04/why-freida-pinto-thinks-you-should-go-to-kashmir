Slumdog Millionaire  star Freida Pinto zooms across Dal Lake, in Srinagar, India, for this month’s cover. Hundreds of vessels dot the water here, including motorboats like the one Pinto is driving and the more ubiquitous  shikaras —wooden rowboats reminiscent of Venetian gondolas, with a single oarsman transporting passengers from one part of the lake to the other. To rent one (oarsman included), ask the manager of your houseboat or your hotel concierge to suggest several options; rides typically cost about $3 per person. More adventurous types go for the motorboat to water-ski and wakeboard ($60 per half hour). Get the look Stylist Mohan Neelakantan loves trawling the markets of New Delhi for glam finds like the gilded accessories he used for Pinto’s cover shoot. His favorites? “Khan Market is the perfect shopping destination in the city,” says Neelakantan. “From avocados to Indian beads, you get it all. It has a very old-world, colonial charm, with small alleyways and hidden streets.” There’s also treasure to be found in Lajpat Nagar: “It’s the complete opposite of Khan—a noisy bazaar, but very popular with locals for fabrics, accessories, and  pakoras  [fried dumplings] to snack on,” he says. “You get a taste of Indian mayhem here.” His one word of advice: “Bargain!” Here, a few pieces from Neelakantan’s New Delhi treasure hunt that made it into the shoot… The Story Our story on Freida Pinto, featured on this month’s cover, follows the Indian actress on a humanitarian mission through Ethiopia. But when it came to choosing a location for the cover shoot, the  Slumdog Millionaire  star and Mumbai native insisted on her home country. “Originally, the plan was for the photographer to meet us in Africa,” Pinto says. “But I thought, if this is going to be the cover of  Condé Nast Traveler , then I want to show India off to the world.” Pinto chose to be photographed in the city of Srinagar, in the northwestern Indian region of Kashmir. Though it has been riven for decades by a violent territorial dispute between Pakistan, local militia, and India, the situation has stabilized enough that Britain last year lifted its long-standing warning against travel to and between the cities of Jammu and Srinagar (the U.S. State Department still recommends avoiding travel in the region).  “My uncle was in the army and was posted to Kashmir, so I grew up seeing photographs of the physical beauty that surrounded him there,” she says, describing the mountainous, lake-filled landscape. The cool, Alpine-like topography of the region made it a summer retreat for members of the British Raj, and today its popularity is on the rise with middle-class Indian families and others eager to escape the oppressive heat of New Delhi and the surrounding plains. “I wanted to show that there is so much more to Kashmir than what’s reported in the paper and on the telly,” Pinto says. “It’s disappointing to think that when people begin researching Kashmir, they wind up reading about the unrest and the threat of danger in the past and maybe think that’s all there is, without ever learning what it’s like today.” The shoot itself took place over two days on Dal Lake—the region’s second largest, often called the “jewel in the crown of Kashmir”—where photographer Jonas Fredwall Karlsson made use of both the lake’s famed houseboats and the smaller rowboat-like  shikaras  that dot the water. “We had nine boats on the day of the shoot,” Karlsson explains. “The  shikara  Freida and I were in was very narrow and unstable—especially since she was standing—so we used rope to connect extra boats to the main one to steady it and prevent excessive rocking.” A houseboat contained all the clothing Pinto needed for each look, while the stylist, Mohan Neelakantan, was perched on yet another  shikara  nearby. “We couldn’t adjust anything or even lean into the other boat, for fear that Freida would lose her balance and topple over,” says Neelakantan. “So we had to shout instructions to her. She did all the clothing adjustments herself!” And what was it like for the cover girl, standing in a small, swaying shikara, adorned with gowns and jewelry? “It was nerve-racking. Jonas asked me to stand at the tip of the boat for most every shot so he could get a good background and make it look like something out of a fairy tale. I also have a bit of a fear of water,” Pinto admits. “From where I was standing, you could see straight down about 14 feet to all the lotus roots at the bottom. I thought, ‘I’d better not fall, or I’m going to get tangled up and trapped in them!’ ” While the result of all this production is a stunning portrait of the actress, Pinto sees herself only in a supporting role, with India as the star. “I love my country, and there is so much to experience here. One lifetime is not enough to take it all in." If you go According to  Jonny Bealby  of Wild Frontiers (he’s one of Wendy Perrin’s Top Travel Specialists, an expert on northern India, and has led tours to the region since 2005), Americans shouldn’t be deterred from visiting Kashmir, despite the  State Department’s caution . “The level of violence and insurrection has radically diminished in the last decade and is now almost nonexistent,” Bealby says. To get there, fly into Delhi, then catch a domestic flight to Srinagar—Air India and Jet Airways both have daily service. A stay on one of Dal Lake’s lavish houseboats is a quintessential Srinagar experience. Bealby recommends  Sukoon , which opened in April and has five bedrooms and a sundeck (91-9910025022; doubles from $125). The best hotel option is the  Lalit Grand Palace Srinagar , a 113-room former maharaja’s residence overlooking the lake, where both Pinto and photographer Jonas Fredwall Karlsson based themselves during the shoot. Lalit’s restaurant,  Chinar Garden , serves the traditional Kashmiri wazwan: a 20-course dinner of lamb kebabs, grilled fish, and curries (91-194-2501001; doubles from $275; entrées from $10).
