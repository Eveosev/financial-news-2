General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest
foreign automaker in  China , reported sales growth accelerated in
the country last month, helped by demand for its Wuling and
Buick vehicles.  Total sales in August climbed 11.2 percent to 245,799
units, after expanding 11.1 percent the preceding month, the
Detroit-based company said in a statement today. Deliveries of
Wuling vehicles, which account for almost half of GM’s China
sales, gained 12.4 percent to 112,139 units last month.  GM’s sales in China have risen 10.7 percent this year,
keeping it on track to reach its 2013 target of selling 3
million vehicles in the world’s largest auto market. To defend
its sales lead, the U.S. automaker is spending $11 billion by
2016 on new plants and products in China and is building four
assembly plants there to boost production capacity to five
million vehicles a year by 2015.  Buick deliveries rose 17.7 percent to 67,793 units on the
popularity of the Excelle line. Chevrolet sales to 50,029
vehicles, it said.  Demand for the upscale Cadillac marque doubled to a record
4,396 vehicles on demand for the XTS sedan and SRX crossover.
The low-cost Baojun brand sold 28.8 percent more vehicles to
7,606 units, the company said.  GM plans to introduce 17 new models this year in China, its
largest market, focusing on  sport utility vehicles  and luxury
models. The automaker is looking at adding nine new or refreshed
SUVs in China over the next five years.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
