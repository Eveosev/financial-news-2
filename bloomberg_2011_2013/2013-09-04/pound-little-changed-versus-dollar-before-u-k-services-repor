The pound strengthened to the
highest in more than three months against the euro as a report
showed U.K. services expanded at the fastest pace since 2006,
boosting demand for Britain’s currency.  Sterling climbed for a third day against the dollar after
Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply said their U.K.  services  index, based on a survey of
purchasing managers, rose to 60.5 last month from 60.2 in July
as a gauge of new business rose to the highest in more than 16
years. U.K. government bonds were little changed as Bank of
England policy makers began a two-day meeting today.  “The improvement in data in recent weeks has helped to
support sterling as it has forced some to reduce their short
positions,” said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency strategist at
Deutsche Bank AG in London, referring to bets the pound will
weaken. “While we remain relatively bearish on sterling because
of the country’s weak external position, positive data headlines
will probably underpin the pound in the near term.”  The pound climbed 0.3 percent to 84.45 pence per euro at
4:20 p.m. London time after reaching 84.27 pence, the strongest
level since May 16. Sterling rose 0.5 percent to $1.5640.  The pound will drop to $1.50 by the end of this year,
according to the median of 75 estimates compiled by Bloomberg
News. A separate forecast sees the currency weaken to 85 pence
per euro.  Services Expand  The services data beat the median  forecast  of 26 analysts,
which called for a decline to 59.7. The U.K. economic recovery
that started in the second quarter is gaining momentum, with
Markit’s reports on manufacturing and construction also showing
faster expansion in August.  “The forward-looking components -- new orders, business
expectations -- were uniformly stronger and suggest that growth
momentum in the U.K. can be sustained for now,” Jens Larsen,
chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets in  London , wrote
in an e-mailed note.  The pound strengthened 6.3 percent over the past six
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 3.9 percent and the dollar climbed 2.4 percent.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today it closed a trade that
bought the euro versus sterling with a potential loss of 0.2
percent, citing positive U.K. data.  The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
will keep its asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds
tomorrow, according to all 38 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Officials will hold the main  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5
percent, a separate survey shows.  Forward Guidance  Under the central bank’s forward guidance, the MPC plans to
keep its key interest rate on hold as long as unemployment
exceeds 7 percent. The jobless rate was at 7.8 percent,
according to data on Aug. 14.  The premium for three-month options granting the right to
sell the pound versus the dollar relative to those giving the
right to buy dropped 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point,
to 1.27 percentage points. The premium reached 1.64 percentage
points on July 5, the most since July 2012.  Ten-year gilts yielded 2.87 percent. They reached 2.90
percent yesterday, the highest level since Aug. 1, 2011. The
price of the 2.25 percent bond due September 2023 was at 94.63.  U.K. government bonds were the worst performers in European
markets this year through yesterday after bonds from Sweden and
 Denmark , according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Gilts lost
4.15 percent, the indexes showed, while Swedish and Danish
securities dropped 4.24 and 4.66 percent respectively. German
bonds declined 2.6 percent and Treasuries lost 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
