Malaysia’s ringgit fell the most in
a week after a U.S. factory index rose to the highest in more
than two years, bolstering the case for the  Federal Reserve  to
cut stimulus that has fueled fund flows to  emerging markets .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks snapped a four-day
gain after the ISM manufacturing gauge increased to 55.7 in
August from 55.4 a month earlier, official data showed yesterday.
Fifty is the dividing line between expansion and contraction.
Overseas investors sold a net 6.8 billion ringgit ($2.1 billion)
of Malaysian stocks in August, exchange data show.  Government
bonds  were little changed.  The ringgit dropped 0.6 percent to 3.3060 per dollar as of
9:24 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.3068 earlier, the weakest
level since Aug. 29. The ringgit has lost 4.4 percent this
quarter, the worst performance among Asia’s 11 most-traded
currencies after India’s rupee and Indonesia’s rupiah.  “The better manufacturing data adds to the U.S. economic
recovery and that strengthens the case for cutting bond
purchases,” said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at RAM Holdings
Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “We expect the ringgit to reach 3.2 to
the dollar by year-end on the premise of a recovery in global
demand led by advanced economies.”  Malaysia’s central bank will hold its benchmark overnight
 policy rate  at 3 percent, according to all 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before a policy review tomorrow.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, surged 30 basis
points, or 0.3 percentage point, to 9.28 percent.  The yield on the 3.48 percent government bonds maturing
March 2023 was 4 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
