The euro declined to a six-week low
versus the dollar as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials discussed an interest-rate cut at today’s
policy meeting.  The 17-nation currency also weakened against the yen as
Draghi, speaking after the ECB kept  borrowing costs  at a record-low 0.5 percent, said he would consider a further reduction if
money-market rates climbed too high. The dollar rose through 100
yen for the first time since July on speculation signs of
improvement in the  U.S. economy  will compel the  Federal Reserve 
to taper stimulus as early as this month. Foreign-exchange
trading surged to an average $5.3 trillion a day in April 2013,
a Bank for International Settlements report showed.  “Draghi is still not very confident about the economic
recovery, and that’s contributing to the weakness in the euro,”
Douglas Borthwick, head of foreign exchange at Chapdelaine & Co.
in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “The market knows
very well that the ECB is going to be on hold with a bias
towards lower rates for the foreseeable future.”  The euro slipped 0.7 percent to $1.3120 as of 5 p.m. New
York time, after reaching the weakest since July 19. The dollar
strengthened 0.4 percent at 100.11 yen after climbing to the
strongest since July 25. The euro depreciated 0.3 percent to
131.34 yen.  Krona, Rupee  Sweden’s krona declined versus all of its 16 major peers as
the nation’s central bank stuck to a plan to raise borrowing
costs late next year. The krona dropped 1.3 percent to 6.6786
per dollar after reaching the weakest level since July 16. It
fell 0.7 percent to 8.7623 per euro.  India ’s rupee advanced versus all 31 of its most-traded
counterparts after the country’s new central bank governor took
steps to boost dollar supply and lawmakers moved closer to
allowing foreign investment in pension funds. The currency
appreciated 1.5 percent to 66.1150 per dollar after climbing as
much as 2.3 percent, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The pound reached a four-month high versus the euro as the
 Bank of England  held its bond-purchase  target  at 375 billion
pounds ($584 billion). The decision was predicted by all 38
analysts in a Bloomberg  survey . Policy makers also kept the key
 interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent.  Sterling increased 0.4 percent to 84.16 pence per euro
after reaching 84.08, the strongest level since May 6. The pound
declined 0.2 percent to $1.5590.  Trading Surge  Foreign-exchange trading surged to an average $5.3 trillion
a day in April 2013, boosted by greater yen volumes, the BIS
said. Trading increased 33 percent since the same period in
2010, the BIS said, citing a survey of currency traders it runs
every three years.  The role of the Chinese  yuan  in foreign-exchange trading
“surged in line with efforts to internationalize the Chinese
currency,” the BIS said. Turnover in the Chinese currency
jumped to $120 billion a day from $34 billion a day in April
2010 as it became the ninth most-actively traded currency with a
2.2 percent share of global volumes.  Trading today in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $28.5 billion, compared with $25.9 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  totaled $6.5 billion, the largest
share of trades at 23 percent. Options on the Aussie dollar-U.S.
dollar pair amounted to $4.4 billion, or about 15 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 34 percent more than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day. Aussie dollar-U.S. dollar options trading was 159 percent
more than average.  Bearish Yen  The yen commenced a bearish trend after closing yesterday
weaker than key support at 99.60 per dollar, Roelof-Jan Van den Akker, an Amsterdam-based technical analyst at ING Group NV,
wrote today in a client note. The currency may fall to 101.35,
its weakest level since July 8.  The EBB’s Draghi is trying to convince markets that he will
keep  interest rates  low for an extended period to support the
euro area’s recovery from its longest-ever recession. Rate
expectations have risen close to levels that he described last
month as “unwarranted,” suggesting some investors are
questioning his promise.  While the ECB raised its forecasts for the euro area’s
economic growth this year, it cut the projection for 2014. Gross
domestic product will climb 1 percent next year, the ECB said,
compared with a 1.1 percent increase forecast previously.  Rate Pressure  “The downward revision to 2014 growth suggests the ECB, as
a whole, is looking through a lot of the recent upside in the
data, and cuts were hinted at today,” said  Stephen Gallo ,
European head of currency strategy at Bank of Montreal in
 London . “The Fed is moving towards taper, and other major
central banks are doing what they can to resist the upward
pressure on rates.”  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  non-manufacturing 
index rose to 58.6 in August from 56 the prior month, a report
from the Tempe, Arizona-based group showed today. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a drop to 55.  Fewer Americans than forecast filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  last week. Jobless  claims  declined by
9,000 to 323,000 in the week ended Aug. 31, less than the lowest
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, from a revised
332,000, according to Labor Department data issued today in
 Washington .  U.S. Data  U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 180,000 in August while the
jobless rate held at 7.4 percent, the lowest since December
2008, Labor Department data will show tomorrow, according to a
separate Bloomberg survey.  Fed policy makers are debating whether the economy is
strong enough to allow them to pare monthly purchases of $85
billion in Treasuries and mortgage debt, which tend to debase
the dollar. A Bloomberg News survey of economists taken Aug. 9-13 showed that 65 percent of them expected a reduction at the
Fed’s meeting on Sept. 17-18.  The dollar has strengthened 5.9 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has
fallen 9.7 percent and the euro is up 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
