China Railway Corp., which took over
operations from the disbanded Ministry of Railways in March,
plans to sell 20 billion  yuan  ($3.3 billion) of bonds next week,
two people familiar with the matter said today.  The state-owned company will sell 15 billion yuan of seven-year notes and 5 billion yuan of 20-year notes on Sept. 11, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private. The company last issued 20 billion yuan of seven-year
notes at 5.06 percent on Aug. 26, the highest for that tenor
since 2011, according to a Chinabond statement. It sold 10
billion yuan of 20-year bonds at 5.35 percent on Aug. 13.  Premier Li said in July that railroads are key for the
nation “to get rich” as he tries to stimulate an economy
growing at the slowest pace in more than a decade. The
endorsement hasn’t profited holders of rail bonds, which have
lost  1.7 percent  this quarter following a record cash crunch.
The average  yield  on seven-year railway bonds has climbed 50
basis points in the same period to 5.33 percent, the highest
since November 2011, according to Chinabond data.  The National Development and Reform Commission, the
nation’s top planning agency, approved China Railway to sell 150
billion yuan of bonds this year, according to a  statement  dated
July 3 and posted on Chinabond’s website. The train operator,
which took over the ministry’s 2.8 trillion yuan debt, has
issued 60 billion yuan of the so-called enterprise bonds.  The company is seeking feedback from investors and there’s
a chance it may adjust its planned sale accordingly, the people
said. China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co. rated the
company AAA, its top rating, according to a statement posted on
Chinabond’s website on Aug. 16.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
