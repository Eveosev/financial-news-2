The Australian dollar will
strengthen versus its U.S. counterpart after forming an inverted
head-and-shoulders chart pattern, according to Bank of America
Corp., citing technical indicators.  The Aussie may rise to 94.07 U.S. cents, approaching its
strongest level since June 19 and a “pretty sizable pivot”
established in November 2009, before resuming its longer trend
of decline,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and
interest-rates technical strategy in New York at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, said in a telephone interview. He said he set a
long-term target for the currency of 80.66 U.S. cents, the
lowest since July 2009.  “The Aussie should continue on its climb against most
currency pairs,” Curry said. “Once it’s completed, we should see
a much larger bear trend.”  A head-and-shoulders pattern comprises three consecutive
peaks on a chart, with the middle being the highest. A breach of
a neckline, drawn across the base of the three peaks, is seen to
indicate that a trend is about to reverse.  The Aussie gained 1.2 percent to 91.74 U.S. cents in New
York, after rising to the strongest since Aug. 19. It also broke
through its 50-day moving average.  The currency has fallen 8.4 percent this year against major
peers, the second-worst performer among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
