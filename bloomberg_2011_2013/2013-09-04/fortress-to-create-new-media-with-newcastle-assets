Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)  plans
to create a newspaper and website company, New Media, through
the bankruptcy of its  GateHouse Media Inc. (GHSE)  and the recently
purchased assets of  Newcastle Investment Corp. (NCT)   Newcastle has made “two investments in high-yielding local
media companies that will be combined and spun into a new
company,” Fortress Co-Chairman Wesley Edens said during a
conference call today. As part of the plan, GateHouse will file
a prepackaged bankruptcy next week, he said. Such prepackaged
reorganizations already have creditor support.  Newcastle, managed by New York-based Fortress, said today
it bought Dow Jones Local Media Group from  News Corp . for $87
million. The operations, including 33 local publications, will
be run by GateHouse, Newcastle said. More than 80 percent of
readers rely on a local newspaper and the industry’s distress
has created a buying opportunity, Newcastle said.  GateHouse’s 78 daily newspapers serve 10 million people in
21 states, according to the company’s  website . It also owns 91
advertising-only publications, 235 weekly newspapers, 350
locally focused websites and six yellow-page directories.  Newcastle, which owns 52 percent of GateHouse’s
$1.2 billion in debt, said it entered an agreement to
restructure the company by converting the debt into equity in a
new company. Other creditors will have the option of converting
their debt to equity or cash at a price of 40 percent of par,
Newcastle said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
