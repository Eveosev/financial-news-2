Olympus Corp. (7733) , whose former
president revealed a $1.7 billion accounting fraud that lasted
13 years, was charged in the U.K. for allegedly deceiving
auditors at a subsidiary.  Olympus’s Gyrus Group Ltd. unit misled auditors between
April 2010 and March 2011, the Serious Fraud Office said in a
 statement  today. The first court hearing on the matter will take
place Sept. 10, the SFO said. The potential financial impact of
the prosecution on Olympus’s business is unclear, the company
said in a statement to the Tokyo stock exchange.  Former Olympus President  Michael Woodford  said in October
2011 that he asked the SFO to investigate a report by
PricewaterhouseCoopers about payments made by the Japanese
company to advisers in a 2008 deal. Woodford went public with
his knowledge of the dealings after the Olympus board fired him.
The company was fined 700 million yen ($7 million) in Japan and
three executives pleaded guilty to covering up losses at the
maker of endoscopes and cameras.  “This won’t influence Olympus’ fundamentals,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo, adding that a decline in Olympus’ stock
price will be temporary.  Olympus fell as much as 6.3 percent and closed down 2.9
percent to 2,798 yen in Tokyo trading today.  “We just received the notice last night and so are still
going through it,” said Michiko Kawasaki, a spokeswoman for
Olympus. “We haven’t decided on the specifics on how we’ll
handle it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
