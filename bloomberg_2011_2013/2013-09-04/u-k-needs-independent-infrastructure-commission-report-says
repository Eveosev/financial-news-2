The U.K. should set up an
independent panel to identify long-term infrastructure needs and
monitor government projects designed to meet them, a report by
former Olympics Delivery Authority Chairman John Armitt said.  The report, commissioned by opposition Labour leader Ed
Miliband and the party’s finance spokesman, Ed Balls, calls for
the creation of a committee, appointed by government and
opposition parties, to consider how to meet requirements over
the next 25 to 30 years and deliver value for money.  “Over the last 40 years U.K. infrastructure has fallen
behind the rest of the world and is increasingly struggling to
cope with the demands we make of it,” Armitt, a former rail-industry chief who presided over the body that oversaw
construction of stadiums for the 2012 Olympics, said in a
statement. “An infrastructure fit for the future must now be a
national priority.”  The report suggests carrying out a review of the U.K.’s
infrastructure needs every 10 years, with its conclusions being
put to a parliamentary vote within six months of publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
