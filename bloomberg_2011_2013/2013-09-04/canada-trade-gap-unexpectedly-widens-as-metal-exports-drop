Canada’s trade  deficit  unexpectedly
widened in July as exports to the European Union fell to the
lowest since 2010.  The nation’s trade gap expanded to C$931 million ($887
million) during the month, from C$460 million in June,
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. The July gap exceeded
the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. The median of the 22 responses predicted a deficit
of C$250 million.  Canada’s economy is being weighed down by what the  Bank of
Canada  calls the slowest export recovery since World War II,
driven in part by tepid growth among its major trading partners.
Shipments to the European Union fell 16 percent in July to C$2.6
billion, the lowest since April 2010.  “Weak demand in Europe is clearly hurting exporters,”
 Benjamin Reitzes , an economist at BMO Capital Markets in
Toronto, said in a note to investors.  The July trade gap was the 19th in a row and extends the
longest streak of deficits in at least a quarter century.  The Canadian dollar weakened after the report, trading at
C$1.0514 per  U.S. dollar , down 0.2 percent, at 9:33 a.m. in
Toronto, after rising to as high as C$1.0479 earlier today.  Metal Shipments  Exports fell 0.6 percent to C$39.2 billion on a 7.3 percent
drop in shipments of metal and non-mineral products. Unwrought
precious metals and precious metal alloys, including gold, led
declines in that category with a 17 percent decline.  Shipments of aircraft and other transportation equipment
fell 22.8 percent in July. Energy and forestry-product exports
led gains, recording increases of 1.7 percent and 8.2 percent.  Imports rose 0.6 percent to C$40.1 billion, with  consumer
goods , the largest component, climbing 1 percent.  The volume of exports fell 1.7 percent and import volumes
rose 1.0 percent.  Economists anticipate exports will eventually accelerate in
the second half after flooding in  Alberta  crimped exports
earlier this year. Shipments of Canadian goods abroad slowed to
a 0.9 percent pace in the second quarter.  An improving outlook for trade will bolster growth to 2.1
percent in the third quarter, from 1.7 percent in the second
quarter, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
