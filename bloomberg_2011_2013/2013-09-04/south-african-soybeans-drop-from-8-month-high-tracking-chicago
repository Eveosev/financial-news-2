South African soybean futures
declined the most in more than four weeks, retreating from an
eight-month high, as the Chicago benchmark fell on a report that
showed heat and dryness had less effect on crop conditions in
the U.S. than some analysts expected.  The oilseed for delivery in December, the most active
contract, fell 2.2 percent to 5,840 rand ($570) a metric ton by
the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. That was
the biggest decline since Aug. 5. The contract yesterday climbed
as much as 2.1 percent to 5,995 rand, the highest since it
started trading on Dec. 19.  An estimated 54 percent of the U.S. soybean crop, the
world’s largest, was in good or excellent  condition  in the
latest week, down from 58 percent on Aug. 25, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a report yesterday, based on a
survey of the 18 biggest growing states. Soybeans fell 1.1
percent to $13.72 a bushel today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after climbing 2.2 percent yesterday on speculation dryness in
the past 30 days hurt yield prospects.  “Soy was the most vulnerable at one stage, most people had
expected it to drop, but yesterday’s USDA report showed that it
was not as bad as anticipated,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader
from Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd., said by phone in Johannesburg.  Yellow corn for December delivery in  South Africa  dropped 2
percent to 2,181 rand a ton, the biggest drop since July 24,
while the white variety for delivery in the same month decreased
1.6 percent to 2,333 rand a ton.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from white corn is used as one of the nation’s staple
foods, while the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
