(Corrects description of venture in headline, second
paragraph of story originally published Sept. 4.)  Siguler Guff & Co. and Cerberus
Capital Management LP, two private-equity firms whose
specialties include distressed debt, are teaming up to buy
nonperforming loans, according to two people briefed on the
investment vehicle and Delaware state records.  Cerberus will manage a partnership that will use capital
provided by Siguler Guff to invest in the soured loans,
according to the people, who requested anonymity because the
firms haven’t discussed the fund publicly. The fund, formed
under the name Cerberus/Siguler Guff NPL Fund LP, will probably
focus on European loans, according to one of the people.  Siguler has about $10 billion in assets under management,
primarily in direct investment vehicles, separate accounts and
funds of funds that allocate client capital to money managers
such as Cerberus. The firm’s Distressed Opportunities Fund II
LP, a $988 million fund that started in April 2005, invested
some of its capital with Cerberus, LBO Wire reported the
following year.  James Gereghty, the head of New York-based Siguler’s
distressed opportunities funds, declined to immediately comment.  George Siguler, Drew Guff and Donald Spencer initially
created the private-equity group of New York-based Paine Webber
in 1991 and began running the unit as an independent firm in
1995. Cerberus, founded in 1992 by  Stephen Feinberg  and William Richter, invests in private-equity deals, distressed assets and
real estate, and also originates loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
