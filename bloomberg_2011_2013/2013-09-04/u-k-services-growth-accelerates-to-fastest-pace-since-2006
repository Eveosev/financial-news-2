U.K.  services growth  unexpectedly
accelerated last month to the fastest pace since 2006 as
companies reported a surge in demand.  A gauge of activity increased to 60.5 from 60.2 in July,
Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said in a statement today in  London . Economists forecast
59.7, according to the median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. A gauge of
new business rose to the highest in more than 16 years.  The  U.K. economic recovery  that started in the second
quarter is gaining momentum, with Markit’s reports on
manufacturing and  construction (ECO2PMIC)  also showing faster expansion in
August.  Bank of England  policy makers meet this week after
pledging last month to hold the  key interest rate  at a record
low until unemployment drops.  “The U.K. is well on course to register a strengthening of
gross domestic product growth over the third quarter,” said
 Paul Smith , senior economist at Markit in London. The services
industry’s recovery, “which has been evident since the start of
the year, has legs.”  The pound extended its gain against the dollar after the
report and was up 0.2 percent at $1.5592 as of 9:36 a.m. London
time. The yield on the 10-year gilt slipped 1 basis point to
2.87 percent.  Manufacturing Rises  Construction grew at the fastest pace in six years in
August, and an index of  manufacturing  expanded the most in 2 1/2
years, Markit said earlier this week.  In the euro area, a  services index  rose to 50.7 in August
from 49.8 in July, Markit said. That’s below an Aug. 22 estimate
of 51. A composite index of services and manufacturing increased
to 51.5 from 50.5.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will keep its
bond-buying program at 375 billion pounds ($584 billion),
according to all 38 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Officials will also hold the key rate at a record low of 0.5
percent, a separate survey showed.  The meeting is the first for the MPC since it introduced
forward guidance last month. Under the plan, policy makers said
they won’t raise the benchmark rate at least until  unemployment 
falls to 7 percent. The jobless rate was 7.8 percent in the
second quarter.  The MPC will announce the decisions at noon in London
tomorrow The meeting was moved forward a day to allow Carney to
attend the Group of 20 summit on Sept. 5-6 in  St. Petersburg ,
 Russia . Minutes of the decision showing how officials voted will
be published Sept. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
