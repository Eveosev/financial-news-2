Safeway Inc. (SWY) , the second-largest
U.S. supermarket chain, agreed to curb leaks at 659 stores of a
refrigerant that causes climate change and depletes ozone, and
pay a $600,000 fine to the federal government.  The settlement today with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency is the most extensive in terms of facilities under Clean
Air Act rules that govern refrigeration equipment, the agency
said in a statement. Safeway violated the law by failing to
promptly repair leaks of hydro-chlorofluorocarbon, a greenhouse
gas that is used as a coolant. It will spend $4.1 million to
reduce those releases, the EPA said.  “This is a critical step to assure that companies that
make, use and handle these dangerous ozone-destroying and heat-trapping chemicals stop leaking them into the air,” David
Doniger, policy director for climate at the Natural Resources
Defense Council, said in an e-mail.  Hydro-chlorofluorocarbon, or HCFC-22, is as much as 1,800
times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of global warming
emissions, according to the EPA. The steps Safeway agreed to
take will prevent future releases of more than 100,000 pounds of
ozone-depleting refrigerants, according to the EPA.  Teena Massingill, a spokeswoman for Pleasanton, California-based Safeway, didn’t immediately respond to telephone and e-mail messages.  The agreement, filed with the complaint today in federal
court in San Francisco, resolves the lawsuit brought under the
Clean Air Act.  The case is U.S. v. Safeway Inc., 13-cv-04086, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
