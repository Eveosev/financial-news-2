Gasoline fell to a three-week low as
the summer driving season ended and as crude slipped on
speculation a U.S. strike against  Syria  isn’t imminent and would
be limited in scope.  Futures sank as much as 1 percent. A U.S. Senate panel will
vote today on a resolution to give President  Barack Obama  a
limited window to conduct a military operation in response to
what the U.S. says was the Syrian government’s use of chemical
weapons against civilians. U.S.  inventories  were 5 percent above
the five-year average in the seven days ended Aug. 23 and  demand 
dipped to a five-week low,  government data  show  “A strike is not imminent and if does occur it will be
relatively limited,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner
at the Energy Management Institute in New York. “There’s also
plenty of gasoline and demand is going to start coming down.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 1.91 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8455 a gallon at 9:46 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 20 percent above the
100-day average.  October gasoline’s premium to November gasoline narrowed
0.52 cent to 2.2 cents, the smallest gap for the contracts
nearest to expiration since July 8, indicating less immediate
concern about supply.  The motor fuel’s crack  spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 44 cents to $12.21 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent gained 25 cents to $4.88.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.2 cent to $3.589 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Retail prices are 23.5 cents below a year earlier, AAA data
show.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery fell 2.22
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.1261 a gallon on trading volume
that was 27 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI rose 25 cents to $23.94 a
barrel while the premium over Brent widened 5 cents to $16.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
