Desjardins Securities Inc. said
Edward Sollbach, a quantitative analyst and strategist with its
research unit, left the Canadian bank on Aug. 14.  “This was made in the context of an overall business
review and an ongoing alignment of our research product to the
overall needs of Desjardins,” said Mark Lucey, head of research
with Desjardins Securities, in a telephone interview today from
Toronto.  Desjardins has “backed away” from the type of technical
analysis that Sollbach used, Lucey said. He declined to say if
Sollbach had resigned or was fired and the company hasn’t named
a replacement. The securities firm is a unit of the Levis,
Quebec-based Desjardins Group financial services company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
