Hong Kong   stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index snapping the longest winning streak in three
weeks, amid increased odds of a U.S. military strike on  Syria .
China Construction Bank Corp. dropped after Bank of America
Corp. sold its stake in the mainland’s second-biggest lender.  China Construction Bank slumped 1.4 percent as trading of
the shares boosted volume on the  Hang Seng Index  to the highest
since June 25. Xinyi Glass Holdings Ltd. tumbled 5.9 percent on
the automotive-glass maker’s plan to sell shares. Zhaojin Mining
Industry Co., the mainland’s No. 2 gold producer, led materials
companies higher as prices for the metal rose yesterday as
Middle East turmoil drove demand for haven assets.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 0.3 percent to 22,326.22 at the
close in Hong Kong, after rising as much as 0.2 percent. Volume
was more than double the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. More than three stocks declined for every
two that climbed on the 50-member gauge. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index slid 0.2 percent to 10,233.03.  “Syria’s situation is not long-term but volatility may
rise,” said Cedric Ma, a Hong Kong-based senior investment
strategist at Convoy Asset Management Ltd., which oversees about
$260 million. “The market had a nice run the last couple of
days and this gives investors an excuse to lock in profits.”  The Hang Seng Index pared this year’s loss to 1.5 percent
as factory output data from around the world this week added to
signs of global economic recovery. The gauge is the second-worst
performer this year among developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg, and traded at 10.7 times estimated earnings, compared
with 14.8 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  CCB Slumps  China  Construction Bank slid 1.4 percent to HK$5.85 after
Bank of America agreed to sell its 2 billion-share stake in the
lender for $1.5 billion. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings
Plc and Citigroup Inc. earlier sold shares in Chinese financial
institutions after new international rules made it more
expensive to hold minority stakes in banks.  Xinyi Glass slumped 5.9 percent to HK$6.65 to lead declines
on the Hang Seng Composite Index. The company said it plans to
raise HK$793 million ($102 million) by selling shares to fund
capital expenditure.  Want Want China Holdings Ltd. (151)  fell 2.1 percent to HK$11.20
after Uni-President China Holdings Ltd. sold 42.3 million of the
snackmaker’s shares at HK$11 each.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.1 percent today. The measure
climbed 0.4 percent yesterday in  New York  as economic data
outweighed heightened concern over Syria. Data showed the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. manufacturing index last
month increased to its strongest since June 2011, exceeding
economists’ estimates.  Syria Situation  President  Barack Obama  won endorsement from top Republican
lawmakers to help makes his case that the Syrian government was
behind an alleged sarin gas attack against civilians last month.
Separately, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed on a
draft resolution authorizing force that would set a 90-day limit
on U.S. military action.  A measure of materials companies had the biggest gain among
the Hang Seng Composite Index’s 11 industry groups. Zhaojin
Mining jumped 5.5 percent to HK$7.50, while  Zijin Mining Group
Co. (2899) , China’s No. 1 gold miner, rose 1 percent to HK$1.98. Gold
yesterday traded above $1,400 an ounce, rising the most in a
week. The precious metal in August capped its first back-to-back
monthly gain in a year.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the H-share index, dropped 16 percent from a Feb. 1 high after
mainland economic growth slowed for two quarters. The measure
traded at 1.23 times book value, compared with a five-year
average of 1.77.  China Growth  Chinese President Xi Jinping said yesterday slower growth
was a choice that would allow adjustments to the nation’s
economic structure, which have so far included curbing excess
lending and capacity. Data this week showed manufacturing
strengthened, adding to signs China will meet its 7.5 percent
growth target.  Goldman Sachs yesterday raised its 2013 GDP forecast for
China to 7.6 percent expansion from 7.4 percent, joining Credit
Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
lifting projections.  Television-maker  TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings Ltd. (1070) 
surged 9.6 percent to HK$4.10, the  steepest gain  on the Hang
Seng Composite Index. Baidu Inc.’s and TCL’s 48-inch TV capable
of playing online videos will go on sale online today at 4,567
 yuan  ($746), the companies said in a joint statement ahead of a
news conference in Beijing yesterday.  Hang Seng Index futures declined 0.1 percent to 22,302. The
HSI Volatility Index gained 4.8 percent to 18.91, indicating
traders expect a swing of 5.4 percent on the benchmark equity
gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
