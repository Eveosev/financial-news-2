The Scottish government needs to
answer questions from the electorate about the economic
implications of independence before next year’s referendum,
according to the  Confederation of British Industry .  “The CBI is not convinced of the economic case for
independence,” Mike Rake, president of the U.K.’s biggest
business lobby group, will tell business leaders in Glasgow
later today, according to e-mailed extracts of his remarks.
“The break-up of the U.K. could be costly and create
significant economic dislocation.”  Analysis published by the U.K. Treasury this year raises
“serious questions” about the cost of independence, such as
maintaining different cross-border, tax, regulatory and legal
systems, Rake will say. Other issues include what currency
 Scotland  might adopt as well as the U.K.’s unified labor market
and Scotland’s position in the European Union, he will say.  Independence is the flagship policy of Scottish First
Minister  Alex Salmond  and his  Scottish National Party . Salmond
plans to publish a policy paper by the end of the year setting
out the semi-autonomous government’s proposals ahead of the
referendum that will take place on Sept. 18, 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
