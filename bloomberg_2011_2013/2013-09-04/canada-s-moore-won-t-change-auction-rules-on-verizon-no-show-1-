Canadian Industry Minister  James Moore  said the federal government doesn’t plan to change the
rules of an auction of wireless airwaves set for January after
 Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  said it won’t expand into Canada.  “To those who are looking at our policies, we are not
changing dates, we are not changing our policies, we’re moving
forward,” Moore told reporters today in Saint-Hubert,  Quebec .  Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said Sept. 2
his company wasn’t coming to Canada after it agreed to buy
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s 45 percent stake in  Verizon Wireless ,
giving it full control of the most profitable U.S. mobile-phone
operator for $130 billion in the biggest acquisition in more
than a decade.  Verizon’s decision not to invest in Canada may encourage
other carriers, possibly from abroad, to take a look at the
market, Moore said.  “We’ll see what materializes,” Moore said, adding he
won’t speculate about who may be interested.  The deadline for participants to register and submit a
deposit is Sept. 17 for the January auction. The list of
registrants will be published Sept. 23.  The three large incumbents --  BCE Inc. (BCE) ,  Rogers
Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  and  Telus Corp. (T)  -- waged a public relations
battle with the government over the auction rules that they say
favor foreign players such as Verizon. All three vowed Sept. 2
to continue lobbying the government to change the rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
