Denham Capital Management LP, a
Boston-based private-equity firm dedicated to energy investment,
moved one its managing partners to London to focus on  emerging
markets .  Scott Mackin, co-president and head of Denham’s power and
renewable energy team, relocated from New Jersey to head a four-person team, the company said in a statement today.  “Opportunities in power and renewable will be far stronger
in emerging markets than in the U.S.,” Mackin said in a phone
interview. “Moving to London gives us greater visibility on
deal flow and puts us closer to where we want to invest.”  Denham, which raised $3 billion for its sixth fund last
year, will focus its London office on finding investments in
 Africa , South America and Asia Pacific. The firm also has
offices in the Australia, Brazil and the U.S.  The company’s investments include stakes in Brazilian wind
developer Rio Energy LLC and solar-plant operator Fotowatio
Renewable Ventures, according to Denham’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
