The Ibovespa fell for a second day
as Brazilian raw-material producers dropped with commodities on
speculation that the U.S. will start reducing monetary stimulus.  Steelmaker  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  led
declines on the MSCI Brazil/Materials Index, which fell the most
among 10 industry groups. Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, dropped for the first time in four days.  The Ibovespa fell 0.8 percent to 51,238.60 at 10:43 a.m. in
Sao Paulo, with 52 stocks retreating and 20 advancing. The real
traded little changed at 2.3584 per dollar. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24  raw materials  lost 0.9 percent amid
speculation that better-than-forecast economic data in the U.S.
will encourage the  Federal Reserve  to slow a bond-buying program
that has boosted assets including commodities and emerging-market stocks.  “One of the concerns is that less liquidity in the global
markets will affect demand for Brazilian stocks,”  Alvaro Bandeira , a partner at Orama Asset Management, said in a phone
interview from  Rio de Janeiro . “Investors are waiting for a
more definitive sign from the Federal Reserve about the futures
of the stimulus program.”  Speculation that the U.S. is moving closer to a military
strike against Syria also is making investors more cautious,
Bandeira said. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote
today on a resolution that supports the use of force by the U.S.
military in Syria.  Usiminas, as Usinas Siderurgicas is also known, fell 1.7
percent to 10.26 reais. Vale lost 0.8 percent to 31.88 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
