Sprint Corp. (S)  is planning to sell
eight- and 10-year bonds as soon as today in its first offering
since November, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  Proceeds from the benchmark issue by the third-largest U.S.
wireless carrier will be used for general corporate purposes
said the person, who asked not to be identified because terms
aren’t set. Moody’s Investors Service may rate the securities
B1, four levels below investment grade, the person said.
Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kansas, last tapped debt
markets in November, selling $2.28 billion of 6 percent, 10-year
notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those securities
traded at 93.75 cents on the dollar to yield 6.93 percent
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. are the two
biggest U.S. wireless carriers, according to data from Bloomberg
Industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
