Western media outlets propagate
ideas from “hostile forces” that don’t want  China  to succeed,
Li Congjun, head of the official Xinhua News Agency, wrote in an
editorial.  China’s media must innovate to lead public opinion and
refute such reports, Li wrote in an editorial published in the
Communist Party’s flagship People’s Daily newspaper today.
Western media dominate global opinion and Chinese media’s sway
is out of step with the country’s international standing, Li
said.  Media outlets run by the Communist Party need to quicken
their expansion into digital and new media and develop Internet
and mobile offerings, Li said. That will allow them to maintain
their ability to direct public opinion, he said.  “If we cannot effectively rule new media, the ground will
be taken by others, which will pose challenges to our dominant
role in leading public opinion,” Li wrote in the article.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
