Jay Z, the entertainer who started
an athlete-representation firm in April, is selling his minority
share in the Brooklyn Nets to the team’s coach,  Jason Kidd , for
$500,000, the New York Post reported, according to people
familiar with the situation.  Team spokesman Barry Baum declined to comment in an e-mail.  Jay Z was forced to sell his .067 percent stake in the
National Basketball Association franchise to avoid a conflict of
interest after starting the  Roc Nation  sports agency.  Roc Nation’s clients include New York Yankees second
baseman  Robinson Cano  and Oklahoma City Thunder forward  Kevin
Durant . The company operates in a partnership with Creative
Artists Agency.  Jay Z, whose real name is  Shawn Carter , has won 17 Grammy
Awards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
