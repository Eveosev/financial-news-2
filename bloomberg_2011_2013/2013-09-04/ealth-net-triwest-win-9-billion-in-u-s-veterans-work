Health Net Inc. (HNT)  and TriWest
Healthcare Alliance Corp. won U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs contracts with a combined maximum value of $9.42
billion.  A unit of  Woodland Hills , California-based Health Net will
receive as much as $5.05 billion under an agreement to
coordinate specialty care for veterans, according to an
announcement today on a federal government website. TriWest will
receive as much as $4.37 billion through a similar contract.  The award is a lifeline for Phoenix-based TriWest, which
cut more than 1,500 workers after losing a $20.5 billion Defense
Department medical contract to  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  last
year.  “We have proven expertise in providing access to quality
health care and pride ourselves in delivering best-in-class
 customer service  to our nation’s veterans, even in the most
rural areas,” David J. McIntyre Jr., TriWest’s chief executive
officer, said in a statement.  TriWest said in the statement the Veterans Affairs
agreement was for five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
