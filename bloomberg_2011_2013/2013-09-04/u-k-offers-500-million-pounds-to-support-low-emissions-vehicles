The U.K. government sought advice
from industry on how it should invest 500 million pounds ($780
million) it has set aside to stimulate development of ultra-low
emissions vehicles by 2020.  The  government  is calling for companies to submit
suggestions on how it should distribute the money for the five-year period starting 2015 as it aims for every new car to be an
ultra-low emission vehicle by 2040. It follows 400 million
pounds of support provided to 2015.  “Our vision is that by 2050 almost every car and van will
be an ultra-low emission vehicle with the U.K. at the forefront
of their design, development and manufacture,” Transport
Minister Norman Baker said in a statement from his office in
London today. “This strategy moves us up a gear in pursuing
that vision.”  The U.K. is pushing to reduce greenhouse gas from vehicles
that contribute as much as 21 percent to the country’s
emissions. It’s aiming to curb the pollution by at least 80
percent by 2050 compared to 1990 levels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
