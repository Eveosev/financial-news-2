Vitafoam Nigeria Plc (VITAFOAM) , a foam-products manufacturer, posted its biggest gain in 12 weeks after
announcing plans to raise capital for expansion.  The stock climbed 9.7 percent to 4.41 naira by the close of
trading in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, the most since
June 12. More than 1.2 million shares were traded, or 1.24 times

million) by selling more shares to investors, a rights offer or
special placement, Chairman Samuel Bolarinde told shareholders
today in Lagos, without giving further details.  “Investors expect the expansion will increase income,”
David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co., said by phone today.  Vitafoam’s profit for the nine months through June rose to
480 million naira from 398 million naira a year earlier,
according to an Aug. 2 filling with the  Nigerian Stock Exchange .
Revenue rose to 13 billion naira from 11.2 billion naira.  The stock has gained 20 percent this year, compared with a
29 percent advance by the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
