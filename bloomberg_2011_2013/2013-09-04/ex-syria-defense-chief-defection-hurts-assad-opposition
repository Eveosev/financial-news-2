Syria ’s former Defense Minister General Ali Habib has defected, dealing a “blow to the morale” of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, a member of the opposition said today.  Habib had been under government house arrest in the coastal city of Latakia, Kamal Labwani, a member of the Syrian National Coalition, the main political opposition, said by telephone from Paris. Habib will be “an important source of information” for the West, he added.  The defection came days before the U.S. Congress was set to debate whether to allow U.S. President  Barack Obama  to strike Syria for what he says is the regime’s use of chemical weapons last month.  Labwani said the opposition had no hand in his defection and said Habib won’t join the opposition or the rebel Free Syrian Army. “He didn’t defect to join the opposition,” he said.  Habib was the leader of the Syrian forces in the U.S.-led coalition that ended Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait in 1991.  Several senior members of Assad’s government have deserted the regime, including former Prime Minister Riad Hijab who defected last year.
