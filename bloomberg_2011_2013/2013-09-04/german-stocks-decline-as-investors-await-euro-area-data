German stocks  declined for a second
day as investors awaited a report that may confirm the combined
economy of the euro area expanded last quarter.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Europeâ€™s second-largest airline,
retreated 3.2 percent as a gauge of travel and leisure shares
fell the most on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  K+S AG (SDF)  advanced 1.6
percent as Macquarie Research upgraded the potash producer.  The  DAX (DAX)  slipped 0.3 percent to 8,160.02 at 9:42 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The measure lost 3.7 percent last week on concern the
U.S. will take military action against  Syria  for deadly
chemical-weapons attacks. The broader HDAX Index also retreated
0.3 percent today.  A report at 11 a.m. in Luxembourg will confirm that second-quarter  gross domestic product  in the 17-nation euro area grew
0.3 percent from the previous three-month period and fell 0.7
percent from a year earlier, according to the  median estimates 
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Separate reports will probably show services activity in
the euro area, based on a survey of purchasing managers,
expanded in August and retail sales increased in July from June.  The Bank of England and the European Central Bank will
announce interest rate decisions tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
