Europe ’s 40  largest insurers  spent
as much as 4.9 billion euros ($6.5 billion) last year complying
with new regulations, according to estimates by Deloitte LLP.  The cost is equivalent to a one percentage point reduction
in return on equity, a measure of profitability, the accounting
firm said in a statement today. Insurers expect the expense to
continue at current levels until at least 2015, Deloitte said.  Insurers are grappling with income regulations such as the
Solvency II directive that are aimed at making the industry
safer. Solvency II, intended to harmonize the way insurers
allocate capital against the risks they take across the European
Union, was originally scheduled to come into force in 2013. It
may not now be implemented before 2016.  “The volume of new insurance rules has increased to a
level not seen in decades,” Francesco Nagari, insurance partner
at Deloitte, said in a statement. “The new agenda is leaving
insurers stretched, uncertain and requiring new capabilities.”  Deloitte estimated that the total cost of compliance from
2010 to 2012 may be as much as 9 billion euros, with the average
cost for each insurer exceeding 200 million euros.  Deloitte LLP is the U.K. member firm of Deloitte Touche
