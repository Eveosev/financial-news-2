PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , the soft-drink maker
that makes half of its sales outside of the U.S., said currency
fluctuations will cut revenue growth by about 2 percentage
points this year, more than previously forecast.  The company projected a 1 percentage-point effect in July.
Foreign-exchange rates will have an “unfavorable impact” on
full-year core earnings per share, Purchase, New York-based
PepsiCo, which is also the world’s largest snack maker, said in
a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi  has been trying to sell
snacks to countries with a growing middle class, such as India,
 Brazil  and Russia. The company has developed foods that appeal
to local tastes and added more spicy offerings to its line up.  PepsiCo fell 0.6 percent to $79.17 at 10:37 a.m. in  New
York . The  shares  gained 17 percent this year through yesterday,
while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 15 percent.  PepsiCo reiterated a forecast for earnings per share growth
of 7 percent, in constant currencies. Excluding certain items,
that would equal profit of about $4.39 a share this year.
Analysts estimate $4.34, the average of 16 projections compiled
by Bloomberg.  Revenue excluding structural changes, foreign exchange
translation and acquisitions will increase in the “mid-single
digits” this year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
