Ciena Corp. (CIEN) , a provider of fiber-optic networking gear for carriers such as AT&T Inc., rose the
most in almost three months after posting profit and sales that
beat analysts’ estimates.  Excluding some items, earnings were 23 cents a share in the
fiscal third quarter, the Hanover, Maryland-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts had projected 16 cents on
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed
to $538.4 million in the period, which ended on July 31. That
topped the $533.8 million estimate.  Ciena is increasing its market share and expanding into new
areas, helping it deliver more sustainable financial
performance, Chief Executive Officer  Gary Smith  said in an
interview. The company expects fourth-quarter sales to range
from $550 million to $580 million, compared with the $551.7
million seen by analysts.  “I don’t see an increase in carrier spending -- what we do
see is a shift in what the carriers are spending it on,” Smith
said. Areas such as mobile-to-landline network connections and
data-center equipment are hot spots, he said.  The shares rose 14 percent to $23.54 at the close in  New
York , the biggest one-day gain since June. The stock has
advanced 50 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
