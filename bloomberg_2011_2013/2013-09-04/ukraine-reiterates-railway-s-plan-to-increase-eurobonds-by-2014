Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister
Oleksandr Vilkul reiterated a plan by state-managed railway
operator Ukrzaliznytsya to sell debt abroad.  “Ukrzaliznytsya will be working in all available  capital
markets , including the Eurobond market, to implement its
investment programs,” Vilkul said in an interview at the
Krynica Economic Forum in Poland today. He didn’t elaborate.  Infrastructure Minister Volodymyr Kozak said in June that
Ukrzaliznytsya wants to triple or quadruple the $500 million
worth of Eurobonds it sold three weeks ago in the first half of
next year.  State companies including Ukrzaliznytsya and state road
operator Ukravtodor need to sell debt to revamp aging
infrastructure and help boost the country’s economy, which
contracted 1.1 percent in second quarter from a year before.
Ukravtodor has no Eurobond plans for this year, Vilkul said.  Conditions for Ukraine to attract loans under state
guarantees are as provided by the market, Vilkul said. “I
cannot say they are too good or too bad,” he said.  The yield on Ukrzaliznytsya’s 9.5 percent $500 million
Eurobond maturing in May 2018 rose to a record-high 13.152 as of
4:36 p.m. in Kiev.  To contact the reporters on this story:
