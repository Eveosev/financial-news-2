Sales of American Eagle silver  coins 
by the U.S. Mint this year surpassed the total for all of 2012
as investors snap up precious metals at a record pace and spark
a rebound in prices.  About 33.75 million ounces of the silver coins were sold so
far in 2013, compared with 33.74 million in 12 months last year,
according to data on the mint’s  website . In January, sales
reached an all-time high of 7.498 million, and averaged 3.65
million a month since then as demand heads closer to the annual
record of 39.868 million reached in 2011.  Silver prices surged into a  bull market  last month and have
gained 29 percent from a 34-month low on June 28, sparked by
demand for precious metals as an alternative asset. Holdings in
exchange-traded funds backed silver rose to a record 20,082
metric tons on Aug. 30 and are up 5.9 percent this year. Bets on
higher prices for the precious metal  advanced  for the three
straight weeks, data from U.S. Commodity Futures Trading show.  “Demand continues to remain very strong,” Paul Zimnisky,
chief executive officer of Madison, New Jersey-based, Pure
Funds, said in a telephone interview. “The lure of it being an
industrial metal is also giving it a boost as expectations of
demand in  China  are improving.”  Imports by China , the world’s biggest user after the U.S.,
rose for three straight months through July.  The  U.S. Mint  suspended sales of silver coins for more than
a week in January because of a lack of inventory. Sales of gold
and silver coins may rise to a record this year if demand
continues at the current pace, Richard Peterson, acting director
of the mint, said in a June 5 interview.  High Premium  The premium charged by dealers surged to 25 percent in
April, the highest since 2008, after prices slumped into a  bear
market  that month, according to Richard Nachbar, a coin dealer
based in Williamsville, New York.  The metal reached a 31-year high of $49.845 an ounce in
April 2011 as global central banks expanded their balance
sheets, boosting the precious metal’s appeal as an inflation
hedge.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 4.2 percent to
close at $23.415 today on the Comex, the biggest slump since
July 5. While prices are up from the June low, they are down 23
percent for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
