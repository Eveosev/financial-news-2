Global businesses are increasingly
looking to their home markets for demand, according to
accountancy company Grant Thornton LLP.  The proportion of companies expecting exports to increase
over the next year fell to 17 percent in the second quarter from
21 percent in the first three months of the year, according to a
survey of 3,224 businesses.  The finding reflects how  China  is looking to rebalance its
economy away from exports and how the U.S. is becoming more
self-sufficient as it begins to tap new energy supplies.  “We’re not seeing the end of globalization by any means
but the world’s largest exporters are all in transition,” said
Ed Nusbaum, global chief executive officer at Grant Thornton
International in  London .  The number of businesses anticipating greater trade dropped
3 percentage points to 13 percent in the Group of Seven and by
the same magnitude to 18 percent in the so-called BRIC economies
of  Brazil ,  Russia , India and China.  The survey nevertheless found a net 50 percent predicted
business revenues to rise in the next year, up from 48 percent
in the previous quarter. That number rose 2 percentage points to
45 percent and 67 percent in the G-7 and BRIC economies
respectively.  “With export confidence on the slide but revenue
expectations holding up, it is clear that business leaders at
growing companies are looking to tap into improving  consumer
confidence  and spending power in their own markets,” said
Nusbaum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
