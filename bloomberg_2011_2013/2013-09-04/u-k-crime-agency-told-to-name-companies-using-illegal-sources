The U.K.’s Serious Organised Crime
Agency has been given until Sept. 9 by lawmakers to release
names of insurance companies and law firms thought to have paid
detectives who illegally gained information.  Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee said the list must be
published by then or lawmakers will publish it themselves,
according to the office of the committee’s chairman, Keith Vaz.  SOCA has passed the Home Affairs Committee a list of
clients of four private investigators who were jailed last year
for using illegal methods to get information. The agency asked
the panel not to publish the names for fear of prejudicing
future investigations, and because it wasn’t saying any of the
companies on its list had broken the law. The committee in July
published the categories of companies as a compromise.  The list included 22 law firms, as well as 10 insurance
companies, an  oil company  and eight companies in financial
services.  SOCA have told the committee they will respond to them on
Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
