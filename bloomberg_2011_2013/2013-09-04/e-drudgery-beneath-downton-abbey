Over Labor Day weekend, I read  “The Maid’s Tale”  by Rose Plummer, an East Ender who spent about a decade as a servant in London’s big houses before she married an odd-job man. If you are ever tempted to nostalgia for the good old days, this account of her first day should put you off it: You can argue that these jobs were unnecessarily horrible. Certainly the nonsense of making lower servants sit on uncomfortable chairs just to reinforce their status is indefensible -- and hardly the only bit of nonsense in the book. Consider how servants are supposed to exit rooms backward, rather than turn their backs on their employers, and how they must find somewhere to disappear to if they encounter someone in the hall.  But the most galling elements are not anywhere close to the worst bits of the jobs she describes; they’re just petty annoyances. The bad things are the physical discomforts: the hours (from dawn until after dinner), the hands scrubbed raw, the knees crippled with arthritis as they tried to scrub the front steps white in coal-fogged London. Perhaps the employers should not have tried to keep their steps so white, and perhaps if they hadn’t held themselves at such callous remove, they wouldn’t have. And probably the jobs would have been a bit better if England’s income distribution had been more equal.  Yet many of these things were simply features of the time -- housewives as well as servant girls were making their hands red and raw with the era’s primitive cleaning solutions. When I was a child in the 1970s, all the dishwashing liquids promised to save you from “dishpan hands,” a mysterious ailment that I’d never seen. Nor has any child born since; you could keep your hands immersed in modern dishwashing soap all day, and the worst you’d get would be a bit of chapping around the cuticles -- from the damp, not the soap. But the women to whom they were marketing freedom from “dishpan hands” probably remembered the day when women who did their own heavy work frequently had red, calloused hands. For all the horror of these jobs, they were often actually better than the alternatives, as Plummer goes on to point out: “As a friend I made a bit later on once said to me: ‘I loved it when I started work – I might have had to skivvy for a load of toffs but at least they fed me and I had my own bed and a bit of decent food. At home I was an unpaid servant and the food was terrible and my mum and dad were always at me to get out of the house.’” For women without educations or family connections, domestic service was actually one of the better jobs: indoors, safe, and usually pretty well fed. It is customary to end these pieces by saying that these jobs went away, or got better, because unions and the government made them so, but this isn’t true. These jobs went away because the alternatives improved. Yes, by the 1950s, the normally affluent could not afford servants, thanks to the heavy taxation that had reduced their incomes. But long before that, the lives of servants began to improve, because domestic servants were getting scarce. With opportunities opening up in factories and offices, people refused to go into service unless they were treated quite well. World War II basically ended the heyday of the British domestic servant, not because of some law, but because the servants could get a better deal for war work. Economic progress made people too economically productive to waste hours of their lives making the steps white. So the steps stayed gray (at least until the invention of the pressure washer). That, in a nutshell, is the sum of human progress. So in honor of the recently passed labor day, let us now praise gray, dirty steps.
