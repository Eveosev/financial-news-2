Romania ’s economy expanded more than
initially estimated in the second quarter, boosted by industry
and exports as consumption struggled.  Gross domestic product  grew a seasonally unadjusted 1.5
percent from a year earlier, compared with a preliminary 1.3
percent reading on Aug. 14, the  National Statistics Institute  in
Bucharest said today by e-mail. GDP grew 0.5 percent from the
previous three months compared with a 0.3 percent initial
reading and a 0.6 percent increase in the first quarter.  As the end of the euro region’s record-long recession buoys
export demand, Romania’s economy will expand 1.9 percent this
year, according to the government, which raised its forecast in
July from 1.6 percent previously. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg are more optimistic, predicting 2.6 percent growth in
an Aug. 29 poll.  Final consumption rose 0.1 percent from a year earlier in
the second quarter after a 0.2 percent  contraction  in the
previous three months, according to the statistics institute.  Industry grew 1.4 percent in the second quarter,
agriculture advanced 0.6 percent, while construction declined
0.5 percent, it said. Net exports grew 6 percent in the second
quarter, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
