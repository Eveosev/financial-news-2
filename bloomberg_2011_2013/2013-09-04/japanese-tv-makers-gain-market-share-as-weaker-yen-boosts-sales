Japanese electronics makers grabbed
a bigger share of flat-panel television sales in the second
quarter as a weaker yen made their sets more competitive against
those made by companies based in South Korea and  China .  Sony Corp. (6758)  raised its portion of worldwide revenue in the
period to 8 percent from 5.2 percent in the first quarter,
researcher DisplaySearch  said  on its website yesterday.
Panasonic Corp. accounted for 5.3 percent of the industry’s
sales in the period, up from 4.6 percent.  Japanese makers regained some lost ground to  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) , LG Electronics Inc. and TCL Corp. as prices and
demand dropped. Global flat-panel TV revenue at the five largest
manufacturers combined fell 12 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, as demand from  North America  and  Europe 
weakened, DisplaySearch said.  “The weak yen and cost cuts by Japanese TV makers have
helped them advance their market share,” Keita Wakabayashi, an
analyst at Mito Securities Co. in Tokyo, said by phone. “The
overall market is not what it used to be as panel prices
continue to decrease.”  The Japanese currency has declined about 24 percent against
the Korean won in the past 12 months, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A weaker yen makes Japanese exports cheaper. The
dollar bought 99.76 yen as of 2:25 p.m. in Tokyo, after reaching
99.86 yesterday, the strongest since Aug. 2.  Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung Electronics had a market
share of 26.5 percent in the second quarter, falling from 27.8
percent in the previous three months, according to
DisplaySearch. The share of Seoul-based LG Electronics fell to
16.3 percent from 16.4 percent. Guangdong, China-based TCL, the
smallest of the top five makers, had a share of 5.1 percent,
dropping from 6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
