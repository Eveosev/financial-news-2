Most large corporations will admit to struggling with innovation. But in reality most companies, particularly those that manage to last for any reasonable period of time, do day-to-day innovation extremely well. After all, your laptop (if you still use one) is much more reliable than it was a decade ago. Your television picture quality is significantly better. Your cellphone sounds clearer and drops fewer calls. Your shampoo leaves your hair feeling cleaner. Your toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling that much fresher.  Where companies struggle is with the breakthroughs that reinvent existing categories or create entirely new ones. It's not like large companies never manage to do it. Apple spent most of the past 10 years riding successive waves of breakthroughs. Amazon.com turned its own internal IT capabilities into a multibillion-dollar cloud-computing offering called Amazon Web Services. And Nestl√© has created a similarly large business of coffee devices and related consumables under its Nespresso brand. But study the stories of these and related corporate breakthroughs, and it often seems that success traces back to a large dose of serendipity or the heavy hand of a charismatic founder. And there are plenty of stories of big bets that ended up disappointing. So it's no surprise that one of the most frequent questions senior executives ask us is how to increase the odds that their big bets on breakthroughs will pay off.   From our studies of corporate breakthroughs and our own experience in helping corporate giants such as Medtronic rethink the pacemaker market in India, Walgreens transform its corner drug stores into a disruptive mechanism to treat patients suffering from chronic conditions, and a Fortune 100 financial services company reinvent private banking, we've come to understand that large corporations have the best chances of successfully breaking through when three ingredients come together: 
Developing a breakthrough idea will never be a paint-by-numbers exercise. But this should not stop large corporations from redoubling their investments in breakthroughs. For as much as the world extolls the virtue of start-ups,  large companies are uniquely positioned   to address global challenges such as making health care more affordable, feeding the world's surging population, or dealing with challenges resulting from rapid urbanization. While it isn't easy, it is worth the effort.
