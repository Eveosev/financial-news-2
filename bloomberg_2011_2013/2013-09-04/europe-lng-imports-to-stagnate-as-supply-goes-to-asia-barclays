Europe won’t increase its imports of
liquefied natural gas next year because demand in Asia will
absorb new supply, according to  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   Global LNG supply is forecast to grow by 900 million cubic
feet a day in 2014 as four liquefaction projects start
operating, Biliana Pehlivanova, a New York-based analyst for the
bank, said in an e-mailed report dated yesterday.  “Global regasification capacity is set to grow by 2.8
billion cubic feet a day next year, with all but one terminal
located in Asia,” Pehlivanova said.  Asian demand will be led by  China , where five new
regasification plants are set to start by the end of 2014.
India, Malaysia, Indonesia and  Singapore  are also forecast to
increase LNG imports, Barclays said.  There are “risks” that demand my decrease in Japan and
 South Korea , as both nations plan to restart nuclear plants.
according to Pehlivanova.  “For South Korea, this is likely to affect consumption
later this year and next,” Pehlivanova said. “For Japan,
effects on consumption are likely to be limited until 2015.”  The tightness in global LNG markets may peak next year,
according to Barclays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
