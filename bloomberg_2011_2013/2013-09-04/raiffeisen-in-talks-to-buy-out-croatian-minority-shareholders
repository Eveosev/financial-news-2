Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ,
eastern  Europe ’s second-biggest lender, is in talks to buy out a
minority stake in its Croatian unit, Raiffeisenbank Austria dd,
held by three of its own shareholders.  Raiffeisen plans to acquire the 25 percent it doesn’t
already own in  Croatia ’s fourth-biggest lender from
Raiffeisenbank Zagreb Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH by the end of
the year, Susanne Langer, a spokeswoman for the company, said by
telephone yesterday.  New Chief Executive Officer Karl Sevelda plans to make more
of the bank’s capital compliant with new European Union
regulations that may force lenders to deduct the capital of
banks they don’t fully own. Raiffeisen, owned by regional
Austrian cooperative banks with declining profits and a lack of
access to  equity capital markets , has the challenge of
bolstering its financial strength without diluting existing
investors.  Raiffeisen-Landesbank Steiermark AG owns 60 percent of the
holding company, while Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberoesterreich AG
and Raiffeisenverband Salzburg regG own 20 percent each,
according to the Austrian company register. All three are
indirect Raiffeisen owners via Raiffeisen Zentralbank
Oesterreich AG. In similar deals, Raiffeisen last year bought
out some of its owners’ minority stakes in its Czech, Slovak and
Hungarian units.  Raiffeisen’s profit after tax in Croatia dwindled by two
thirds to 11 million euros ($14.5 million) in the first half of
the year as bad debt expanded to 14 percent of the loan book.
Its total assets in the Adriatic country are 5 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
