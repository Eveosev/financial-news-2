Syria ’s neighbors and the  United
Nations  urged the world to find a political solution to the
conflict in Syria that’s created more than 6 million refugees.  “These countries need unreserved massive support from the
international community and that support is not yet there,” UN
High Commissioner for Refugees  Antonio Guterres  told reporters
at a press conference at the UN in Geneva today.  More than one-quarter of Syria’s 22 million people have
been driven from their homes since the rebellion against
President Bashar al-Assad started in 2011, according to the UN
refugee agency. More than 2 million of those are seeking shelter
in neighboring Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.  Political leaders should come together to stop a conflict
that’s escalating with the use of chemical weapons, Guterres
said after meeting with ministers from the four countries.  The use of chemical weapons is “a threat to the entire
world,” Jordan’s Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters
in Geneva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
