An  Idemitsu Kosan (5019)  Co. and  Mitsubishi (8058) 
Corp. joint venture agreed to boost its purchases of liquefied
petroleum gas from  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  amid
increased demand for the fuel in  Japan .  Tokyo-based Astomos Energy Corp. will buy 800,000 metric
tons a year of LPG from 2017 to 2018, up 200,000 tons from an
earlier contract, it said in a Sept. 2 statement on its website.
Under previous agreements, Astomos will buy 400,000 tons a year
from 2013 through 2015 and 600,000 tons in 2016.  Japan’s LPG imports from the U.S. rose 48 percent in the
six months ended June 30 to 390,000 tons from a year earlier as
a shale-gas boom increased production of the fuel, according to
data from the  Finance Ministry . The Asian nation’s LPG
consumption will rise 5.6 percent to about 16.1 million tons in
the year ending March 2014, a government panel estimated in a
June report, citing a projected economic recovery.  Idemitsu Kosan, a Japanese oil refiner, owns a 51 percent
stake in Astomos Energy while Mitsubishi, the country’s biggest
trader, holds the rest, according to the venture’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
