Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened
against West Texas Intermediate as the U.S. benchmark lost
ground to Brent, while other oils produced on the  Gulf Coast 
were mixed.  WTI’s discount to its European counterpart widened by 54
cents to $7.68 a barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, with both oils’ outright prices falling as U.S.
officials consider action in  Syria .  When WTI weakens to Brent,
which is used to price foreign crudes, it can raise the value of
domestic oils competing for space in Gulf Coast refineries.  LLS gained 10 cents a barrel against WTI to a premium of
$4.30 at 1:53 p.m. in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened 30 cents a barrel to a
premium of $5.30. The premium for  Thunder Horse  gained 40 cents
to $2.90 a barrel, while Mars Blend fell 16 cents to a premium
of 25 cents over WTI.  Poseidon rose 20 cents to a discount of 25 cents.  Bakken crude from  North Dakota  fell 25 cents to a discount
of $5.75 a barrel to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
