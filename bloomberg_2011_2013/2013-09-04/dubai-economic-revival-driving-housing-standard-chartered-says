Dubai’s growing population and
improving economy are driving a rebound in the sheikhdom’s
housing market, rather than the type of speculation that fueled
the 2008 boom, according to  Standard Chartered  Plc.  Apartment prices have climbed 38 percent in 12 months and
the property rally is also being propelled by Dubai’s status as
a haven amid political and economic unrest in other parts of the
 Middle East , Carla Slim, an analyst at the London-based bank,
said in a report today.  Dubai, which built the world’s tallest tower and man-made
islands, is recovering from one of the world’s worst property
crashes. The market’s revival began in 2011, though this time
few buyers are quickly reselling homes to profit from rising
demand. That’s underlined by subdued mortgage growth, low off-plan sales and increasing regulations, Slim said.  “We expect housing-market supply to grow at the same pace
as demand, with new projects being launched in a more planned
and controlled manner than in the past,” Slim, who’s based in
Dubai, said in the report.  The Real Estate Regulatory Agency is requiring developers
to pay the full price of land and put down a 20 percent
construction guarantee as collateral to limit developers’
dependence on proceeds from sales of properties before their
construction, Slim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
