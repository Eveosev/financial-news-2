Richline Group Inc., owned by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , reached a deal to make and
distribute jewelry featuring the artwork from cards produced by

play a central role in our future product assortments,”
Richline Chief Executive Officer Dennis Ulrich said today in a
Business Wire statement that didn’t disclose terms of the
American Greetings deal. Richline also has relationships with
the Marie Claire brand and the National Football League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
