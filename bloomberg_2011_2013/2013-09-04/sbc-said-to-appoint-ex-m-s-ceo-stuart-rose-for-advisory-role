HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  appointed  Stuart Rose , former chairman and chief executive officer of Marks &
Spencer Group Plc, to its investment-banking unit’s European
advisory council, according to a person briefed on the move.  Rose, 64, will help advise HSBC’s clients in the retail and
consumer industries, the person said, who asked not to be
identified because the appointment hasn’t been made public.  A spokeswoman for Ocado Plc, where Rose is chairman, wasn’t
able to comment and HSBC declined to comment.  Rose stepped down as CEO of London-based Marks & Spencer,
the U.K.’s biggest clothing retailer, in 2010 and retired as
chairman on 2011. Sky News reported the appointment earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
