The Canadian dollar gained the most
in almost a month as data overnight showing economic growth
quickened in Australia and  China  boosted prospects for the
global economy and increased appetite for riskier assets.  The currency rose against the majority of its most-traded
peers before a Bank of Canada interest-rate decision in which
policy makers are forecast to leave the benchmark rate at one
percent for the 36th straight month by all 22 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The Australian dollar gained after the
nation’s economic growth picked up and China’s services industry
expanded.  “Canada is riding the coattails from overnight positive
data,” said Brad Schruder, a director of foreign exchange at
Bank of Montreal, by phone from Toronto. “I think this is more
a story of the Canadian dollar is just being caught up in
overall positive effects coming out of  Asia .”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.2 percent to
C$1.0512 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:32 a.m. in Toronto. Earlier it
gained 0.5 percent to C$1.0479 per U.S. dollar, the biggest
intraday move since Aug. 8 and the highest level in a week. One
loonie buys 95.13 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
