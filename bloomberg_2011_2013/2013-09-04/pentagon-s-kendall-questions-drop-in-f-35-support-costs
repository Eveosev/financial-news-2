The Pentagon’s weapons buyer
questioned whether operating costs for  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s
F-35 fighters will drop as low as the $857 billion over 55 years
predicted by the office developing the plane.  “We’re looking at that number,” Frank Kendall, the
Defense Department’s undersecretary for acquisition, said today.  He was asked about an estimate provided to lawmakers by the
F-35 program office in July that said maintaining a fleet of the
fighters would cost 22 percent less than the official estimate
of $1.1 trillion developed two years ago by the Pentagon’s
independent cost-assessment office. Operating costs include
expenses from spare parts to repairs and fuel.  “We are going to do a review of F-35 this fall and we’ll
get another estimate out of” the cost-analysis office, Kendall
said after speaking at defense conference in  Washington . “We’ll
probably make some adjustments. I do expect it to come down. I
don’t know if it will come down” to $857 billion.  The F-35 is the Pentagon’s costliest weapon system, with an
estimated price tag of $391.2 billion for a fleet of 2,443
aircraft, up 68 percent from the projection in 2001, as measured
in current dollars.  The rising costs and troubles in building the plane even as
it’s being developed have led to criticism in Congress. This
year, lawmakers, the Government Accountability Office and the
Pentagon test office have said the aircraft is making progress
in flight tests and in stabilizing production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
