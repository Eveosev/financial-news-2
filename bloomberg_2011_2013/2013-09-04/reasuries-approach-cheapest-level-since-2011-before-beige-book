Treasury 10-year notes fell for a
third day as the  Federal Reserve  said the economy maintained a
“modest to moderate” pace of expansion, bolstering a case for
policy makers to cut stimulus this month.  Yields on the benchmark securities climbed to almost two-year highs as consumers spent more on travel and tourism while
manufacturing expanded “modestly” from early July through late
August, the Fed said in its Beige Book business survey before
policy makers meet Sept. 17-18. Data in two days is forecast to
show employment growth quickened in August. The 10-year  term
premium , a model that includes expectations for  interest rates ,
growth and inflation, advanced to a more than two-year high.  “The data is fairly lukewarm -- it’s good enough to
convince the Fed to not continue a period of extreme
accommodation,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist
in  New York  at BNP Paribas SA, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “The market is fairly bearish for the near-term. If we get strong nonfarm payrolls, then it locks up
tapering for September.”  Ten-year  yields (USGG10YR)  rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 2.9 percent as of 5 p.m. New York time, based on
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield reached 2.93 percent on
Aug. 22, the highest since July 29, 2011. The 2.5 percent note
due in August 2023 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount,
to 96 19/32.  The  term premium  rose to 0.55 percent, the highest level
since July 2011. It was negative as recently as June 18.  Treasury Losses  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 9 percent to
$331.4 billion after reaching $364 billion yesterday, the most
since Aug.22. The figure is down from a 2013 high of $662
billion reached on May 22 and up from a low of $148 billion on
Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $313.4 billion.  U.S. government debt is on track to deliver a 3.6 percent
loss this year, which would be the biggest annual decline since
2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Accelerating U.S. growth has prompted Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  to pledge to slow monetary stimulus if the economic
expansion meets policy makers’ forecasts. The U.S. central bank
will reduce its monthly purchases of $85 billion at its meeting
this month, according to 65 percent of economists in a Bloomberg
survey last month.  “ Consumer spending  rose in most districts, reflecting, in
part, strong demand for automobiles and housing-related goods,”
the Fed said of the report that is based on anecdotal reports
from its 12 regional banks. “Residential real-estate activity
increased moderately in most districts, and demand for
nonresidential real estate gained overall.”  U.S. payrolls rose 180,000 in August, up from 162,000 in
July, and the jobless rate held at 7.4 percent, according to
economists surveyed before the data are released on Sept. 6.  Pimco’s Views  “Tapering nearly a sure thing,”  Bill Gross , founder and
co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management
Co., in  Newport Beach ,  California , wrote in a note on Twitter.
Gross estimates a $10 billion reduction in the Fed’s Treasury
purchases with “front-end friendly guidance.”  Gross’s Total Return Fund, the world’s biggest bond mutual
fund, shed $41 billion, or 14 percent of its assets in the past
four months through losses and investor withdrawals. It had $7.7
billion in net redemptions in August, according to researcher
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  Over the past four months, investors redeemed
$26.4 billion. The fund lost 3.9 percent this year, trailing 86
percent of peers.  Pimco Total Return (PTTRX)  had $251.1 billion in assets as of Aug.
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yield Forecasts  Treasury 10-year yields will end the year at 2.78 percent
and rise to 3.06 percent by mid-2014, according to the weighted
average of analysts’ predictions compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market is preparing itself for tapering,” said Tom
Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in New
York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “People are waiting to see the
Fed policy before they actually come back into the market and
buy. Until the uncertainty is removed, it will be difficult for
people to come back.”  Treasuries fell the most in almost two weeks yesterday as a
gauge of U.S. manufacturing rose more than forecast in August.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  factory index  climbed
to 55.7, a two-year high, from the prior month’s 55.4, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group’s report showed yesterday. A reading
of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  The 14-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year
yield rose to 64, from 61.6 yesterday, approaching the 70 level
that some traders see as a sign a market measure has risen too
fast and may be due to reverse course.  To contact the reporter on this story:
