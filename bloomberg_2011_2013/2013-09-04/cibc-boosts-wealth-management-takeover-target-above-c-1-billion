Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-biggest bank, is boosting the target size
for wealth-management takeovers to more than C$1 billion ($951
million) as it seeks to increase profit from the business.  “As we have worked through the universe of potential
acquisitions, it becomes clear that choices improve as we expand
the size of the universe under consideration,” Chief Executive
Officer Gerald McCaughey, 57, said today during a conference
sponsored by  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  in Toronto.  Canadian Imperial plans to expand its wealth-management
business through internal growth and takeovers so the unit
accounts for 15 percent of earnings, McCaughey said. It
currently generates 11 percent of profit, he said.  CIBC agreed in April to buy Atlantic Trust Private Wealth
Management from  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ)  for $210 million, a deal that
followed its August 2011 purchase of a 41 percent stake in
American Century Investments for $848 million.  Those takeovers provided “a good range” for the size of
transactions the Toronto-based lender was seeking, McCaughey
said in an April 25 interview.  “We are now open to considering acquisitions in excess of
C$1 billion that would accelerate how fast we get to 15 percent
of wealth that is part of bank earnings,” McCaughey said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
