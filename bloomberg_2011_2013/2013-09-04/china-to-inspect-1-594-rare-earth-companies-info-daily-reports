Rising Nonferrous Metals Share Co. (600259) 
and Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel  Rare-Earth  Hi-Tech Co. led
China’s rare earth stocks higher following a report the nation
will curb illegal production of the metals.  Rising Nonferrous rose 4.1 percent to close at 48.70 yuan
today in Shanghai, after climbing as much as 8.6 percent. Baotou
Steel Rare Earth increased 0.7 percent to 29.46 yuan. The key
Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2 percent.  China will inspect 1,594 rare earth producers and traders
nationwide as part of measures to halt illegal production, the
 Economic Information Daily  reported, citing a government
official it didn’t identify. The country, supplier of 90 percent
of the world’s rare earths, has imposed export quotas since 1999
to help conserve resources and cut pollution.  The U.S., the European Union and Japan complained in March
last year to the  World Trade Organization  about China’s limits
on shipments of rare earths, a group of 17 chemically similar
elements used in  wind turbines  and hybrid cars.  “The inspection is part of government efforts to crack
down on illegal mining, fueling speculations that the move will
drive up rare earth prices and benefit bigger companies,” said
Li Xiaolu, a Shanghai-based analyst with Capital Securities Co.  The Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  will
create a ‘blacklist’ of companies found to have violated rules,
the report said, without elaborating on the action the
government plans to take. Three calls to the Ministry of
Industry and Information Technology’s general office went
unanswered.  China’s southern provinces produced at least 37,000 metric
tons of so-called heavy rare earth minerals last year, more than
double the 13,400 ton output quota set by the government, the
Daily reported, citing the Association of China Rare Earth
Industry.  China Minmetals Rare Earth Co. gained 0.7 percent to 26.04
 yuan , while Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., whose parent has rare-earth assets, increased 3.7 percent to HK$2.80 in Hong Kong
trading.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
