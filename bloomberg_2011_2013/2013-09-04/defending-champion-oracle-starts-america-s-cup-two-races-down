Defending champion Oracle Team USA
will begin the America’s Cup two races down after crew members
violated modification rules on its smaller yachts.  The best-of-17 series between Oracle and Emirates Team  New
Zealand  begins with two races on Sept. 7 in  San Francisco Bay .
Oracle will have to win 11 races to retain the most prestigious
trophy in sailing, while New Zealand needs nine victories.  Oracle’s primary wing trimmer and two shore crew were
banned from the regatta and the team was fined $250,000 for the
modifications on yachts used in the America’s Cup World Series
in 2012. Oracle uses larger yachts in the America’s Cup, which
was first contested 162 years ago.  “While we disagree with the unprecedented penalties
imposed by the Jury, we have no choice but to make the necessary
changes to personnel on our race boat and do our best to use the
next four days for the new team to practice and get ready for
the start of the 34th America’s Cup,” Oracle Team USA Chief
Executive Officer Russell Coutts said on the champion’s website.  In August, Oracle voluntarily withdrew retroactively from
the 2012-13 regattas in question.  None of the Oracle team’s senior management -- including
skippers Jimmy Spithill and Ben Ainslie, Coutts, General Manager
Grant Simmer and Shore Team Director  Mark Turner  -- was aware of
the rules breach, investigators said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
