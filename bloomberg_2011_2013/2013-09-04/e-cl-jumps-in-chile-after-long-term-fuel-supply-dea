E.CL SA (ECL) , a power-generation unit of
 France ’s  GDF Suez (GSZ) , rose the most in four months after saying it
had signed a long-term contract for fuel at its thermoelectric
plants in northern  Chile .  E.CL advanced 3.9 percent to 685 pesos at 12:44 p.m. in
Santiago, its biggest gain on closing basis since April 26.
Volume traded was six times the full-day average of the past
three months. The IPSA benchmark index climbed 0.3 percent.  The power company disclosed yesterday in a regulatory
filing a contract with Soc. GNL Mejillones SA that will
guarantee a supply of liquefied natural gas for its thermal
plants through 2026.  “Securing long-term supply of LNG is beneficial for the
company,” EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA analyst Ximena Garcia said today in an e-mailed research note. “We should see
a positive impact on this overly punished stock.”  E.CL’s stock has fallen 38 percent in 2013, the IPSA
gauge’s seventh-worst performance. The company reported an $8.51
million net loss in the second quarter as fuel costs rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
