The estate of  Boris Berezovsky , who
died in March, may be in debt by as much as 309 million pounds
($482.2 million), a lawyer said.  The debts could include 720 million rubles ($21.5 million)
to OAO Aeroflot, 100 million pounds to U.K. tax authorities and
a 3 million pound claim from the son of former Kyrgyzstan leader
Kurmanbek Bakiyev,  Philip Marshall , a lawyer for the Moscow-based airline, said at a hearing today.  “The information from the receivers points to
insolvency,” Judge Paul Morgan said at the hearing.  An autopsy found that Berezovsky died from hanging with no
evidence of a violent struggle, according to London police. Once
a multibillionaire, he faced mounting debt. He lost one of the
largest U.K. civil lawsuits ever filed against Roman Abramovich,
the Russian owner of the Chelsea Football Club, last year.
Berezovsky was “unimpressive and inherently unreliable,” the
judge said in her ruling in August.  Berezovsky’s daughter, who asked the court today to make
her interim administrator of her father’s estate, doesn’t agree
that he was bankrupt, her lawyer,  Anthony Trace , said.  “You say it is overwhelmingly likely this is insolvency,
we say the reverse,” said Trace, Ekaterina Berezovskaya’s
lawyer. “Your lordship cannot make a judgment one way or
another whether the estate is insolvent.”  If Berezovskaya’s application is successful, she will
replace  Grant Thornton  LLP as receiver on an interim basis,
Trace said.  A call to Grant Thornton’s press office wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
