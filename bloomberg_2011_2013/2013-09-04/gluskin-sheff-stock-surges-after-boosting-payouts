Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc. (GS) 
gained the most since January after boosting dividends and
 executive compensation  to retain talent.  Gluskin Sheff, a  money manager ,  advanced  2.9 percent to
C$21.70 ($20.68) at 2:49 p.m. in Toronto after earlier rising
7.7 percent to C$22.72, the most since Jan. 21. Gluskin has
climbed 45 percent this year, second-best among peers after
 Fiera Capital Corp. (FSZ) , which is up 51 percent this year.  “They increased their quarterly dividend,” Patrick Ruiz,
analyst at M Capital Partners Inc., said in a phone interview
from Toronto. “The market liked that.”  The Toronto-based company declared a special dividend of
C$1.40 and increased its quarterly dividend by 14 percent to 20
cents a share, from 17.5 cents, starting in the first quarter of
2014, the firm said today in a statement.  Gluskin increased the maximum percentage of performance
fees that go into the bonus pool to 40 percent from 25 percent.  “The pay announcement also is an indication that their pay
practices are in line with the market,” Ruiz said. “It brings
some stability to the business, where your only asset is your
people, and where people are motivated by compensation.”  Ruiz recommends buying the stock, and assigns a 12-month
price target of C$24.00, 14 percent higher than yesterday’s
closing price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
