U.K. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles asked to review a plan to redevelop the site of  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s London headquarters near the London Eye Ferris
wheel.  Pickles asked to study the plans because the project may
affect the Parliament area on the opposite side of the  River
Thames , the Communities Department said in a statement today.  “Ministers are very selective about calling in planning
applications and only take this step if planning issues of more
than local importance are involved,” the department said in the
statement. “The process will include reviewing all relevant
considerations, including the design and any potential impact on
the UNESCO World Heritage site by  Parliament Square .”  Canary Wharf Group Plc and Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund
won local-government approval in May to construct offices and
877 homes at the site. The project includes more than 1.2
million square feet (111,000 square meters) of real estate in
eight buildings ranging from five to 37 stories. The tower
occupied by Shell since the 1960s would remain part of the
development.  The government’s decision to review the project isn’t
unusual for large-scale developments, according to a spokesman
for The Hague-based Shell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
