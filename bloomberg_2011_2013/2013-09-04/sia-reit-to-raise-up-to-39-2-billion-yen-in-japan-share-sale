SIA REIT Inc., a Japanese real
estate investment trust, plans to raise as much as 39.2 billion
yen ($393 million) in the country’s third-biggest initial share
sale by REITs this year.  The REIT will issue as much as 78,435 shares in the sale,
according to the document filed through the nation’s finance
ministry. The sale includes a possible offering of 1.87 billion

the public for the first time, joining  Comforia Residential REIT
