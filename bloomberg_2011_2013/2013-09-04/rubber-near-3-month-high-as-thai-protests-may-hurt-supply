Rubber traded near the highest level
in more than three months amid speculation protests by Thai
farmers may disrupt shipments from the world’s largest producer
and exporter.  Rubber for delivery in February on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange swung between gains and losses, rising as much as 1.3
percent and declining as much as 1.2 percent before trading at
283.2 yen a kilogram ($2,844 a metric ton) at 10:21 a.m. local
time.  Rubber farmers have held protests in  Thailand ’s south to
pressure the government to subsidize prices. Finance Minister
Kittiratt Na-Ranong said yesterday the government will not
consider paying farmers guaranteed price for rubber for now.  “Protests by Thai farmers raised concerns shipments from
the country will be disrupted,” said Hideshi Matsunaga, an
analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo.  The Thai cabinet approved proposals from the rubber policy
committee to help subsidize production costs for small rubber
growers, according to the minister.  Thai rubber free-on-board rose 1.2 percent to 85.90 baht
($2.67) a kilogram yesterday, said the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand. The contract for January delivery on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange lost 0.8 percent to 20,835  yuan  ($3,403) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
