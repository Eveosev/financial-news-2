VimpelCom Ltd (VIP) , a wireless operator
with 215 million users, named Mikhail Slobodin, a former
executive of its billionaire shareholder Mikhail Fridman’s TNK-BP oil business, to head its largest unit in Russia.  VimpelCom appointed Slobodin to lead the unit, which
accounts for about 40 percent of the company’s revenue and
profit. Fridman and partners sold their holding in TNK-BP to
state-run oil producer  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  for $14 billion in March.  VimpelCom is lagging behind its competitors  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MBT)  and  OAO MegaFon (MFON)  by number of Russian users and
network size in the country. The company has been focused on
cutting its about $26 billion debt since buying
telecommunication assets from Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris in 2011.  “Although investors might be concerned Slobodin does not
have telecom experience, he has so far proved to be a strong
manager,” Ivan Kim, a VTB Capital analyst, said in a note
today. Fridman’s Altimo has been seeking to strengthen
management of the Russian unit,  Vedomosti  said last month.  VimpelCom Chief Executive Officer Jo Lunder said Aug. 7 he
had no plans to replace  Russia  head Anton Kudryashov as he had
achieved “substantial improvement” in the country’s business.
Kudryashov will be transfered to the head office in Amsterdam to
head the group’s business development, VimpelCom said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
