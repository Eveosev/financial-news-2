Steven Antonakes, the former
Massachusetts regulator who started the U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau’s bank supervision unit, has been named deputy
director of the federal agency.  The promotion for Antonakes, who has been acting deputy
since January after Raj Date stepped down, was announced by the
bureau in a statement today. He will continue as head of bank
supervision, enforcement and fair lending in his new role.  “Steve’s experience, his knowledge and his judgment are
vital in helping us achieve our mission of fostering a thriving,
sustainable marketplace for both consumers and responsible
businesses,” CFPB Director  Richard Cordray  said in the
statement.  Antonakes joined the bureau in 2010 during its formation
under the auspices of the Treasury Department and  Elizabeth
Warren , who was serving as an adviser to President  Barack Obama .
Before that, he was the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks from
2003 to 2010. He was the Obama administration’s first choice to
set up banking supervision at the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
