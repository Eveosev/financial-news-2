National Bank of Commerce Ltd., a
Ugandan lender, is in talks regarding the sale of its shares and
introducing Islamic banking in the country, central bank
Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebilie said.  New Vision newspaper yesterday  reported  that Bank of Uganda
has approved the lender’s takeover by Emirates Link for
Strategic Alliance, an Abu Dhabi-based company controlled by
Ahmed Darwish Al Marar, who is also chairman of France Telecom
SA’s Orange unit in the East African nation, according to the
Kampala-based newspaper.  “I can confirm that they are talking,” Tumusiime-
Mutebilie said by phone from Kampala today. “I don’t know what
level they have reached in the talks.”  A bill to cater for Islamic banking will be introduced in
parliament later this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
