Hans-Werner Sinn, head of the
Munich-based Ifo economic institute, said that  Greece  faces a
decade-long “illness’ if it stays in the euro area and tries to
increase its competitiveness by lowering wages and prices,
 Passauer Neue Presse  said today, citing an interview with Sinn.  A return to its old currency, the drachma, would be an
easier route for Greece, Sinn said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
