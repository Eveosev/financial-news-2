“ Harry Potter  and the Deathly

office tracker said. The screenings also set a sales record for
 Imax Corp. (IMAX)  locations, taking in $2 million at 274 theaters, the
widest release of any film on Imax screens.  “I feel pretty comfortable saying the three-day domestic
record is in jeopardy,” Dan Fellman, Warner’s president of
domestic theatrical distribution, said in an interview. “This
is bittersweet because we own it ourselves with ‘The Dark
Knight.’”  The previous Imax record was $1.4 million set by “Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1,” which opened at 238
Imax locations, Greg Foster, Imax chairman and president of
filmed entertainment, said in an interview.  “There are people outside our theaters and they’ve been in
line for many, many hours, in costume, having a party, waiting
to go in,” he said.  Warner Bros . Studios  Warner Bros. was  third  in domestic sales with $754.7
