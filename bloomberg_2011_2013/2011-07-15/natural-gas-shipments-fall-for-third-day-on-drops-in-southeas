Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators dropped for a third day as
deliveries to the Southeast declined.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 6 percent to 17.5 million
dekatherms (17.1 billion cubic feet) from yesterday’s 18.6
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The report
includes delivery schedules for 705 of the 742 pipelines as of

dropped 19 percent to 4.14 million dekatherms, with 185 of the
196 pipelines in the region having reported deliveries.  Temperatures in the Southeast will be in a normal range

normal, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
Maryland.  Atlanta may have a high of 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28
Celsius) tomorrow, 6 degrees below normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. The city had a

supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Scheduled deliveries to  Florida  fell 3.9 percent to 3.15
million dekatherms. All 80 pipelines have reported shipments.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at Florida Gas
