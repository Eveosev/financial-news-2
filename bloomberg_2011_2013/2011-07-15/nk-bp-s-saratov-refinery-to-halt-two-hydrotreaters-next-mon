TNK-BP, the Russian oil producer
half owned by  BP Plc (BP/) , will halt two hydrotreaters at its Saratov
oil refinery at the beginning of next month.  Both units will remain offline until the beginning of
November, according to data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK
unit. CDU-TEK collates information gathered from  oil companies 
operating in  Russia .  The Saratov plant, which is on the Volga River southeast of
Moscow, can process 135,000 barrels a day of crude, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A hydrotreater removes sulfur,
metals and other impurities from fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
