Uganda ’s shilling rallied, heading
for the first weekly gain in seven against the dollar, inflows
from exports and from the sale of the U.S. currency by local
firms to meet domestic expenses.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer
appreciated 0.7 percent, to 2,551.25 at 4:59 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, taking its increase this week to 2.3 percent,
the first since the five days through May 20.  “I understand that there are some inflows from exports,”
Ahmed Kalule, a currency trader at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd.
said by phone from Kampala. “Some companies which were holding
long positions are selling the dollar to finance local
operations.”  Uganda, East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy, is on the cusp
of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc, the U.K.-based energy
company, expected to start pumping crude and gas from the Lake
Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an estimated 2.5 billion
barrels of oil, with about 1 billion barrels in proven reserves,
according to Tullow.  The central bank has sold dollars in the domestic foreign-
exchange market at least four times since June 15 as the
currency slumped to its weakest level since 1993 on June 30,
making it the fourth-worst performer worldwide after Suriname’s
dollar, Maldive’s rufiyaa, and  Kenya ’s shilling. Inflation in
the East African country accelerated to a 17-year high of 16
percent in May, before slowing to 15.8 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
