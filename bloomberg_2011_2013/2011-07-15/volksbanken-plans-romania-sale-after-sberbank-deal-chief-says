Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) 
plans to also sell its Romanian unit after OAO Sberbank bought
most of its eastern European business, Chief Executive Officer
Gerald Wenzel said.  It would make “little sense” to keep one sole unit in
eastern  Europe  after selling the rest of its Volksbank
International AG, Wenzel told reporters in Vienna today.  The Romanian business accounted for 4.8 billion euros ($6.8
billion) of total assets at the end of last year, and turned
into a loss after taxes of 31.4 million euros due to rising
provisions for bad debt, according to VBI’s annual report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
