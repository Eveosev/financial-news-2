Spain ’s Cabinet approved the sale of
a 49 percent stake in the state-owned airport operator Aena
Aeropuertos and of management contracts for its two biggest
airports in  Madrid  and Barcelona.  Two companies will be created and the firms that win the
contracts to manage the airports will take a 90.05 percent stake
in each, leaving the remaining 9.95 percent with Aena,
Development Minister Jose Blanco said today in Madrid. The
Cabinet also authorized the sale of as much as 49 percent of
Aena Aeropuertos, which has already hired  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS)  to seek buyers.  Spain’s Socialist government is selling assets as it seeks
to reduce the amount of debt it needs to issue to finance a
 budget deficit  that was the third-largest in the euro region
last year. It also plans an initial public offering of lottery
operator Sociedad Estatal Loterias y Apuestas del Estado this
year as it tries to win back investor confidence and stem
contagion from the sovereign debt crisis.  The management contracts are for 20 years, extendable by
another five, longer than the 15-year period the government
proposed in a presentation in June. The Madrid tender will raise
at least 3.7 billion euros ($5.2 billion) and the Barcelona sale
1.6 billion euros, the Development Ministry said in a statement.  The operators will also have to pay an annual fee
equivalent to 20 percent of revenue. In 2012 that fee will be
150 million euros for Madrid and 80 million euros in  Barcelona .  Aena handles 200 million passengers annually in 47 Spanish
airports and the 28 it manages outside Spain. Madrid Barajas and
Barcelona El Prat are  Europe ’s fourth- and ninth-busiest
airports with 49.8 million and 29.2 million passengers a year
respectively. In 2010, Barajas reported a net loss of 134.7
million euros and El Prat lost 73.9 million euros after tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
