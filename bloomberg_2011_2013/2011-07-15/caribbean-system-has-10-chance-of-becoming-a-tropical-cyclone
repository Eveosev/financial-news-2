An area of disturbed weather in the
southwestern Caribbean that is drifting westward toward Central
America has a 10 percent chance of developing into a tropical
cyclone within 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center said.  “Locally heavy rainfall is possible over portions of
Central America during the next few days,” the Miami-based
center said today in a website  advisory  at 2 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
