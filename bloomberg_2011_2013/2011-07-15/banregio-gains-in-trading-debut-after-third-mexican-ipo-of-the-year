Banregio Grupo Financiero SAB, the
12th biggest Mexican bank by loans, gained in its first day of
trading after raising 1.8 billion pesos ($153 million) in an
initial public offering yesterday.  The shares advanced 0.2 percent to 32.07 pesos at 4 p.m.
New York time in  Mexico  City trading. Earlier the stock jumped
as much as 4.7 percent.  The sale marked Mexico’s third IPO of the year and the
first for a financial services firm since Corp. Actinver SAB
went public in May 2010. The offering was 2.4 times
oversubscribed, according to two people familiar with the
matter, who couldn’t be identified because the details of the
transaction weren’t yet public.  The underwriters may exercise an option to buy additional
shares within 30 days, which would bring the size of the
offering to 2.1 billion pesos.  Banregio, based in the Monterrey suburb of San Pedro Garza
Garcia, Mexico, priced the sale at 32 pesos a share, near the
bottom of its marketed range of 31.50 pesos to 40 pesos,
according to a filing with the Mexican stock exchange.  Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit and Grupo Financiero BBVA
Bancomer SA managed the sale.  Mexican initial share listings have lost an average of 1.8
percent in their first 20 days of trading, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg since April 2010, when the country snapped
a 22-month period without a new listing.  ABC Aerolineas SA, which operates low-cost airline
Interjet, postponed its initial offering about two weeks ago,
citing a “complex situation” in global financial markets.  The benchmark IPC index of 37 Mexican stocks closed little
changed today at 36,155.86.  To contact the reporters on this story:
