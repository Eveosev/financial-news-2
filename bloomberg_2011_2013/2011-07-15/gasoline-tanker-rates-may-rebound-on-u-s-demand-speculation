Shipping rates for European gasoline
may rebound on speculation U.S. demand for refined oil products
is increasing.  There may be export opportunities for gasoline and blending
components in the U.S., according to a note from Vienna-based
JBC Energy GmbH’s head of research  David Wech  today. In
northwest Europe, 32 tankers were available for hiring to ship
gasoline to the U.S., compared with 34 last week, a Bloomberg
News survey of five shipbrokers and two traders showed.  While charter rates for vessels carrying 37,000 metric ton
cargoes to the U.S. from Europe fell to 144.58 Worldscale points
yesterday, the lowest level since June 8, demand is “busy” and
traders can profit buying cargoes in Rotterdam and selling them
in  New York , Ben Goggin, a freight derivatives broker at SSY
Futures Ltd. in  London , said today by e-mail.  “We think the momentum will probably carry into next week,
but will be a gentle firming rather than shooting up,” Goggin
said. SSY Futures is a unit of the world’s second-biggest
shipbroker.  Gasoline’s crack, a measure of refining profit, was at
$8.47 a barrel in northwest  Europe  yesterday for August
deliveries, up 12 percent from $7.55 a barrel on July 7,
according to data from London-based brokerage PVM Oil Associates
Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
