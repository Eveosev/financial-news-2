Britain’s financial regulator said
it will press ahead with an overhaul of the investment-advice
industry, rejecting calls from lawmakers who say the plans will
cost jobs.  The industry has already begun the changes and 82 percent
of advisers will stay in the trade, the Financial Services
Authority said in an e-mailed statement.  In a report published today, Parliament’s Treasury
Committee urged the regulator to delay implementing the retail
distribution review until 2014 to allow financial advisers more
time to comply with the new rules.  “The FSA is right to reform the financial advice market,”
committee Chairman  Andrew Tyrie  said. “However, the current
timetable for reform risks putting large numbers of experienced
financial advisers out of business.”  The FSA said it needed to overhaul the sector after mis-
selling of financial products eroded consumer trust and
“damaged the reputation of the retail investment market.” Mis-
sold personal pension and endowment policies alone have led to
almost 15 billion pounds ($24 billion) having been paid in
compensation, the FSA said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
