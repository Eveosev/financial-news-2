Cash premiums for U.S. corn shipped
in July to export terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to
Chicago futures as hot weather threatens U.S. crops. The soybean
basis fell.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month rose to $1 a bushel above September futures from 89 cents
to $1 yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The
soybean premium was 82 cents to 85 cents a bushel above August
futures, compared with 82 cent to 87 cents.  “The pipeline supply of corn to exporters is depleted”
because of increased purchases by U.S. ethanol and livestock
producers,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview. “U.S. soybean-processor demand is slow, and export
demand is moving to cheaper supplies from  Brazil .”  Corn futures for September delivery rose 10.5 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.0125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest closing price since June 21. The contract gained 9.2
percent this week.  Soybean futures for August delivery climbed 3.75 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $13.8575 a bushel on the CBOT. The contract
gained 2.9 percent this week, the most since the May 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
