Zimbabwean police yesterday arrested
former  African Medical Investments Plc (AMEI)  Chief Executive Officer
Vivek Solanki, the  Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp . reported on its
website.  Solanki, who was wanted by Interpol, was picked up by
police for questioning in the capital, Harare, state-owned ZBC
said.  U.K.-based AMI said in a statement on March 9 that it was
conducting an “ongoing investigation into alleged financial and
administrative irregularities” perpetrated while Solanki was
CEO. The company suspended Solanki in July 2010.  Solanki will appear in court “soon,” ZBC said.  Calls to Wayne Bvudzijena, spokesman for the Zimbabwean
police, weren’t immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
