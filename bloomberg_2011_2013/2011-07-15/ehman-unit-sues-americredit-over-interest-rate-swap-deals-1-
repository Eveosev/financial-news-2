A  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  unit
sued AmeriCredit Financial Services Inc. for breach of contract,
alleging it undervalued termination payments for interest rate
swap agreements connected to auto-loan securitizations.  Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. entered into swap
agreements with trusts sponsored in 2005 and 2007 by AmeriCredit
that issued $3.85 billion in notes, according to a complaint
filed today in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan.
AmeriCredit Financial, a subprime auto lender based in Fort
Worth, Texas, was bought by  General Motors Co. (GM)  last year.  When Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection, the swaps were
terminated and AmeriCredit failed to calculate termination
payments according to the terms of the agreement by not seeking
bids from potential replacement counterparties when  interest
rates  were moving in Lehman’s favor, according to the complaint.  While AmeriCredit made early termination payments of
$13 million, Lehman should have received $42.5 million,
according to the complaint. The lawsuit seeks $13 million in
interest from three swap agreements and other unspecified
damages.  Caitlin DeYoung, a spokeswoman for General Motors
Financial, didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message left
after regular business hours.  The case is Lehman Brothers Special Financing v.
AmeriCredit Financial Services, 11-2403,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court ,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
