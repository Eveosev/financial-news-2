Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s biggest
carmaker, said it expects to continue outperforming the auto
market in the second half after posting a record 4.1 million
deliveries in the first six months of the year.  Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and vans at the
company’s brands including the Audi luxury division and Czech
unit Skoda rose 14 percent, VW said today in an e-mailed
statement. Global industry sales increased 6.1 percent in the
same period, according to the company.  “We’re also confident we can perform better than the
global automobile market during the second half,” VW sales
chief Christian Klingler said in the statement. “Plenty of hard
work lies ahead.”  Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen is counting on growth
in  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India  and  China  to help surpass Toyota Motor
Corp. as the world’s biggest carmaker no later than 2018. VW has
forecast its global sales will increase 5 percent this year
after posting a record 7.2 million deliveries in 2010.  Sales in June increased 12 percent, the carmaker said.  Year-to-date sales were powered by a 29 percent gain in
central and eastern Europe to 253,700 vehicles, a 20 percent
increase in the U.S. to 211,100 units and a 16 percent rise in
China, VW’s biggest market, to 1.1 million autos. Deliveries in
VW’s German home-market rose 9.3 percent to 580,600 units,
according to the statement.  The manufacturer said last month that it will expand third-
quarter production of the Golf hatchback and Tiguan compact SUV
at its main factory in Wolfsburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
