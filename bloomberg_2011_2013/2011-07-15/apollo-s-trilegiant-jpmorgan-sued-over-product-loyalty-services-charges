Apollo Global Management LLC’s
Trilegiant unit was sued by an  Arizona  man over claims it
conspired to defraud consumers with charges for product loyalty
services and membership clubs.  Juan M. Restrepo said in a complaint in federal court in
Tucson, Arizona, that he was unaware that Trilegiant charged
$10.99 to his Chase MasterCard account each month from May 2007
through to May 2011. Restrepo noticed the monthly charges in
April and claims he never authorized the charges, according to
the complaint filed July 13.  “The charges were virtually unnoticeable because it was
embedded in all other ordinary charges that normally escape
close scrutiny of the ordinary consumer,” according to the
complaint, which seeks to represent other customers in a class
action, or group lawsuit. Chase Bank USA is also a defendant in
the case.  The companies are accused in the lawsuit of racketeering,
violating electronic communications privacy laws, violating
unfair trade laws and unjustly enriching themselves. Restrepo is
seeking a court order barring the companies from continuing the
alleged scheme plus unspecified damages.  Mike Bush, a spokesman for Trilegiant, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment after regular business hours
yesterday. Trilegiant is based in Norwalk,  Connecticut ,
according to the complaint.  Tom Kelly , a spokesman for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , declined
to comment. New York-based JPMorgan is the parent of Chase Bank
USA.  The case is Restrepo v. Chase Bank USA N.A., 11-cv-00423,
U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Tucson).  To contact the reporter on this story:
