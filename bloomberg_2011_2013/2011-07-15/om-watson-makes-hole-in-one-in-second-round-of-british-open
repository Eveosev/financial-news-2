Five-time champion  Tom Watson  made a
hole-in-one on the par-3, 178-yard sixth hole during the second
round of the British Open.  Watson’s tee shot took one bounce and went into the hole at
Royal St. George’s in Sandwich,  England . The 61-year-old eight-time 
major winner was congratulated by playing partners Henkrik Stenson
and Tom Lewis before taking a bow for the crowd.  It’s the second ace at this year’s Open following American
Dustin Johnson’s yesterday on the 159-yard 16th hole.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
