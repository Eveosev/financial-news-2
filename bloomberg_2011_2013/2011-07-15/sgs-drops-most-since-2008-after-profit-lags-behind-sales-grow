SGS SA (SGSN)  shares fell the most in
more than two years after the strong Swiss franc hurt first-half
net income even as sales increased.  The stock fell as much as 9 percent, the most since
December 2008, trading at 1,511 Swiss francs by 9:53 a.m. in
Zurich and giving the world’s largest product inspector a market
value of 11.8 billion francs ($14.4 billion).  Net income dropped to 246 million francs from 270 million
francs a year earlier, Geneva-based SGS said today, citing the
strength of the Swiss currency. That fell short of the 278
million-franc mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales advanced 12.8 percent to 2.3 billion francs.  “SGS presented a first-half result in which only the
organic sales growth was convincing,” Zuercher Kantonalbank
analyst Daniel Buerki, who has a “market weight” rating on the
stock, said in an e-mailed note to clients.  “Profit numbers
were below our expectations.”  SGS also said profitability will drop in the second half
compared with the first as the pace of investments increases.
Still, second-half margins will be higher than a year earlier,
the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
