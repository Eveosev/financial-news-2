controlled by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte and Deutsche Bank
AG, plunged 4.3 percent to 5,550 rupiah, its sharpest drop since
Feb. 21. Danamon said it plans to sell new shares in a rights
offer to boost capital.  “The news is quite surprising,” Agus Pramono, an analyst
at PT UOB Kay Hian Securities in Jakarta, said. “My concern is
this right issue will further depress its return on investment,
at least for the next one or two years before it can utilize all
of its capital.”  PT Bank Mandiri (BMRI IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest bank by
assets, advanced 1.3 percent to 7,900 rupiah, a record close.
The lender provided a $25 million loan to PT Wintermar Offshore

expansion plans, Bambang Setyogroho, senior vice president
corporate banking at Mandiri, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
