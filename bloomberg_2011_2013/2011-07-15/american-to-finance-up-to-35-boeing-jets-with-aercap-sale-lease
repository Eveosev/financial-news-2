AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s  American Airlines  agreed
to a sale and lease-back transaction with  AerCap Holdings NV (AER)  to
finance as many as 35  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-800 jets as the carrier
weighs an order for more new planes.  The AerCap arrangement covers 29 firm deliveries, three of
which are newly ordered aircraft, and purchase rights for six
more,  Fort Worth , Texas-based American said today in a
statement. Airlines often sell planes to another party and then
lease them back to defray costs.  American is considering whether to purchase as many as 280
new single-aisle jets from Airbus SAS or Boeing, a break from
the airline’s traditional reliance on Boeing products, people
familiar with the matter said in June. AMR’s board may decide on
the order as soon as this month, the people said.  Deliveries began in 2009 on American’s order of 130 of the
737-800 jets, with the last planes due in 2013. The deal with
Amsterdam-based AerCap would cover options on 737s to be
delivered through 2014 at the third-largest U.S. airline.  AMR fell 8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $5.01 at 4:02 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest closing
price since August 2009.  Narrow-body models such as Boeing’s 737 and the  Airbus A320 
are the backbone of global airline fleets and are typically used
on domestic routes. The 737 is more fuel efficient than
American’s 216 Boeing MD-80s, the most-numerous plane type among
613 aircraft in the carrier’s main jet fleet.  An order at American would buoy Toulouse, France-based
Airbus as it tries to crack Boeing’s grip on single-aisle plane
sales to big U.S. airlines. It would also add to pressure on
Boeing, which is deciding whether to match Airbus and put
upgraded engines on the 737 or wait to build a new jet by 2020
with more fuel savings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
