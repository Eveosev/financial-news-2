Standard & Poor’s  anticipates U.S.
lawmakers will reach an agreement to lift the nation’s debt
limit and avoid defaulting on its debt, according to  John
Chambers , chairman of S&P’s sovereign rating committee.  S&P place the U.S. AAA rating on “CreditWatch” yesterday,
saying there is a 50 percent chance it would be cut in the next
90 days even if an agreement is reached by Aug. 2. Chambers
spoke today with  Carol Massar  on Bloomberg Television’s “Street
Smart.”  The move comes after Moody’s Investors Service placed the
nation’s credit rating under review for a downgrade July 13,
ratcheting up the pressure on President  Barack Obama  and
Republicans in Congress to strike a deal to raise the
government’s $14.3 trillion debt limit.  “You need something that can credibly be implemented that
won’t have escape clauses,” Chambers said. “You need more than
a headline figure. Now is the time in which that plan will be
forthcoming, or it won’t be.”  The yield on three-month Treasury bills was little changed
at 0.005 percent, and has fallen from a high of 0.05 percent on
June 15, even as negotiators have made little progress on
lifting the debt limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
