Soybeans rose, capping the longest
rally since 2007, and corn climbed to a one-month high on
speculation that hot, dry weather will reduce crop yields in the
U.S., the world’s leading exporter.  High temperatures  will rise to as much as 12 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for seven days starting tomorrow in the
Midwest, Mike Tannura, the president of T-storm Weather LLC,
said in a telephone interview. As much as 46 percent of the corn
crop and 44 percent of soybeans have drier-than-normal topsoil,
and the adverse conditions may extend into August, he said.  “Hot, dry weather will rob yield potential,”  Don Roose ,
the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview. “The crops are getting smaller,
and we don’t have any excess inventories to offset the losses.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.2
percent, to close at $13.87 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The price was up for the 10th straight session,
the longest rally since September 2007. The oilseed, up 3
percent this week, has climbed 40 percent in the past 12 months.  Corn futures for December delivery gained 6.5 cents, or 1
percent, to $6.85 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached $6.96,
the highest for a most-active contract since June 14. The grain,
up 7.5 percent this week, has surged 69 percent in the past
year.  Dry weather  in the past two weeks depleted soil-moisture
reserves in parts of the Midwest, leaving shallow-rooted plants
more vulnerable to heat stress, Gail Martell, the president of
Martel Crop Projections in Whitefish Bay,  Wisconsin , said in a
report. Fields from eastern Iowa to  Ohio  are most at risk, she
said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
