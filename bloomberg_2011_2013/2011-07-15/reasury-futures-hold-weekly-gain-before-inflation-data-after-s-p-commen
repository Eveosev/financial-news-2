Treasury futures headed for a second
weekly advance before a government report that economists said
will show the cost of living in the U.S. fell.  Contracts held gains from earlier in the week even after
 Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut the U.S.’s AAA rating within
90 days if Congress and President Barack Obama’s administration
haven’t achieved a credible solution to raising the government
debt ceiling.  Ten-year futures contracts for September delivery were
little changed at 124 13/32 as of 9:01 a.m. in  Tokyo , based on
electronic transactions on the Chicago Board of Trade.  The contracts rose 22/32, or $6.88 per $1,000 face amount,
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
