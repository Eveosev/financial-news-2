Range Resources Corp. (RRC)  rose 12
percent to lead the biggest rally among U.S. oil and gas
producers in six months after  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  agreed to buy
 Petrohawk Energy Corp. (HK)  for $12.1 billion in cash, a 61 percent
premium to the stock price.  Range gained $6.68 to $61.78 at 4:10 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  increased $5.83, or 9.3 percent, to
$68.43.  Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD) ,  Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN) 
and  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  also rose.  “There’s a new high-water mark being set for the people,
process and assets of tight oil and tight gas production,”
David M. Heikkinen, a Houston-based analyst for Tudor Pickering
Holt & Co., said today in an interview. “That’s the catalyst.”  Range, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is similar to Petrohawk,
with lots of acreage in shale plays and few barriers to a sale,
such as joint ventures, said Leo Mariani, an analyst with RBC
Capital Markets LLC in Austin, Texas.  “There’s a tremendous amount of running room here,” said
Mariani, who rates Range’s shares at “outperform” and owns
none. “They’ve got thousands of wells left to drill on their
position.”  Buying all onshore gas producers on the BHP purchase is a
“flawed strategy,” Heikkinen said.  The firm picked  Brigham Exploration Co (BEXP) , Oasis Petroleum
Inc., Southwestern Energy and  Ultra Petroleum Corp. (UPL)  as the most
likely takeover targets in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
