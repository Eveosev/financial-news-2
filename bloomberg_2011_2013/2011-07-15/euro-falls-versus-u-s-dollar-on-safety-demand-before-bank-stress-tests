The euro fell for a second week
against the dollar after eight banks failed the European Union
stress tests and Ireland was downgraded by Moody’s Investors
Service.  The U.S. currency strengthened after a report showed U.S.
consumer prices excluding food and energy increased for a second
month, cutting chances of additional stimulus from the Federal
Reserve.  Australia ’s dollar fell against most its major peers as
investors anticipated central bank will cut interest rates in
December.  “They haven’t resolved the broader issues that have
emerged and there will be question marks over the stress tests
and the pressure on the euro in the near term is likely to
downward more than up,” said Steven Englander, head of Group of
10 currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “The market
has moved way beyond what they were assuming in the stress
test.”  The euro traded $1.4157 per dollar at 5 p.m. in New York,
down 0.8 percent from $1.4265 on July 8. The yen strengthened
2.6 percent against the euro to 112.02, the biggest five-day
gain since May 6. The dollar weakened 1.9 percent to 79.13 yen
from 80.64.  Stress Test  The European banks were found to have insufficient reserves
to maintain a core tier 1 capital ratio of 5 percent in the
event of an economic slowdown, the European Banking Authority
said.  The assessments are the first by the European Banking
Authority since it was set up earlier this year. Last year’s
tests by its predecessor were criticized for not being tough
enough because banks were shown to need only 3.5 billion euros
more capital, a 10th of the lowest analyst estimate. Banks that
fail the stress test must present a plan to raise more capital
within three months.  The euro has fallen 1.5 percent in the past month against
10 developed-nation currencies, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The dollar is down 1.4
percent and the yen is up 1.2 percent.  Moody’s Investors Service cut Ireland to Ba1 from Baa3 on
July 12. The rating agency cited the probability that the
country, which received a bailout last year, will need
additional official financing and for investors to share in
losses before it can return to the private market to borrow.  Fed, Inflation  The dollar rose against 10 of 16 major counterparts this
week after  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told
Congress yesterday that inflation has moved higher, boosting
speculation the central bank won’t take further steps to support
the  U.S. economy .  The core measure of the cost of living in the U.S., which
excludes more volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.3
percent for a second month, the Labor Department reported today.  “The bar is set very high for more quantitative easing if
you can’t point to disinflation or deflation, but you actually
are pointing to a rise in inflation, some of which is not
anticipated,” said  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10
foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York. “If
you’re seeing a limited reaction on significant news it’s from
the market being whipsawed on a variety of different
headlines.”  Aussie Rates  The Australian dollar depreciated against all but one of 16
major peers tracked by Bloomberg, falling 0.7 percent against
the greenback to $1.0653, after Westpac Banking Corp. became the
first among the nation’s four biggest lenders to predict the
central bank will cut  interest rates  in December.  “There were some local banks talking about some rate cuts
in Australia, which is a first for a local bank to come out and
say that,” said  Paul Robson , a senior foreign-exchange
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  The rand declined versus the dollar and posted its worst
weekly retreat in two months as strikes in  South Africa  created
fuel shortages.  South Africa’s currency fell 0.7 percent to 6.8846. It has
declined 2.6 percent versus the dollar in the past five days,
its worst performance since the week ending May 13.  Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  survived a
confidence vote that he called to speed parliamentary approval
of a four-year deficit-cutting plan. Berlusconi carried the vote
in the Chamber of Deputies in  Rome  today, after winning a
similar confidence motion in the Senate yesterday.  The plan seeks to balance the budget in 2014 and includes
cuts in transfers to regional governments, an extension of a
freeze on civil servants’ wages, additional fees for some
health-care services and an increase in the  retirement age .  To contact the reporter on this story:
