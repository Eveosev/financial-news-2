Polish fixed-rate  government bonds 
may attract investors to switch from inflation-linked and
floater bonds after the country’s consumer-price index fell more
than analysts estimated, according to BNP Paribas SA.  “The largest funds have a relatively high allocation into
inflation linkers and floaters,” the French lender wrote in a
report to clients dated today. “The end of monetary tightening
in  Poland  as well as moderating inflation could spur local funds
to switch into fixed-rate bonds, which would provide a boost
to” the securities “in the coming months,” BNP Paribas wrote.  Polish inflation slowed to 4.2 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with 5 percent in May, the  Central Statistical
Office  reported in Warsaw on July 13. The rate compares with the
4.8 percent median estimate of 29 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
