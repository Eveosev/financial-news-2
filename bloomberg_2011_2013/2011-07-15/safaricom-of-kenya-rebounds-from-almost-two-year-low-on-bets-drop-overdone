Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s
biggest mobile-phone company, rebounded from the lowest price in
almost two years after sinking beneath a key level of an
indicator used in technical analysis.  The stock of  Kenya ’s second-biggest company by market value
snapped five days of declines, rising 0.20 shilling, or 5.7
percent, to 3.70 shillings as of the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi,
the capital. It closed at the weakest since August 2009
yesterday.  The company’s 14-day relative strength index closed at 19.9
yesterday and was at 40.2 today. The RSI identifies possible
turning points in indexes or securities by measuring the degree
that gains and losses outpace each other in a given period. A
reading below 30 means the gauge is poised to rise.  “The price had come off quite a bit so now we are seeing
new buyers who are getting in because the valuation is
attractive,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
