Tiger Woods will play in an Aug. 31
charity event organized by Notah Begay III, his former teammate
at  Stanford University .  Woods skipped this week’s British Open after sitting out
last month’s U.S. Open and hasn’t played in a tournament since
aggravating knee and ankle injuries at the Players Championship
in May. He was originally injured during April’s Masters
Tournament.  Begay’s mixed-team event at Verona, New York’s Turning
Stone Resort was rescheduled from July 5 to give Woods, 35, more
time to recover from his injuries. Begay disclosed Woods’s
participation in a  statement  on his charitable foundation’s
website. The foundation was formed in 2005 to reduce childhood 
obesity and  Type 2 diabetes , and promote leadership among 
American Indian youth. Begay identifies himself as the only 
full-blooded American Indian on the  PGA Tour .   A 14-time major tournament winner, Woods has yet to say if
he will play in the  PGA Championship , golf’s final major of the
year, scheduled for Aug. 11-14 at the Atlanta Athletic Club in
Johns Creek, Georgia.  Woods hasn’t won a tournament since November 2009. He’s
fallen to No. 19 in the  Official World Golf Ranking  after
holding the top spot for a record 281 weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
