Oil gained, trimming this week’s
decline, as reports of lower inflation in the U.S. and better-
than-forecast earnings at  Citigroup Inc. (C)  buoyed confidence in
the global economic recovery.  Futures reversed earlier losses as the consumer-price index
decreased 0.2 percent while Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest
U.S. bank, said profit rose 24 percent, beating analysts’
estimates.  Brent crude  has lost 1.3 percent this week as
 Standard & Poor’s  joined Moody’s Investors Service in reviewing
the U.S.’s credit rating. Oil may rebound next week, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of traders and analysts.  Brent oil for September settlement gained as much as 0.7
percent to $117.09 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Earlier it dropped as much as 0.7 percent to
$115.45, and was at $116.60 as of 1:37 p.m. London time.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , crude for August
delivery was at $96.12 a barrel, 43 cents higher. The contract
yesterday declined $2.36 to $95.69, the lowest since July 11.  Thirteen of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, or 43
percent, forecast oil will rise through July 22. Eleven
respondents, or 37 percent, predicted prices will fall and six
estimated there will be little change. Last week, 51 percent of
those surveyed said futures would drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
