Rwanda ’s inflation accelerated to
5.8 percent in June as food and transport costs increased, the
statistics office said.  The urban inflation rate rose from 4.5 percent in May, the
 National Institute of Statistics  of Rwanda, based in the
capital, Kigali, said on its website today. Prices increased 1.5
percent in the month.  Rwanda’s central bank left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 6 percent on July 8, saying that inflation
pressures remained “moderate.” The bank lowered the rate three
times last year to help support economic growth in the tea and
coffee-exporting nation. Inflation will probably ease to below
7.5 percent by year-end, Governor Claver Gatete said on May 16.  Bread and cereal prices had the biggest increase of all
items in the index last month, rising 6.1 percent, while
transport costs jumped 3 percent, the statistics office said.
The underlying inflation rate, which excludes food and energy
costs, increased 5.8 percent in June from a year earlier, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
