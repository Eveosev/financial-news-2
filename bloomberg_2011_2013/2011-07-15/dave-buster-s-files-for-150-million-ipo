Dave & Buster’s Entertainment Inc.,
the owner of Dave & Buster’s restaurant and arcade venues, seeks
to raise $150 million in a U.S. initial public offering,
according to a regulatory  filing .  The Dallas-based company didn’t specify the number of
shares it would sell or the price range in a filing today with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Proceeds will be
used to repay debt, and the stock will trade under the symbol
PLAY.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Jefferies Group Inc. and Piper
Jaffray Cos. were hired to lead the deal, according to the
prospectus. Last year, Oak Hill Capital Partners acquired Dave &
Buster’s for $570 million.  Revenue rose 5 percent to $148.6 million for the quarter
ended May 1, the company said in the filing. There are 57 Dave &
Buster’s in the U.S. and  Canada ; one location is a franchise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
