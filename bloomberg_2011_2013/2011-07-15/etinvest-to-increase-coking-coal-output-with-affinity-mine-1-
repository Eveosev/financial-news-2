Metinvest, Ukraine’s largest
steelmaker, plans to increase production of steelmaking coal at
its United Coal Company unit in the U.S. after commissioning a
new mine.  The capacity of the Affinity mine, in  West Virginia , will
be 1.9 million metric tons a year by 2012, Metinvest said today
in an e-mailed statement. United Coal will raise its overall
coal output by 14 percent to 8.2 million tons this year,
according to the statement.  Metinvest, owned by Ukraine’s richest businessman  Rinat Akhmetov , also plans to boost coking coal production in Ukraine
itself by 7 percent to 6.2 million tons this year, and 6.5
million tons in 2012, the company said.  Metinvest also said today that its  Azovstal (AZST)  steelmaker
signed a $20 million dollar contract with Germany’s SMS Siemag
AG to supply metal-production equipment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
