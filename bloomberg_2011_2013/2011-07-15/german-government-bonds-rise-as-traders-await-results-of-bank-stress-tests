Greek, Irish and Portuguese two-year
notes led declines by securities from  Europe ’s most indebted
nations, while German bunds rose before the publication of
stress tests that may show European banks need more capital.  Yields on notes of the three nations to accept
international bailouts reached euro-era records, while German
10-year yields headed for a second straight week of declines as
investors favored the safest assets amid concern the region’s
debt crisis is worsening. Regulators will release test results
for 91 banks to help reassure investors that the region’s
lenders have enough capital.  Standard & Poor’s  yesterday became
the second ratings company this week to warn that it may cut the
U.S.’s top credit grade.  “Uncertainty continues to be very high, and that explains
why bunds are stronger,” said  Michael Markovic , a senior fixed-
income strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “If we
see negative news and surprises from big banks, that would be
something that affects the market, and it may lead to a further
rally in bunds due to safe-haven flows.”  The yield on  Greece ’s two-year notes surged 185 basis
points to 33.07 percent as of 4:33 p.m. in London, after
reaching a record 34 percent. Ten-year Greek yields rose 49
basis points at 17.58 percent.  Bank Assessment  The assessment of European banks is the first by the
European Banking Authority since it was established earlier this
year. The tests follow criticism of similar evaluations by the
EBA’s predecessor last year that found banks needed only 3.5
billion euros ($5 billion) in extra capital. S&P’s own stress
test, published in March, found European banks would need as
much as 250 billion euros in fresh capital if faced with a
“sharp” increase in yields and a “severe” economic downturn.  Ireland’s two-year note yield was 179 basis points higher
at 23.12 percent, a euro-era high. Spanish 10-year bond yields
rose 20 basis points to 6.06 percent while equivalent-maturity
Italian debt yielded 5.76 percent, up 13 basis points from
yesterday.  The 10-year bund yield declined five basis points to 2.69
percent. It reached 2.50 percent on July 12, an eight-month low,
amid speculation the debt crisis was spreading to  Italy . The
3.25 percent German security due July 2021 rose 0.395, or 3.95
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 104.79. Yields on two-year
notes fell two basis points to 1.21 percent.  U.S. Rating  German  government bonds  have handed investors 1.9 percent
this year, while  U.S. Treasuries  returned 3.5 percent, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds lost 20 percent, and
Italian bonds 2.5 percent, the indexes show.  Most European stocks fell, heading for their biggest weekly
drop since March.  Portugal ’s two-year note yield jumped 168
basis points to 19.35 percent after touching 19.50 percent,
while the nation’s 10-year bond yield increased 16 basis points
to 12.79 percent.  S&P said there’s at least a 50 percent chance it will cut
the U.S.’s AAA rating by one or two notches into the AA category
within 90 days. S&P said the ranking would be at risk if it
concludes Congress and President Barack Obama’s administration
haven’t achieved a credible solution to the rising government
debt burden and aren’t likely to achieve one in the near future.  To contact the reporters on this story:
