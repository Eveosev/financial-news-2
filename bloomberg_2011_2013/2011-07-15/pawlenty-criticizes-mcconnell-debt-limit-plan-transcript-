Republican presidential
candidate and former Minnesota Governor  Tim Pawlenty , in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with
 Al Hunt ,” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell’s
plan to raise the U.S. debt limit is like a “Band-Aid on a
broken bone.”  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: From Bloomberg headquarters in  New York , we
begin the show with Republican presidential candidate Tim
Pawlenty. Governor, thank you for being with us.  TIM PAWLENTY: Delighted to be with you.  HUNT: The president had his second news conference in
five days this week to talk about the debt ceiling. He said
80 percent of the public in polls favor a balanced package,
which he defines as $3 in spending cuts for every $1 of
revenues and that politicians will pay a price if they play
games with the debt ceiling.  PAWLENTY: Well, a couple of things. One is, I think
it’s important to understand how we got in this mess. And if
you look at -  HUNT: But you don’t agree with what the president said
today?  PAWLENTY: No, I don’t. But I think for this reason.
Let’s see how we got here. And we didn’t get here by being
undertaxed. We got here because  government spending  at the
federal level has been growing dramatically faster than the
rate of growth of the private economy.  And then, number two, as to the solution, the president
needs to stop lecturing everybody every, you know, 24 hours
and get the deal done and get something done that’s
structural and permanent. And, look, the Republicans -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: So these press conferences are really lectures
and posturing?  PAWLENTY: Well, he’s certainly spinning. But, you know,
we’ve got - we’ve got to solve problems. And I wish they
didn’t raise the debt ceiling, but if they’re going to do
it, Al, we need to get something structural that’s
meaningful and measurable that will get the country back on
a better track.  HUNT: Let’s get to that in a minute. We’ll talk about
getting the debt ceiling done.  Mitch McConnell , as you know,
has a proposal to get the debt ceiling done, where the
president has to come back with spending - could you support
the McConnell proposal?  PAWLENTY: No, I don’t like it. I think it’s a Band-Aid
on a broken bone.  HUNT: Bad idea?  PAWLENTY: Well, it’s just not going to solve - it
doesn’t solve the problem.  HUNT: So you’re against the McConnell proposal?  PAWLENTY: Solve the - I don’t like it.  HUNT: OK. Let’s talk about if the debt ceiling isn’t
raised. You’ve said, hey, it’s not going to be a crisis, we
can deal with it, and the Treasury should pay outside
creditors first. That means Chinese bondholders get
preference to an Army sergeant in  Afghanistan ?  PAWLENTY: You know, when I wrote that op-ed, it was
January or February. And moving the money around internally
works for a while, but it doesn’t work forever. So the first
deadline was April, then it was May, then it was July, now
it’s August, so eventually the gig’s up.  And I saw Secretary Geithner over the weekend. He said
they blew through the debt ceiling in May, Al. They’ve
already blown through it. And so -  HUNT: So if we - if we default, who should - what
should be the priority? Who should be paid first? Who -  (CROSSTALK)  PAWLENTY: Well, of course the outside creditors. Of
course.  HUNT: Before - before Social Security? Before -  PAWLENTY: Well, you have to - to take away the - the
false choice between a default to outside creditors and
raising the debt ceiling or doing it incorrectly or unwisely
-  HUNT: You just -  PAWLENTY: - pay the outside - the interest on the
outside obligations first.  HUNT: And then - then Social Security, then the
military -  PAWLENTY: Well, then the military, and then the rest.
But, again, I argued six or eight months ago to do that
temporarily to buy the time so you could get to the debating
and enacting the real fixes. Now they’ve lost that
opportunity, and now they’ve got their backs up against the
wall at the 11th hour.  HUNT: You don’t think there will be a default, do you?  PAWLENTY: I don’t - I don’t think there should be a
default. We shouldn’t default.  HUNT: Do you think there will be?  PAWLENTY: No, I don’t think there will be.  HUNT: OK. Let’s talk about your economic plan. You have
a tax plan which you’ve described and many agree as the
boldest tax plan out there. You would drop the top rate to
25 percent, eliminate taxes on dividends,  capital gains , and
the states. I suspect many people watching this show would
like that idea.  PAWLENTY: Cut the corporate rate from 35 percent to 15
percent.  HUNT: Exactly. Let’s stay on the individual side for a
minute. Bloomberg reported that this would be the biggest
tax cut ever and that the top 0.1 percent of wealthiest
Americans would get an average tax cut of $1.4 million a
year. Wow.  PAWLENTY: Well, look, if you’re into wealth
redistribution, vote for President Obama. If you’re into
growing the economy so the other 97 percent of us can have
jobs and pay our mortgages and put gas in our car and get
our kids to college, then vote for me, because I don’t
really think the main issue in the country is whether some
small percent of the country gets a little more wealthy or a
little less wealthy. I think the issue is the economy
overall has to grow, and we’ve got to provide jobs, so that
the 95 percent or so of the country that depends on jobs for
their quality of life has them available to them. That’s
what I’m after.  HUNT: Well, America’s in a fiscal bind, though. And
sacrifices, maybe small ones, are being asked of seniors, of
middle-class college students, of health researchers. What
sacrifice does Tim Pawlenty ask of top CEOs, whose
compensation went up 23 percent last year, or  Warren
Buffett ? What single sacrifice?  PAWLENTY: Well, again - I’ll answer that - but, again,
I don’t look at this from a wealth redistribution
standpoint. That’s not the measure of our country. The
measure of our country, are jobs growing? Are we providing
jobs?  But on your question, in my reform plan, I look at
means testing part of Social Security, specifically the
cost-of-living adjustment. So if you’re wealthy, you won’t
get that. If you’re middle-income or low-income -  HUNT: Well, that doesn’t affect - the CEOs’
compensation is going up 23 percent.  PAWLENTY: Well, it’s not government’s place to set
compensation. Do you really want the government coming in
and telling a company what their -  HUNT: No, I’m not talking about - but I’m saying there
is some sacrifice that’s being asked of a whole lot of
people. Again, we’re saying this can be small, but it’s
manageable. But of the rich, there’s no sacrifice being
asked.  PAWLENTY: But, again, if - if you want to have wealth
redistribution or focus on what percent of the top 10
percent are paying in taxes - and, by the way, they’re
paying a bucket load already - then vote for Obama. That’s
his argument. If you want Robin Hood, vote for  Barack Obama .  If you want to get the economy overall moving and do
the things that are going to require you or help you get a
job, vote for me.  HUNT: OK. We’ll get there. The sine qua non then is tax
cuts or not increasing taxes. Explain to me then,  Bill
Clinton , 1993, increases taxes, 23 million jobs over the
next seven years.  George W. Bush , two big tax cuts - not as
big as yours, but big - a measly 3 million jobs. Why?  PAWLENTY: Well, there’s other things that go on. So if
you go back to Reagan, for example, and you isolate the
effect of the Reagan tax cuts -  HUNT: Right.  PAWLENTY: - I don’t think there’s any dispute they not
only cut taxes, but they grew government revenues. But what
they also did at the same time is raise government spending.
Under my plan, I proposed to cut taxes, as well as cut
spending -  HUNT: Which Reagan also increased taxes in ‘82, ‘83,
and ‘84, right?  PAWLENTY: Well, that’s also true.  (LAUGHTER)  But nonetheless, he - if you look at on a net basis, he
was a tax-cutter, not a tax-raiser.  HUNT: He was. He was.  PAWLENTY: I think you can concede that point.  HUNT: Yeah.  PAWLENTY: But I don’t think anybody’s debating that we
need to do these things to make the tax burdens and burdens
of government lighter on our job providers. The people who
want to start and grow business in this country, Al, all say
the same thing: It’s too costly, too difficult, too slow,
over-regulated, too discouraging, too uncertain. And,
governor, if you’re going to be president, do those things
that are going to make the load lighter for the
entrepreneurs in the country, not heavier.  HUNT: With the point to create jobs - and you have said
that your calling card in this race is your record as
governor - you’ve contrasted it to Congressman Bachmann and
even to Governor Romney. But let me ask you this. The
central issue is jobs. I just looked up at - under  Jon
Huntsman , 5.9 percent job growth when he was governor.  Rick
Perry , 12.5 percent, a lot more than under Tim Pawlenty. Why
shouldn’t - what do you have that Huntsman and Perry don’t
have?  PAWLENTY: Well, a couple of things. One is, I operated
in a blue state, so we’re taking it from way over to the
left to something more mainstream, and so you’ve got to look
at the starting point. But in  Minnesota , when I left office,
we had one of the lower unemployment rates in the country.
And post-crash, our job growth rate was one of the fastest
in the country.  So if you look at it overall, I cut taxes, I cut
spending, I did school reform the right way, I did health
care reform the right way -  HUNT: So you’d be better than Perry or Huntsman?  PAWLENTY: Well, yes, but I also didn’t start with Utah
or  Texas  as the starting point. I had the land of McCarthy,
Mondale, Humphrey, Wellstone, Ventura, and now, Al, United
States Senator Al Franken.  HUNT: Tell me -  PAWLENTY: And so it’s one thing to rubber-stamp, you
know, a conservative legislature’s work. It’s another thing
to move the needle, you know, a state like Minnesota.  HUNT: They just cut a budget deal, as you know,
yesterday. Is that a deal if you were in Minnesota you would
support?  PAWLENTY: Well, they did some things that I thought
were curious, which is, you know, they adopted the
Democratic governor’s call for increased spending beyond the
revenues coming in, and then they also did some one-time
adjustments to accomplish that. So it doesn’t appear like -  HUNT: Would you support it?  PAWLENTY: Well, I’d need to know more about it. I just
read a squib on it this morning. But it looks like they both
increase spending and didn’t (ph) make structural changes.  HUNT: One or two things as president. As president,
could you envision openly gays or lesbians in your cabinet?  PAWLENTY: Yeah. I mean, in my case - look, I’m not a
supporter of gay marriage. But I’ve had many appointees,
several appointees -  HUNT: So that’s not an issue?  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: Your campaign has been depicted as struggling,
whether that’s accurate or not. You’ve said it’s early. You
know,  John McCain  had a struggle at this time.  PAWLENTY: Can I - can I just say, on that last
question, Al, I pick people based on the merits.  HUNT: I’m sorry.  PAWLENTY: On the merits. And so I don’t view that as a
reason why you would or wouldn’t pick somebody for a
position in office.  HUNT: OK. Your campaign has been depicted as
struggling. You’ve said, hey, it’s early, campaigns always
struggle early. But you have an Iowa straw poll coming up in
less than a month. Are you going to win that?  PAWLENTY: I don’t know that we’ll win it, but we’re -  HUNT: Will you finish at least a close second?  PAWLENTY: We need to be, you know, showing progress, so
the Des Moines Register poll, which is a credible poll, had
us in sixth or seventh place, so we need to move up from
there for the straw poll in 60 days - or now 50 days. And
then we need to be in a position to win the caucus.  HUNT: I’m going to pressure you just for a minute.
What’s moving up, first or second?  PAWLENTY: Well, you know, top few.  HUNT: Top three?  PAWLENTY: Well, we’re not putting a number on it.  HUNT: Top few.  PAWLENTY: We’ve just got to show significant
improvement. And part of it is also who else is in that mix.  HUNT: Right.  PAWLENTY: You know -  HUNT: Governor -  PAWLENTY: - and their viability going forward.  HUNT: Governor Tim Pawlenty, thank you so much for
being with us today and this conversation. When we come
back, make-or-break time for debt ceiling talks. Bloomberg
reporters are next.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
