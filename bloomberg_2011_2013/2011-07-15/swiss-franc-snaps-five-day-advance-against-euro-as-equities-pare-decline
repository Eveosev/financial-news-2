The Swiss franc stayed near record
highs against the euro and dollar after the European Union
banking regulator said eight banks failed stress tests.  The Swiss currency, which benefits as a haven from
financial turmoil, was little changed against the euro at
1.15324 as of 5:27 p.m. in  London . It strengthened to a record
1.14945 yesterday and touched 1.5064 today. The franc
appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 81.54 centimes per dollar
after reaching a record 80.83 yesterday.  Regulators said the eight banks had a combined capital
shortfall of 2.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion). They included
Greeceâ€™s EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA and Agricultural Bank of
Greece SA. All banks tested in  Italy ,  Germany , France, the U.K.
and Ireland passed, the lenders said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
