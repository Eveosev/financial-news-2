Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , which
manages $43.1 billion of assets, bought new shares in  Japan ’s
smallest real estate investment trust as it revived the
investment after four months.  A Fortress unit and three other investors bought 711,597
shares valued at 7 billion yen ($88 million) in  Invincible
Investment Corp. (8963) , according to a statement by the companies
through the stock exchange. Fortress will also buy 97 percent of
shares in the Tokyo-based REIT’s asset manager on July 29 for an
undisclosed amount.  Today’s transaction is the latest sign that the market is
recovering from the record earthquake in March. Invincible
canceled a plan to sell 514,304 shares for 4.8 billion yen to a
unit of Fortress on March 23, while rival United Urban
Investment Corp. said in May it plans to raise as much as 62.8
billion yen from a share sale it scrapped after the quake.  Fortress will own 45 percent of Invincible after the
acquisition and will manage the trust, the statement said.  Invincible rose 3.5 percent to 11,310 yen at the 3 p.m.
close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest gain in almost a
month. The share purchase was released after the market closed.  Fortress, based in  New York , in June 2010 said it closed
the Fortress Japan Opportunity Domestic Fund at 75 billion yen,
saying it would invest in real estate debt and other assets in
Japan over the next 12 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
