TransCentury Ltd. , a Kenyan investor
in infrastructure projects, tumbled a day after listing on the
 Nairobi Stock Exchange , wiping out most of its debut gain.  The stock of the company, which was listed by introduction,
slid to 52.50 shillings as of the 3 p.m. close in the capital,
Nairobi, compared with a 57 shilling close yesterday, when
TransCentury surged 14 percent from the initial public offering
price of 50 shillings each.  “There is some illiquidity before supply kicks in,”
Victor Odendo, an investment manager at Nairobi-based CIC Asset
Management Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “There is
also a perception that when the shares were trading over the
counter, the market could not place a fair value.”  The listing price gave TransCentury, which is investing in
construction and electricity companies, a market value of 13.4
billion shillings ($149 million), Chief Executive Officer Gachao
Kiuna told reporters July 5. The company will also raise $75
million through the sale of Eurobonds, he told reporters.
TransCentury’s revenue grew last year by 25 percent, Kiuna said
April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
