Israel â€™s air force struck the Hamas-
controlled Gaza Strip early today after rockets hit the Israeli
south as violence escalated after weeks of relative calm.  Seven rockets have hit Israel since July 13, causing no
damage or injury, and the Israeli military has launched three
air strikes on Gaza, an army spokeswoman said, speaking
anonymously according to regulation. Palestinian health
officials said at least five people were wounded in the strikes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
