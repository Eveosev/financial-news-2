The Federal  Reserve Bank  of New York
recouped $4.68 billion in cash from its now-halted auctions of
mortgage bonds assumed in the U.S. rescue of  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)   The amount,  posted  today on the New York Fed’s website,
represents about 47 cents on the dollar for almost $10 billion
of debt. The central bank in March rejected an AIG bid of about
51 cents on the dollar for a pool of almost $31 billion of
securities that includes those the New York Fed has sold.  It ended the auctions last month, citing “market
conditions,” after the sales helped roil credit prices,
reducing the value of some subprime-mortgage securities by
almost 20 percent. The offerings may be resumed later.  A total of 22 broker-dealers bought the bonds, either on
behalf of their clients or to hold in their inventories,
according to the data released today.  Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit topped the list,
purchasing $1.14 billion of debt, based on sales prices.
Citigroup Inc. bought $699.4 million, while Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc’s RBS Securities acquired $541.1 million and Credit
Suisse Group purchased $419.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
