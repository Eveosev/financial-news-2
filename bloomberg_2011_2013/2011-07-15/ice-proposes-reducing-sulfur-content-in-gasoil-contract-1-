ICE Futures  Europe  exchange is
proposing to reduce the sulfur content of its gasoil contract to
keep pace with cleaner fuels being introduced in the region.  ICE intends to cut the sulfur in its gasoil contract to 10
parts-per-million sulfur from 1,000 ppm starting from January
2014 futures, the exchange said today in a  circular  posted on
its website to members. The cetane index, a measure of the
performance of the fuel, will be increased to a minimum of 46
from 45, according ICE proposal.  The 10ppm fuel “constitutes the grade that will continue
to be the most representative part of the wider European
physical middle distillate market,” ICE said. “This
specification represents a highly liquid, fungible physical
base, one with high and growing demand and many supply sources
within Europe and globally.”  ICE’s gasoil contract is used as a benchmark for
heating oil, diesel and jet fuel. Diesel used in the European
Union has a maximum of 10 ppm sulfur.  The exchange may also introduce a low-sulfur gasoil
contract with 10 ppm to begin from the January 2012 contract
month until December 2013, trading in parallel with the existing
1,000 ppm contract.  Consultation with bourse members will be completed by July
29, after which ICE will publish a final notice on any changes,
the exchange said.  Germany , Europe’s largest heating market, is encouraging
sales of gasoil with 50 ppm sulfur from grades with a higher
content of the pollutant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
