Avusa Ltd. (AVU) , which runs a publishing
venture with  Pearson Plc (PSON)  in South Africa, will combine content
from Business Day newspaper, I-Net Bridge and the Financial Mail
to start an online venture next year,  Business Day  said, citing
the paper’s editor, Peter Bruce.  The operation, which will support a so-called pay wall
where users are charged to for access, will be called Business
Day Live, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported today, with
Bruce adding that there won’t be any job losses stemming from
the change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
