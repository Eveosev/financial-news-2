India ’s benchmark stock index fell,
halting three weeks of gains, as investors sold riskier assets
amid concern a global slowdown will hurt corporate earnings.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the country’s biggest
mortgage provider, slid for the third time this week. Asian
equities dropped after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut the
U.S.’s rating and the  Federal Reserve  ruled out immediate
further bond purchases. The European Banking Authority will
release results of the stress tests for 91 banks as part of an
effort to reassure investors the region’s banks have sufficient
capital.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software
exporter, rose 2 percent after net income climbed 28 percent,
beating estimates, as clients outsourced more computer services.  “I don’t know how Monday morning will look like, the way
things stand now, said Gajendra Nagpal, chief executive officer
at Unicon Financial Intermediaries Pvt. in  New Delhi . ‘‘News
from  Europe  is not going to be very good. People would like to
approach next week with as little position as possible.’’  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
56.28, or 0.3 percent, to 18,561.92 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai. The gauge shed 1.6 percent this week, its first loss in
four weeks. The S&P CNX Nifty Index declined 0.3 percent to
5,581.10 and its July futures settled at 5,591.25. The BSE 200
Index decreased 0.3 percent to 2,307.37.  Housing Development declined 1.4 percent to 693.8 rupees.
 Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-largest motorcycle maker, slid 0.6
percent to 1,422.2 rupees, extending yesterday’s 1.5 percent
drop after posting a smaller-than-expected 21 percent gain in
first-quarter profit as raw-material costs rose. Infosys Ltd.,
the second-largest software services provider, shed 0.3 percent
to 2,731.35 rupees, falling 8.8 percent in six sessions.  Earnings Outlook  The three are among companies on the Sensex whose earnings
have lagged behind estimates.  ‘‘Corporate earnings are not going to be very good in the
June quarter as commodities prices,  interest rates  and inflation
were very high,’’ Unicon’s Nagpal said.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the largest state explorer, slid
1.6 percent to 278.9 rupees.  Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. (RELI) , the
builder of a mass rapid transit system in Mumbai, fell 1.2
percent to 569.35 rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, lost 3.3 percent to 1,033.05 rupees, making
it the worst-performing auto company on the Sensex this year.
 Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , the biggest motorcycle maker, lost 1.2
percent to 1,828.3 rupees. It has lost 3.9 percent this week.  Beating Estimate  Tata Consultancy jumped 2 percent to 1,146.05 rupees and
its July futures settled 1,148.05 rupees. Net income jumped 28
percent to 23.8 billion rupees ($535 million) in the quarter
ended June. A Bloomberg News survey of 21 analysts estimated a
23 percent jump in profit to 22.6 billion rupees.  The company said it continues to see strong demand for its
computer services because global economic uncertainty prompts
customers to adapt and outsource more work. It gets as much as
90 percent of its sales from Europe and the Americas.  ‘‘The macro uncertainty is real and it’s not going to go
away in the near future,” Chief Executive Officer N. Chandrasekaran said yesterday. “Everybody is getting adjusted
to the operating environment but staying pretty much focused on
what they have to do. That is driving opportunities.”  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest software services provider,
climbed 0.8 percent to 414.8 rupees, halting a four-day 4.6
percent slide.  The Sensex has declined 9.5 percent this year, the second-
worst performer among key indexes in the world’s 10 biggest
markets, amid rate increases. Companies on the measure are
valued at 15 times estimated earnings, compared with 11 for the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Overseas investors bought a net 3.38 billion rupees ($76
million) of Indian stocks on July 14, raising total investment
in equities this year to 91.5 billion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
