Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Europe’s
second-largest airline, became the first carrier in the world to
offer regular scheduled flights running on biofuel, with four
daily round trips between Hamburg and Frankfurt.  The airline will use a biofuel blend using 50 percent so-
called hydrotreated renewable jet fuel, Lufthansa said. The fuel
is made from feedstocks including inedible plants and wood
chips. Lufthansa will fly an Airbus A321 on the services.  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group, Europe’s biggest airline, operated
the world’s first commercial biofuel flight last month, using a
blend of recycled cooking oil to drive a  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-800.
Finnair OYJ plans to test planes between Amsterdam and Helsinki.  Airlines won approval in June to power planes with blends
including biofuels made from algae to organic waste from the
U.S. standards body ASTM International. The International Air
Transport Association industry group set a target in 2007 to
eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from  air travel  by 2050.  Other airlines that have run test flights with biofuels or
begun exploring their use include United Continental Holdings
Inc., Japan Airlines Co., Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., Qatar
Airways and Qantas Airways Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
