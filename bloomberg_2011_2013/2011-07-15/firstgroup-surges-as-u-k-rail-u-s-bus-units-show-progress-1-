FirstGroup Plc (FGP)  rose the most in 15
months in  London  trading after Britain’s biggest train operator
said first-quarter trading was in line with forecasts, buoyed by
improving trends at its U.K. rail and U.S. bus businesses.  FirstGroup advanced as much as 8.8 percent to 358.9 pence,
the sharpest gain since March 17, 2010, and was trading at 358.7
pence as of 10:58 a.m. in London. The advance pared the stock’s
decline this year to 10 percent and bolstered the company’s
market value to 1.73 billion pounds ($2.8 billion).  The company is making “good progress” in implementing a
recovery plan at its First Student unit, which operates about
57,000 yellow school buses in  North America , it said in a
statement today. The unit generated 17 percent of the group’s
earnings last year and has been suffering from constraints on
school budgets prompted by pressure on U.S. municipal finances.  “If the First Student business does well it means they can
afford to keep paying the dividend,” said Carl Burns, an analyst
at Shore Capital in Liverpool,  England , who has a “hold” rating
on the stock. “The share performance has been very poor.”  FirstGroup will pay a dividend of 15 pence a share on Aug.
19, a yield of 6.6 percent. That compares with 0.9 percent for
Stagecoach Group Plc, 3.6 percent for Go-Ahead Group Plc and 2.4
percent for National Express Group Plc, Bloomberg data shows.  U.K. rail revenue rose 8.5 percent on a comparable basis,
with Greyhound bus unit sales 3.7 percent higher, the Aberdeen,
Scotland-based company said. Revenue at its U.K. bus division,
the biggest profit generator, advanced 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
