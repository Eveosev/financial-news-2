Chrysler Group LLC, heading into
labor negotiations with the  United Auto Workers , is planning 
to purchase trucks for use by non-union workers to transport 
its cars and trucks, the UAW’s top leader said.  UAW President Bob King, speaking in front of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters convention in Las Vegas
last month, said he’d been told of “a new ploy” by Chrysler to
“buy $5 million worth of trucks to give to a non-union company
to do work.” A video of the speech was posted on a Teamsters-
affiliated  website  earlier this month.  King will lead the UAW in contract negotiations with Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler, which is controlled by  Fiat SpA (F) ,
as well as  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  that officially
begin later this month. The UAW will push back against efforts
to outsource Teamster jobs to non-union car haulers, King said.  “We’re going to stand with the Teamsters,” he said.
“We’re going to fight not only to keep the jobs you have, but
where they are using non-union carriers, we’re going to fight
together to make that 100 percent union, 100 percent Teamster,”
he said to applause.  When this has been an issue before, King said, the UAW’s
previous message was: “You’ve got a war with the UAW if you try
to outsource Teamster jobs to non-union carriers.”  Michele Martin, a UAW spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond for comment. Galen Munroe, a Teamsters spokesman,
declined yesterday to comment, and  Shawn Morgan , a Chrysler
spokeswoman, didn’t immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
