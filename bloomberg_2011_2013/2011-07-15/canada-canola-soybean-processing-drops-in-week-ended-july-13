Canadian mills processed 4.2 percent
less canola and 16 percent fewer soybeans in the week ended July
13, compared with a week earlier, an industry group said.  Mills crushed 111,564 metric tons of canola, also called
rapeseed, and 14,941 tons of soybeans, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-
based Canadian Oilseed Processors Association said today in an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
