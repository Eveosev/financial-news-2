Banco Sabadell SA said European
Union regulators found it has sufficient capital to withstand a
recession and losses on sovereign debt.  The lender’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of
financial strength, was 5.7 percent in the test’s adverse
scenario, surpassing the 5 percent minimum required by the
European Banking Authority’s tests, the company said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
