Greece  issued 58 percent more visas
to Russians in the first six months of 2011 than in the year-
earlier period,  Kathimerini  reported, citing Culture and Tourism
Minister Pavlos Yeroulanos.  Multiple-entry visas for Russians have increased eightfold
since Greece opened four visa centers in  Russia  to provide
papers faster, Yeroulanos said at a press conference in Moscow,
according to the newspaper.  Greece wants to attract more visitors from Russia, Israel,
Turkey and Ukraine, Kathimerini said, adding that Yeroulanos
travels to Ukraine today.  To contact the reporter on this story
