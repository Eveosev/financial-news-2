U.S. stocks erased gains after a
measure of  consumer confidence  was below economist forecasts and
House Speaker John Boehner said Republicans won’t accept tax
increases in a deficit-reduction deal.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent to
1,307.93 at 10:27 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  declined 19.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,418.05.  Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in July
to the lowest level in more than two years, adding to concern
that weak employment gains and falling home prices may keep
households from spending. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment decreased to
63.8, the weakest reading since March 2009, from 71.5 the prior
month. The gauge was projected to rise to 72.2, according to the
median forecast of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Stocks lost gains amid concern negotiations toward raising
the U.S. debt ceiling are failing to progress. House Speaker
 John Boehner , a Republican from Ohio, told reporters that his
party wouldn’t accept any tax increases as they work with
President Barack Obama on a deal to lower deficits and possibly
raise the U.S. debt limit.  The  S&P 500  rallied 93 percent from its low in March 2009
through yesterday as the Federal Reserve used large-scale asset
purchases to buoy the economy and companies posted earnings that  beat analysts’ estimates. Of the 12 S&P 500 companies that have
posted results so far this earnings season, 10 have beaten
forecasts for per-share profit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
