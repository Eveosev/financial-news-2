Mauritius’s rupee headed for its
first weekly decline this month against the dollar as concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen and the U.S.’s credit rating may
be cut curbed demand for riskier frontier-market assets.  The currency fell as much as 0.5 percent to 28.45 per
dollar before trading at 28.3 by 1:12 p.m. in Port Louis, the
capital, bringing this week’s loss to 0.5 percent. The rupee has
added 9.1 percent to the dollar this year, the second-best
performing currency in  Africa  after  Mozambique ’s metical.  Frontier-market stocks fell while the dollar rose against
all but one of 16 major peers as investors sought the safest
assets before an Italian vote on austerity plans and European
bank stress-test results.  Standard & Poor’s  said it may lower
its  credit rating  for the U.S. as politicians struggle to agree
on raising the debt ceiling. The rupee closely tracks the euro’s
movements against the dollar, with an average correlation of
0.88 this week. A value of 1 would mean they move in lock step.  “Europe, our main market, is struggling, and that hurts us
in turn,” Fabien Gebert, treasurer at GML, a Port Louis-based
investment group that says it’s the country’s biggest by
revenue, said by phone.  Europe is Mauritius biggest market for tourism and textile
products, representing 41 percent of the country’s foreign-
currency earnings, according central-bank data. Buying prices
for dollars ranged from 27.25 rupees to 27.6 rupees, while the
selling price was 28.9524 per dollar, according to indicative
exchange rates published on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website 
today.  Mauritian stocks snapped five days of declines, with the
38-member SEMDEX index rising 0.2 percent to 2,060.98 by the
1:30 p.m. close, led by Mauritius Commercial Bank, the Indian
Ocean island nation’s largest lender by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
