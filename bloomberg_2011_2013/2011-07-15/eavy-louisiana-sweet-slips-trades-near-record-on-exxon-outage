Heavy  Louisiana  Sweet oil’s premium
slipped from a record high reached as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  performs
maintenance on a pipeline segment in Louisiana that transports
the oil to refineries.  The line was shut June 29 for scheduled hydrotesting,
Claire Hassett, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail
yesterday. The work will take place over the “next few weeks,”
she said July 13.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium sank 75 cents to $23.50 a
barrel over WTI as of 4:09 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The grade traded at the highest premium
since at least 1991 yesterday at $24.25 a barrel greater than
the U.S. benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium rose 40 cents to $19.25 a
barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premiums for Mars
Blend and Poseidon added 75 cents $16.75 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium advanced $1.75 to $15.75 a
barrel, while West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 75
cents. Thunder Horse’s premium was unchanged at $22.50.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $9.50. Syncrude
is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands 
in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$18.65 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
