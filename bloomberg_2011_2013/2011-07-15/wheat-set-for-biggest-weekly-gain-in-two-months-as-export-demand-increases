Wheat fell for a second day in
 Chicago  on speculation buyers of the grain will turn to Russian
supplies and shun the U.S. and the European Union. Rice slid.  Russia ’s overall grain harvest may total 90 million metric
tons in 2011 and exporters will ship 1.5 million tons in July,
First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov said yesterday. That’s
up from the 85 million tons forecast by Prime Minister  Vladimir
Putin  last month.  Egypt , the world’s biggest wheat importer,
said this week it may add Romania and Ukraine as suppliers.  “We may have a reminder of just how much cheaper wheat
from Russia has become since the opening of their export window
when Egypt tenders for wheat again,” said  Dave Norris , an
independent grain broker in Harrogate, England. “Any sharp
price rises in the EU will only serve to alienate EU wheat on
the export front even further.”  Wheat for September delivery declined 5.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $7.0125 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Milling wheat for November delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 1 euro, or 0.5 percent, to
198.75 euros ($280.73) a ton.  Egypt purchased Russian-grown wheat this month for the
first time since the eastern European country barred all grain
exports last year. The ban expired July 1 as scheduled. Egypt is
seeking to buy at least 55,000 tons of soft wheat at a tender
today.  Corn, Soybeans  Corn for December delivery rose 5.25 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $6.8375 a bushel in Chicago. The grain has climbed 8.7
percent this year as rainfall in the U.S., the world’s top
grower and exporter, delayed seeding.  Soybeans for November delivery added 5.75 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $13.8975 a bushel. A gain today would be the 10th in
a row. The oilseed increased 41 percent in the past year, partly
on rising demand from  China , the biggest importer.  Rice for September delivery dropped 21 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $16.79 per 100 pounds. The grain is still up 13
percent in July, on course for the biggest monthly advance since
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
