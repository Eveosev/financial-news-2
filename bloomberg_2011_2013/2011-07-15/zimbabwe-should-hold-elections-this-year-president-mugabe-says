Zimbabwe should hold elections this
year as the power-sharing government set up in 2009 has “run
its full course,” President  Robert Mugabe  said today.  “We still have six months to go and elections can be held
this year,” Mugabe told the central committee meeting of his
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. “The inclusive
government born out of the agreement was never meant to last
forever.”  Zanu-PF’s chief decision-making body yesterday decided
“unanimously” that elections should be held this year, rather
than 2012, the Harare-based Herald newspaper reported today,
citing party spokesman Rugare Gumbo.  The Movement for Democratic Change, which shares power with
ZANU-PF, wants the election delayed until democratic safeguards
can be put in place. The MDC is pushing for a new constitution,
guarantees on press freedom and for foreign election monitors to
be deployed for six months before any vote.  The South African Institute of Race Relations said on June
3 that  Zimbabwe ’s electoral register was flawed, containing the
“impossible figure” of more than 40,000 people older than 100
years, and needed to be replaced.
