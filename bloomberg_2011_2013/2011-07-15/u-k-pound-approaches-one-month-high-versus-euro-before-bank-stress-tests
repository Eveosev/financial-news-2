The pound traded near the strongest
level in almost a month against the euro before the publication
of stress tests on European banks that may show lenders need to
raise more capital than their U.K. counterparts.  Britain’s currency was little changed versus the dollar.
 Europe ’s stress tests, which will reveal how much government
support the finance industry needs to stay solvent, are due to
be published from 5 p.m.  London  time. Ten-year gilts rose for a
second day.  “Sterling seems to be benefiting from a diversification
trade before the stress tests,” said Jane Foley, a senior
foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank International in London.
“It’s all about negative sentiment surrounding the euro.
Sterling’s getting a little bit of support despite a weak
fundamental backdrop.”  The pound traded at 87.55 pence per euro as of 9:02 a.m. in
London from 87.62 pence yesterday, after reaching 87.49 pence on
July 12, the strongest since June 16. Sterling slipped 0.1
percent to $1.6120 from $1.6156. It reached $1.6194 yesterday,
the most since June 22.  The pound has dropped 6.8 percent in the last 12 months
against nine developed-market peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, the second-biggest
decline after the dollar.  Downgrade Outlook  Government bonds  rose, with the 10-year gilt advancing for
a second day, pushing the yield down three basis points to 3.08
percent. The two-year yield dropped one basis point to 0.70
percent.  The Debt Management Office appointed Citigroup Inc., HSBC
Holdings Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc. and UBS AG to lead a sale of
inflation-linked bonds maturing in March 2034 in the week
starting July 25, it said in a statement today.  Gilts have advanced this month as concern that Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis is spreading to some of the euro area’s
larger economies stoked demand for the safest assets, and on
speculation that slowing economic growth will limit the Bank of
England’s ability to raise borrowing cost as the  European
Central Bank  tightens monetary policy.  Gilts have returned 1.7 percent since the end of June,
compared with a 4.1 percent loss by Italian bonds, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds handed investors a
1.9 percent loss, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
