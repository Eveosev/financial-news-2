reversing an earlier gain of 0.7 percent, as concern U.S. debt
ratings may be downgraded outweighed prospects for economic
expansion in the worldâ€™s biggest crude user.  Crude for August delivery was at $95.62 a barrel, down 7
cents,  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:05 p.m.
Singapore time after earlier gaining as much as 65 cents. The

July 11. Prices are down 0.6 percent for the week and 25 percent
higher the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement was at $115.98 a barrel,
down 28 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

York crude after settling at a record of $22.63 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
