Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  and
 Espirito Santo Financial Group SA (ESF)  will increase capital or sell
assets in the next three months to strengthen their balance
sheets, the Bank of  Portugal  said on its website today.  Banco Comercial passed the European Union stress test with
a 5.4 percent capital ratio and ESFG passed the test with a 5.1
percent capital ratio.  The Portuguese central bank decided that the country’s
lenders should reinforce their capital so that they can exceed
“even more comfortably” the minimum capital level set in the
stress test exercise and established a reference level of 6
percent, Carlos Costa told reporters in Lisbon today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
