The euro fluctuated against the
dollar before European bank stress-test results amid concern the
U.S.’s AAA  credit rating  is at risk.  The euro strengthened for a third day against the yen as
Italian lawmakers prepared for a confidence vote on an austerity
package.  Standard & Poor’s  said there’s a 50 percent chance the
U.S. will lose its top credit rating even if Congress reaches
agreement on raising the debt ceiling.  The 17-nation currency appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.4163
as of 11:19 a.m. in  London , after weakening as much as 0.3
percent, and rose 0.1 percent to 112.07 yen.  S&P may lower the U.S.’s long-term rating by one or more
notches into the AA category if it concludes Congress and
President Barack Obama’s administration haven’t achieved a
credible solution to the rising government debt burden and
aren’t likely to achieve one in the near future, the company
said in a statement dated yesterday.  The European Banking Authority will release the results of
the stress tests for regional banks as part of an effort to
reassure investors that lenders have sufficient capital. The
assessments are the first by the EBA since it was set up earlier
this year. The results will be published from 5 p.m. U.K. time.  The Australian dollar depreciated against all but one of 16
major peers tracked by Bloomberg, falling 0.6 percent against
the greenback to $1.0656, after Westpac Banking Corp. became the
first among the nation’s four-biggest lenders to predict the
central bank will cut  interest rates  in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
