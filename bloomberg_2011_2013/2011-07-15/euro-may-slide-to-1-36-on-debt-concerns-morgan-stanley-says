The euro may slide to $1.36 by year
end on concern that the European sovereign-debt crisis will
worsen, according to  Ian Stannard , head of European foreign-
exchange strategy at Morgan Stanley in  London .  “Until we see a longer-term agreement, until we see the
European authorities able to bring in a framework to deal with
these problems before they arise, then the euro is going to
continue to remain extremely vulnerable,” Stannard said in an
interview in London yesterday. “The dollar will continue to be
relatively well supported, particularly in an environment where
 risk aversion  is likely to remain high.”  The euro may also weaken to a record 1.13 against the Swiss
franc until European officials “restore confidence,” he said.
He does not expect Switzerland’s policy makers to intervene in
 currency markets  to weaken the franc after similar attempts
contributed to a record loss of $21 billion at the central bank
in 2010.  “Given the size of the  Swiss National Bank ’s balance sheet
following the last rounds of intervention, it makes it very
difficult for them to come back in and carry out further
action,” Stannard said. “I wouldn’t expect them to come into
the market so Swiss franc strength is going to continue.”  The euro was little changed at $1.4154, as of 12:21 p.m. in
London, and last traded at $1.36 on Feb. 22. It was 0.2 percent
stronger at 1.1563 Swiss francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
