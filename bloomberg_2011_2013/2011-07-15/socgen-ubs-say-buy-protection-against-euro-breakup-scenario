Societe Generale SA recommended
buying insurance against a euro “meltdown,” and UBS AG said
the Danish krone may offer protection as  Europe ’s debt crisis
threatens to deteriorate.  “It is not too late to get hedges,” SocGen strategists
David Deddouche and Olivier Korber wrote in an investor report
dated yesterday. “We simply cannot rule out entirely a further
dramatic collapse” of the euro against the dollar, and a
rebound in the 17-nation currency to above $1.40 “provides a
fresh opportunity to hedge against such an event through tail
options,” they said.  UBS currency strategist  Chris Walker  said “a significant
escalation in the euro-zone debt crisis, to the extent the
existence of the euro is itself threatened, could lead to the
abandonment” of  Denmark ’s currency peg to the euro. Though this
would cause short-term volatility, longer term the krone would
likely appreciate against other Scandinavian currencies and the
euro, he wrote.  The euro was little changed at $1.4142 as of 8:05 a.m. in
 London . It fell to $1.3837 on July 12, the lowest level since
March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
