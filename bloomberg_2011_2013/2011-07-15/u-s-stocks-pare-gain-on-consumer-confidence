U.S. stocks pared gains after a
gauge of consumer confidence missed economist forecasts.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to
1,314.31. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 19.98
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,457.10.  Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in July
to the lowest level in more than two years, adding to concern
that weak employment gains and falling home prices may keep
households from spending. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment decreased to
63.8, the weakest reading since March 2009, from 71.5 the prior
month. The gauge was projected to rise to 72.2, according to the
median forecast of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The S&P 500 rallied 93 percent from its low in March 2009
through yesterday as the  Federal Reserve  used large-scale asset
purchases to buoy the economy and companies posted earnings that
beat analysts’ estimates. Of the 12  S&P 500  companies that have
posted results so far this earnings season, 10 have beaten
forecasts for per-share profit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
