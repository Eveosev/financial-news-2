European margins on processing crude
into gasoline, diesel and other fuels fell 48 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, according to data from  Total
SA (FP) , the continent’s largest refiner.  Margins plunged to $16.30 a metric ton ($2.22 a barrel)
from $31.20 a ton a year ago, the Paris-based company said today
in a statement.  Prices for fuel products dropped more than benchmark  Brent
crude  in the second quarter because of declining demand,
squeezing profits for refiners. Gasoline for immediate loading
in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading hub, fell
5.2 percent, while Brent crude fell 4.2 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Margins won’t rise “materially” before 2013 as additional
capacity outweighs demand, according to a report by Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. on June 9. Europe is “suffering from
overcapacity and weak demand growth,” it said.  Falling profits and demand have forced refiners including
Petroplus Holdings AG, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total to reduce
capacity through sales and closures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
