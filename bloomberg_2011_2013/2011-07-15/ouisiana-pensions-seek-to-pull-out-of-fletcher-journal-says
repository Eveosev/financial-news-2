Three  Louisiana  pension funds are
seeking to withdraw all their money from Fletcher Asset
Management after the New York-based money-management firm met
prior redemptions with promissory notes instead of cash, the
Wall Street Journal reported.  Two of the pension funds submitted written requests to
redeem the remainder of their investments, the newspaper said.
The funds have $143 million invested with Fletcher, it said,
citing fund documents and an unnamed fund official and
consultant to the  retirement plans .  The funds, pension systems for municipal employees of
Louisiana, the state’s firefighters and the New Orleans
firefighters, unsuccessfully tried to cash out some of their
investments in the hedge fund, they said in a join statement
this week. The investment was designed to return at least 12
percent annually, with other investors absorbing losses when
fund returns were below that mark, according to the statement.  “The distribution of a promissory note in lieu of
immediate cash has raised concerns with each of the systems
respective boards,” the Firefighters’ Retirement System, the
New Orleans Firefighters’ Retirement System and the Municipal
Employees’ Retirement System said in the statement, dated July
11.  Debbie Charleville, an administrative specialist for the
Firefighters’ Retirement System in  Baton Rouge , declined to
comment. Richard Hampton, executive director of the New Orleans
Firefighters’ Retirement System, and Robert Rust, executive
director of the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System, didn’t
immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment.  Messages left with Fletcher, based in  New York , were not
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
