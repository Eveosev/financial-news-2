The European Union plans to force
banks to disclose how they fare in future stress tests to
prevent any repeat of the last-minute withdrawal of Germany’s
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen from this year’s exams.  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, is
seeking to empower national regulators and the European Banking
Authority to override professional secrecy rules so that they
can publish stress test data, according to a draft of the plans
seen by Bloomberg News. Under existing law, the banks retain
ownership of the information and decide what may be published.  Professional secrecy rules “shall not prevent”
regulators from publishing the outcome of stress tests, the
document says. Authorities should also be allowed to transfer
the data to the EBA for publication, it says.  Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen, known as Helaba, refused to
allow the EBA to release its stress-test data on July 13 in a
dispute over the regulator’s measurement of Core Tier 1 capital,
the gauge by which banks are said to have passed or failed the
exercise. The bank said it was “incomprehensible” for the EBA
to exclude instruments that German regulators counted toward
lenders’ reserves.  Helaba spokesman Wolfgang Kuss didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment. Bafin,  Germany ’s financial supervisor,
doesn’t comment on pending legislation, the regulator’s
spokesman Ben Fischer said.  The European Commission will publish the proposal on July
20 as part of a broader set of measures to toughen bank capital
rules. The plans will need to be approved by governments and
lawamkers in the European Parliament before they can enter into
force.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
