Zimbabwe’s security forces arrested
four journalists who were covering the eviction of a police
officer from her state-provided lodgings, the Media Institute of
Southern Africa said in an e-mailed statement.  The police officer was allegedly moved out of her home in
Bulawayo because she supported the Movement for Democratic
Change, a rival to President  Robert Mugabe ’s party, the
institute said.  A police spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.
