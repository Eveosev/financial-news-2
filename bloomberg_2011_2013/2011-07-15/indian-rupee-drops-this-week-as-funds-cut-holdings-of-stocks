India ’s rupee fell this week by the
most in two months on concern overseas investors will refrain
from adding to holdings of the nation’s stocks after inflation
accelerated in June.  Funds based abroad sold $65 million more equities than they
bought in the week to July 13, according to exchange data.
Appetite for emerging-market assets may also wane as the
European debt crisis deepens, according to Sudarshan Bhatt at
Mumbai-based  Corporation Bank .  “Inflation poses a problem as foreign investors may not
bring money into the Indian equity market,” said Bhatt, chief
currency trader at the lender. “The situation in  Europe  will
also dictate flows.”  The rupee slipped 0.4 percent this week, the sharpest drop
since the period ended May 6, to 44.5100 per dollar as of 10:15
a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was
little changed today.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.01 in
three months, compared with expectations of 45.02 yesterday.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  India’s wholesale-price index rose 9.44 percent in June
from a year earlier, compared with 9.06 percent in May, the
commerce ministry said in a statement yesterday. Inflation has
held above 8 percent for 18 consecutive months.  The rise in costs is a matter of concern and the government
is working with the central bank to reduce prices, according to
a finance ministry statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
