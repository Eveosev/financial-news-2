The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  should make the process of adopting Dodd-Frank Act
rules more transparent by publicly posting drafts of new
regulations for the $601 trillion swaps market for seven days
before the agency finalizes them, the chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee said.  The agency should also adopt no more than three rules at
each meeting and publish a plan for when the rules would take
effect in the market, Representative  Frank Lucas , Republican of
Oklahoma, said in a letter today to  Gary Gensler , CFTC chairman.  “This transparency will help to mitigate any potential
market disruption as rules become effective,” Lucas said.  The CFTC has begun finalizing rules, including new powers
for the agency’s enforcement lawyers to pursue fraudulent
manipulation in derivatives markets. The agency has scheduled a
July 19 meeting to consider final rules related to
whistleblowers and the process for reviewing swaps for clearing.  Dodd-Frank, the financial overhaul enacted last July, seeks
to reduce risk and boost transparency after largely unregulated
trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
