Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s assets may have declined in 2010 even as the stock
market improved.  The central bank chief and his family owned financial
assets valued between $1.06 million and $2.31 million, a lower
range than the $1.15 million to $2.48 million reported last
year, according to annual financial disclosures released by the
Fed today. The forms from the Office of Government Ethics
require officials to report only a range in the value of
holdings.  Bernanke’s two largest assets are retirement accounts,
listed as TIAA Traditional and CREF Stock Large Cap Blend. Both
were valued in a range of $500,001 to $1 million in both years.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 13 percent in 2010.
Bernanke has fought the worst U.S. recession and financial
crisis since the 1930s by lowering the benchmark U.S. interest
rate to zero and embarking on two rounds of large-scale asset
purchases that drove the Fed’s balance sheet to a record $2.88
trillion.  Bernanke, 57, who succeeded  Alan Greenspan  as chairman in
2006 and began a second four-year term in 2010, earns a salary
of $199,700, an amount set by Congress.  A former Princeton professor, Bernanke earned between
$150,000 and $1.1 million in royalties from textbooks last year.
In 2009, he earned at least $200,000 from textbook royalties,
more than his compensation as central bank chief.  Regional Presidents  The central bank’s annual report, released earlier this
month, showed that the presidents of the Fed’s regional banks
have the bigger salaries.  William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of  New York , earned $410,780 last year. The 11 regional
bank presidents who were in office at the end of 2010 had total
salaries of $3.8 million.  Salaries of the reserve bank presidents are set by the Fed
board with consideration for tenure and comparable executive
salaries in their regions.  The central bank today also released disclosures for the
other members of the Fed’s Board of Governors and their
families, showing that all five are millionaires. Vice Chairman
Janet Yellen and her husband George Akerlof, a Nobel laureate,
had assets between $5.1 million and $13.7 million, according to
the disclosures.  Governor  Elizabeth Duke , a former banker, had at least $3
million in assets. Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin , a former
Maryland banking regulator, and Governor Daniel Tarullo, a law
professor at  Georgetown University  before joining the Fed, each
had assets of at least $1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
