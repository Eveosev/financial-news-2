South Korean  government bonds 
advanced, pushing yields to a one-month low, as concern local
and international economic growth is slowing bolstered demand
for the relative safety of sovereign debt.  The Bank of Korea cut its 2011 economic growth forecast to
4.3 percent from 4.5 percent today, while raising its annual
inflation estimate to 4 percent, from an April projection of 3.9
percent. The central bank board’s unanimous decision to leave
its benchmark interest rate unchanged yesterday reflected policy
makers’ concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is deepening,
Governor Kim Choong Soo said.  “Concerns that global and local economic recoveries may be
weaker than expected boosted demand for safer assets,” said
Hwang Soo Ho, fixed-income analyst at Daishin Securities Co. in
Seoul. “Speculation the Bank of  Korea  may raise  interest rates 
in the second half is limiting further gains in bonds.”  The yield on South Korea’s 4 percent bond due March 2016
dropped one basis point to 3.92 percent, the lowest level since
June 20, according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. The rate dropped 15 basis points
this week, the most since the security began trading in March.  The won climbed 0.1 percent to close at 1,057.95 per dollar
at 3 p.m. in Seoul, leaving it down 0.1 percent for the week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,054.10 yesterday, the strongest level since August 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
