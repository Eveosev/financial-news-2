Former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich ’s
presidential campaign, beset by resignations of his top aides,
owes more than $450,000 to an air charter company for travel and
almost $50,000 to himself, accounting for about half of the $1
million in debt reported today to the U.S.  Federal Election
Commission.   He was one of several presidential candidates reporting
today to the FEC. The reports cover fundraising through June 30.  Gingrich told the FEC he had raised $2.1 million through
June 30 and had $322,222 in the bank. He received $5,000 from
his leadership political action committee and $5,000 from
Citizens United PAC, whose challenge to federal election law led
to the January 2010 Supreme Court ruling allowing corporations
and unions to spend money from their treasuries in support of
candidates.  Besides $451,946 for travel, the Gingrich campaign also
reported owing $212,060 for website management and $101,144 in
legal fees. Gingrich is owed $47,005 for travel and a mailing
list.  More than a dozen campaign aides resigned last month,
citing disagreements over strategy, the role of Gingrich’s wife,
Callista, and money. His two top fundraising aides also quit.  Gingrich Trailing  Gingrich’s fundraising trailed such Republican candidates
as former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and former
Minnesota Governor  Tim Pawlenty .  Romney led all Republican candidates by raising $18.3
million. According to his FEC report, registered lobbyists
brought in $517,450 for his campaign. He had a bank account
balance of $12.7 million, also tops among Republicans.  Pawlenty reported raising $4.3 million and had $2 million
in the bank. The campaign said $610,000 of that total was for
the general election.  Representative Joe Wilson, the South Carolina Republican
who gained national attention for yelling, “You lie,” during
President Barack Obama’s Sept. 9, 2009, address to Congress,
contributed $5,000 from his campaign account. So did the
political action committee of Minneapolis-based  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) 
Pawlenty’s leadership PAC gave $4,749.  Pawlenty also landed two former top fundraisers for
President  George W. Bush  for his national finance team. In the
2004 presidential, Tom Hicks, chairman of Dallas-based Hicks
Holdings LLC, brought in more than $100,000 for Bush and Ray
Washburne, chairman and chief executive officer of Dallas-based
Charter Holdings brought in more than $200,000 for the former
president’s re-election campaign.  Bachmann Fundraising  U.S. Representative  Michele Bachmann  of Minnesota raised
$1.6 million, including $1.1 million in donations of less than
$200, and transferred $2 million from her congressional campaign
account to her presidential committee. She had $3.4 million cash
on hand.  Another small donor favorite, U.S. Representative  Ron Paul 
of Texas announced in a news release that he had raised $4.5
million and had $3 million in the bank.  Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum raised $582,348
and had $229,115 in the bank.  Businessman  Herman Cain  raised $2 million, with $1.1
million in donations of under $200, and lent his campaign
$500,000. He had a bank account balance of $481,895.  Former Utah Governor  Jon Huntsman , who served as U.S.
ambassador to  China  under Obama, doesn’t have to disclose his
fundraising until October. Huntsman’s campaign announced July 1
that it had taken in $4.1 million, including some funds from the
candidate.  $46 Million  Obama’s campaign committee reported raising $46 million
during the previous three months and entered July with $37.1
million in the bank.  The figures included $12.8 million from a joint fundraising
with the  Democratic National Committee  in which donors could
donate as much as $35,800 to the party and campaign. Those
giving the maximum included actor  George Clooney , comedienne
Ellen Degeneres; Robert Iger, chief executive officer of
Burbank, California-based,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ; and Robert Wolf,
chairman of UBS Americas, FEC records show.  Four years ago, Obama took in $58.6 million though June 30
of the non-election year, though he began raising money months
earlier than this time. During the three months from April to
June 2007, he raised $32.9 million. He announced his intention
to seek a second four-year term in April of this year.  Obama announced his fundraising totals on Wednesday, saying
that the campaign and the party took in more than $86 million
between them. The Democratic National Committee will spend most
of its money to re-elect the president.  The president today released a list of 244 people who
raised at least $50,000 for his re-election campaign by bundling
donations, the practice of soliciting friends and associates and
asking them to donate to the campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
