Cameroon distributed more than
200,000 high-yielding cocoa plants to farmers in the country’s
Mefou Afamba region in an effort to boost production of the
chocolate ingredient, the government said.  The plants were given to more than 15,000 farmers who are
now expected to cultivate an additional 200 hectares (494 acres)
with the crop by 2015, Clementine Ananga Messina, an official at
the Ministry of Agriculture, said in an interview yesterday at
the town of Mfou, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of the
capital, Yaounde.  “This is just the first action taken by government in its
program to revamp cocoa production in the country,” she said.  The Mefou Afamba region has 27,500 hectares of cocoa
plantings with average annual production of 2,000 metric tons of
beans, Rene Ntep, a ministry administrator, said in a separate
interview.  National output since August reached 222,200 tons while
production for the 2009-2010 season was 198,000 tons, according
to the Cocoa and Coffee Board.  Cocoa represents 25 percent of Cameroon’s annual non-oil
exports, according to Ananga Messina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
