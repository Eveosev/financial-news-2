Econet Wireless Zimbabwe Ltd. (ECWH) , the
country’s biggest mobile-phone operator, spent $430 million over
the past two years on improving voice and data services.  “Data is the future,” Econet Chief Executive Officer
Douglas Mboweni today told shareholders at the company’s annual
general meeting in the capital, Harare. “We are seeing a trend
away from traditional voice, towards data. We cannot be players
if we do not enhance our data capability. This is the space we
are increasingly playing in.”  The company has built a fiber-optic network that would
allow it access undersea cables in  South Africa , he said,
without disclosing how much Econet spent on the project.  While Econet had cut off 1.4 million subscribers who failed
to meet a March deadline to register SIM cards, the “vast
majority” of these had since been reconnected, Mboweni said.
The company, which has a 65 percent share of the Zimbabwe
mobile-phone market, plans to start a mobile money transfer
service by the end of the year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
