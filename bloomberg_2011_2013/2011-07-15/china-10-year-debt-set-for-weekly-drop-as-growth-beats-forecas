China ’s 10-year government bonds
declined this week on speculation the central bank is more
likely to raise borrowing costs after gross domestic product
increased more than expected in the second quarter.  Asia ’s largest economy grew 9.5 percent from a year earlier,
compared with the 9.3 percent median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, the statistics bureau said July 13. The
People’s Bank of China drained a net 86 billion yuan ($13.3
billion) from the financial system this week using bill sales,
the first withdrawal in two months, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Economic growth will probably be better than expected”
this year, said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co.
in  Shanghai . “For the time being, there is basically no hard
landing risk.”  The yield on the 3.94 percent government bond due January
2021 climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this
week to 3.94 percent as of the 4:30 p.m. close in Shanghai,
according to the Interbank Funding Center. The rate was up one
basis point today.  The cash shortage has eased on speculation the central bank
won’t raise lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios this month, said
Xu Dazhu, a bond trader at Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, declined 202 basis points this week to
4.13 percent, according to a weighted average rate compiled by
the National Interbank Funding Center. It dropped 85 basis
points from yesterday.  Bond Demand Low  The  finance ministry  failed to sell all of the three-year
debt offered at an auction on behalf of local governments on
July 11. A sale of one-year central  government securities  on
July 13 drew bids of 1.33 times the 30 billion yuan on offer,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.56 in a 30-year bond
sale the previous week.  “The cash supply is still quite unstable,” said Qilu
Bank’s Xu. “Demand for debt has waned, as reflected in the weak
demand in the auctions.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis
point this week to 3.84 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It dropped two basis points today.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
