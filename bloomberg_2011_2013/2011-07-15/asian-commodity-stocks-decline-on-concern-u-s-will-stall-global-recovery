Asian commodity stocks fell,
dragging the regional index toward its first weekly drop in four
weeks, after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut the U.S.’s credit
rating and the  Federal Reserve  ruled out immediate further
stimulus, driving down oil and metal prices yesterday.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, sank
1.6 percent in Sydney.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , the nation’s
second-biggest oil and gas producer, lost 2.2 percent.
Mitsubishi Corp.,  Japan ’s largest commodities trader, dropped
0.5 percent in  Tokyo .  Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)  jumped 4.9 percent
in Taipei after Nomura Holdings Inc. named the company one of
its top picks among Asian technology stocks.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.01 point, or less than
0.1 percent, to 135.69 as of 7:39 p.m. in Tokyo. About five
stocks rose for every four that fell. Last week, the gauge
extended its rally for a third week as European leaders hammered
out proposals to roll over debt to stop Greece defaulting,
 China ’s latest interest-rate increase sparked speculation a
tightening cycle may soon end, and a report showed U.S. retail
sales rose.  “America still provides growth leadership and is the
missing piece in the recovery story in many ways,” said James Holt, Sydney-based director of BlackRock Investment Management
(Australia) Ltd., which oversees about $40 billion. “The
default position is that a deal on the debt ceiling will be
struck, but markets are getting jittery about the lack of
progress. You either have a deal or you have a default, and one
is hugely positive while the other is hugely negative.”  U.S. Stalemate  S&P said there was at least a 50 percent chance it will
lower the U.S. AAA rating within 90 days, citing the risk of a
stalemate enduring beyond any near-term agreement to raise the
nation’s debt ceiling. Moody’s Investors Service put the U.S.
credit rating on review July 13 for a downgrade. The U.S. has
held the top rating since 1917.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.3 percent, led by
developers after China said it’s seeking to limit residential
property prices in smaller cities. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
fell 0.4 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.4
percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.7 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1
percent today. In  New York , the index slipped 0.7 percent
yesterday to the lowest level this month as a stalemate
continued in  Washington  on negotiations over the U.S. debt
ceiling.  Bernanke’s Mix Message  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying for a second day
before the Senate Banking Committee, told lawmakers yesterday:
“We’re not prepared at this point to take further action.” A
day earlier, he had said he was prepared to provide more
stimulus if needed.  Even as the ratings companies warned of downgrades, U.S.
Treasuries were still set for a weekly gain and three auctions
this week attracted higher-than-average bidding as the worsening
European debt crisis spurred investor demand for safer assets.  Ten-year Treasury yields were little changed at 2.96
percent, after falling to this year’s low of 2.81 percent
earlier this week. The 10-year average is 4.06 percent.  BHP, also Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, sank 1.6 percent
to A$42.89 in Sydney. Woodside fell 2.2 percent to A$39.17.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal by
market value, slid 1.8 percent to HK$27.00 in Hong Kong.
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  dropped 0.5 percent to 2,049 yen in Tokyo.
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest energy exploration company, lost
1.5 percent to 588,000 yen.  Hong Kong Developers  Crude oil for August delivery dropped 2.4 percent to settle
at $95.69 a barrel in New York yesterday. The London Metal
Exchange Index of prices for six metals including copper and
aluminum fell 1.8 percent.  Developers fell in Hong Kong after a summary of a State
Council meeting chaired by Premier Wen Jiabao showed China will
expand efforts to curb the growth in residential prices to
smaller cities after limiting home purchases in Beijing and
Shanghai.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , controlled by the
nation’s construction ministry, sank 4.9 percent to HK$16.08,
while  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , another state-controlled
developer, dropped 2.9 percent to HK$14.68.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 4.1 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 2.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.2 times for the S&P 500
and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  Technology Stocks  Asustek climbed 4.9 percent to NT$280 in Taipei, leading
technology stocks higher. Nomura said the company will likely be
able to exceed its shipment target with a new tablet computer
model, according to a report yesterday.  Other technology stocks rose after  Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of
the world’s largest Internet-search engine, reported sales and
profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  MediaTek Inc., Taiwan’s largest chip designer, climbed 1.9
percent to NT$263. Lenovo Group Ltd., China’s biggest maker of
personal computers, advanced 1 percent to HK$4.86 in Hong Kong.  Japanese electronics retailers advanced after the Nikkei
newspaper reported that Japan may revive a program designed to
promote sales of energy-efficient appliances to help cut power
usage.  Yamada Denki Co. surged 2.4 percent to 6,880 yen. Bic
Camera Inc. gained 3.1 percent to 49,250 yen.  Also in Tokyo, Hitachi Ltd., a maker of products from
electronics to nuclear reactors, rose 1.9 percent to 484 yen
after the company won preferential negotiating rights to join a
Lithuanian nuclear plant project.  Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp. (4188) , a chemicals maker,
gained 1.9 percent to 602 yen after the Nikkei said the company
may report higher profit than previously forecast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
