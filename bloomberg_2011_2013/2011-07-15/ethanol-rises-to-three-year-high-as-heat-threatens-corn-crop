Ethanol futures climbed to the
highest price in more than three years in  Chicago  as a heat wave
blanketing the Midwest threatens the corn crop.  The grain-based additive gained as temperatures reaching
100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) move across the corn-rich
U.S. Midwest. Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S., with
one bushel making at least 2.75 gallons.  “It certainly is related to the grain market,” said  Rich Nelson , director of research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
 Illinois . “Though corn didn’t close at its highs, people are
expecting higher prices due to the heat right now. The way
ethanol is priced, which is off of corn, the two are directly
tied together.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery gained 3.6 cents, or
1.3 percent, to settle at $2.873 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since June 27, 2008. Futures have
gained 78 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  advanced 2.5
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.065 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive increased 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.935,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast jumped 1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $3.075 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the fuel added 0.5 cents
to $2.855.  Corn for December delivery rose 6.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
$6.85 a bushel in Chicago.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
20 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
Illinois is pocketing 26 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
