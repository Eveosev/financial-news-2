Brent oil will average $109 a barrel
this year, down from the year-to-date average of $111.63, as
high summer prices give way to a weak autumn, according to
Citigroup Global Markets Inc.  Brent, traded on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, will average $110 a barrel in the third quarter, down
from $116.99 in the second, and $105 in the fourth quarter, said
 Edward Morse , head of commodities research, and Aakash Doshi, a
commodity strategist, both at Citi Global Markets in  New York .  “It is our judgment that seasonal factors will likely
bring higher crude  oil prices  through mid-summer, perhaps
topping the April peaks,” they said in a report to clients
dated yesterday.  “Seasonal factors” should make autumn “weak,” followed
by a “normal” winter, they said.  “Add to this slowing Chinese and U.S. demand growth and
it’s harder to sustain the bull argument,” they said.  Brent oil for September settlement increased 96 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $117.26 a barrel on the ICE exchange.  The analysts also forecast that U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate oil would average $92 a barrel in 2011, compared
with $98.36 so far this year. They estimated July 6 that Brent
oil’s premium to WTI may widen to $40 a barrel or more between
now and the middle of 2012.  WTI for August delivery rose $1.55, or 1.6 percent, to
settle at $97.24 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
September WTI futures were $19.66 a barrel cheaper than Brent.  The New York-traded oil will probably average $90 in the
third quarter and $82 in the fourth, the Citigroup analysts
said. Prices were at $101.56 on average in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
