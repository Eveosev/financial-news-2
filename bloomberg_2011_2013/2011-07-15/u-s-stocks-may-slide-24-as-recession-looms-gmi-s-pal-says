The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
fall as much as 24 percent and the euro might tumble to $1.20 if
the  U.S. economy  slows further and Europe’s debt crisis widens,
said Raoul Pal, the former GLG Partners Inc. fund manager
currently writing the Global Macro Investor strategy sheet.  “I think with the European situation seemingly
unresolvable, it’s likely we will see accelerated downside in
the latter part of the summer,” Pal, who also worked in hedge-
fund sales for  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and predicted the
financial meltdown of 2008, said in a phone interview from
Javea, Spain. “It does all depend on the U.S. economic data,
but the highest possibility for me is we are going into a
recession.”  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which tracks the
extent to which U.S. reports beat or miss forecasts, closed at
the lowest since January 2009 on June 3 as employment and
manufacturing data disappointed. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index is
on course for the biggest weekly drop since March amid concern
that Italy is being engulfed in Europe’s debt crisis.  Writing in the July edition of GMI, published July 1 and
updated this week, Pal said the current situation resembles the
conditions in early 2008, when the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s U.S. manufacturing gauge was at 51.1, before it
collapsed to 33.3 by the end of that year. The S&P 500 tumbled
54 percent from the start of 2008 to March 2009. The index slid
0.7 percent to 1,308.87 yesterday.  Factory Orders  The ISM factory index rose to 55.3 in June, the first gain
in four months, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said July 1. The
report eased concern the U.S. economy is stalling after the
gauge slumped to 53.5 in May from 60.4 the prior month. Readings
greater than 50 signal expansion.  The  S&P 500  may reach 1,000 by the end of 2011, Pal said,
though the index has a support level about 1,250, which
technical analysts who follow charts say can act as a floor
limiting losses. If economic reports improve, equities may
rebound as they did last summer, he said.  Pal, who retired from managing money for clients in 2004 at
the age of 36 according to the GMI website, said he’s been
bearish on equities and bullish on bonds for the past 11 years
as a “secular backdrop,” yet has during the period recommended
buying equities at times to benefit from market upswings and the
business cycle.  Treasuries Doubled  The S&P 500 has fallen 9 percent since the start of 2000,
while Treasuries have almost doubled in the period, according to
Merrill Lynch indexes.  Pal in December 2007 predicted the key U.S. interest rate
would fall to near zero and that action from the  Federal Reserve 
wouldn’t stop equities from declining. In June 2008 he said the
economic recession would be “deeper and longer than people are
forecasting” would send the S&P 500 as low as 800. The index
fell from 1,385.67 on the day of the report to a 12-year low of
676.53 in March 2009.  In May last year he predicted that stocks would slump in a
repetition of the 1929-1933 market crash, saying “I am actually
now so nervous I can’t sleep at night.” The S&P 500 climbed 23
percent in the 12 months from May 21 as the Fed bought bonds and
companies beat earnings estimates.  Euro Slide  The euro may fall to $1.20 from $1.41 yesterday as the
region’s debt crisis worsens, Pal wrote this week, citing
technical analysis charts. The move will be followed by a
bounce, and the currency will then “finally roll over and head
well below parity,” he wrote. He said he’s bullish on the
dollar and Treasuries.  Austerity measures in Europe that aim to bring down bond
yields from multiyear highs will hinder the task of lowering
budget deficits, while bailing out  Greece  only perpetuates that
country’s problems, he wrote.  “Deficit reduction in a slowing economy is next to
impossible,” Pal wrote. “This is a real vicious circle.
Delaying an eventual default is actually making things in Greece
much, much worse.”  Problems facing the banking system and real-estate market
in Europe are particularly noticeable on Spain’s Mediterranean
coast, where he lives, the strategist said.  “The  property market  is still awful,” Pal said.
“Properties are being sold at a 40 to 50 percent discount.
Apartments don’t sell at all, at any price.”  “Spain is  Lehman Brothers , whilst Greece is Bear
Stearns,” Pal wrote in the report. The bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008 was the biggest in U.S.
history. The collapse came four months after Bear Stearns Cos.
was rescued by a merger and preceded a 43 percent decline in the
S&P 500. “Once  Spain  goes I think we will be heading into the
vortex of multiple sovereign defaults,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
