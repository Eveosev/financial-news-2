Colombia ’s peso fell, snapping a
three-day advance, as European stocks retreated on concern the
sovereign-debt crisis will spread to Italy and  Spain  and as
rating companies may cut the U.S.’s top credit rating.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 1,758.06 per  U.S. dollar  at 2
p.m. New York time, from 1,748.50 yesterday. The peso earlier
gained to 1,742.50 per U.S. dollar, the strongest since July
2008.  “The peso had a correction as stocks abroad lost earlier
gains,” said Daniel Lozano, analyst at Serfinco SA. “Today’s
drop came after the peso’s advances in the last three sessions
came with quite a bit of velocity.”  U.S. stocks headed toward a weekly loss for the  Standard &
Poor’s  500 Index, and European stocks posted the biggest weekly
drop since March.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  warned there’s
no possible extension to the time limit to raise the debt
ceiling as Standard & Poor’s joined Moody’s Investors Service in
reviewing the U.S.’s credit rating this week. S&P said it will
lower the long-term rating by one or more notches into the AA
category in the next three months if it concludes that Congress
and President Barack Obama’s administration haven’t found a
credible solution to the government’s rising debt burden and
aren’t likely to do so in the foreseeable future.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 was
little changed at 7.77 percent, according to the stock exchange.
The bond’s price fell 0.032 centavo to 117.905 centavos per
peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
