Vietnam ’s bonds rose for a third
week on speculation deposit rates at banks are luring funds,
giving lenders more cash to invest in debt. The dong gained.  Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for  Foreign Trade  of Vietnam,
or Vietcombank, the country’s biggest listed bank, and Vietnam
Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for Industry & Trade, known as
VietinBank, are offering depositors as much as 14 percent,
according to their websites.  “Demand for bonds rose since liquidity has improved at
banks due to high deposit rates,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a
fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based Ocean Commercial Joint-Stock
Bank. “We’ve also seen demand for bonds increase from overseas
investors.”  The yield on five-year notes dropped two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 12.43 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It was down one basis
point from a week ago.  The dong strengthened 0.1 percent to 20,570 per dollar as
of 3:30 p.m. in Hanoi, and was little changed from 20,575 on
July 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central
bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,608, unchanged this week,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of the rate.  The overnight interbank deposit rate fell three basis
