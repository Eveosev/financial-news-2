Tanzaniaâ€™s inflation accelerated to
10.9 percent in June, the fastest pace in 14 months, on higher
energy and food costs, the National Bureau of Statistics said.  The inflation rate rose from 9.7 percent the month before,
the bureau said in a statement handed to reporters in the
commercial capital,  Dar es Salaam , today. Energy prices jumped
29 percent over the 12 months.  Food prices increased 11.7 percent in June from the same
month last year, compared with an annual increase of 10.1
percent in May, according to the statement. Rising food costs
have helped push inflation above 10 percent in neighboring
Uganda and  Kenya  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
