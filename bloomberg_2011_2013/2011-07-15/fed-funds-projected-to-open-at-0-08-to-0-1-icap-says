percent to 0.1 percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of
zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.04 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.03 percent to 0.1 percent and averaging 0.06 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.072 percent.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from July
2015 to December 2016. The purchases are part of the Fed’s
policy to continue to reinvest the proceeds of maturing assets
on its balance sheet to prevent a tightening of monetary policy.  The central bank plans to buy $2.5 billion to $3 billion
securities today, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
