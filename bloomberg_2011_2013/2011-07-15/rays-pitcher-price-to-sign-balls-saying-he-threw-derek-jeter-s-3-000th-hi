David Price  will sign hundreds of
baseballs with an unusual historic note -- that he threw the
home-run pitch that gave  Derek Jeter  3,000 career hits.  Price, a 25-year-old left-hander for the  Tampa Bay Rays ,
agreed to sign balls and photographs that say, “I Gave Up DJ’s
3K, 7-9-11,” said Brandon Steiner, president of Steiner Sports
Marketing.  “It’s all in good fun,” Steiner said in a telephone
interview. “It’s a cool collectible that’s being done tongue-
in-cheek.”  Price;, Jeter, the  New York Yankees ’ shortstop and captain;
and Christian Lopez, the fan who caught the home-run ball at
Yankee Stadium on July 9, also agreed to sign a limited number
of baseballs that will be offered today by Steiner. The
signatures also will be available individually in a three-ball
set.  Price’s ball goes for $159.99. Add Jeter’s autograph and
the figure surges to $799.99. The three-signature ball will cost
slightly more, Steiner said. Lopez’s ball that says, “I Caught
DJ3K,” sells for $34.99.  “The balls are a little on the pricey side,” Steiner
said. “But then Jeter is a little pricey these days.”  Not since Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. broke
 Lou Gehrig ’s streak by playing in his 2,131st consecutive games
on Sept. 6, 1995, has the sports-collectible field experienced
so much “insanity” caused by an individual feat, Steiner said.  After Jeter became the first Yankee and the 28th Major
League Baseball player to reach 3,000 hits, Steiner said, the
company got 6,000 calls for memorabilia commemorating the feat.  “This was kind of an exclamation point with Jeter,”
Steiner said. “This brought non-Yankee fans into perspective.
They wanted a piece of Jeter to put in their kids’ rooms to
represent how baseball should be played. You don’t have to like
him, but you have to respect him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
