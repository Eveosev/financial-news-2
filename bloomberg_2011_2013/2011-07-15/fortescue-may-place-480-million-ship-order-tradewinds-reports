Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , an
Australian iron-ore producer, is discussing a ship order worth
as much as $480 million with yards in  China  and South Korea,
 TradeWinds  reported.  Fortescue executives visited yards including those owned by
state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corp., the shipping-
industry newspaper said today, citing unidentified
“shipbuilding players.”  Contracts would be to build between four and six ships,
each with a capacity of 250,000 deadweight tons, larger than the
standard size of 180,000 tons for capesize vessels, according to
TradeWinds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
