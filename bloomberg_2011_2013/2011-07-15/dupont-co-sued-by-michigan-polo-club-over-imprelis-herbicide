DuPont Co., the largest U.S.
chemical company by market value, was sued by members of a
 Michigan  polo and golf club alleging the company’s  Imprelis 
herbicide is causing unintended damage to trees.  DuPont touted Imprelis as “the most advanced turf
herbicide in over 40 years” since it was registered last year,
according to a purported class-action complaint filed yesterday
in federal court in  Delaware .  “Reports of sudden and disastrous side effects quickly
followed,” said lawyers for the  Polo Fields  Golf & Country Club
LLC of Southfield, Michigan.  “We are working with our customers to investigate reports
of unfavorable symptoms observed on certain tree species,
primarily Norway spruce and white pine,” said Kate Childress, a
spokeswoman for DuPont, in an e-mailed statement today. The
Wilmington, Delaware-based company is confident the lawsuit “is
unfounded, and we will oppose it vigorously,” she said.  The company’s website urges caution in using Imprelis near
certain trees.  The lawsuit seeks a  jury trial , and unspecified triple
damages on behalf of those whose properties were harmed by the
chemical.  The case is Washtenaw Acquisition v. DuPont, 11CV624, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
