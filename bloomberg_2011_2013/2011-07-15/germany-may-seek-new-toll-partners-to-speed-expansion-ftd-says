Germany may seek new partners to
expand its freeway truck toll amid a row over technical delays
with the current operator Toll Collect GmbH, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing unnamed government officials.  The government sought to expand the toll this year to four-
lane carriageways to boost revenue, yet Toll Collect -- a group
that includes  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  -- has cited
technical problems in delaying the launch, the FTD said.  Revenue from Toll Collect, a satellite system in operation
since 2005, is partly used to maintain highways.  To contact the reporter on this story:
