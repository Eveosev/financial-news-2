Independencia SA, the Brazilian
meatpacker operating under bankruptcy protection, has received
five bids as part of an auction to sell assets and use the
proceeds to pay off debt, Valor Economico reported, citing

1.9 billion reais ($1.2 billion), will evaluate the bids at a
meeting on July 22 in  Sao Paulo , the newspaper said. The assets
are being auctioned for at least 706.9 million reais, Sao Paulo-
