(Corrects U.S. dollar conversion in first paragraph.)  China â€™s central bank this week
drained 86 billion yuan ($13 billion) of cash from the banking
system for the first time in nine weeks, reducing the chance the
monetary authority will raise the reserve requirement ratio for
banks this month, China Business News reported today, citing
unidentified analysts.  The central bank sold a combined 211 billion yuan of bills
this week, compared with the 125 billion yuan of bills that
matured this week, according to the Shanghai-based newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
