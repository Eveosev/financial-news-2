Heating oil and gasoline gained on
speculation that the economic recovery will accelerate and
demand will improve if an agreement is reached to raise the U.S.
debt ceiling.  Heating oil futures rose as much as 1 percent as President
 Barack Obama  pressed congressional leaders to give him options
for a deficit-cutting deal that lawmakers could support as part
of raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit by an Aug. 2
deadline.  “Once we get past this debt-ceiling crisis, demand as we
go into the fourth quarter, will provide some support for the
oil markets and gasoline in particular,”  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Heating oil for August delivery gained 2 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.1049 a gallon at 10:46 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures slipped as much as 0.9 percent
earlier in electronic trading.  The U.S. House of Representatives plans a vote next week on
a measure that would raise the government’s debt limit by $2.4
trillion, cut spending, cap government expenditures and propose
a balanced-budget constitutional amendment, Republican lawmakers
Sean Duffy and Billy Long said.  Gasoline for August delivery rose 1.21 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.1369 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump rose 1.2 cents to $3.667 a
gallon yesterday, the tenth consecutive increase, according to
AAA data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
