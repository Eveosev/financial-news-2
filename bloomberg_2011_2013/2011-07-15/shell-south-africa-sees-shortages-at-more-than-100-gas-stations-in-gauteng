Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s South
African unit said there are shortages of certain grades of fuel
at more than 100 gas stations in Gauteng province and at more
than 20 in the Durban area, in Kwazulu-Natal province, after an
industry strike for better pay started July 11.  “High fuel sales continue unabated across the country
making it difficult to maintain adequate stock levels at retail
sites,” Shell said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
