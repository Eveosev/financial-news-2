Nigeria’s  First City Monument Bank
Plc (FCMB)  and  FinBank Plc (FIRSTINL)  signed an agreement to merge today.  The accord will enable Lagos-based First City to inject new
capital into FinBank, a lender also based in the Nigerian
commercial capital that was bailed out by the central bank two
years ago, Kenny Aliyu, a spokesman for First City, said in a
telephone interview today.  FinBank’s chief executive officer was one of eight bank
heads fired by the African nation’s central bank in 2009 after
they gave loans to stock speculators, almost bringing the
industry to collapse amid the global debt crisis.
The regulator provided a 620 billion naira- ($4 billion) bailout
for the affected lenders and recently set a deadline of Sept. 30
for them to recapitalize or risk having their assets sold.  FinBank “welcomes this strategic investment which will
strengthen the financial position of our institution,” Suzanne Iroche, Group Managing Director of FinBank, said in a statement
on behalf of both lenders e-mailed today.  The two banks will execute a so-called Scheme of Merger in
accordance with Nigerian law, the statement said.  The merger will help First City achieve its “strategic and
financial goals” and create a “a robust retail platform,” said
Ladi Balogun, Group Managing Director of First City, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
