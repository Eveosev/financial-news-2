The western-led coalition is
considering a possible deal with Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
that would remove him from power but allow Qaddafi to remain in
internal exile in the country, the Financial Times reported,
citing unnamed British and French officials.  “In a complicated situation like this, a tactical and
face-saving formula is something that you might have to look
for,” a British official said, according to the newspaper.
