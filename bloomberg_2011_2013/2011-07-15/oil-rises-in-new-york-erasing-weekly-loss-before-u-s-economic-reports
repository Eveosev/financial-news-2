Oil gained in  New York , trimming
this week’s decline, before data forecast to show improving
confidence and manufacturing growth in the U.S., the world’s
largest consumer of crude. Futures reversed earlier losses as
Citigroup Inc.’s earnings surpassed analyst estimates.  Oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was up 51 cents at $96.20 a barrel, unchanged from the end of
last week, at 1:10 p.m. London time, after declining earlier as
much as 48 cents to $95.21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
