EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) ,  Greece ’s
second-biggest bank, and  Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE)  SA failed
European Union stress tests after regulators found the lenders
had insufficient capital.  Eurobank’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of
financial strength, was 4.9 percent in the test’s adverse
scenario, missing the 5 percent minimum required by the  European
Banking Authority , the Athens-based bank said in a statement
today. Eurobank needs 58 million euros ($82 million) to meet the
capital target, according to the statement.  Agricultural, known as ATEbank, failed the tests for a
second year running, and said it needs 713 million euros to meet
the 5 percent Core Tier 1 capital benchmark. The bank’s 7.85
billion euros of Greek sovereign bonds and loans helped explain
its failure to meet targets, it said.  They were among eight banks that failed stress tests with a
combined capital shortfall of 2.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion),
including one in  Austria  and five in  Spain , far less than
predicted by analysts and investors.  The EBA’s attempt to bolster confidence in the industry has
been criticized by analysts for excluding a possible Greek
default. This year’s tests included a 25 percent writedown on
Greek government bonds.  ATEbank said provisions of 750 million euros and a planned
convertible bond for 235 million euros would help make up the
shortfall. Eurobank said yesterday that it may sell a
controlling stake in its Turkish unit, Eurobank Tekfen, to boost
liquidity and capital.  ‘Mitigating Factors’  “What matters are where we are today after the mitigating
factors,” Eurobank Deputy Chief Executive Officer Michalis Colakides said in a phone interview. He said that his bank,
rather than opting for a capital increase, merged with an
investment fund, sold a Polish unit and announced plans to sell
a stake in its Turkish business.  Profitability at Greece’s banks is under pressure amid a
shrinking economy, downgrades by credit ratings companies and
concern over their holding of Greek  government bonds , leaving
them largely reliant on emergency support from the  European
Central Bank .  Fitch Ratings yesterday cut Eurobank and four other Greek
banks ratings to “B-” on “deteriorating creditworthiness”
and concerns that capital, funding and liquidity and asset
quality will continue to decline due to “serious concerns”
about the economy. The ratings company a day earlier lowered
Greece’s sovereign level to “CCC” from “B+”.  Greece’s banks took protective measures in a difficult
economic environment and the stress test results are
“encouraging,” Bank of Greece Governor  George Provopoulos 
said. “The big challenges Greece’s economy faces today demand
not that they simply continue their efforts but that they step
them up,” he said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
