Major League Baseball  accused the
bankrupt Los Angeles Dodgers of treating two fired employees
unfairly by not immediately seeking court approval to give them
severance payments.  The Dodgers, who have asked the court’s permission to pay
severance to some employees immediately, put off seeking the
authority to pay two “highly compensated” non-player workers,
attorneys for MLB Commissioner  Bud Selig  said in a court filing
today.  “This discriminatory practice should not be allowed,”
according to the filing, which didn’t name the employees or say
why the Dodgers haven’t sought quick payment for them.  The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy on June 27 after Selig
rejected a proposed television-rights deal Frank McCourt, the
team’s owner, negotiated with  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Sports.  “MLB’s objection is based solely on the fact that the
Dodgers are not paying severance to a former employee who is now
a well paid officer at MLB,” Sidney Levinson, a bankruptcy
attorney for the team, said in an e-mailed statement. “We will
address the issue with the  bankruptcy court  next week.”  The bankruptcy case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-
12010, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
