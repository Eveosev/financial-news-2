Financing in  China  decreased by
384.7 billion yuan ($60 billion) from a year earlier to 7.76
trillion yuan in the first half, according to a new central bank
measure that looks at lending, bonds and stock sales.  Yuan lending accounted for 53.7 percent of total society-
wide financing, down 3.2 percentage points from a year earlier,
the People’s Bank of China said in a statement today.  Chinese policy makers are trying to get a clearer picture
of the extent of credit creation in the economy that’s fueled
inflation and property speculation. It will take time for the
central bank to decide whether the gauge can be used as a
monetary policy target, Sheng Songcheng, the head of the bank’s
statistics department, said in April.  Corporate bonds accounted for 8.5 percent of the total, up
half a percentage point from a year earlier, while foreign-
currency loans made up 4.3 percent, an increase of 2 percentage
points, the statement showed. It was the second time that the
central bank released the figures.  In the first quarter, social financing totaled 4.19
trillion yuan, the central bank said in April. The bank didn’t
provide figures for the second quarter.  Society-wide financing includes bank loans, corporate bond
and stock sales, and off balance sheet lending, according to the
central bank.  --Zheng Lifei. Editors: Ken McCallum, Paul Panckhurst  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story: Zheng Lifei in
