The Bovespa index recorded its fifth
weekly decline in six as global economic growth concerns
overshadowed a report that showed Brazilian inflation fell more
than forecast this month.  The index dropped 0.3 percent to 59,478.01 at 4:30 p.m. New
York time after earlier rising as much as 0.7 percent. The
equity gauge fell 3.3 percent this week. The real strengthened
0.3 percent to 1.5745 per  U.S. dollar .  Gerdau SA (GGBR4) , Latin America’s largest steelmaker, led
decliners, dropping to its lowest price in more than two years.
Lojas Renner SA, Brazil’s biggest publicly traded clothing
retailer, dropped 2.3 percent, leading a retreat by companies
that depend on domestic demand.  BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , the
world’s largest poultry exporter, fell as its shares were cut to
“market perform” from “outperform” at Itau BBA Securities.  “This report isn’t conclusive, it’s not really an
indication that inflation is weakening,” Marcello Paixao,  money
manager  at Sao Paulo-based quant fund Principia Capital
Management, said in a telephone interview. “European countries
still need to prop up the funds to buy sovereign-bonds, and to
propose something to tackle the solvency problem. All of this is
weighing on the markets.”  The IGP-10 inflation index from the Getulio Vargas
Foundation in  Rio de Janeiro  showed a decline of 0.12 percent in
July, compared to a median estimate of a 0.09 percent drop in a
Bloomberg survey of 30 economists.  Stress Tests  The European Banking Authority said eight banks had a
combined capital shortfall of 2.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion),
far less than predicted by analysts and investors. The list
included two Greek and five Spanish banks. A further 16 banks,
including seven in Spain, barely passed the tests. All banks
examined in Italy,  Germany ,  France , the U.K. and Ireland passed.  U.S. stocks rose, trimming the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s weekly loss, as gains in energy and technology shares
were enough to overcome concern that an impasse over raising the
federal debt limit may put the nation’s top credit rating in
jeopardy. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment decreased to 63.8, the weakest
reading since March 2009, from 71.5 the prior month. The gauge
was projected to rise to 72.2, according to the median forecast
of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Copper futures for September delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$4.4140 a pound on the Comex in  New York . Crude for August
delivery advanced 1.6 percent to $97.24 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Gerdau slumped 3.2 percent to 14.62 reais, its lowest price
since April 8, 2009, and Lojas Renner fell 2.3 percent to 56.50
reais. Brasil Foods, which jumped to its highest in two months
yesterday after getting approval for its $3.8 billion Sadia SA
acquisition, retreated 0.7 percent to 29.50 reais.  OGX  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, the  oil company 
controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , fell 1.2 percent to
13.90 reais.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge has lost 19 percent since a
November high on concern that rising inflation may hurt domestic
demand as a slowdown in global economic growth could weaken
commodities.  The Bovespa trades at 9.6 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, the lowest since March 2009, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 12.9 for the
Shanghai Composite Index, 6.7 for  Russia ’s Micex and 15 times
for  India ’s Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index.  Traders moved 5.68 billion reais ($3.61 billion) in stocks
today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares to a daily
average this year of 6.42 billion reais through July 6,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
