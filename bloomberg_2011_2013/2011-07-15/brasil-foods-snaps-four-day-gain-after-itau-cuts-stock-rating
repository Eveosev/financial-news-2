BRF  Brasil Foods  SA, the world’s
biggest poultry exporter, dropped for the first day in five
sessions after Itau Corretora de Valores SA cut the stock to
“market perform” from “outperform.”  Shares fell 0.7 percent to 29.50 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time after earlier tumbling
as much as 3.3 percent. The Bovespa index slid 0.3 percent to
59,478.01.  Brasil Foods won conditional approval for its $3.8 billion
takeover of Sadia SA in a 4-1 vote by  Brazil ’s antitrust
regulator, known as Cade, on July 13. Shares jumped 10 percent
that day, the biggest gain in two years.  “With a clearer picture” of the company’s outlook
following the Cade ruling, “our valuation exercise shows little
upside” for the shares, Itau’s analysts including Juliana
Rozenbaum wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
