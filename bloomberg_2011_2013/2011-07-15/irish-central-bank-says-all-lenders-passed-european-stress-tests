Ireland’s central bank said all of
the country’s lenders passed the European stress tests.  The banks don’t need additional capital, the Dublin-based
central bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Ireland, which had a top Aaa rating just over two years
ago, lost its investment grade this week on concern the country
may need additional external funding. The Irish government in
November accepted a bailout plan including funds for its banks
and has said it plans to inject further capital into lenders.  Bank of Ireland Plc,  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , Anglo Irish
Bank Corp., EBS Building Society and  Irish Life & Permanent
Group Holdings Plc (IPM)  all issued public debt under a state-backed
guarantee program. The government approved  Allied Irish ’s
takeover of EBS Building Society, both under state control, on
June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
