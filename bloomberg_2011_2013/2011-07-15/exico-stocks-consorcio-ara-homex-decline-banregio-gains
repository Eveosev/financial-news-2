The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index was little changed at 36,155.86. The gauge
slipped 0.9 percent this week.  Mexican homebuilders fell after a measure of U.S. consumer
confidence was below economists’ forecasts. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment decreased to 63.8, the weakest reading since March
2009, from 71.5 the prior month. The gauge was projected to rise
to 72.2, according to the median forecast of 62 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX* MM), Mexico’s largest
homebuilder, shed 2.7 percent to 43.73 pesos. Consorcio Ara SAB
(ARA* MM), Mexico’s fourth-largest homebuilder, slipped 0.9
percent to 5.72 pesos.  Banregio Grupo Financiero SAB (GFREGIO MM), the 12th-
biggest Mexican bank by loans, gained 0.2 percent to 32.07 pesos
in its first day of trading after raising 1.8 billion pesos
($154 million) in an initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
