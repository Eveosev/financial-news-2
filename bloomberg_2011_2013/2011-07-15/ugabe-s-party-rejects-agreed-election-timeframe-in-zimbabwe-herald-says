President  Robert Mugabe ’sZimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front rejected a negotiated
timeframe for holding elections in the southern African nation,
the  Herald  reported, citing party spokesman Rugare Gumbo.  Zanu-PF’s chief decision-making body yesterday decided
“unanimously” that elections should be held this year, rather
than in 2012, the Harare-based newspaper said.  Mugabe’s party shares power with the Movement for
Democratic Change, led by Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , and
a splinter movement of the MDC led by Welshman Ncube. Both
parties insist elections must be held next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
