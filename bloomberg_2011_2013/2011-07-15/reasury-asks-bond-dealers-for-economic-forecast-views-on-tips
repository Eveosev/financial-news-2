The U.S. Treasury Department asked
bond dealers for their latest economic and fiscal forecasts for
2012 and 2013, and for recommendations on Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities.  The survey, released in a statement today, is for a July 29
meeting between Treasury officials and Wall Street bond dealers
in advance of next month’s quarterly auctions of notes and
bonds.  “Do you believe the current financing schedule is well-
suited to meet Treasury’s financing needs through the end of
FY2012?” the department asked in the survey. The Treasury also
asked dealers if it should consider any particular new products.  To contact the reporters on this story:
