Hong Kong stocks swung between
losses and gains as some companies rose on higher profits
forecasts while Chinese developers fell after the government
said it’s seeking to limit residential prices in smaller cities.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , controlled by the
nation’s construction ministry, sank 4.7 percent. Jiangxi Copper
Co.,  China ’s biggest producer of the metal by market value, slid
0.7 percent as metal prices fell after U.S.  Federal Reserve 
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he has no immediate plans to
further stimulate the economy. Changsha Zoomlion Heavy Industry
Science and Technology Development Co., a construction machinery
maker, rose 0.5 percent on higher profit expectation.  Imposing China’s property curbs “across the country will
affect the revenue for a lot of developers, and hurt their share
prices,” said  Castor Pang , head of research at Core-Pacific
Yamaichi International Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Companies’ positive
profit surprises are helping to improve the  market sentiment ,
but it won’t create a strong rebound.”  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.3 percent to 21,883.89 at the
midday-trading break, after rising as much as 0.2 percent.
Almost twice as many stocks declined as gained in the 46-member

steepest since the period ended March 25. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ H shares fell 0.4
percent to 12,282.10.  A measure of property developers had the biggest decline
among the Hang Seng Index’s four industry groups. China Overseas
Land sank 4.7 percent to HK$16.10.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a
state-controlled developer, fell 2.8 percent to HK$14.70.  Home Purchase Limits  China will expand its efforts to curb the growth in
residential prices to smaller cities after limiting home
purchases in Beijing and Shanghai, according to a summary of a
State Council meeting chaired by Premier  Wen Jiabao .  The government said so-called second and third-tier cities
which have seen excessive price gains should restrict the number
of homes each family is allowed to buy, according to the State
Council or cabinet yesterday.  Jiangxi Copper slid 0.7 percent to HK$27.30, and United Co.
Rusal, a Russian aluminum producer, dropped 1.9 percent to
HK$9.71 after the London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 1.8 percent
yesterday.  The Federal Reserve’s Bernanke yesterday told Congress that
the central bank isn’t currently ready to embark on a third
round of government bond-buying to stimulate the economy.  Zoomlion  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has dropped 4.8 percent this year
through yesterday, on concern China’s tightening measures, and
 Europe  and  U.S. debt  will hamper global economic growth. Shares
in the gauge traded at 11.8 times forecast earnings at the last
close, compared with about 14.4 times at the end of last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that rose, Changsha Zoomlion increased 0.5
percent to HK$16 after saying first-half net income may have

acquire a 41 percent stake of the Chinese company for HK$4.55
billion ($584 million).  Airlines Rise  Airlines increased after the Shanghai Daily said Chinese
airlines’ first-half traffic increased 9.8 percent from a year
earlier to 139 million passengers, citing the Civil Aviation
Administration of China.  China Southern Airlines Co., Asia’s largest carrier by
passenger numbers, jumped 6.1 percent to HK$4.90, while China
