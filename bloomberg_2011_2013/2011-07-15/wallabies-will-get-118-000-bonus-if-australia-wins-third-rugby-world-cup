Australia ’s Rugby World Cup squad
will each receive a $110,000 ($118,000) bonus payment if the
Wallabies win the Oct. 23 final.  The Wallabies agreed to accept a decrease in match payments
during the tournament in  New Zealand  in order to maximise their
potential bonus for winning it, the Australian Rugby Union said.  The 30-man squad will be entitled to A$25,000 per player
should the Wallabies win a semifinal and reach the championship
game in Auckland. A further bonus of A$85,000 awaits if
Australia wins the final to become the first country to lift the
Webb Ellis Cup three times.    “Winning the Rugby World Cup would have enormous flow on
benefits for the game in this country, so it is only fair the
players have an opportunity to receive a tangible benefit,” ARU
Chief Executive Officer John O’Neill said in a statement.  The Wallabies, who won rugby’s four-yearly championship in
1991 and 1999, are scheduled to open their campaign Sept. 11
against Italy before facing Ireland, the U.S. and  Russia  in
their remaining group games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
