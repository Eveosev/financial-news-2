Spain ’s Castilla-La Mancha first-
half budget deficit was close to 6 percent of its gross domestic
product,  Expansion  reported, citing unidentified people in the
regional government.  The deficit amounts to almost 2 billion euros ($2.8
billion), Expansion said. The Spanish government set a maximum
deficit target of 1.3 percent GDP for the country’s regions for
this year, Expansion said.  Castilla-La Mancha also has about 1.7 billion euros of
pending bills, compared with the 700 million euros that were
disclosed by the previous regional administration, Expansion
said.  No one was available to comment at the regional president’s
office when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
