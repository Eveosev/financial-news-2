Ghana ’s cedi appreciated versus the
dollar after a supplementary budget presented yesterday by the
finance and economic planning minister,  Kwabena Duffuor ,
improved investor confidence.  The currency of the world’s second biggest cocoa producer
strengthened to 1.5150 per dollar as of 1:28 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, from 1.5170 at the close yesterday, according to
data compiled by the local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd.  Ghana’s supplementary budget raised the economic growth
target for 2011 to 14.4 percent from 12.3 percent. The
government also expects oil revenue to rise to 923 million cedis
($609 million) from an earlier estimate of 584 million cedis.  “Growth targets for the year, expected cocoa proceeds and
the upward adjustment in expected oil revenue have assured
investors the government can build foreign reserves, and overall
be able to pay back debt,” Kofi Pianim, a Standard Bank
currency trader, said in a telephone interview today. Overseas
investors have “shown positive sentiments” on the country’s
economy and “interest in three-year and five-year bonds,”
Pianim said.  The central bank will sell its first five-year bond since
June 2007 on July 28, it said on its website on June 30. The
 Bank of Ghana  will sell 300 million cedis of notes, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
