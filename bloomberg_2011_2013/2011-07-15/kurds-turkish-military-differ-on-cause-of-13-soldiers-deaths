A pro-Kurdish  news agency  said the
13 Turkish soldiers killed yesterday in the southeast of the
country died as a result of bombing by Turkish aircraft,
disputing the account provided by  Turkey ’s armed forces.  The soldiers and two members of the Kurdistan Workers’
Party, or PKK, died in a woodland blaze after jets bombed a site
in Diyarbakir province where fighting was taking place, the
Firat news agency reported, citing an unidentified member of a
state-run militia force who listened to Turkish military radio
communications during the clashes. Firat is close to the PKK and
access to its website is restricted from Turkey.  The General Staff in Ankara said that 13 soldiers died in a
fire caused by hand grenades thrown by the PKK, according to a
 statement on the military’s website . It said seven PKK members
also died in the fighting. The statement didn’t mention any
action by aircraft.  The PKK in February said it was abandoning a cease-fire it
declared in 2010, blaming Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
for failing to seize a chance for lasting peace. The group is
classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and
the European Union. More than 40,000 people have died since it
took up arms in 1984.  To contact the reporter on this story:
