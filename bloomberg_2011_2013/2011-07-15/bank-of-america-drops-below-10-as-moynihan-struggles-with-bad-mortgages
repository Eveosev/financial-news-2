     July 15 (Bloomberg) --  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, fell below $10 a share in New York
trading today as concern mounted about the company’s ability to
restore profit.  The lender’s shares dropped 9 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$9.98 as of 1:53 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.  Bank of America traded for less than $10 back in May 2009,
when it was emerging from the worst depths of the financial
crisis. Mounting costs from bad mortgages and faulty
foreclosures at the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based company led
to losses in six of the past 10 quarters. The company expects to
formally report quarterly results next week.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  has been
rebuilding capital and has vowed to reduce risk in Bank of
America’s holdings. He’s spent or earmarked at least $30 billion
to quell losses ties to the company’s home lending and
foreclosures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
