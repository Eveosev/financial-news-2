Cameroon could miss its cocoa
production target of 293,000 metric tons this year, Cameroon
Radio and Television reported, citing the Cocoa and Coffee
board, which regulates the industry.  The West African nation needs to have produced 70,800 tons
in June and July to meet that goal, with output having reached
222,200 tons by the end of May, the Yaounde-based broadcaster
said. Average monthly production during the growing season is
about 22,200 tons, CRTV said.  The broadcaster didn’t give a reason for the possible
shortfall in cocoa production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
