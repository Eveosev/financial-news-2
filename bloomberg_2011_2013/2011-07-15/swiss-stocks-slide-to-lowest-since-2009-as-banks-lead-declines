Swiss equities fell for a second day
as  consumer confidence  in the U.S. retreated more than
economists had forecast.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and Credit Suisse AG, Switzerland’s two biggest
lenders, fell 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.  SGS SA (SGSN) ,
the world’s largest goods inspection company, sank 6.9 percent
after second-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.
 Transocean Ltd (RIGN) , the world’s largest offshore oil driller, rose
3.7 percent as Jefferies Group Inc. recommended buying its
shares.  The benchmark  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  lost 0.7 percent to
5,938.06 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich, sliding to its lowest
since August 2009. The gauge fell 3.5 percent this week, its
second straight week of declines, as concern mounted that the
sovereign-debt crisis will spread to the bigger economies of
 Italy  and  Spain . The broader Swiss Performance Index retreated
0.8 percent today.  “Everybody’s waiting for the stress tests,” said Michael Borre, a chief equity adviser at Nordea Private Bank in
Copenhagen. “If we get a disappointing outcome it could hurt
stocks.”  The European Banking Authority will release the results of
stress tests for 91 banks from 5 p.m. London time today as part
of an effort to reassure investors that the region’s banks have
sufficient capital.  Swiss stocks consolidated their losses after a report
showed that confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in
July to the lowest level since March 2009. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment  decreased to 63.8 from 71.5 in June. The gauge was
projected to rise to 72.2, according to the median forecast  of
62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  UBS, Credit Suisse  UBS fell 2.1 percent to 13.70 Swiss francs and Credit
Suisse dropped 1.5 percent to 30.12 francs.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  plunged 20 percent to 18 francs, the
biggest drop since January 2009. The banking software provider
reduced its full-year outlook for license revenue, saying it
expects growth of 5 percent to 10 percent.  SGS declined 6.9 percent to 1,470 francs, having dropped
the most since December 2008 after reporting sales and profit
figures that missed analyst estimates.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the maker of Cartier watches
and Mont Blanc pens, fell 1.4 percent to 53.90 francs after
Deutsche Bank cut the stock to “hold” from “buy.”  Transocean increased 3.7 percent to 51.05 francs after
Jefferies raised its view on the company’s shares to “buy”
from “hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
