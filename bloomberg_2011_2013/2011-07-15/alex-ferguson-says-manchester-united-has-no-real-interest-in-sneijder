Manchester United  has no agreement
imminent to sign Inter Milan’s Wesley Sneijder, according to the
English soccer champion’s manager  Alex Ferguson .  Newspapers including the Daily Mail reported yesterday that
United was set to pay Inter 35 million pounds ($56.5 million)
for the Netherlands midfielder, who had accepted terms on a
contract worth 190,000 pounds a week.  “I’ve not really been involved in it since we’ve come to
America,” Ferguson said yesterday in a news conference in
Seattle broadcast on the club’s website. “There’s no real
interest at this moment in time in Wesley Sneijder for a lot of
reasons. There’s nothing I can tell you about it.”  Sneijder, 27, helped the Netherlands reach the 2010  World
Cup  final in  South Africa  and won the Italian league title,
Italian cup and Champions League with Inter last year.  Ferguson, who’s seeking a replacement for the retired Paul Scholes, added that no further signings were imminent and that
the club was “very comfortable” with the three acquisitions it
made this offseason.  United signed defender Phil Jones, goalkeeper David de Gea
and forward Ashley Young last month for a combined cost of about
50 million pounds, according to U.K. media reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
