Taiwan ’s government bonds fell,
pushing five-year yields to the highest in more than two years,
after the island sold debt at a higher-than-expected rate.
Taiwan’s dollar had its biggest weekly decline in a month.  Taiwan sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of five-year
securities at a yield of 1.18 percent at an auction today,
compared with 1.075 percent at the last auction of similar-
maturity debt in April, the central bank said. The yield
compared with the 1.155 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of six finance companies. The monetary authority
increased the  interest rates  on 30-, 91- and 182-day bills on
July 1 after it raised its benchmark rate the day before.  “The yield’s much higher than expected,” said Joy Tseng,
a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Polaris Securities Co.
“The central bank just raised rates on short-term bills this
month, so banks have more alternatives when it comes to  asset
allocation .”  The rate on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded government debt, gained 2.3 basis points to 1.182
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. That’s the
highest level for a benchmark five-year bond since January 2009.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The central bank raised borrowing costs for the fifth
straight quarter on June 30 to restrain a surge in  home prices .  The sale of the bonds due July 2016 attracted bids for 1.85
times the amount on offer, compared with 1.87 times at the
previous auction.  Foreigners Sell Stocks  Taiwan’s dollar had a second weekly decline as foreigners
pulled funds from the island’s stocks on concern the global
economic recovery is losing momentum.  Overseas investors sold $1.2 billion more Taiwanese shares
than they bought this week, bringing net sales this year to $213
million, according to exchange data. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said yesterday he’s not prepared to take immediate action to
stimulate the  U.S. economy .  “Investors are still concerned recoveries in the U.S. and
 Europe  are not going well,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income
trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Foreign funds have
sold a lot of stocks recently, dragging down the  Taiwan
dollar .”  The Taiwan dollar declined 0.4 percent this week to
NT$28.897 against its U.S. counterpart at the close, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.00 on July 13, the weakest
level since June 28. The currency fell 0.2 percent today.  The overnight rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, was little changed today and this week at 0.373
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
