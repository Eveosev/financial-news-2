China Railway Materials Commercial
Co. , a state-owned builder and steel trader, plans to raise as
much as $2 billion in an initial public offering in  Shanghai  and
Hong Kong in 2011, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The company picked Citic Securities Co. for the Shanghai
portion of the IPO, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified as the process is private. It plans to submit
documents to  China ’s securities regulator for a listing in
September, according to the person.  Liu Guoping, vice president of Beijing-based China Railway
Materials Commercial, said in May last year that the company may
seek to raise about 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in a dual
listing.  The company, a unit of China Railway Materials Commercial
Corp., will accept proposals from investment banks until next
week for managing the  Hong Kong  portion of the IPO, one of the
people said. The Shanghai sale will likely take place before the
Hong Kong offering, one person said.  Wen He, a director of China Railway Materials Commercial
Co.’s Enterprise Culture unit who handles media inquiries,
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
