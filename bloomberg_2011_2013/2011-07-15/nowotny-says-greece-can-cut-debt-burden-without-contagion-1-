European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said extending  Greece ’s debt
maturities is a possible way to increase the country’s ability
to deal with its debt while avoiding contagion to other
countries.  “I believe the question of extending debt maturities is a
relevant one,” Nowotny said in a live interview with Austrian
television broadcaster ORF. “I believe that ways can be found
that on the one hand improve the debt sustainability but don’t
imply the risk of negative side effects” for other countries.  “Everything that can reduce risks is positive, for
instance an extension of maturities or a reduction of  interest
rates ,” he said. “But that must happen in a way that doesn’t
result in a default” and “is accepted by rating agencies,” he
added.  “This is something where discussions are being led right
now and next week there could be decisions,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
