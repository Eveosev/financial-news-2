The U.S. may have its AAA long-term
and A-1+ short-term credit ratings cut by Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services, which said there is an increasing risk of a
substantial policy stalemate enduring beyond any near-term
agreement to raise the debt ceiling.  S&P put the ratings on Creditwatch negative, meaning
there’s a one-in-two chance they may be cut in the next 90 days.
The outlook on the AAA rating was revised to negative from
stable by S&P on April 18.  The long-term rating may be lowered by one or more notches
into the AA category in the next three months if S&P concludes
Congress and President Barack Obama’s administration haven’t
achieved a credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt
burden and aren’t likely to achieve one in the foreseeable
future, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
