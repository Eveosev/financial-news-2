Colombia ’s peso rose to a
three-year high as foreign direct investment may reach a record
high this month on flows into the oil and mining sectors.  The peso was little changed at 1,748.89 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:16 a.m. New York time, from 1,748.5 yesterday. The peso
earlier gained to 1,742.5 per U.S. dollar, the strongest since
July 2008. The peso has jumped 9.6 percent since March 1 through
yesterday, the best performance among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The preponderant factor is the jump in foreign direct
investment in the last few weeks,” said  Camilo Perez , analyst
at Banco de Bogota SA. “The investment is increasingly
concentrated in oil and mining.”  Perez said June may see the highest one-month investment
flows on record after reaching $1.3 billion in the first 24 days
of the month, with 86 percent going into oil and mining,
according to the central bank. January saw $1.37 billion in
investment, the largest one-month flow recorded by the bank.  “This is a result of new contracts and blocks granted in
recent auctions,” said Juan David Pineros, oil analyst at
Interbolsa SA. “It comes in stages. After preliminary studies,
companies start drilling and investing in infrastructure.”  Deposits in Colombia,  South America ’s third-largest crude
producer, have attracted billionaires  Carlos Slim  of Mexico and
 Eike Batista  of Brazil as the nation opens up unexplored swaths
of the country to tap new energy reserves.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.78 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.167
centavo to 117.770 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
