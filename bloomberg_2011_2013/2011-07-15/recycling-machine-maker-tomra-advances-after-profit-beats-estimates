Tomra Systems ASA (TOM) , a Norwegian maker
of recycling machines, rose the most in four months in Oslo
trading after reporting net income that beat estimates as sales
jumped.  The shares rose as much as 7.9 percent, the most since
March, and were up 5 percent at 47.9 kroner as of 9:47 a.m. in
Oslo.  Net income in the second quarter rose to 108.1 million
kroner ($19.4 million) from 64.4 million kroner a year earlier,
the Asker-based company said today in a statement. The company
was expected to make 105 million kroner in the period, according
to a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  The company said profit attributable to the shareholders of
the parent company after other comprehensive income was 77.6
million kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
