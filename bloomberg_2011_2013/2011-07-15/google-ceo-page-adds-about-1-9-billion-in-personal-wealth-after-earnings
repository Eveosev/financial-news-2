Google Inc. (GOOG)  Chief Executive Officer
 Larry Page  added about $1.9 billion in personal wealth today
after the company announced second-quarter results that beat
analysts’ estimates amid growth under his new leadership.  The value of Page’s stake in Google rose to approximately
$16.25 billion, based on his holdings reported in a regulatory
filing today. Co-founder  Sergey Brin  added about $1.8 billion in
personal wealth, based on his holdings reported in a filing
earlier this month.  Seeking to better compete against rivals such as Facebook
Inc. and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Page, who took over as CEO in April, is
pushing the Mountain View, California-based company into markets
such as mobile, social and e-commerce while maintaining the
company’s traditional leadership in search. Google benefitted
from surging demand for its online advertising services, pushing
up prices at a faster rate than in the previous quarter.  Second-quarter sales, excluding revenue passed on to
partner sites, rose to $6.92 billion, Google said on its website
yesterday. That topped $6.57 billion, the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items,
was $8.74 a share, exceeding the $7.85 average of analysts’
estimates.  Google rose $68.68, or 13 percent, to $597.62 at 4:20 p.m.
New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, its biggest percentage
gain since Oct. 2008. Google shares have risen less than 1
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
