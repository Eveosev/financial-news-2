Following is the text of the
June consumer prices from the Labor Department.  Consumer Price Index - June 2011  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) decreased
0.2 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, the  U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics  reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all
items index increased 3.6 percent before seasonal adjustment.  The gasoline index declined sharply in June, falling 6.8 percent.
While this decrease was the major factor in the seasonally adjusted
decline in the all items index, the index for household energy
declined as well. In contrast, the index for all items less food and
energy increased 0.3 percent for the second consecutive month. The
indexes for shelter, apparel, new vehicles, used cars and trucks, and
medical care all continued to rise in June.  The food index increased as well, although the 0.2 percent rise was
the smallest of the year. The index for food at home increased 0.2
percent, with major grocery store food groups mixed. The indexes for
fruits and vegetables and for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs both
declined, and while the other major grocery store food group indexes
all increased, none rose more than 0.6 percent.  The 12 month change in the all items index remained at 3.6 percent.
The change in the index for all items less food and energy edged up
to 1.6 percent, its highest level since January 2010. The food index
has increased 3.7 percent over the last 12 months while the energy
index rose 20.1 percent.  Food  The food index rose 0.2 percent in June after rising 0.4 percent in
each of the prior two months. The index for meats, poultry, fish, and
eggs turned down in June, falling 0.4 percent after increasing more
than one percent in each of the previous four months. The fruits and
vegetables index declined for the third month in a row in June,
falling 0.3 percent as the fresh vegetables index continued to
decline. In contrast, other major grocery store food groups
increased. The index for cereals and bakery products rose 0.6 percent
in June, and the dairy and related products advanced 0.5 percent, as
did the index for other food at home. The index for nonalcoholic
beverages increased 0.3 percent as the coffee index continued to
rise. The index for food at home has risen 4.7 percent over the last
12 months, with all the major groups increasing 3.2 percent or more.
The index for food away from home rose 0.3 percent in June after
rising 0.2 percent in May.  Energy  The energy index, which fell 1.0 percent in May, declined 4.4 percent
in June, the largest decline since December 2008. The gasoline index,
which fell 2.0 percent in May, declined 6.8 percent in June. (Before
seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices fell 5.8 percent in June.)
Despite the recent declines, the gasoline index has increased 35.6
percent over the past 12 months. The index for household energy also
decreased in June, falling 1.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent in
May. The index for natural gas rose 0.4 percent, but the electricity
index declined 1.6 percent and the index for  fuel oil  fell 2.2
percent. The household energy index has risen 2.8 percent over the
last 12 months, with the fuel oil index up 37.3 percent and the
electricity index up 1.5 percent but the index for natural gas down
0.8 percent.  All items less food and energy  The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in
June, the same increase as in May. The shelter index also repeated
its May increase of 0.2 percent, with the index for lodging away from
home again rising significantly. The rent index rose 0.1 percent and
the index for owners' equivalent rent increased 0.2 percent. The
apparel index continued to rise sharply, increasing 1.4 percent in
June after a 1.2 percent increase in May. Vehicle indexes also
continued to rise; the new vehicles index rose 0.6 percent in June,
while the index for used cars and trucks increased 1.6 percent. The
medical care index rose 0.2 percent, the same increase as in May,
with medical care services rising 0.3 percent but medical care
commodities declining 0.1 percent. The tobacco index rose 0.4 percent
in June after declining in April and May. In contrast, the index for
airline fares declined 3.0 percent in June, and the recreation index
turned down, declining 0.1 percent after rising in May.  The index for all items less food and energy increased 1.6 percent
over the last 12 months. This figure has been steadily rising and
most of the increase has come within the past six months. The shelter
index has risen 1.2 percent over the last 12 months, the medical care
index has risen 2.9 percent, and the index for new vehicles has
increased 4.0 percent.  Not seasonally adjusted CPI measures  The  Consumer Price Index  for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased
