US Coal Corp., the Lexington,
Kentucky-based surface mining company, is seeking a $105 million
term loan to refinance debt, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the six-year debt with
an interest rate of 6 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private.  US Coal is proposing to sell the loan at 98 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting yield to investors. The bank will host a lender meeting
July 18 at 1:30 p.m. in  New York .  Lenders are also offered call protection of 103 cents
during the first year, the person said. The premium to refinance
the debt would drop to 2 cents more than face value in the
second year and to 1 cent the following year  To contact the reporter on this story:
