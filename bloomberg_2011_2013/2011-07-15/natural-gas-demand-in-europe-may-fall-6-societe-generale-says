Natural gas demand in the 27 nations
of the European Union may decline 6 percent this year as warmer-
than-normal weather and high prices reduced demand for the
heating fuel,  Societe Generale  said.  Consumption in 2011 will drop to 499 billion cubic meters
from last year’s 531 billion, Societe Generale analysts
including Thierry Bros said today in a report and in an e-mailed
response to questions. The estimated decline is bigger than the
bank’s earlier forecast of 4 percent.  Demand in the first half of 2010 dropped 9.2 percent, the
analysts said.  “Temperature accounts for the bulk of the demand decline”
in the first half, the analysts said. Also affecting demand were
“price-induced demand restraint and energy efficiency,” they
said.  Natural gas futures traded on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange rose to 65.95 pence a therm ($10.60 per million
British thermal units) on March 16, the highest level since Jan.
15, 2009. Prices gained 0.05 pence, or 0.1 percent, to 54.61
pence a therm today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
