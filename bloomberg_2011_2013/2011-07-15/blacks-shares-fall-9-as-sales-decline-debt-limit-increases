Blacks Leisure Group Plc (BSLA) , a U.K.
outdoor clothing retailer, fell the most in a month after the
company said sales were falling and debt levels increasing.  Shares tumbled 10 percent, or 1.63 pence in  London  to 14.62
pence at 8:24 a.m., the biggest fall since March 15, giving the
company a market value of 12.3 million pounds ($20 million).  Group revenue in the 19 weeks ended July 9 fell more than
forecast to 54.6 million pounds from 61.3 million pounds a year
earlier, with same-store sales declining 9.7 percent, according
to a statement on Regulatory News Service.  Black’s debt has “increased significantly,” according to
the statement. The company has agreed to an increase in its debt
limit to 40 million pounds until Dec. 15, an increase of 2
million pounds above its usual maximum facility.  “It’s worrying that they’re that close to their banking
facilities,” said  Andrew Wade , an analyst with Numis
Securities. “Cash is clearly pretty tight, but Blacks need the
cash to improve the situation,” Wade added, citing store
refurbishments as a priority. He is reviewing his “add”
recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
