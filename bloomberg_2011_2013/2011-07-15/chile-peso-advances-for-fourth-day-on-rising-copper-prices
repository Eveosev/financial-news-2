Chile ’s peso fell, breaking a three-
day winning streak, after a measure of U.S. consumer confidence
was below economist forecasts, offsetting rising copper prices.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 462.52 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:59 p.m. New York time, from 462.11 yesterday. The currency
rose as much as 0.2 percent earlier today. It advanced 0.1
percent this week.  “The news did have an impact on the price of the peso, but
it was very acute,” Andrea Lombardi, a foreign exchange trader
at Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa, said in a phone interview
from Santiago. “There hasn’t been any change here that was very
significant.”  Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in July
to the lowest level in more than two years, adding to concern
that weak employment gains and falling home prices may keep
households from spending. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment decreased to
63.8, the weakest reading since March 2009, from 71.5 the prior
month. The gauge was projected to rise to 72.2, according to the
median forecast of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Copper futures for September delivery rose 3.3 cents, or
0.8 percent, to close at $4.413 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The price was little changed this week.  “Copper continues to reach prices above $4.35 per pound,
and expectations are for it to continue rising,” Raul Lopez,
head currency trader at Banco Penta, said in a phone interview
from Santiago. “This puts pressure on the peso to keep gaining
on the dollar, but it’s fundamentally driven by a mix of
commodity prices and the news from outside Chile.”  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.60 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
