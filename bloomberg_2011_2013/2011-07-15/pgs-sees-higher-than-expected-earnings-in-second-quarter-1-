Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (PGS) , a
Norwegian surveyor of oil and gas fields, said it expects to
report second-quarter results that are higher than current
market expectations, citing “strong” multiclient sales.  Based on preliminary numbers, second-quarter revenue,
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, as
well as earnings before interest and taxes are expected to be
“significantly higher than current market expectations,” the
company said today in a statement.  Total revenue is expected to exceed $310 million, while
Ebitda is expected to exceed $150 million and Ebit to be more
than $40 million, the company said.  A Bloomberg survey of analysts showed Ebitda was expected
to be $108 million in the period. The company will report
results on July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
