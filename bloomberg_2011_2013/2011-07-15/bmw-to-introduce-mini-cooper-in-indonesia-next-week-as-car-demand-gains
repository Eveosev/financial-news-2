Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s
Indonesian unit will introduce three Mini Cooper models starting
next week to meet growing demand for cars in  Southeast Asia ’s
largest economy.  “Indonesia’s economy is growing definitely, so we think it
is really the right time for the Mini brand to enter the
market,” President Director Ramesh Divyanathan said in a July
12 interview in Jakarta.  BMW, the world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles , plans to
debut the Mini Cooper S, Mini Cooper S Convertible and Mini John
Cooper Works at the  Indonesia International Motor Show  in
Jakarta, which runs from July 22 to July 31. The  PT BMW
Indonesia  unit is spending about 100 billion rupiah ($11.7
million) over the next two years to upgrade factories to produce
new models, increase output and introduce the Mini Cooper.  The Munich-based automaker’s Indonesian unit boosted
luxury-car market share about 8 percent to 28 percent for the
first four months of 2011, according to a May 31 statement.  Prices for the Mini Coopers being introduced range from 500
million rupiah to 700 million rupiah ($58,609 to $82,053), said
Joe Surya, a president director at PT Maxindo International
Nusantara Indah, a Mini distributor.  Given  Indonesia ’s population of 238 million people, the
country could become one of the largest regional markets for the
Mini Cooper, Divyanathan said in the interview, which took place
after an event held to announce the introduction of the three
models. Distributor PT Maxindo has so far received about 20 pre-
orders for the cars, Surya said.  Global Sales Surge  Global Mini Cooper sales surged about 30 percent to 141,913
units in the first half of 2011 from a year earlier, BMW said in
a statement on July 7. Last year, Mini sold 222 cars in
 Malaysia , 407 in  Thailand , 145 in the  Philippines  and 275 in
 Singapore , according to BMW Indonesia’s data. Maxindo is working
with BMW to determine the potential size of the market in
Indonesia, Surya said.  Indonesian auto sales rose 12 percent to 415,276 units in
the first six months of 2011 from a year earlier, Marketing
Director PT Toyota-Astra Motor Joko Trisanyoto said on July 4.  Gross domestic product may expand 6.3 percent to 6.8
percent this year, after growing 6.1 percent in 2010, Bank
Indonesia estimates. Consumer-price increases, which eased to a
12-month low of 5.54 percent in June, may reach 4 percent to 6
percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
