Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  and its unit
EBS Building Society won European Union approval to receive an
Irish government recapitalization of 13.1 billion euros ($18.6
billion).  The European Commission said it would make a final decision
on the aid when the Irish lenders submitted a new restructuring
plan, which was expected by the end of the month. The Irish
government seized control of EBS last year and ordered it to
merge with  Allied Irish .  “The commission acknowledges that the measures are
necessary to increase the bank’s solvency ratios and maintain
confidence in the Irish financial markets,” the regulator said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Allied Irish and Bank of Ireland, the country’s two biggest
lenders, will require “close surveillance” from EU antitrust
authorities because they will control the Irish market after a
banking crisis forced the government to bail out several
lenders, EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said last
month.  EU regulators said final approval of the government help
for Allied Irish and EBS required a restructuring plan that
ensured an “adequate participation in the restructuring costs
by shareholders and subordinated debt holders.”  Helen Leonard, a spokeswoman for Allied Irish in Dublin,
declined to comment. EBS declined to immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
