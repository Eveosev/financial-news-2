Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-
largest lender, would have a loss of 3.16 billion euros ($4.47
billion) in 2011 under the adverse scenario used by the European
Banking Authority to stress-test the region’s lenders.  The bank would report a loss of 639 million euros in the
baseline scenario, according to a  template  the Frankfurt-based
lender filled out for the European Banking Authority as part of
the stress test, and that was posted on its  website  today.  Neither the baseline scenario nor the adverse scenario and
results of the stress test should in any way be construed as a
bank’s forecast or directly compared to a bank’s other published
information, according to the template.  Commerzbank reiterated its forecast of an operating profit
of more than 4 billion euros in 2012, before regulatory effects
and under stable markets.  Commerzbank passed the  stress test  with a core Tier 1
capital ratio -- a measure of financial strength -- of 6.4
percent in the test’s adverse scenario, surpassing the 5 percent
minimum required by the EBA, the German company said.  The lender said on May 6 that first-quarter net income
climbed 39 percent to 985 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
