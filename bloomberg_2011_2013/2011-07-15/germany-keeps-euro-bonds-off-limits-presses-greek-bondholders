Germany  remains opposed to joint
euro-area bonds and insists that private investors contribute to
stemming the region’s debt crisis, government spokesmen said.  Germany’s rejection of common euro-region debt “remains in
effect,” Steffen Seibert, Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s chief
spokesman, said in Berlin today. Joint sovereign bonds lessen
the pressure for budget discipline and this “contradicts the
basic structure of the European currency union.”  Governments are “working very intensively” on finding
ways to involve private bondholders in a second rescue program
for Greece, Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus said at
the same briefing. “We have a basic consensus in the Eurogoup:
There will be participation by private creditors,” he said.  European leaders are struggling to find a solution for
 Greece  as the debt crisis the country touched off in 2009
threatened  Italy  this week. Italy sold five-year bonds yesterday
at the highest yield in three years.  Germany won’t agree to holding an emergency meeting of
euro-area leaders until the additional aid package for Greece is
ready, Seibert said. A summit will happen when it “makes
sense” and leads to a “good result” that sends a signal to
financial markets.  “The decisive thing isn’t to start a race for the date of
such a summit,” Seibert said. “The decisive thing is to work
on a new program for Greece with urgency and the right awareness
for the seriousness of the situation.”
