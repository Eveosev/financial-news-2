Peru ’s sol fell from its highest
level since 2008 after the central bank made its biggest dollar
purchase in a year to stem gains in the local currency.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7430 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:05 p.m. from 2.7410 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank’s
local unit.  Peru’s central bank bought $276 million yesterday to soak
up increased supply from exporters selling the greenback to pay
worker bonuses. The purchase was the biggest since July 14 2010,
when the central bank bought a record $494 million.  The sol’s recent gains “have been more to do with
specifics, such as the payment of taxes and bonuses,” said
 Benito Berber , an emerging market analyst at Nomura Securities
Inc. in  New York . The appreciation also reflects investor
confidence that President-elect Ollanta Humala will pursue
“market-friendly” policies when he takes office July 28,
Berber said.  The central bank has bought $433 million this week, helping
to reduce Peruvian banks’ net dollar surplus to $351 million on
July 13 from $556 million on July 11, according to central bank
data.  The purchases are “a clear signal that the more structural
dollar inflow is resuming,” said BNP Paribas SA, which
recommends selling dollars. “Foreigners are extremely light
when it comes to positioning” in the sol, the bank said in a
note to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
