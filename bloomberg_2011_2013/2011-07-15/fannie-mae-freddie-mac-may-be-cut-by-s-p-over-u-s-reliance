Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  may have
their AAA ratings lowered by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
because of their dependence on the U.S. government, which is
under review for a possible cut.  S&P also placed select AAA-rated Federal Home Loan Banks
and 126 debt issues guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. on Creditwatch negative, meaning there’s a one-in-two
chance they may be cut in the next 90 days, the ratings firm
said today in a statement.  S&P reduced the outlook on the U.S. rating to negative from
stable on April 18. The U.S. may have its AAA long-term rating
lowered if S&P concludes Congress and President Barack Obama’s
administration haven’t achieved a credible solution to the
rising U.S. government debt burden and aren’t likely to achieve
one in the foreseeable future, the firm said July 14.  Home loan guarantors  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac, which were
placed under government conservatorship in 2008, have a “direct
reliance on the U.S. government,” S&P said in today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
