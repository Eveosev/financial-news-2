Tanzania, East Africa’s second-
largest economy, said it will keep fuel costs unchanged this
month as it reviews the formula used to determine prices.  Existing prices “will continue to apply until new prices
that will be determined using the new formula are released” at
the start of August, the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory
Agency said in a statement published in the Guardian newspaper
today. It didn’t say why the review is being conducted.  The current price of gasoline in  Dar es Salaam , the
commercial capital, is 2,052 shillings ($1.32) a liter (0.26
gallons), according to the statement. Kerosene is 1,940
shillings a liter and diesel is 1,939 shillings, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
