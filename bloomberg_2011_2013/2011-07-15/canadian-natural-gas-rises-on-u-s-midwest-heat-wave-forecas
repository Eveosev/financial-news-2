Canadian natural gas rose as a heat
wave baking the U.S. Midwest was forecast to hang on for a week,
raising demand for the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gained 2.3
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland,
forecast Midwest temperatures as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit
(8 degrees Celsius) higher than normal until July 24.  “A major heat event will continue into this period,” MDA
said in a note to clients. “The core of the strongest heat will
move from the Plains and Midwest early into the Northeast and
mid-Atlantic around mid-period. Widespread highs well into the
90s to near 100 degrees will be common under the strong upper
level ridge.”  Alberta  gas for August delivery rose 8 cents to C$3.555 per
gigajoule ($3.52 per million British thermal units) as of 10:25
a.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. September gas gained 9.75 cents to C$3.57. Gas traded on
the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and is priced
on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas on the Nymex rose 12.5 cents, or 2.9 percent,
to $4.503 per million Btu as of 10:27 a.m.  Weather Outlook  Cooling demand in Chicago and Cleveland will be about twice
normal until at least July 22, said Weather Derivatives, based
in Belton, Missouri.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The high in Wichita, Kansas, today may reach 101 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), 8 degrees above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. of  State College , Pennsylvania.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.82 billion
cubic feet as of 9 a.m. in  New York .  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.71 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.72 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 934 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.83 billion cubic feet today, about 66 percent of its
capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 4.21 cents to $4.4596 per million Btu yesterday on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western
 Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 2.98 cents to $4.0732.  To contact the reporter on this story:
