The European Union’s antitrust
agency has opened a formal probe into whether Altstoff Recycling
Austria AG, known as ARA, abused its market position by
pressuring customers and waste-collection companies not to work
with its competitors.  The investigation will also examine whether ARA denied
rival firms “access to its collection infrastructure, which is
necessary to operate in the market,” the Brussels-based
European Commission said in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
