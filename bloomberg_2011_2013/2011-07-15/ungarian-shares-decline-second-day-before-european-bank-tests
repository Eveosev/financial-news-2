Hungarian stocks fell for a second
day as investors ditched riskier assets in  Europe  on speculation
stress tests to be published today may show some of the region’s
banks don’t have enough capital to weather the fiscal crisis.  The BUX gauge of companies slid 0.3 percent to 22,089.12 by
the 5 p.m. end of trade in Budapest, extending this week’s loss
to 1 percent. OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s biggest lender with
a 31 percent weighting in the index and the only Hungarian
participant in the stress tests, dropped 1.2 percent to 5,500
forint.  European stocks fell before the European Banking Authority
releases findings for 91 banks from 5 p.m. London time as part
of efforts to reassure investors lenders have sufficient
capital.  Standard & Poor’s  yesterday joined Moody’s Investors
Service in reviewing the U.S.’s top credit rating.  “The results of the latest stress tests to be published
after the market close may get especially strong attention,”
Peter Fazekas and Zsigmond Gelencser, analysts at Buda-Cash
Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a research note today. “Tensions are
also on the rise regarding America,” the Buda-Cash analysts
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
