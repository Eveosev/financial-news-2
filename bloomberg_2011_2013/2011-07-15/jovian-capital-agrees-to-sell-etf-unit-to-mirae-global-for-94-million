Jovian Capital Corp. (JOV) , a Canadian
 money manager , agreed to sell its exchange-traded fund business
to Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., South Korea’s biggest
mutual-fund manager.  Jovian will receive about C$90 million ($93.9 million) for
the business, based on an enterprise value of about C$150
million, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based company said today in a
statement. The sale includes Jovian’s 58 percent stake in
BetaPro Management Inc., its Horizon Exchange Traded Funds Inc.
business and other assets.  Mirae said July 4 it was in talks to buy a stake in BetaPro
to tap the growing popularity of ETFs, whose assets surged to
$1.37 trillion globally as of February from $74.3 billion in
2000, according to BlackRock data. Jovian’s five-year-old ETF
business manages about C$3 billion in assets, according to the
statement.  In a separate statement, Mirae said it agreed to buy 85
percent of BetaPro for C$127.5 million, without specifying the
owners of the remaining stake. Janet Yoo, an outside spokeswoman
for Mirae, didn’t immediately have a comment.  Jovian fell 25 cents to C$11.25 in 4 p.m. trading in
Toronto. The shares have gained 36 percent this year.  Jovian’s largest shareholder is Calgary billionaire Murray Edwards, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  CIBC World Markets  advised on the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
