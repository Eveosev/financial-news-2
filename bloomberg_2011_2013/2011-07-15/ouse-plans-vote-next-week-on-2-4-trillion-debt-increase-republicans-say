The U.S. House plans a vote next
week on a measure that would raise the governmentâ€™s debt limit
by $2.4 trillion, cut spending, cap government expenditures and
propose a balanced-budget constitutional amendment, Republican
lawmakers Sean Duffy and Billy Long said.  Duffy, of Wisconsin, and Long, of Missouri, described
discussions in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on
 Capitol Hill .  President  Barack Obama  and bipartisan congressional leaders
have been meeting daily to search for a compromise that would
cut the deficit and let the government sell debt after its
borrowing authority is exhausted on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
