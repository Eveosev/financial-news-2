Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.
said European Union regulators found it has sufficient capital
to withstand a recession and a sovereign debt crisis.  The lender’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of
financial strength, was 8 percent in the test’s adverse scenario
for 2012 and 8.2 percent for this year, surpassing the 5 percent
minimum required by the European Banking Authority’s tests, the
company said in a statement posted on its website today.  Nova Kreditna, Slovenia’s No. 2 bank after Nova Ljubljanska
Banka d.d., raised 104 million euros ($147 million) in April
with a share sale at the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  after Slovenia’s
2009 recession dented its capital base. The lender, majority
owned by the government, had its debt and deposit rating cut two
levels to Baa3 from Baa1 last month by Moody’s Investor’s
Service on expectations bad loans will keep weighing on its
balance sheet.  Slovenian central bank Governor Marko Kranjec in May
predicted that both NLB and Nova Kreditna would pass the EU
examination. The central bank warned the biggest threat to an
economic recovery is the debt crisis in  Europe .  The announcement on the stress test outcome came after the
Slovenian stock market closed. Before that, Nova Kreditna
advanced for a second consecutive day, gaining the most in more
than two weeks. The stock rose 13 eurocents, or 2 percent, to
close at 6.63 euros at the Ljubljana stock exchange, giving the
bank a market value of 173 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
