Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s
biggest oil company, said the volume of refined product sales
fell 2.3 percent in the second quarter as it processed less
crude at its refineries.  The company processed 3.1 percent less crude than in the
second quarter of 2010, Lisbon-based Galp said today in a
regulatory filing. The Rotterdam cracking refining margin, a
measure of profit from turning a barrel of crude into fuels, was
negative at $1 a barrel in the second quarter from $1.90 a
barrel a year earlier, Galp said.  The oil company’s refinery in Oporto can process about
90,000 barrels a day, while the Sines plant has a 220,000-
barrel-a-day capacity.  Galp is expanding exploration in regions such as  Brazil ’s
offshore  Santos Basin , where the Lula project is located, and
 Angola  to improve access to crude supplies and rely less on
refining and sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain .  The company on March 14 said it aims to raise about 2
billion euros ($2.83 billion) from a capital increase at its
Brazilian unit as it develops offshore projects in the Latin
American nation. It will invest about 3.5 billion euros in the
2012-2015 period, with exploration and production representing
70 percent of the total.  Galp’s average working interest production rose 10.4
percent from a year earlier to 21,800 barrels a day, while
average net entitlement production increased 26.4 percent to
13,800 barrels a day. The company had said on April 29 that it
was aiming at reaching working interest production of 21,000
barrels a day for the second quarter.  The volume of natural gas sales rose 7.4 percent to 1.19
billion cubic meters in the second quarter.  Galp shares have gained 5.8 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 12.6 billion euros.  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s
biggest oil company, and Portuguese holding company Amorim
Energia BV each control a third of Galp.  Galp is due to report second-quarter earnings on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
