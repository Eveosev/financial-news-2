Russian industrial production
accelerated in June for the first time in five months as
corporate investment rebounded.  Output at factories, mines and utilities rose 5.7 percent
from a year earlier, the most since February, after a 4.1
percent increase in May, the Federal Statistics Service in
Moscow said in an e-mailed statement today. The median estimate
of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for an annual gain of
4.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
