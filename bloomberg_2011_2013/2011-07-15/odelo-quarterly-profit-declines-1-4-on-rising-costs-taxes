Grupo Modelo SAB, the Mexican brewer
of Corona beer, said profit fell for the third time in the last
four quarters because of rising costs and a 34 percent increase
in taxes from a year ago.  Second-quarter net income fell 1.4 percent to 2.89 billion
pesos ($247 million) from 2.93 billion pesos a year earlier, the
 Mexico  City-based company said in a filing to the Mexican stock
exchange yesterday. Sales advanced 8.2 percent to 25.1 billion
pesos as domestic beer shipments rose 8 percent and export
volume jumped 11 percent.  Profit was hurt by operating costs that rose 6 percent in
the quarter from a year ago and taxes of 2.03 billion pesos, a
34 percent increase from a year ago, the company said in the
filing.  Modelo was expected to report net income of 2.97 billion
pesos and sales of 25 billion pesos, said Celso Sanchez, an
analyst with the Mexican unit of Citigroup Inc. in a July 13
report.  Beer sales in Mexico were helped by an average high
 temperature  for April and May of 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees
Fahrenheit), the highest since the National Water Commission
began keeping records in 1971. The agency hasn’t yet posted the
June figure.  The company was interested in teaming up with Molson Coors
Brewing Co. to buy Foster’s Group Ltd., Bloomberg reported last
month, citing five people with knowledge of the situation.
Modelo has not made a public bid for the Australian brewer.  Foster’s said in June it rejected an offer by SABMiller Plc
to buy it for A$9.5 billion ($10 billion).  Modelo shares rose 0.2 percent to 73.51 pesos in Mexico
City trading yesterday before reporting earnings.  (The company is scheduled to hold a conference call today
