L’Oreal SA heiress Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer Pascal Wilhelm was cleared of any
wrongdoing in his role advising her on an investment in an on-
line game company owned by another client,  Agence France-Presse 
said today, citing the Paris bar association.  The bar investigated Wilhelm after Bettencourt’s daughter
complained the investment constituted a conflict of interest for
the lawyer, AFP said. Bettencourt said last month she would
terminate the investment, AFP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
