The main reasons for the global debt
crisis are weaknesses in the international financial system,
according to former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker ,
 Handelsblatt  reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Volcker said
international accounting and auditing standards, and
international regulation of financial institutions, are needed
to reduce systemic risks. “The rules must be such that we can
let any institution go into an orderly insolvency,” he was
cited as saying.  Europe must strengthen budget discipline and the
institutions enforcing it, or accept that the common currency
will fall apart, the newspaper cited Volcker as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
