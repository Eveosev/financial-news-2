European stocks fell as Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services became the second agency this week to
say it may cut the U.S.’s top credit rating and investors
awaited stress tests on European banks.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.3 percent to 266.77
8:03 a.m. in  London . The gauge has fallen 2.6 percent this week,
the biggest drop since March, amid concern that the sovereign-
debt crisis will spread from  Greece  to the larger economies of
 Italy  and  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
