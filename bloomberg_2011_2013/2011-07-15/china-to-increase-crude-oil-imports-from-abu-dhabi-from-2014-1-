China National Petroleum Corp. , the
country’s biggest oil producer, said it has agreed to increase
imports of crude oil from  Abu Dhabi  starting in 2014.  The accord is part of a 20-year crude supply deal that CNPC
and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. signed on July 13, the parent of
PetroChina Co. said in its online  newsletter  today, without
giving details. Liu Weijiang, the Beijing-based director of
CNPC’s international department, couldn’t immediately comment on
the total volume and schedule covered by the agreement.  Abu Dhabi National Oil, the state oil company known as
Adnoc, will increase crude supplies to CNPC to 200,000 barrels a
day starting in 2014, the United Arab Emirates’ state news
agency WAM reported yesterday.  China ’s 2010 crude imports from the U.A.E. totaled 5.29
million metric tons, or about 100,000 barrels a day, according
to customs data. Abu Dhabi exports the majority of the U.A.E.’s
crude. Some supplies are also shipped from Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
