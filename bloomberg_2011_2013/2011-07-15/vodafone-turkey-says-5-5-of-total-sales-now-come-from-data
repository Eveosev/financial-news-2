Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s  Turkey  unit
increased the weighting of data revenue on total sales last year
to 5.5 percent after investing in network upgrades, the
division’s chief executive officer said.  About half of Vodafone Turkey’s users now subscribe to so-
called third-generation mobile services, a category comprising
fast data transfer and Internet connection via mobile devices,
the unit’s CEO Serpil Timuray said in an e-mailed statement
today. She didn’t provide a previous-year figure for the unit’s
share of revenue from data.  Vodafone invested 1.04 billion liras ($630 million) in
Turkey in the fiscal year ended March 31, mostly for 2G and 3G
network improvement, Timuray said. The operator’s 3G network now
covers 78.6 percent of Turkey’s population, she said.  Vodafone had 16.8 million subscribers in Turkey at the end
of March with a 27.3 percent user market share, according to the
national regulator’s  website .  Vodafone’s Turkey unit competes with Turkcell Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS, the country’s biggest mobile-phone operator, and
Avea Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, a unit of  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS. (TTKOM)   The company’s Turkish sales surged 30.2 percent to 3.7
billion liras in the fiscal year ended March 31, with 28.9
percent growth in service revenue, Newbury, England-based
Vodafone said May 17. The Turkish mobile market grew 4 percent
during that period, Timuray said at the time.  Vodafone today began Turkish sales of Webbox, which
connects standard television sets to the Internet, the company
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
