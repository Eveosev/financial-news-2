Gold futures rose, capping the
longest rally since November 2009, on mounting concern that debt
woes in the U.S. will escalate, boosting the appeal of the
precious metal as a haven.  Standard & Poor’s became the second rating company to say
it may cut the U.S.’s top credit grade, and the  Federal Reserve 
said it may consider a third round of so-called quantitative
easing if the economy falters. Gold rose to an intraday record
$1,594.90 an ounce yesterday.  “The flight-to-quality buyers are emerging,” Adam Klopfenstein, a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “People are starting to question
if the  U.S. economy  can keep its footing and keep QE3 off the
table.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 80 cents to settle at
$1,590.10 at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New York. That’s the
highest settlement ever. The metal gained 3.1 percent this week
and was up for the ninth straight session. The metal traded at
$1,593.50 in electronic trading at 4:55 p.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
