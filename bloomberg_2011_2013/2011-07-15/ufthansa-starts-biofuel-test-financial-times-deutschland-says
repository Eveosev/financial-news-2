biological fuel made of plant oil on a scheduled domestic flight
between Hamburg and  Frankfurt ,  Financial Times Deutschland  said.  The airline will operate one engine of an Airbus SAS A321
with conventional kerosene, and the other with a mixture of
kerosene and biological fuel to determine the effects of the
combustible on lifespan and engine maintenance, the newspaper
