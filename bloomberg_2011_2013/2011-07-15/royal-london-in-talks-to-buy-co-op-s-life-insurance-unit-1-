Royal  London  Mutual Insurance
Society Ltd., the U.K.’s biggest customer-owned life insurer, is
in exclusive talks to buy Co-operative Financial Services’ life
insurance and asset-management divisions. Separately, the Co-op
said it is cutting 670 jobs.  The firm is conducting due diligence on the businesses,
which have about 2 million policyholders and 20 billion pounds
($32 billion) of assets, Royal London said today in a statement.
The company didn’t give a potential price.  “The opportunity we are discussing with CFS has the
potential to deliver another major step forward for Royal
London, with real benefits for our members and other
policyholders,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Yardley said in
the statement.  Co-op , based in Manchester,  England , is considering leaving
the life-insurance and fund-management markets after completing
a strategic review sparked by the recession and the government’s
planned Retail Distribution Review, which changes the way
financial products are sold. The firm will also cut 670
employees from its financial-advisory division as it transfers
some of the services to Axa SA, it said in a separate statement.  “Unite has expressed to Co-operative Financial Services
disagreement with the decision to cease to provide life-
assurance products,” said Dave Fleming, national officer of the
trade union. “The 750 employees potentially affected by this
news will be deeply concerned and upset.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
