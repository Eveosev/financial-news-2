Two people were killed and 16 others
wounded in separate shelling incidents in the southern Yemeni
city of Taiz, residents said today.  One civilian was killed and five wounded in the Al-Rawdha
neighborhood, Mohammed Ahmed said. Another person was killed and
11 wounded in Al-Masbah, according to resident Munir Abdullah.  A security officer and two of his guards were also killed
in an ambush which left four of the attackers wounded,
Abdulrahman Saeed, a witness, said in a phone interview.  Tens of thousands protested in Taiz today to demand the
establishment of a transitional council and a civil state, Salah
Saleh, an activist, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
