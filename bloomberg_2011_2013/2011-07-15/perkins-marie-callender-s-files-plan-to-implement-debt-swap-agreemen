Perkins & Marie Callender’s Inc.
filed a plan to implement the debt agreement the restaurant
operator negotiated with creditors before it sought Chapter 11
court protection last month.  Holders of senior unsecured notes owed $204 million and
general unsecured creditors owed as much as $25 million would
get new stock under the plan filed today in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Wilmington, Delaware.  The proposed disclosure statement, filed along with the
plan, doesn’t tell creditors how much they stand to receive as a
percentage recovery. General unsecured creditors have the option
of taking 10 percent cash rather than stock, so long as the
total cash payout doesn’t exceed $1.5 million.  About $103 million owing on secured notes would be rolled
over into new secured notes of the same amount, plus interest,
under the plan. Holders of existing stock and subordinated
claims would get nothing. Noteholders and general unsecured
creditors will be allowed to vote on the plan.  Funds managed by Wayzata Investment Partners LLC would get
control of the reorganized company after the plan is confirmed.
Perkins, based in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , filed for bankruptcy on
June 13.  Assets are valued at $290 million while debt totals $440.8
million, according to court papers. Castle Harlan Inc., a New
York-based private-equity firm, acquired the company in 2005 for
$245 million in cash.  Perkins said at the time of its bankruptcy filing that it
would close 58 restaurants. At the start of the case, the
company owned 85 Marie Callender’s sites in nine states and
franchised 37 in four states. It owned 160 Perkins stores in 13
states and franchised 314 in 31 states.  The case is In re Perkins & Marie Callender’s Inc., 11-
11795, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
