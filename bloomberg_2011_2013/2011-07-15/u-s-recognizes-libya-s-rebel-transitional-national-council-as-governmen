The U.S. and international
allies meeting about  Libya  have recognized the transitional
national council as the sole legitimate governing
authority in the country, a step that allows for greater
funding for the opposition group.  “I am announcing today that, until an interim
authority is in place, the United States will recognize the
TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya, and we
will deal with it on that basis,” Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton  said today in Istanbul.  The Contact Group laid out the conditions for a
“genuine cease-fire” in a final statement and declared that
leader Muammar Qaddafi and certain members of his family
must go.  To contact the reporter on this story:
