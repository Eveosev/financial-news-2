Colorado Rare Earths Inc., a mining
exploration company whose shares have jumped 18-fold since
November, is considering a merger with closely held  U.S. Rare
Earths Inc. , said two people familiar with the situation.  The companies are in talks and terms haven’t been agreed
upon, said the people, who declined to be identified because the
discussions are private.  Dick Stern, a spokesman for Colorado Rare Earths, declined
to comment. U.S. Rare Earths Chief Executive Officer Edward Cowle, who also sits on the board of Colorado Rare Earths,
didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment that was
left at the company’s headquarters in  Salt Lake City .  Both companies explore for rare earths, a group of 17
chemically similar elements that have soared in price after
 China  curbed exports. Chinese output accounts for at least 90
percent of global supply of rare earths, which are used to make
helicopter blades, hybrid cars and wind turbines.  Colorado Rare Earths, which is based in Lonoke,  Arkansas ,
has mining claims in Colorado, Idaho and Montana. U.S. Rare
Earths has mining leases in Montana and Idaho.  Colorado Rare Earths rose 50 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $9
as of 5:20 p.m. New York time in over-the-counter trading,
giving it a market capitalization of $116.6 million.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
