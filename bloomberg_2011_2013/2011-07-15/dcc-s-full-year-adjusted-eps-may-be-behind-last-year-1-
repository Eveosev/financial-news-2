DCC Plc (DCC) , an Irish distribution
company, said full-year operating profit and adjusted earnings
per share may be “modestly” down on last year as trading at
its energy unit in the first quarter was “well behind.”  The outlook “continues to be framed against a difficult
economic environment, particularly in the U.K.,” the Dublin-
based company said today in a statement on the Regulatory News
Service. DCC said warmer weather in April and May meant the
company’s target of achieving about 15 percent of operating
profit in the first quarter wasn’t reached.  Second-half results will be affected by the first quarter,
the company said. The health-care, beverage and environmental
units traded in line with or modestly ahead of first-quarter
forecasts, it said.  DCC fell 0.2 percent to 19.45 euros in Dublin trading
yesterday and has risen 5.9 percent during the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
