A rule aimed at protecting small
investors who buy U.S. commodity contracts from retail brokers
will go into effect tomorrow.  The Retail Commodity Transactions rule from the Dodd-Frank
Act will allow the agency’s enforcement lawyers to pursue
brokerages that offer custom-made futures contracts, not traded
on exchanges, that are sold under the guise of spot contracts,
according to documents posted on the U.S.  Commodity Futures
Trading Commission  website.  “The people who were offering leverage to retail customers
were skating in a gray area,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer of
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “The government feels a lot of these shops
don’t have the actual metal behind the trade. They’ll be forced
to go with a regulated environment, and this will provide some
customer protection.”  Speculative demand has helped fuel a surge in commodity
investing and prices during the past decade. About $9.61 billion
went into commodity funds in the first quarter, more than triple
the $2.77 billion a year earlier, EPFR Global, a Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based research firm, said in a report in April.
Gold futures surged to a record $1,594.90 an ounce yesterday on
the Comex in  New York .  The CFTC and the  Securities and Exchange Commission  are
finalizing Dodd-Frank rules aimed at reducing risk and boosting
transparency after largely unregulated trades helped fuel the
2008 credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
