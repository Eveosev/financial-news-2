Two substations that transform and
export electricity generated by  wind turbines  have been
installed at the London Array offshore wind farm being developed
in the U.K. by Dong Energy A/S, EON AG and Masdar.  The offshore substations will convert electricity produced
by windmills in the outer Thames Estuary to as much as 150,000
volts, according to a  statement  on the project’s website. That
power is then exported to the substation onshore where the
voltage is increased again and fed into the grid.  The 1-gigawatt London Array project backed by Dong, the
Danish energy company,  Germany ’s EON and the Abu Dhabi
government-owned renewable energy company Masdar is the world’s
largest approved wind farm at sea, according to the project’s
website. Able to power 750,000 homes, it’s being built as the
U.K. government strives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
linked to  climate change .  The installation of the substations weighing more than
1,260 metric tons each is a “real sign of progress” for the
project whose first phase should be complete by the end of next
year, Richard Rigg, project director at London Array, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
