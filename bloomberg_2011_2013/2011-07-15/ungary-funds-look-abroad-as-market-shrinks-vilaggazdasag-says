Hungarian fund managers need more
foreign assets as domestic stock and bond markets shrink,
 Vilaggazdasag  reported, citing the head of Pioneer Global Asset
Management SpA’s local unit.  Fewer analysts are focusing on domestic assets as the state
takeover of 3 trillion forint ($15.7 billion) in privately
managed pension assets depletes the  bond market  and trading
volume on the Budapest Stock Exchange falls, Sandor Vizkeleti,
chief executive officer of Budapest-based Pioneer Alapkezelo, a
unit of UniCredit SpA, told the newspaper in an interview.  While fund managers aren’t quitting the Hungarian market
because of the pension changes, some may have to cut costs and
jobs, Vizkeleti, who is also president of the country’s fund
manager association, Bamosz, told Vilaggazdasag.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
