Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg said
European Union regulators found it has sufficient capital to
withstand a recession and losses on sovereign debt.  The lender’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of
financial strength, was 7.1 percent in the test’s adverse

European Banking Authority’s tests, the company said in a
 statement  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
