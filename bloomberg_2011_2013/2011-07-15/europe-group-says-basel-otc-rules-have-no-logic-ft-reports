The European Association of
Corporate Treasurers said in a briefing note for European Union
officials that new Basel rules on bank capital, that assign
higher than expected capital costs to over-the-counter
derivative transactions carried out by banks, have “no logic”
unless the intention is “punitive behaviour towards OTC
derivatives,” the Financial Times reported, citing the note.  This is “a flaw that is irrational in substance,” the
EACT said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
