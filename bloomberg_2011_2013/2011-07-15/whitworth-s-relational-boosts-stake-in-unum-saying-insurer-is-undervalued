Relational Investors LLC, the money
management firm led by Ralph Whitworth, increased its stake in
long-term disability insurer  Unum Group (UNM) , saying that the
company’s shares are undervalued.  Relational held about 19.1 million, or 6.2 percent, of
Unum’s shares as of July 6, according to a regulatory filing
today. That compares with about 14.4 million shares, or 4.7
percent, at the end of March, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The additional stake makes Relational the third-
largest shareholder in the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based insurer.  Unum, led by Chief Executive Officer Tom Watjen, trades at
87 percent of book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities,
according to Bloomberg data. The insurer has said it will boost
the quarterly dividend to 10.5 cents from 9.25 cents.  “Shares are undervalued by the market at the present
time,” Relational said in the filing. Relational said it will
“closely monitor” Unum’s “capital allocation process.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
