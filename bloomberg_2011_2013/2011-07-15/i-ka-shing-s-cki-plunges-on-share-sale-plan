Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings
Ltd. (1038) , controlled by billionaire  Li Ka-shing , fell the most in
more than two years in Hong Kong trading after announcing a
HK$3.4 billion ($436 million) share-sale plan.  The roads and utility company known as CKI dropped as much
as 7 percent, the most since October 2008, and traded down 5.6
percent at HK$41 as of 10:08 a.m.  The slide followed CKI’s  announcement  to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today that it plans to sell 84.5 million shares
at HK$40.41 each for general funding. The placing price is a
discount of 7 percent to yesterday’s closing price of HK$43.45.  CKI will submit a 2.4 billion pound ($3.9 billion) takeover
proposal for the U.K.’s  Northumbrian Water Group Plc (NWG) , it said
July 11. The Hong Kong-based company, which has invested in
electricity, gas, water and road assets in  New Zealand , China,
Australia, the U.K. and Canada, led a group that agreed in
October to buy Electricite de France SA’s U.K. power networks
for 5.8 billion pounds.  CKI’s controlling shareholder, Li’s Hutchison
Infrastructure Holdings Ltd., will sell 84.5 million existing
shares to not less than six independent investors and then
subscribe the same amount of new shares. Its holding in CKI will
be reduced to 81.527 percent after the completion of the fund-
raising, from 84.583 percent, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
