Russia  is engaged in “difficult
dialog” with the European Union and the U.S. as it negotiates
entry into the  World Trade Organization , Prime Minister  Vladimir
Putin  said in Magnitogorsk today.  Russia will maintain requirements that foreign automakers
meet a quota for manufacturing vehicles in the country or face
higher import duties. The E.U. is urging Russia to abolish the
rules in accession talks, Putin said.  “They urge us to remove the requirement for foreign
automakers in Russia to produce at least 300,000 vehicles a year
and source 60 percent of the materials locally,” Putin said.
“We told them it’s a red line we won’t cross, though we would
like to join the WTO,” Putin said after opening a steel mill in
the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
