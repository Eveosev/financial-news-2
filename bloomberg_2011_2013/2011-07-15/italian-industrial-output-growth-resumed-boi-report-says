Italy ’s industrial output resumed
rising in the second quarter as growth in the euro region’s
third-biggest economy gained pace, the  Bank of Italy  said.  The Rome-based central bank said production likely
increased in the three months through June by 1.15 percent from
the first quarter, when it contracted 0.1 percent. Gross
domestic product probably rose by 0.4 percent, up from 0.1
percent in the three months through March, according to the
bank’s quarterly economic report published today.  The Bank of Italy said the economic outlook remains
“uncertain” amid risks “related mainly to the intensity of
the international recovery and to the evolution of the crisis of
sovereign debt in the euro area.”  “After six months of slight increases, Italy’s GDP rose in
the second quarter at a rate in line with the euro area’s
average,” Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi  said in a speech
in  Rome  on July 13. “In the medium term the pace of growth of
the Italian economy would remain on a level below the ones of
our main European partners,” the  European Central Bank ’s
incoming president also said.  The central bank does not expect “a significant recovery
in employment” after the Italian jobless rate fell to 8.1
percent in May, today’s report said. The rate had reached 8.7
percent in April 2010, the highest since monthly records began
in January 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
