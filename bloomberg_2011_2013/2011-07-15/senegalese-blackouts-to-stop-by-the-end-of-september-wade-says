Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade
forecast that electricity blackouts would be over by September
as temporary generating facilities came on line.  “The power cuts will be nothing but a bad memory,” Wade
told a meeting of government officials in the capital, Dakar,
yesterday.  The state-owned electric utility, Senelec, has hired
generators with a capacity of 150 megawatts, Mamadou Diallo,
company spokesman, said by phone today. Of that, 50 megawatts
has already been delivered and another 100 megawatts should
arrive by the end of July, he said.  Senegal saw its worst street protests since the beginning
of President Wade’s 11 year rule in June, after power cuts which
lasted up to 20 hours at a time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
