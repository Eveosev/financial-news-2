Kenya ’s shilling appreciated and was
set for a weekly increase against the dollar as currency supply
was curbed after the central bank tightened overnight borrowing
rules.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.3 percent to 89.38 per dollar and was trading 0.1
percent higher at 89.55 by 2:38 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi
from yesterday’s close of 89.68, bringing its increase so far
this week to 0.6 percent.  The Central Bank of Kenya on July 12 said lenders planning
to grant loans to other operators in the  interbank market  can no
longer access funds through the discount window on the same day.
The rules are part of attempts to rein in inflationary
expectations and curb speculative trading in the shilling, which
reached the weakest level in 17 years on June 22.  “The tight liquidity conditions in the money market
coupled with limited demand ahead of the weekend is boosting the
shilling and it’s expected to trade within the 88.70 to 89.30
range in the coming week,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone today.  The  central bank  also reversed an increase in the rate it
charges lenders for overnight loans back to 6.25 percent after
raising it to 8 percent just two weeks ago, saying banks were
using this as a base for interbank lending, resulting in
“distortions in the money market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
