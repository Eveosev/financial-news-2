CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) , Southeast Asia’s
biggest developer, and its partners have agreed to buy a
development site in China’s Western Chongqing city for 6.54
billion yuan ($1.02 billion).  The project will include a shopping mall with a gross floor
area of 220,000 square meters (2.4 million square feet), 331,000
square meters of residential space and 174,000 square meters of
offices, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
CapitaLand and  CapitaMalls Asia Ltd. (CMA) , its retail property unit,
will each own 25 percent of the project, while Singbridge
Holdings Pte and other partners will hold the rest, it said.  CapitaLand, with S$10.1 billion ($7.8 billion) of assets in
China, will continue to seek opportunities in the country even
as the government intensified measures to curb the risk of an
asset bubble, Chief Operating Officer Lim Ming Yan said Nov. 20.
The government this year raised mortgage requirements and
imposed home purchase restrictions in about 40 cities.  The project, located in the Yuzhong district, is expected
to cost a total of 21.1 billion yuan, according to the statement.
It will be CapitaLand’s third shopping mall in the city, adding
to its 40 retail properties in  China , with another 16 under
construction.  CapitaLand shares fell 1.6 percent to S$2.49 at the close
in  Singapore , while CapitaMalls dropped 0.4 percent to S$1.27.  China’s home prices last month posted the worst performance
this year, with 33 out of 70 cities that the government
monitored falling from the previous month.  The Singapore-based developer’s third-quarter profit
dropped 83 percent after lower contributions from China and
 Australia  and an accounting rule change that restated last
year’s revenue. CapitaLand will aim to double its portfolio in
China in the next five years as it expects the economy to expand
over the next decade, Lim said in an interview in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
