Italy ’s public debt rose to the
highest level since  Benito Mussolini  won elections 89 years ago,
paving the way for his 20-year dictatorship.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows  debt  jumped in 2012 to 127
percent of gross domestic product from 120.8 percent a year
earlier. That’s the most since 1924, when Mussolini won 64
percent of the popular vote in elections that opposition members
said were marked by irregularities. The chart is based on data
from the  Bank of Italy  and national statistics office Istat.  “Nowadays, reducing debt-to-GDP ratio is challenging, much
more than it used to be,” said Fabio Fois, an economist at
Barclays in Milan. “Cutting unproductive public expenditures
and increasing growth potential are the only viable measures.
Maintaining a large primary surplus position over the medium
term must remain a policy goal.”  As the spending cuts and tax increases passed by outgoing
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  helped Italy raise its primary
surplus to 2.5 percent of GDP last year, the euro region’s
third-biggest economy contracted 2.4 percent. Still, interests
on debt rose last year by 10.7 percent and the  budget deficit 
amounted to 3 percent of GDP, within European Union limits. The
national debt was also increased by the cost of bailing out the
euro region’s distressed countries including Greece and 1.9
billion euros ($2.5 billion) in derivatives.  Before Mussolini took power, Italy’s debt had peaked at 159
percent of GDP in 1921, data compiled by Bloomberg News show. It
was at 152.9 percent in 1924 before falling to 111.3 percent in
1925.  Monti’s policy mix prompted 25 percent of voters in last
month’s inconclusive election to back the anti-austerity stance
of comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement,
which was the single most voted party in the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
