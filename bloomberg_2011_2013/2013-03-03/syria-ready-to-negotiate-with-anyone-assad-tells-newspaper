Syria ’s President Bashar al-Assad
said he is ready to hold peace talks with rebels to end the
conflict.   “We are ready to negotiate with anyone, including
militants who surrender their arms,” Assad told the London-
based Sunday Times in an interview. “We are not going to deal
with terrorists who are determined to carry weapons, to
terrorise people, to kill civilians, to attack public places or
private enterprise and to destroy the country.”   Syria has “opposition that are political entities and we
have armed terrorists,” Assad said. “We can engage in dialogue
with the opposition, but we cannot engage in dialogue with
terrorists. We fight terrorism.”  Assad said any moves by the west to arm Syrian rebels would
result in consequences.  “Syria lies at the fault line geographically, politically,
socially and ideologically,” Assad told the Times. “So playing
with this fault line will have serious repercussions all over
the  Middle East . Any intervention will not make these things
better. It will only make them worse. Europe and the  United
States  and others are going to pay the price sooner or later
with the instability in this region. They do not foresee it.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
