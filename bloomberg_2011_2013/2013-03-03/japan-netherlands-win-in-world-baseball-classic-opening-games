Two-time defending champion Japan
rallied with a three-run eighth inning to defeat Brazil 5-3
yesterday, while the Netherlands shutout South Korea 5-0 in the
opening games of the World Baseball Classic.  Pinch-hitter Shinosuke Abe sent home the go-ahead runner in
the eighth with the bases loaded for Japan at Fukuoka Dome in
southwestern Japan.  Netherlands starter Diegomar Markwell allowed two hits in
four innings to lead his team to the win over the South Korea at
Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in Taichung, Taiwan.  In the other games, Chinese Taipai topped Australia 4-1
yesterday and Cuba today defeated Brazil 5-2.  Sixteen teams are competing to reach the championship game
on March 19 in San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
