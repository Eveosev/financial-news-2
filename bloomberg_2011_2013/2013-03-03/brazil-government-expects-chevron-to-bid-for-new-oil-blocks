Brazil â€™s oil regulator expects
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) , which suspended operations in the country last
year after an offshore spill, to participate in an auction for
new oil blocks this year, Magda Chambriard, head of the agency
known as ANP, said in an interview in Houston.  The regulator also sees OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes as
a model producer of gas for electricity plants ahead of a gas
block auction in October, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
