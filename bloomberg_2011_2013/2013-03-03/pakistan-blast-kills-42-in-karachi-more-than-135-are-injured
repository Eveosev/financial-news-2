At least 42 people were killed today
when an explosion ripped through a commercial neighborhood
dominated by Shiite Muslims in Karachi, a senior health official
said.  More than 135 people were injured in the explosion, health
official Suresh Kumar said by phone in Karachi.  “The death toll may rise, as we suspect more people may be
trapped under rubble of the buildings damaged in the blast,”
Kumar said.  Last month, 84 Shiites died in a bombing in Quetta, in
southwestern Baluchistan province. A bombing in Quetta in
January killed at least 96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
