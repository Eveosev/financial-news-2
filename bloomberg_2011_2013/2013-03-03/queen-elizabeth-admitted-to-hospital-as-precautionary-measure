Britain’s  Queen Elizabeth  II has
been admitted to a  London  hospital with symptoms of
gastroenteritis,  Buckingham Palace  said.  The 86-year-old monarch, whose illness was first announced
March 1, has canceled all official engagements for the coming
week, including a planned two-day visit to Rome.  “The queen is being assessed at the King Edward VII’s
Hospital, London, after experiencing symptoms of
gastroenteritis,” the palace said in a statement. “As a
precaution, all official engagements for this week will
regrettably be either postponed or canceled.”  Yesterday, the palace had said the queen would spend the
weekend resting at Windsor Castle after deciding not to attend a
military celebration in Wales during the country’s St. David’s
Day celebrations. Today, it was announced she had been admitted
to hospital.  Gastroenteritis causes inflammation of the stomach lining
and intestines. It can be transmitted through contact with an
infected person or contaminated food and drink. Symptoms can
include vomiting, fever and stomach ache.  An unidentified spokesman for the queen told the U.K.’s
Press Association that she was in good spirits and was otherwise
in good health.  She was last hospitalized 10 years ago for a minor knee
operation, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
