French President  Francois Hollande 
has disappointed about two-thirds of the public less than a year
into his presidency, according to a BVA poll.  Sixty-eight percent of French people and 44 percent of
those who voted for Hollande in the second round of May’s
election say they’re disappointed by the leader, the  poll 
published in today’s Le Parisien showed.  No more than 10 percent of French people think Hollande
will keep his promises on the economy, employment and taxes this
year and more than 50 percent think he won’t do so before the
end of his five-year term, according to BVA. For 54 percent,
Hollande hasn’t gone far enough in his reforms, the poll showed.  Fifty-one percent of the French think that former President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  would have done a better job had he been re-
elected, according to BVA.  The poll questioned 1,013 adults on Feb. 28 and March 1 by
phone and Internet. It has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
