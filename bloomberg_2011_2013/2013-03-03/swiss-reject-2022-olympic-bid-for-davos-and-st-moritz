Swiss voters in the mountainous
canton of Graubuenden shot down a proposal to  bid  for the 2022
Winter Olympics in a referendum.  Voters in the eastern province, which is home to the ski
resorts of St. Moritz, Klosters, Arosa and Davos, today  rejected 
the proposal with 52.7 percent against. The turnout was about 59
percent.  The project had a price tag of 2.46 billion Swiss francs
($2.6 billion) and had been touted as a tool for boosting the
region’s “infrastructure, economy and tourism, as well as
global publicity,” according to the committee pushing for the
Olympic bid.  The Swiss frequently vote on planned public spending and
often favor frugality. International Olympic Committee President
 Jacques Rogge  said the region would be a favorite to win the bid
if voters decide to back it, according to an Feb. 24 interview
in Blick newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
