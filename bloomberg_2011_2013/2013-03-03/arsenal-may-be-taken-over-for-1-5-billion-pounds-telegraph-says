Arsenal football club may be bought
out by a Middle East group for 1.5 billion pounds ($2.3
billion), potentially the sport’s biggest takeover, the U.K.
Telegraph reported, citing an unidentified person in the group.  The cash offer for all of the 62,217 issued shares would
include about 830 million pounds for U.S. owner Stan Kroenke’s
66.83 percent stake, according to the report. The bid, more than
twice the amount that Arsenal was valued at two years ago, will
be backed by funds from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the
Telegraph reported.  A successful offer for Arsenal at that price would eclipse
the 790 million pound leveraged buyout in 2005 of  Manchester
United Plc (MANU)  by the U.S.-based Glazer family. The money would
enable the club to pay back its about 250 million pounds of
debt, the Telegraph said, citing Arsenal’s last full-year
results.  The group behind the bid would make available funds to
improve the squad and pledge to reduce ticket prices at
Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium, according to the Telegraph report.
The group has requested a meeting with Kroenke, it said.  Arsenal, which faces Tottenham Hotspur today in the north
London derby, is currently fifth in the 20-team Premier League
standings, one spot out of the positions for  Europe ’s elite
Champions League competition. The team, managed by Arsene Wenger, hasn’t won a major trophy since the F.A. Cup in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
