Corp.’s spacecraft docked with the International  Space Station  a
day late after recovering from engine malfunctions, according to
the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The unmanned craft operated by the Hawthorne, California-
based company known as SpaceX was in place at 8:56 a.m. today,
NASA said in a statement, and it will stay for 22 days before
returning for a  Pacific Ocean  splashdown. This is the company’s
second of at least a dozen planned supply missions to the
station, a $1.6 billion contract.  Just after Dragon’s March 1 launch, three of the craft’s
four thruster pods didn’t initially work and had to be remotely
coaxed back online. Elon Musk, head of SpaceX, had said a
preliminary review suggested the malfunction may have stemmed
from a blocked or stuck fuel valve.  “Spaceflight will never be risk-free, but it’s a critical
achievement that we once again have a U.S. capability to
transport science to and from the International Space Station,”
said William Gerstenmaier, an associate administrator at  NASA ,
in a statement.  The cargo vessel is delivering 1,268 pounds of supplies to
support the space station’s operations and experiments,
according to NASA. It will return with 2,668 pounds of research
samples that scientists hope will help them study spaceflight’s
effects on humans, plant samples that may aid in producing food
for longer space missions and crystals meant to help improve
solar cells and electronics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
