New York  Yankees rightfielder Ichiro Suzuki escaped injury when his car collided with another vehicle
on a Tampa highway yesterday, the New York Post reported.  “He is fine,” Yankees General Manager  Brian Cashman  said,
according to the Post. “His interpreter called to let us
know.”  The Yankees already are losing home-run leader and
outfielder  Curtis Granderson  for the first month of Major League
Baseball’s regular season with a fractured forearm.  Suzuki, acquired last July from the Seattle Mariners,
batted .322 with five home runs, 27 runs batted in and 14 stolen
bases in 67 games for the Yankees to help the club win the
American League East title.  Suzuki, 39, hit a car that was turning left, Tampa police
Lieutenant Ronald McMullen said, according to the Post. The
driver of the turning car, which collided with a third vehicle,
was cited for the accident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
