Wide receiver  Randy Moss , who
proclaimed himself “the greatest receiver to ever do it”
before the  Super Bowl , is unlikely to be back with the San
Francisco 49ers next season.  “Wished we could’ve finished the job!!” Moss wrote on his
Twitter account. “Thanks for the opportunity an [sic] good luck
in the future 9ers.”  Moss, 36, will become an unrestricted free agent after a
season in which he complained about being underutilized. He
returned to the  National Football League  last season after a
year of retirement and caught 28 passes for 434 yards and two
touchdowns for San Francisco.  Moss is second in NFL history for most receiving touchdowns
with 156, third for most receiving yards with 15,292 and ninth
for most receptions at 982.  To contact the reporter on this story:
