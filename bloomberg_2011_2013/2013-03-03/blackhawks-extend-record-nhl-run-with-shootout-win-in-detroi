The  Chicago  Blackhawks extended
their record-setting start to the National Hockey League season
with a 2-1 shootout win against the  Detroit  Red Wings.  The Blackhawks have a 19-0-3 record and a league-leading 41
points, recording at least one point in all 22 games to surpass
the previous mark of 16 to start an NHL season. The Red Wings
are 10-8-4 for 24 points.  Detroit’s Tomas Tatar broke a scoreless tie with a goal two
minutes, 43 seconds into the third period yesterday at Joe Louis
Arena in Detroit. Patrick Kane kept Chicago’s run going with a
power-play goal with 2:02 left in regulation play.  After neither team could score in overtime, Pavel Datsyuk
and Damien Brunner missed for the Red Wings in the shootout, and
Jonathan Toews failed to score for the Blackhawks. Kane then
found the net for the visitors and Corey Crawford saved Henrik Zetterberg’s attempt to give Chicago the 2-1 win.  The  New York  Rangers beat the Buffalo Sabres 3-2 in a
shootout, while the Montreal Canadiens topped the Boston Bruins
4-3 to take over as the first place team in the Eastern
Conference at 14-4-4. The New York Islanders sent Ottawa to a
third straight loss, beating the Senators 3-2 in a shootout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
