The euro approached the lowest level
in almost three months against the dollar as Italy moved toward
a new election and before data this week economists said will
show the region’s economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Japan’s yen rose against all but one of its 16 major peers
as China’s CSI 300 Index of equities dropped by the most in two
years, boosting demand for haven assets. Australia’s dollar sank
to an almost eight-month low against its U.S. equivalent after
building approvals declined. European Central Bank policy
makers, led by President Mario Draghi, will meet on March 7,
while central banks from the U.K., Japan and Australia also
announce policy decisions this week.  “There’s a whole rash of reasons to be mindful of
uncertainty,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of foreign-exchange
strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London.
“People are rationalizing where they want to be positioned
throughout the mass of event risk this week and probably the way
to play it is with a long-dollar bias. The ECB’s language will
be monitored very closely.”  The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2988 as of 9:41 a.m. London
time, after touching $1.2967 on March 1, the lowest since Dec.
11. The yen gained 0.3 percent to 121.53 per euro and was little
changed at 93.58 per dollar.  The so-called Aussie slid 0.7 percent to $1.0129, after
falling to $1.0115, the weakest since July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
