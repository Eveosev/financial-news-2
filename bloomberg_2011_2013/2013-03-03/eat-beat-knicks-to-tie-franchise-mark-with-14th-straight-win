The  Miami Heat  tied a franchise
record with their 14th straight win, erasing a 14-point halftime
deficit in a 99-93 victory over the  New York Knicks .  LeBron James scored a team-high 29 points for the Heat, who
outscored the Knicks 54-34 during the second half yesterday at
Madison Square Garden to beat their Eastern Conference rivals
for the first time in three meetings this season.  “We came out with a sense of urgency in the third
quarter,” James, who added 11 rebounds and seven assists, said
in a televised interview. “It was a big-time game for us. There
was a lot of adversity but we were able to stick through the
tough patches and get a well-needed road win.”  The Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Los Angeles Clippers
108-104 yesterday in a matchup of Western Conference division
leaders as  Kevin Durant  scored 35 points and  Russell Westbrook 
added 29 points and 10 assists.  The San Antonio Spurs improved their NBA-best record to
47-14 with a 114-75 rout of the  Detroit Pistons , while the
Indiana Pacers topped the Chicago Bulls 97-92 in a meeting of
the top two teams in the Eastern Conference’s Central division.  Miami improved its East-leading record to 43-14 yesterday
in New York as  Dwyane Wade  had 20 points, eight rebounds and
eight assists, and  Chris Bosh  scored 14 of his 16 points in the
second half. The Knicks fell to 35-21 and lead the  Atlantic
Division  by three games over the Brooklyn Nets.  The Heat limited  Carmelo Anthony  to eight points in the
second half after he contributed 24 before halftime to avenge a
pair of earlier losses to the Knicks. New York opened the
regular season with a 104-84 win over the Heat and added a
112-92 road victory in December. The teams’ final regular-season
encounter is scheduled for April 2 in Miami.  Knicks’ Lead  The Knicks turned a five-point first-quarter deficit into a
59-45 halftime lead as they outscored Miami 20-8 in the final
five minutes of the second quarter.  A 14-4 scoring run for Miami cut the margin to four points,
with the Knicks making one of 10 shots to open the third
quarter. Anthony then added two free throws and a layup and J.R. Smith hit a 3-pointer to make it 70-59 to New York.  Trailing 77-73 at the start of the fourth quarter, James
made back-to-back 3-pointers to tie it at 79 points apiece.  With the teams tied 87-87, Wade hit a five-foot jumper to
give Miami the lead for good. It was part of a 12-4 run that
gave the Heat a 97-91 lead, their biggest advantage of the game,
with 1:06 remaining.  James assured Miami of a sixth straight road win with a
steal and dunk with 23 seconds left.  Miami’s run of 14 victories ranks second in the NBA this
season behind a 17-win run for the  Los Angeles Clippers . The
Heat’s last run of 14 consecutive victories came during the
2004-05 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
