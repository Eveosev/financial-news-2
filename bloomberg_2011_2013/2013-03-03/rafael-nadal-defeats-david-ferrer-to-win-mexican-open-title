Spain’s Rafael Nadal defeated
compatriot David Ferrer in straight sets in the final of
tennis’s Mexican Open yesterday for his second title in three
competitions since returning from injury.  He beat the three-time defending champion and world No. 4
6-0, 6-2 in 65 minutes in Acapulco for his 38th clay-court
title. Previously he’d come second in Vina del Mar,  Chile , and
won an event in Sao Paulo.  Nadal, now ranked No. 5, was out seven months with a knee
injury.  “I feel good being back on court,” he told reporters. “I
have to thank my family and everyone involved in my
rehabilitation. It has been a difficult time over the last few
months.”  Also yesterday, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic of  Serbia  beat
Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic 7-5, 6-3 to win the Dubai
Open.  Today, Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic defeated
Bethanie Mattek-Sands of the U.S. 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 in the final of
the WTA Malaysian Open.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
