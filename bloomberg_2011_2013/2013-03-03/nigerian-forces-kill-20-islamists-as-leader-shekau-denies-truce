Nigerian security forces killed 20
Boko Haram militants in a clash in the northeastern town of
Monguno, a day after their leader denied he agreed to a truce
with the government, a military spokesman said.  Troops destroyed three four-wheel-drive vehicles and eight
motorbikes and recovered weapons including rocket-propelled
grenades used by the attackers, Sagir Musa, a spokesman for the
joint military  task force  in charge of security in the region,
said today in an e-mailed statement. In a separate operation,
soldiers arrested two commanders of the militants, he said.  Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, which wants to
impose Islamic rule in  Africa ’s biggest oil producer, in an
audio statement e-mailed to reporters yesterday denounced a
cease-fire announced on Jan. 29 by Abu Mohammed Ibn Abdulaziz, a
self-proclaimed spokesman. “I will swear, I don’t even know
him,” Shekau said, adding that a truce isn’t possible while
security forces are holding his followers including “women and
children.”  Hundreds of people have died in the uprising started by the
Islamist group in 2009. Boko Haram, which means “Western
education is a sin,” has carried out bomb and gun attacks in
the mainly Muslim north and Abuja, the capital.  Nigeria ’s more
than 160 million people are almost evenly split between a mainly
Muslim north and a largely Christian south.  To contact the reporters on this story:
