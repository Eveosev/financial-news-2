Luke Guthrie and Michael Thompson
share the lead in the Honda Classic going into the final round
as each seeks his first PGA Tour victory.  Guthrie and Thompson are tied at 8-under 202 after three
rounds at PGA National Resort & Spa in Palm Beach Gardens,
 Florida . Thompson, who started the round one stroke behind
Guthrie, had an even-par 70 yesterday, while Guthrie carded a 71.  “I was confident I would come out here and keep playing my
game; just kind of keep plugging along,” Guthrie said in a
televised interview. “Tomorrow, same thing. I’m proud of the
way I handled myself.”  Thompson birdied the 18th hold to catch up to Guthrie after
the two traded leads several times.  “So that’s what I’ve done this week, just played really
smart golf and you know, try to continue to do it tomorrow and
hopefully I can hit the ball a little bit better tomorrow,”
Thompson said. “But you know, it is what it is, and I’m excited
to have another opportunity to play in the final group.”  Lee Westwood and Geoff Ogilvy are tied for third at 6-under,
while  Rickie Fowler  and Charles Howell III finished yesterday
three strokes off the lead.  Tiger Woods remained at even-par with his third consecutive
70 yesterday to go into the final round eight strokes behind.  “Realistically, if you play well, you can shoot about five
or six under par, there’s no doubt,” Woods said. “There’s some
accessible pins. The greens are perfectly smooth out there. They
are not that fast so you can be pretty aggressive.”
