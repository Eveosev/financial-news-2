Danica Patrick’s eighth-place finish
in the Daytona 500 is a boost for Nascar, a poll by Seton Hall
University said.  The survey found that 21 percent of respondents were more
interested in Nascar’s marquee event because Patrick started in
the pole position.  “Nascar can be very excited that one in five Americans
were more interested, something any sport would love to have,”
Rick Gentile, director of the poll, said in an e-mailed
statement. “That’s really a huge boost to the sport from a
single participant.”  Patrick, the first woman to start from the pole position
for a race in Nascar’s top series, topped the best previous
Daytona 500 finish for by a woman, by Janet Guthrie, who was
11th in 1980.  To contact the reporter on this story:
