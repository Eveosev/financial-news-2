Former National Basketball
Association star Dennis Rodman said North Korea’s dictator Kim
Jong Un asked him to get a message to President  Barack Obama 
that he’d like a phone call.  Rodman, speaking on ABC’s “This Week With  George
Stephanopoulos ” in his first interview since returning from
North Korea, quoted Kim as saying “If you can, Dennis -- I
don’t want to do war.”  Kim, Rodman said, “loves basketball. And I said the same
thing, I said ‘Obama loves basketball.’ Let’s start there.”  Rodman, who was in North Korea last week, is the first
American known to have met with Kim since he took charge of the
country following his father’s death in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
