New Orleans  issued a precautionary
boil water advisory for the eastern half of the city on the
 Mississippi River  for at least 24 hours, the city said in a
statement.  About 9 a.m. local time, the Sewerage & Water Board power
plant had an interruption in a boiler room, which caused a loss
of water pressure, the city said in the statement on its
website.  Water pressure has stabilized across most of the city, but
the boil water advisory remains in effect, New Orleans said. The
advisory covers areas of the city including the French Quarter
and Central Business District.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
