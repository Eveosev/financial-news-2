San Antonio Spurs leading scorer
 Tony Parker  will miss about four weeks with a left ankle sprain,
the National Basketball Association team said.  Parker, 30, underwent an MRI yesterday, one day after he
was helped off the court with a sprained ankle he suffered in
the third quarter of the Spurs 130-102 victory over the
Sacramento Kings.  Parker has averaged 21.0 points and 3.10 rebounds per game
this season in 56 games.  The Spurs also are likely to be without Boris Diaw who has
a low-back strain, Gary Neal with tightness in his calf and
 Stephen Jackson  with a sprained ankle when they meet the Detroit
Pistons tonight.  The Spurs are first in the league with a 46-14 record, two
games ahead of the  Miami Heat  (42-14).  To contact the reporter on this story:
