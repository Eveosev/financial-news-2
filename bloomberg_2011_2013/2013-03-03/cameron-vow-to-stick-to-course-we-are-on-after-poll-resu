The ruling  Conservative Party  is
determined to win the “battle for Britain’s future,” Prime
Minister  David Cameron  writes in an article in the Sunday
Telegraph.  It “is a battle we will win only if we reject the
cynicism, the political calculation and the easy ways out -- and
stick to the course we are on,” Cameron said in response to
last week’s Eastleigh by-election result in which his party came
third.  He said the battle for Britain’s future “will not be won
in lurching to the right, nor by some cynical attempt to
calculate the middle distance between your political opponents
and then planting yourself somewhere between them.”  The U.K. cannot build a “genuinely strong economy by
cutting yourself off from vital markets or new technologies, or
by backing off from vital decisions about infrastructure,
housing or planning,” he said.  “We are turning the tide on years of decline -- and
building a Britain for those who work hard and want to get on,”
Cameron writes. “And we need to go further. We need to get more
houses built. We need to build new roads and railways and energy
connections. Some reading this may not like that; but as I have
made clear, this is not a popularity contest but a battle for
Britain’s future.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
