Major League Baseball  and players’
union officials have been asked to discuss tougher penalties for
violators of the league’s drug policies, Commissioner  Bud Selig 
said.  Selig asked  Rob Manfred , baseball’s executive vice
president of labor relations, and MLB Players Association
Executive Director  Michael Weiner  to consider stiffer
disciplinary action for players who test positive for banned
substances.  “If people want to continue to do what they shouldn’t do,
then the one thing that you have to do is you have to have
stricter penalties,” Selig said yesterday at the Arizona
Diamondbacks’ training field in Scottsdale. “It’s as simple as
that.”  The current contract calls for a 50-game suspension for a
first-time violation, 100-game suspension for a second positive
drug test and a lifetime ban for a third offense.  Players are also subject to random in-season blood tests
for human growth hormone and baseline testosterone readings.  Selig declined to disclose any plans for future drug-
testing.  “The program is working fine, but I’ve come to the
conclusion, the more I’ve thought about this, that obviously
there’s some people, a small minority, who need to be given a
tougher lesson,” Selig said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
