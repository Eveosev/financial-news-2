AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC) , the Israeli company
whose Internet calling technology is used by  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , is
beating the biggest telecommunications companies on the Nasdaq
market on prospects demand for its products will boost sales.  Shares of AudioCodes  advanced  11 percent in February,
extending its rally in the past six months to 186 percent and
making the Lod, Israel-based company the  best performer  on the
Nasdaq Telecommunications Index. The  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity
Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest U.S.-traded Israeli equities in New York
dropped for a third week, led by Allot Communications Ltd. and
 Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)   AudioCodes, which supplies Internet voice call products to
Microsoft, is benefiting from plans by the world’s largest
software maker to catch up with Cisco Systems Inc. in the
Internet telephony and communications market, which  Forrester
Research Inc. (FORR)  predicts will reach $14.5 billion in 2015.
AudioCodes will probably report in 2013 the  fastest revenue
growth  in three years, according to Oppenheimer & Co.  “The Microsoft people are crazy excited about it, and
there is a real opportunity here for AudioCodes to make a name
for themselves,” Andrew Uerkwitz, an analyst at Oppenheimer,
said by phone from New York on Feb. 28. “This company really
had an identity crisis, and once AudioCodes got its strategy
figured out, investors came back to it.”  Shares of AudioCodes gained 0.1 percent to 15.30 shekels,
or the equivalent of $4.11, at the close in Tel Aviv today. The
benchmark TA-25 Index fell 0.4 percent to 1,216.09.  Internet Phones  AudioCodes plunged to a three-year low of $1.37 in August,
as sales slumped for  six consecutive  quarters. The company’s
focus on Microsoft’s Lync communications system has lured back
investors that had abandoned the stock as its price tumbled 45
percent during 2011 and 2012, Uerkwitz said.  Revenue from Microsoft’s Lync program, which offers
corporate phone, video and instant messaging services, grew 35
percent in the second quarter, according to a Jan. 24 earnings
call. The Redmond, Washington-based company has about 5 million
Lync users, with revenue from the segment nearing $1 billion.  Sales of AudioCodes’ Lync products, which range from
Internet handsets to call recording software, may grow as much
as 40 percent in 2013, Uerkwitz said.  The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge retreated 0.3 percent to
87.26 last week as the  TA-25 (TA-25)  index increased 0.3 percent to
1,221.47.  Allot, the Hod Hasharon, Israel-based maker of products
that track wireless traffic, declined 9.9 percent to $13.09 in
the week, making it the worst performer on the Bloomberg Israel-
US gauge. The shares in Tel Aviv dropped 8.4 percent to 48.75
shekels, or $13.10, today.  ‘Stopped Spending’  Procera Networks Inc. (PKT) , a U.S. competitor that also helps
cable companies and mobile operators report on network traffic,
plunged 32 percent last week as its fourth-quarter earnings and
revenue missed analysts’ estimates. Slumping growth at Fremont,
California-based Procera may signal a broader slowdown in the
industry, Wedbush Securities Inc. said.  “The customers have stopped spending temporarily,” Sanjit Singh, a New York-based analyst at Wedbush who rates  Allot (ALLT) 
shares neutral, said by phone on March 1. “It’s not that the
projects are going away, we just don’t know when they’re going
to land.”  Mellanox dropped 3.1 percent to $51.19 in its fourth
consecutive week of declines, while shares traded in Tel Aviv
slipped 0.4 percent to 191.5 shekels, or $51.39, in the week
ended Feb. 28. The stock was the  worst-performing company  on the
TA-25 Index in the last six months with a 59 percent plunge
through Friday. Mellanox shares gained 0.1 percent to 191.60
shekels, or $51.47, in Tel Aviv today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
