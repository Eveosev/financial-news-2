House Speaker John Boehner reported
no progress from what he called a “polite” though “very
frank” meeting with President  Barack Obama  over the automatic
spending cuts known as sequestration.  “I don’t think anyone quite understands how it gets
resolved,” said Boehner, speaking on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press.”  Boehner, who met March 1 with Obama and other congressional
leaders, blamed Democrats for the impasse over the “silly”
cuts. He also said Republicans will hold firm in their demands
for cuts in entitlement spending.  “I’ve been here for 22 years” and “I’ve watched leaders
from both parties kick this can down the road,” said Boehner.
“We’re out of road to kick the can down. We’ve got a long-term
spending problem that has to be addressed’” and “it is going
to be addressed.”  At the same time, Boehner said Republicans have no interest
in shuttering the government later this month when Congress will
have to approve budget legislation to keep federal agencies
running beyond March 27.  “We should not have any talk of a government shutdown so
I’m hopeful that the House and Senate will be able to work
through this,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
