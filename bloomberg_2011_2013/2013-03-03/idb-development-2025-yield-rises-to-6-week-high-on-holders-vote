IDB Development Corp.’s 2025 bonds
fell, pushing the yield to the highest in almost six weeks,
after the Israeli company’s bondholders voted in favor of taking
action on debt settlement plans.  Government bonds  rose.  The yield on IDB’s 987.7 million shekels of 4.95 percent
notes due December 2025 increased 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 13.98 percent, the highest since Jan. 21,
at the close in Tel Aviv. The yield on the 4.25 percent
benchmark government bonds due in 2023 fell three basis points
to 3.95 percent.  IDB Development bondholders authorized their joint
representative to act on debt restructuring and to take legal
steps as necessary as the company’s parent  IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) 
strives to avoid default. Standard & Poor’s Maalot in January
cut IDB Development’s rating to ilB from ilBB, saying it may
fall 1 billion shekels ($269 million) short of cash to cover
liabilities in 2014.  “IDB Development bondholders are starting to put pressure
on the company and the expectation is that they will join forces
with the holders of the parent company to find an overall
restructuring plan,” said Adar Etzioni, head of research at
Migdal Capital Markets Ltd., said by phone from  Tel Aviv . “This
will still mean some form of hair-cut for bondholders.”  IDB Development said today it is considering merger
opportunities for its IDB Tourism unit. York Capital Management,
the biggest IDB Development bondholder, suggested converting
more than half of IDB debt owed to bondholders and banks into
shares, Calcalist reported Feb. 10.  Meet Commitments  “The company reiterates that it has the resources to meet
all of its commitments and hopes the representative will use its
authority it received by bondholders responsibly,” IDB said in
an e-mailed statement today.  IDB Holding’s controlling shareholder Nochi Dankner is
seeking funds to avoid default on 2 billion shekels of debt. The
Israeli tycoon last year arranged an equity investment of as
much as $100 million from Argentine businessman Eduardo Elsztain
and sold an insurance company to a unit of  Warren Buffett ’s
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  for $221 million.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose 0.1 percent to 284.04.
Israeli funds raised a net 2.44 billion shekels in February,
Meitav Investment House Ltd. said today.  Corporate-bond funds
pulled in 1.82 billion shekels compared with 1.92 billion
shekels a month earlier, it said.  Average annual inflation expectations today increased one
basis point to 225, according to the two-year break-even rate,
the yield difference between the inflation-linked bonds and
fixed-rate government debt of similar maturity.  The shekel depreciated 0.2 percent to 3.7225 a dollar on
March 1. The currency fell 0.1 percent in February, according to
data by Bloomberg. One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of
investor expectations for rates over the period, declined one
basis point to 1.59 percent the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
