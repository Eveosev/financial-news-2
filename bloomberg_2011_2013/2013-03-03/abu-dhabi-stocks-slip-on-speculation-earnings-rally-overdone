Abu Dhabi  shares dropped to the
lowest level in almost a week as investors speculated a rally
this year prompted by higher 2012 results was overdone and after
crude  oil prices  fell in New York.  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , the lender whose shares have surged
16 percent year-to-date, declined 0.7 percent.  Sorouh Real
Estate Co. (SOROUH) , Abu Dhabi’s second-largest property developer,
dropped for the second time in three days. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
decreased 0.3 percent to 3,036.64 at the close in the United
Arab Emirates capital, its lowest level since Feb. 26. Dubai’s
 DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 0.4 percent.  Some of Abu Dhabi’s biggest listed companies including
First Gulf, whose 2012 net income grew 12 percent, posted full-
year profit that beat estimates. The earnings helped boost the
emirate’s gauge 15 percent this year, pushing the 14-day
 relative strength  index to 72. A reading above 70 indicates to
some analysts that a security or index is poised to drop. The
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  has declined 0.2 percent in 2013.  “After most companies announced their results and
dividends, traders who were in the rally to trade the news are
now taking profits,” said Nabil Rantisi, managing director of
brokerage at Abu Dhabi-based Menacorp.  ‘Further Upside’  Crude oil for April delivery fell 1.5 percent to $90.68 a
barrel in New York on March 1, the lowest settlement since Dec.
24, as manufacturing expanded less than forecast in China and
contracted in Europe, bolstering concern fuel demand will
decline. Gulf Arab oil exporters, including Qatar and the
U.A.E., supply about a fifth of the world’s oil. Abu Dhabi has
most of the nation’s oil reserves.  First Gulf, which recommended a  cash dividend  of 83 fils a
share for 2012, dropped the most since Feb. 26 to 13.35 dirhams
before closing at 13.45 dirhams. Sorouh, whose full-year net
income advanced 32 percent, decreased 1.1 percent to 1.88
dirhams, its weakest close since Feb. 26.  Both companies are poised to post better results this year,
with First Gulf set for a 7 percent increase in net income,
according to the  mean estimate  of 11 analysts on Bloomberg.
About  122 million shares  were traded in Abu Dhabi today,
compared with a 12-month daily average of 81 million.  “The market still looks good and there is room for further
upside,” Rantisi said.  Egypt Advances  Elsewhere in the Gulf Cooperation Council region, Bahrain’s
 measure  gained 0.7 percent and Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  and Kuwait’s
 gauge  climbed 0.2 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the
biggest companies in the GCC dropped 0.2 percent and Saudi
Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  fell 0.4 percent in Riyadh,
snapping a two-day gain. Qatar’s stock market was closed for a
holiday.  In North Africa, Egypt’s EGX 30 Index rose 0.2 percent, the
first advance in six days.  Orascom Telecom Media And Technology
Holding SAE (OTMT)  surged 9.5 percent to 0.69 Egyptian pound, the
highest level since July 16. The mobile phone operator’s board
recommended 1.35 billion pounds of dividend, or 26 piasters per
share, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  retreated 0.4 percent at the market
close in  Tel Aviv . The yield on the government’s benchmark 4.25
percent bonds due March 2023 lost two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.96 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
