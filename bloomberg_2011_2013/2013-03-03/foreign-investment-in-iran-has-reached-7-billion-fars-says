Iran  has attracted $7 billion in
foreign investment in the current Iranian year ending March 20,
 Fars  reported, citing Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar.  Mohammad-Najjar didn’t say which countries the investment
came from nor what projects they went to, according to the
state-run news agency’s report. The minister said foreign
investment was $5 billion the previous Iranian year. Iran
Economy Minister Shamseddin Hosseini in May put last year’s
figure at $4.3 billion.  Iran is under  United Nations , U.S. and European Union
sanctions over its nuclear program, which Western powers say may
be aimed at developing atomic weapons, a claim Iran denies.  Though their effects have been downplayed by Iranian
authorities, financial and trade restrictions limit
international companies’ involvement in Iranian business, have
weakened the country’s national currency and contributed to
accelerating inflation that nears 30 percent.  The  International Monetary Fund  is forecasting 0.8 percent
economic growth for Iran in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
