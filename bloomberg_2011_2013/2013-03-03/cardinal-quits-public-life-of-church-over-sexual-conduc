Cardinal Keith O’Brien, who was
Britain’s most senior Catholic cleric, said he plans to spend
the rest of his life in retirement after admitting sexual
conduct below the standards expected of a priest.  The cardinal, who resigned his post, said he will play no
further part in the public life of the Catholic Church in
 Scotland .  “In recent days certain allegations which have been made
against me have become public,” O’Brien said in a statement on
the church’s website. “Initially, their anonymous and non-
specific nature led me to contest them. However, I wish to take
this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my
sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me
as a priest, archbishop and cardinal.”  He said he apologized and asked forgiveness of those he has
“offended.”  “To the Catholic Church and people of Scotland, I also
apologize,” he said  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
