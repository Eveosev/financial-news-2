Austria’s ruling coalition parties
each won elections in two provinces, while candidates
representing billionaire  Frank Stronach ’s group appeared likely
to enter regional parliaments.  The conservative  People’s Party  got 55 percent of the vote
today in Lower Austria, the country’s second-most populous
province surrounding Vienna, according to the government’s
 website . The Social Democratic Party won in the southern-most
province of Carinthia for first time in 24 years, beating the
nationalist Freedom Party, the Austrian Press Agency reported.  Today’s results may be a bellwether for national
legislative elections in September. Social Democratic Chancellor
Werner Faymann currently leads the coalition government formed
with the People’s Party.  Stronach’s Team Stronach won about 9 percent of the vote in
each province, ensuring that his party will be able to obtain
seats in regional assemblies. Stronach, who amassed his wealth
at  Magna International Inc. (MG) , North America’s biggest car-parts
maker, has called for government austerity and currency reform.  Austria’s anti-immigrant nationalists lost support in both
elections, according to early results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
