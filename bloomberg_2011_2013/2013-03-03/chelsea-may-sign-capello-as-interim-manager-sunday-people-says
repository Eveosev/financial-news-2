Chelsea may sign former England
soccer manager  Fabio Capello  to oversee the team until the end
of the season, the Sunday People reported.  Current interim manager  Rafael Benitez  faces hostility from
some Chelsea fans. Last week he criticized supporters for booing
him and confirmed he will not be staying at the club beyond this
season.  Owner Roman Abramovich may move to replace him sooner, the
People said. Capello would be able to combine the short-term
role with his post as coach of the Russian national team, the
newspaper added without identifying its sources.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
