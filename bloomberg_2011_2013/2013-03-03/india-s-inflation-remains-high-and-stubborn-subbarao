India ’s central bank Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao comments on inflation and the outlook for
economic growth at a speech at the Indian Institute of
Technology in New Delhi today.  Inflation is currently just below 7 percent, while economic
growth is estimated at 5 percent in 2012-2013, the weakest pace
in a decade, the statistics agency forecasts.  “Inflation is still high and stubborn, the balance of
payments is under stress.  ‘‘Investment most worrying is in decline. A decline in
investment is a worry because today’s investment is tomorrow’s
production capacity.  ‘‘Has the world lost confidence in India? When will we
reach double digits and what should we be doing to get there? My
short answer to all those questions is that the India growth
story is still intact. We can get on track to double digit
growth.  ‘‘I also want to say that India’s growth story is not
inevitable. There is no concrete rule that India should grow in
double digits. We can only achieve growth and improve ourselves
by not just implementing economic reforms but governance reforms
in all sectors of the economy.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
