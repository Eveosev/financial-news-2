Princeton University  defeated
Dartmouth College 68-63 to overtake  Harvard University  in the
Ivy League Conference race for a spot in the NCAA menâ€™s college
basketball tournament.  Princeton (16-9, 9-2 Ivy) is one-half game ahead of the
Crimson (17-9, 9-3 Ivy), who lost 75-72 to  Pennsylvania . The
Tigers are on the road for their final three Ivy contests, while
Harvard will play its last two at home.  If the teams finish tied, they would meet in a playoff for
the second time in three seasons to earn a National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament berth.  Tyler Melville scored 23 points for the Big Green and Gabas
Maldunas added 17 at L. Stockwell Jadwin Gymnasium in Princeton,
 New Jersey .  Will Barrett led Princeton with 24 points, including five
3-pointers in the second half, and T.J. Bray contributed 21.  At Palestra in Philadelphia, Tony Hicks scored 24 points
and Darien Nelson-Henry added 18 for the Quakers (8-20, 5-6
Ivy).  Wesley Saunders led Harvard with 20 points followed by
Christian Webster with 16.  In other conference games last night, Brown beat Columbia
61-58 and Yale defeated Cornell 79-70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
