The Wimbledon men’s semifinal between
Andy Murray and  Poland ’s Jerzy Janowicz resumed after a 30-minute delay as the Centre Court roof was closed because of bad
light. The British player leads two sets to one.  The players left the court during the process, and then had
to warm up. Murray is leading 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 6-4. The winner of
the match will face 2011 champion Novak Djokovic, who overcame
Aregentina’s Juan Martin Del Potro in five sets in the longest-ever semifinal at Wimbledon earlier in the day.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
