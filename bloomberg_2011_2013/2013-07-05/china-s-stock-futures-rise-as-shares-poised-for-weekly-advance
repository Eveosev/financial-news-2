property firms and material producers overshadowed losses in
energy shares and drugmakers.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  climbed 4.1 percent after the developer’s
sales increased last month.  Zijin Mining Co. (601899) , the nation’s
largest gold producer by value, jumped the most since January

that has provided some relief to the market,” said  Wang Zheng ,

Management Co., which manages $120 million. “Upcoming economic
data won’t look good but most negative factors seem to have been
priced in. The market may be range-bound at this level.”  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 12 percent this year, as
data from industrial production to exports pointed to a
sustained slowdown in the economy and money-market rates reached
record highs. The index trades at 8.2 times 12-month projected
profit, after reaching the cheapest level in at least five years
last week,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Analyst Ratings  UBS AG lowered its rating on Chinese stocks to neutral in a

reduced its recommendation on the nation’s shares to underweight
from overweight as economic growth slows and the government
places more emphasis on reform.  The statistics bureau is scheduled to release June data on

rose to 13.5 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) from 13.3 billion yuan
a year earlier.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the second largest,

prolonged period,” Chia Song Hwee, head of the investment

actually looking at it as an opportunity to build on the
portfolio rather than shrinking it.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
