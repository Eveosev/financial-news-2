Derek Jeter  will resume playing in
games today as he nears the end of his comeback from a broken
ankle, the  New York  Yankees said.  The Major League Baseball team’s shortstop and captain will
play at least five innings for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, according to a news release from the Yankees.  Jeter, 39, broke the ankle in last year’s playoffs and re-fractured it in spring training.  Manager  Joe Girardi  said he wanted to see Jeter play
several minor-league games before committing to the player’s
return before the All-Star break begins July 15.  “I think he has to feel comfortable playing,” Girardi
said. “He really hasn’t had a whole lot of at-bats. He has not
played a whole lot of infield. So (we need to see him) being
able to go back-to-back days, back-to-back-to-back days -- that
sort of thing.”  Third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  began a rehab assignment with
one of the Yankees’ Class A farm clubs last week. Rodriguez is
coming back from hip surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
