Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD and its
gas units are being formally investigated by the European
Union’s competition watchdog over possible restrictions to key
gas infrastructures in the country.  The European Commission “has concerns that the Bulgarian
energy incumbent BEH and its subsidiaries may be abusing their
dominant market position on the natural gas markets in
 Bulgaria ,” the EU antitrust regulator said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The EU is separately probing OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural-gas monopoly, over terms in its long-term gas supply contracts
with EU countries. The EU has a string of cases, including the
BEH probe, that are “helping to foster a more competitive
energy environment” in central and eastern Europe, EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a  speech  in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
