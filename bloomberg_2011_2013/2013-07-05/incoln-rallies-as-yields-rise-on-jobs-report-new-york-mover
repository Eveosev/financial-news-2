Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) , the life
insurer with more than $200 billion in assets, gained the most
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as signs of stable U.S. jobs
growth pushed Treasury yields higher.  Lincoln  rose  3.3 percent to $38.21 at 10:32 a.m., the
highest intraday price since October 2008. Shares of the Radnor,
Pennsylvania-based company are up 48 percent this year.  Yields climbed as jobs growth that was higher than
analysts’ estimates fueled bets that the Federal Reserve will
begin to reduce its bond purchases. The 10-year Treasury yield
 rose  19 basis points to 2.69 percent, the highest level since
August 2011. Higher interest rates can boost profits for life
insurers, which invest premiums from clients in bonds and other
assets to back future payouts.  “LNC has elevated sensitivity to low interest rates”
because it makes most of its earnings on life insurance and
annuities,  Jay Gelb , an analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in a June
6 research note using the company’s ticker symbol. “LNC’s
valuation could have upside if interest rates continue to
rise.”  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life insurer, gained 1.5
percent to $46.96. The stock has advanced 43 percent  this year .  To contact the reporter on this story:
