U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains after government data showed the nation added more jobs
than forecast last month, bolstering optimism in the world’s
largest economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September jumped 1 percent to 1,625.00 at 8:31 a.m. in  New York .  Payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a second straight
month, the Labor Department reported today in Washington. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain
after a previously reported 175,000 increase in May. The jobless
rate stayed at 7.6 percent, while hourly earnings in the year
ended in June advanced by the most since July 2011.  Economic growth amid monetary stimulus from the  Federal
Reserve  has helped send the  S&P 500  up 139 percent from its
bear-market low in 2009, including a 13 percent rally so far
this year. The benchmark index has slipped 3.2 percent from its
last record on May 21 after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the central bank could begin to reduce bond purchases should the
employment market show sustainable growth.  The S&P 500 has risen 0.6 percent so far this week, heading
for its second consecutive weekly gain.  While U.S. markets were closed yesterday for the
Independence Day holiday, European shares rallied the most in
two months as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
predicted that interest rates will remain low for an extended
period of time.  In the U.K., the Bank of England signaled that it will
leave interest rates at a record low for longer than investors
had expected.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
