Magnums of 1976 wine from  Chateau
Petrus , one of the two highest-priced producers in Bordeaux’s
Pomerol region, go on sale at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  wine auction in London
this month, along with Chateau Latour 1982 and vintage Burgundy.  Five magnums of Chateau Petrus are estimated to fetch as
much as 8,000 pounds ($12,200) at the sale on July 17, according
to the auction house’s website. Two magnums of Latour 1982 carry
a top estimate of 4,600 pounds.  The auction comes after the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of
top Bordeaux vintages has risen 5 percent this year, with a 3
percent decline since mid-March following a gain of 8 percent in
the previous 10 weeks.  Other leading wines in the sale include Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1986, Burgundies from La Tache and Romanee-Conti
spanning six decades and wines from  Spain ’s Vega Sicilia
vineyard.  Separately, Bonhams is holding a London sale on July 11
which includes a two-bottle lot of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
1959 with an upper estimate of 3,200 pounds and a single bottle
of Echezeaux 1985 Henri & Georges Jayer Burgundy with a top
estimate of 3,000 pounds.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
