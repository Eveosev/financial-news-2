The Greek ambassador to the
Netherlands, Teresa Paraskevi Angelatou, said she’s optimistic
that euro-area finance ministers will approve the next aid
payment to  Greece  when they meet in Brussels on July 8.  “The mobility of civil employees is the only open issue”
in the Greek government’s talks with the so-called troika that
oversees euro-area bailouts, Angelatou said in an interview in
The Hague yesterday. The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairs meetings of his euro colleagues.  Angelatou’s comments echoed those made yesterday by Greek
Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras, who said progress had been
made with the troika on all issues and the aim was to reach a
political agreement on the next aid payment on July 8. Talks
with the troika will continue until July 7 if needed, he said.  European officials this week raised the possibility of
breaking Greece’s next aid payment into smaller tranches.
Angelatou said that while there have been discussions about
breaking the payment into three installments, Greece would
prefer to have the money all at once.  To contact the reporter on this story:
