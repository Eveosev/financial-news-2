Dana Holding Corp. (DAN)  climbed to a
record, capping a week of gains for the maker of car and truck
axles after an expanded stock buyback and an analyst’s upgrade
of his rating on the company.  Shares of the Maumee, Ohio-based company rose 4.9 percent
to $21.06 in  New York , the highest closing price since Dana
exited bankruptcy in 2008. Dana has surged 35 percent this year,
compared with an 18 percent increase in the Russell 2000 Index.  Dana’s board approved an expanded stock buyback program of
as much as $1 billion, the company said June 28. The shares
climbed 5.8 percent that day. They have posted intraday gains
each trading day and are headed for their fourth daily increase
since the announcement. Joseph Spak, an analyst for  RBC Capital
Markets , upgraded Dana stock to outperform in a July 1 report,
increasing his price target to $24 from $18.  “Investors are essentially being ‘paid to wait’” for a
recovery in shipments of Class 8 trucks, the backbone of
interstate hauling, Spak wrote in the July 1 report.  “They are clearly now utilizing their strong balance sheet
to drive  shareholder value ,” he wrote of Dana.  The analyst also projected Dana’s 2014 profit margin before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 11.7 percent,
slightly lower than the company’s 12 percent target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
