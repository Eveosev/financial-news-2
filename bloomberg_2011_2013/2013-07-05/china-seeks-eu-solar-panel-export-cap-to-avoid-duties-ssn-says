China  is proposing to limit exports
of solar panels to the European Union to 10 gigawatts a year to
avoid antidumping tariffs, the Shanghai Securities News said.  China is asking the EU to reduce or remove duties on panels
within the limit and pledged to keep prices at or above 50 euro
cents ($64 U.S. cents) a watt, the newspaper said, citing Wang Sicheng, a researcher at the Energy Research Institute, an
adviser to the government.  Chinese solar-panel output is about 20 gigawatts a year,
Wang said. The institute is under the National Development and
Reform Commission, Chinaâ€™s top economic planning agency.  China is seeking to remove EU tariffs of 11.8 percent on
panels from more than 100 Chinese solar companies including
 Yingli Green Energy Holding (YGE)  Co. and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  The rate is
scheduled to increase to an average of 47.6 percent should
Chinese and EU officials fail to resolve the dumping dispute.  China said last month it would provide easier financing for
solar manufacturers and seek to stimulate domestic demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
