Brazil ’s shorter-term swap rates fell
after a report showed inflation slowed in June more than
analysts forecast, damping speculation that the central bank
will increase borrowing costs at a faster pace.  Swap rates due January 2015 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 9.72 percent at 10:09 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. The real depreciated 0.7 percent to 2.2644 per  U.S.
dollar , extending its decline this week to 1.5 percent.  Consumer prices rose 0.26 percent in June after a 0.37
percent increase in the prior month. The rate was lower than the
0.33 percent median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. While annual inflation of 6.70 percent exceeded the
6.50 percent upper level of the central bank’s target range, it
was slower than the 6.77 percent median forecast.  “Even though it went through the ceiling of the central
bank’s target, it confirms the scenario that rates will be hiked
by 50 basis points,”  Andre Perfeito , the chief economist at
Gradual, said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
