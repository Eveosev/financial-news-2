Idemitsu Kosan Co. (5019) , a Japanese
refiner, plans to conduct a drilling survey for geothermal power
at a national park in northern Japan, public broadcaster NHK
reported today.  The company and partners won local approval for the survey,
NHK said on its website, citing unidentified Akita prefectural
officials. Details about the partners werenâ€™t provided.  The survey will start as early as this month at the
Kurikoma national park in Yuzawa city, Akita prefecture,
according to NHK.  Idemitsu,  Inpex Corp. (1605)  and Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. plan
to develop geothermal power at Kurikoma, according to a brochure
on geothermal by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
released in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
