Center  Dwight Howard  will sign a
free-agent contract with the Houston Rockets, spurning efforts
by the Los Angeles Lakers to keep him there, USA Today reported.  The newspaper, citing an unidentified person with knowledge
of Howard’s decision who requested anonymity because the
decision has not yet been announced, said today that the three-time National Basketball Association defensive player of the
year chose Houston over the Lakers,  Dallas Mavericks , Golden
State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks.  Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban  told reporters today in an e-mail that “we are out of the DH sweepstakes.”  The Warriors have agreed with free-agent guard  Andre Iguodala  on a four-year, $48 million contract, Yahoo Sports
reported earlier today.  The 27-year-old Howard, a seven-time All-Star, was regarded
as the top free agent this offseason. The 6-foot-11 center has
averaged 18.3 points, 12.9 rebounds and 2.2 blocked shots a game
during his nine-year career.  The Lakers were able to offer Howard a contract worth $118
million over five years, the NBA’s maximum. The most money other
teams could give him was $88 million over four years.  NBA players can agree on contracts, though they can’t sign
until July 10, when the league’s moratorium on trades and
signings is lifted.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
