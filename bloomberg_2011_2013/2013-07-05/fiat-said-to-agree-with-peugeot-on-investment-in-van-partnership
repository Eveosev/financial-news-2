Fiat SpA (F)  and  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) 
agreed to share investment in the development of new delivery
vans that will be produced in  Italy , according to four people
familiar with the matter.  The two carmakers will split costs to develop a new version
of a full-sized van, which will be built at the SevelSud plant
in central Italy, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the agreement hasn’t been made public. Fiat
has scheduled an announcement at the plant for July 9 without
providing details. Fiat and Peugeot representatives declined to
comment.  Fiat and Peugeot, which currently cooperate at SevelSud on
assembly of the Fiat Ducato, Peugeot Boxer and Citroen Jumper
models, agreed in May 2011 to end a similar partnership to make
mid-sized delivery vans in  France . Paris-based Peugeot plans to
invest more than 750 million euros ($962 million) to produce a
new model on its own to keep the SevelNord plant open.  The cooperation at the SevelSud joint venture factory in
Val Di Sangro, Italy, runs to 2019, according to the companies.
Marchionne confirmed last week that Fiat will present “new
investments” for the plant as part of its strategy to revamp
vehicle production in Italy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
