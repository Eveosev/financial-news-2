Treasury 10-year notes tumbled the
most in almost two years after stronger-than-forecast employment
growth stoked speculation the Federal Reserve will begin to
reduce the size of its asset purchases.  Yields climbed to the highest levels since August 2011 as a
Labor Department report showed the economy added 195,000 jobs in
June, compared with the median forecast of 165,000 in a
Bloomberg News survey. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last
month policy makers may “moderate” their bond-buying program
this year and may end it mid-2014 if growth meets forecasts. The
 rate to exchange  floating for fixed-rate payments for 30 years
rose above the yield on similar maturity Treasury bonds for the
first time since August 2009.  “Everybody is in the camp that the Fed is going to do
something -- the question is when,” said Michael Franzese,
senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man
Capital Markets in New York.  The 10-year note  yield  increased 24 basis points, or 0.24
percentage point, to 2.74 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the highest yield and
biggest climb since August 2011. The 1.75 percent note maturing
in May 2023 fell 1 30/32, or $19.38 per $1,000 face value, to 91
1/2.  The yield on the  30-year bond  rose 22 basis points to 3.7
percent, the highest level since August 2011.  The U.S. bond market was closed yesterday for a public
holiday.  Swap Spread  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index closed at 117.89, the
highest level since December 2010. The one-year average is 63.6.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, rose to $411.8 billion
from $241.4 billion on July 3 when the U.S. market closed at 2
p.m. New York time. The 2013 average is $322.5 billion.  The 30-year swap spread moved above zero in a continuation
of the rise that has taken place over the past year as Dodd-Frank Act regulations increased costs for swap transactions and
made Treasury securities an attractive alternative.  The spread was 2.75 basis points, after being as much as
negative 12 basis points on June 19.  Worst Performance  Treasuries in May and June lost 3.2 percent, their worst
two-month performance since the first two months of 2009 when
they lost 3.6 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes
show. U.S. government securities declined 2.5 percent in the
first half of the year, their worst start since 2009 when they
dropped 4.5 percent, the indexes show.  An improving  economy  is dimming the lure of bonds as a
haven. The Conference Board’s Consumer  Confidence (CONCCONF)  index rose in
June to 81.4, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey and
the highest since January 2008, the New York-based private
research group said June 25. Home prices have  increased  12
percent since April 2012, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller
Composite index.  “It is a strong report that does keep the Fed on the taper
trail,” Tony Crescenzi, executive vice president at Newport
Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co., said
of the employment data in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. said the Federal Open Market Committee will begin tapering
sooner than they had expected after today’s Labor Department
report.  Quantitative Easing  “The labor market has continued to improve,” Bernanke
said at his June 19 press conference. “Job gains, along with
the strengthening housing market, have in turn contributed to
increases in  consumer confidence  and supported household
spending.”  The unemployment rate for June remained at 7.6 percent
compared with the Bloomberg News survey of economists forecast
of 7.5 percent. The economy has added an average of 189,000 jobs
this year through May, the fastest pace since 2005 when it
created 207,000 positions per month, Labor Department data show.  The central bank has been buying $85 billion in bonds
monthly, a policy known as quantitative easing, to cap borrowing
costs and stimulate the economy. It has kept its target rate at
the zero to 0.25 percent level since December 2008.  “Expectations for a September taper are being completely
priced in,” Shyam Rajan, an interest-rate strategist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “The market’s expecting a smaller
balance sheet going forward.”  Demand Falls  The Fed on July 10 will release minutes of its June 18-19
policy makers’ meeting.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged
yesterday to keep interest rates at a record low for an
“extended period.”  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a revised 1.8
percent annualized rate from January through March, down from a
prior estimate of 2.4 percent, the Commerce Department said June
26. The economy will grow 1.9 percent for 2013, according to the
median forecast of 86 economists in a Bloomberg News survey in
June, down from last year’s 2.2 percent increase.  A measure of demand at the U.S. Treasury Department’s debt
auctions has fallen this year to the lowest level since 2009 as
a drop in bond prices generates the biggest losses on government
securities in four years.  Investors bid $2.94 for each $1 of the $1.077 billion of
notes and bonds sold by the Treasury this year, compared with a
record high $3.15 of bids last year. It’s the first decline in
demand at the auctions since 2008, when the U.S. government
increased note and bond offerings 59 percent to $922 billion as
the recession and the financial crisis deepened.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in three-year notes, $21
billion in 10-year debt and $13 billion in 30-year notes on
three consecutive days starting July 9.  “The supply will be absorbed fairly well because of where
rates are right now,” Franzese of ED&F Man said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
