(Corrects third paragraph of story published July 5 to
remove reference to injunction against Sunovion.)  Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s
bronchitis and emphysema drug Brovana infringed  Mylan Inc. (MYL) ’s
patents, a judge ruled.  Sunovion also agreed not to raise any claims about the
validity and enforceability of Mylan’s patents, U.S. District
Judge  John Koeltl  said in an order dated July 1 in  New York .  “The making, using, offering to sell and selling of
Brovana has infringed” five Mylan patents, Koeltl said.  A unit of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan sued
Sunovion’s predecessor company in 2007 to block the introduction
of  Brovana , which Mylan said infringed patents for a spray to
open bronchial passages.  Sunovion, based in Marlborough, Massachusetts, is a unit of
Osaka, Japan-based Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co.  The case is Dey v. Sepracor, 07-cv-02353, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
