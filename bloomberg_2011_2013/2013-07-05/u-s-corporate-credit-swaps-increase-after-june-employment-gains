A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
rose after a better-than-forecast jobs report stoked speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will begin to curtail asset purchases that
have bolstered credit markets.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
1.5 basis points from July 3 to a mid-price of 86.7 basis points
at 9:18 a.m. in  New York , according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure reached as low as 82 basis points before
the Labor Department report was released at 8:30 a.m. Markets in
the U.S. were closed yesterday for the Independence Day public
holiday.  Investors are looking at employment figures to assess the
strength of the economic recovery and determine when the Fed may
trim its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. The U.S. jobless
rate held at 7.6 percent in June, according to a Labor
Department report today in  Washington . Payrolls grew by 195,000
workers for a second straight month. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain after a previously
reported 175,000 increase in May.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
