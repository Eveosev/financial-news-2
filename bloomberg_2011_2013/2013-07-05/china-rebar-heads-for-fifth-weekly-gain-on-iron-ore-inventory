Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  headed for a fifth weekly gain, the best run in six
months, amid a rally in iron ore and a decline in domestic
inventory.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to 3,638 yuan ($594) a
metric ton and was at 3,626 at 10:14 a.m. local time. The most-active contract has gained 2.6 percent this week and is poised
for the longest streak of weekly gains since Jan. 4.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in  China 
rose for a sixth day yesterday, adding 1.2 percent to $122 a dry
ton, the highest since May 23, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
The raw material is a key ingredient for steel production. Rebar
 inventory  tracked by Shanghai’s Steelhome Information Technology
Co. fell 26 percent last quarter.  “Higher production costs and a steady destocking process
in rebar inventory are positive signs,” Lv Xiaohua, an analyst
at Everbright Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai today.
“Demand in the second half will improve.”  The reduction in inventory over the past few months should
reduce downside risks, Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts led by
Graeme Train said in a report yesterday.  The average spot price for rebar in China gained 0.4
percent to 3,386  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
