Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a spot
cargo from Trinidad & Tobago, ship-tracking data show.  The Hispania Spirit, with a capacity of about 138,000 cubic
meters, is en route to Rio de Janeiro, according to
transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. It was
scheduled to arrive July 2.  The vessel sailed from Atlantic LNG Co.’s Point Fortin
terminal, where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and
departed on June 23.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Petrobras, as the
Brazilian state oil company is known, has a floating
regasification terminal at Guanabara Bay near Rio de Janeiro.  Petrobras will import as many as 60 cargoes this year, up
from 56 in 2012, the company said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
