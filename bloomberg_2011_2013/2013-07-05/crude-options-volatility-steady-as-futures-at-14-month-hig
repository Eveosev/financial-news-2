Crude options volatility held steady
near the highest level since April as continued unrest in  Egypt 
and U.S. job gains propelled futures to a 14-month high.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options, was 24.18 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 4 p.m., down from 24.33 percent on July 3.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery advanced
$1.98, or 2 percent, to $103.22 a barrel on the Nymex, the
highest settlement since May 2, 2012. Volatility has jumped from
19.7 percent on June 28 as crude surged 6.9 percent, the largest
weekly gain since February 2011.  Crude rose today as the U.S. added more jobs than forecast
in June amid concern supplies would be disrupted by political
turmoil in Egypt. Clashes in Egypt between security forces and
Islamist supporters of deposed President Mohamed Mursi left five
dead and 20 wounded. Mursi, the countryâ€™s first democratically
elected president, was deposed by the military on July 3.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
