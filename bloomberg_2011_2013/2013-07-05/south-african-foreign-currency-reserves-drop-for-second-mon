South African gold and foreign-currency reserves dropped for a second month in June after the
price of bullion fell and the central bank increased swap
transactions.  Gross reserves  dropped 2.4 percent to $47 billion, the
Pretoria-based central bank said on its website today. That was
lower than the $47.6 billion median estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Net reserves declined to $44.6 billion
from $45.4 billion.  “The decrease in the gross reserves mainly reflects
valuation adjustments emanating from the significant decline in
the U.S. dollar gold price and an increase of foreign exchange
swaps conducted for liquidity management purposes,” the central
bank said.  Gold slumped 11 percent last month to as low as $1,180.57
an ounce on June 28. It was trading at $1,241.32 as of 7:22 a.m.
in  London .  The central bank has been building reserves to act as a
buffer against currency volatility. The rand has dropped 16
percent against the dollar this year, the most of 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The rand fell 0.1 percent to 10.0471 against the dollar as
of 8:22 a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
