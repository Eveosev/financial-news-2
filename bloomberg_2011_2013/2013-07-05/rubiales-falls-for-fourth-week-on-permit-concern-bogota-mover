Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC) , the
operator of  Colombia ’s largest oil field, headed for its fourth
weekly drop as it awaited permits needed to add to output.  The shares declined 2.3 percent to 32,920 pesos at 12:01
p.m. in Bogota, which would be the lowest closing level since
March 2010. The stock extended its weekly slump to 3.7 percent.
The Colcap index fell 0.7 percent today.  The company plans to seek renewal of its contract for the
namesake Rubiales field, which expires in 2016, and is awaiting
environmental permits for work in an adjacent area.  “The big problem with Pacific Rubiales has been these
permit delays,” said Ray Zucaro, who helps oversee $350 million
of emerging-market debt at SW Asset Management in  Newport Beach ,
 California . “They’ve done a great job acquiring assets, putting
them together, building a beautiful little company, and you
don’t see it reflected in current valuations.”  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Pantin said in a February
interview that he is confident that his company will retain the
license after 2016 because of its success drilling in the
Rubiales field. A company official didn’t reply to an e-mailed
request for comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
