The Canadian dollar fell to the
lowest point in almost two years as stronger-than-forecast U.S.
job growth prompted speculation the  Federal Reserve  will proceed
with its plan to start winding down monetary stimulus this year.  The nation’s currency weakened even as  Canada  lost fewer
jobs than projected in June, hanging on to much of the gain of
the previous month, which saw the biggest jump in a decade. U.S.
job creation picked up with 195,000 positions created in June
from 175,000 the month before. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
had predicted 165,000 new jobs. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said June 19 reductions in the Fed’s bond-buying program, which
tends to devalue the currency, will depend on improvements in
the job market.  “It’s the U.S. number we’re trading off at the moment and
it’s the U.S. where policy is in the balance,” said  Adam Cole ,
head of G-10 currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, by phone
from  London . “People will feel more secure in the idea that
tapering starts before the year is out.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, fell 0.8
percent to C$1.0599 at 10:31 a.m. in Toronto, touching its
lowest since Oct. 4, 2011. One loonie buys 94.35 U.S. cents.  Bonds Fall  Yields on Canada’s benchmark 10-year  bonds  rose to their
highest point in almost two years. The 1.5 percent security
maturing in June 2023 lost C$1.01 cents to C$90.99, with yields
rising 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 2.54
percent, the highest since August 2011.  The  Bank of Canada  will auction C$3.4 billion ($3.2
billion) of five year notes with a coupon of 1.25 percent on
July 10.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s largest export, rose 0.7
percent to C$101.93 per barrel in  New York  and the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks added 0.2 percent.  Canada lost 400 jobs in June after adding 95,000 the month
before. Economists had predicted a 7,500 decline in a Bloomberg
survey with 20 responses. Canada’s job gains have slowed so far
this year, with the average monthly gain of 14,000 less than the
27,000 recorded in the second half of last year, Statistics
Canada said.  Full-time employment fell by 32,400 in June, following a
76,700 gain the prior month. Part-time positions rose by 32,200,
 Statistics Canada  said.  Private companies cut 5,300 workers last month after May’s
94,600 increase, while public-sector employment rose by 1,000.  Policy Rate  The Bank of Canada will hold the benchmark  interest rate  at
1 percent for the rest of the year, according to all but one of
24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Traders are pricing in 5.6
basis points of tightening by the Bank of Canada’s Dec. 4
meeting, calculations based on trading in overnight index swaps
show.  The central bank’s next rate decision is July 17.  The U.S. jobless rate stayed at 7.6 percent, while hourly
earnings in the year ended in June advanced by the most since
July 2011. The Fed’s next policy meeting announcement is July
31.  “There’s no doubt in my mind that quantitative easing
phasing out will start this fall and will finish probably next
spring,” said Clement Gignac, chief economist at Industrial
Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc., by phone from
 Quebec City . “When you have the oil price at 100 bucks and the
Canadian dollar at C$1.06 that tells you it’s more a U.S. story
than a made in Canada story.”  The cost to insure against declines in the loonie versus
its U.S. peer rose from its lowest point in two weeks. The
three-month so-called 25-delta risk reversal rate rose to
1.6450, after hitting 1.6125 yesterday, its lowest since June
20. Risk reversals measure the premium on options contracts to
sell Canadian dollars versus buying U.S. contracts that do the
opposite.  The Canadian dollar has risen 0.8 percent in the past three
months against nine developed nations currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Index. The Australian dollar has
posted a 9.3 percent drop, while the  U.S. dollar  has jumped 5.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
