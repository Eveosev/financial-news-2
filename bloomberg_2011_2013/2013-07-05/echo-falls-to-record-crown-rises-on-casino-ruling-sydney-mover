Echo Entertainment Group Ltd. (EGP) ,
operator of Sydney’s only casino, fell to a record after the New
South Wales government backed  Crown Ltd. (CWN) ’s plan to open a rival
site nearby, on the shore of the city’s harbor.  Echo fell 5.2 percent to A$2.76, the lowest close since the
Brisbane, Australia-based company was spun off from  Tabcorp
Holdings Ltd. (TAH)  in 2011. Trading volume was almost four times the
three-month average. Crown rose 3.2 percent to a two-week high.  Adding a second casino in Sydney would undermine the long-term viability of Echo’s existing Star complex, Chief Executive
Officer John Redmond said in an April 8 interview. New South
Wales state premier Barry O’Farrell selected Crown’s proposal
yesterday to advance to the final stage of a government project
approval process, rejecting Echo’s rival plan, which would have
extended a license lapsing in 2019 that gives the company
exclusive rights to run a casino in the city.  The decision “increases the prospect of increased
competition in the New South Wales casino market,” Adam Alexander, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. Sydney will be the first Australian
city to have more than one casino once Crown’s facility is
built.  Crown’s development will cause Echo to lose about 20
percent of revenue from high-rolling VIP gamblers and about 15
percent from other table games, Alexander wrote. Trading halts
imposed on the companies’ stock ahead of the announcement
yesterday were lifted this morning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
