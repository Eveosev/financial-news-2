German 10-year bunds declined,
pushing yields up the most in almost two weeks, as a U.S.
payroll report showing employers added more jobs than economists
forecast damped demand for safer assets.  Finnish and Dutch securities also fell as the report stoked
speculation an improving U.S. labor market will allow the
Federal Reserve to reduce asset purchases. Portugal’s bonds rose
after Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said his government
will still have the support of a coalition partner even after
the leader of the party resigned as a minister this week.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s pledged yesterday
to keep interest rates low for an extended period.  “It’s a pretty strong report and the bond market is going
down,” said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European interest-rates
strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “The European
markets are holding up. The biggest move is in the Treasury-bund
spread which is what you would expect in an environment where
Draghi is nailing down the front end.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 4:45 p.m. in  London , the
biggest increase since June 24. The 1.5 percent bond maturing in
May 2023 dropped 0.62, or 6.20 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,283)
face amount to 98.04.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 19 policy makers
may “moderate” asset purchases this year and may end them
mid-2014 if economic growth meets their forecasts. Draghi
pledged yesterday to keep interest rates at a record low for an
“extended period.”  Spread Widens  Treasury 10-year yields climbed 19 basis points to 2.70
percent, increasing the extra yield over similar-maturity German
bunds by 12 basis points to 98 basis points, the most since
September 2006 based on closing prices.  U.S. payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a second month in
June, the Labor Department said in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain after a
previously reported 175,000 increase in May. The jobless rate
stayed at 7.6 percent.  The yield on  Finland ’s  bond maturing  in April 2023 climbed
five basis points to 1.98 percent, and the rate on Dutch 10-year
securities increased five basis points to 2.10 percent.  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest among euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Germany and  France ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Portugal Bonds  Portuguese bonds pared a seventh weekly decline after
Passos Coelho held meetings with CDS party leader Paulo Portas
yesterday to try to shore up support for the government.  Portas’s resignation “was a personal decision that does
not involve the CDS party’s support for the government,” Coelho
told reporters. “A way will be found to guarantee the
government has political support from the CDS party and in that
manner ensure political stability. As head of government I will
now seek from the two parties a reinforcement of political
support for the government.”  Portugal’s  10-year yield  dropped 15 basis points to 7.12
percent after climbing above 8 percent on July 3 for the first
time since November. The rate has still increased 68 basis
points this week, the most since the period ended July 27, 2012.  Pimco’s View  Portuguese five-year yields don’t accurately reflect the
risks of the nation’s political crisis, high-debt load or the
possibility of it needing additional aid, according to Pacific
Investment Management Co.  “The clear risk is that additional official support is
conditional on some burden-sharing with bond holders,” Myles Bradshaw, a fund manager at Pimco in London, wrote in an e-mailed statement. “The additional 600 basis points of spread
for owning five-year Portuguese bonds rather than bunds offers
insufficient reward for these high risks.”  Portugal’s  five-year  yield fell nine basis points to 6.48
percent, narrowing the  difference  over similar-maturity German
securities to 584 basis points. The spread expanded to 601 basis
points this week, the widest since November 2012.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.2 percent this
year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. Portuguese bonds dropped 1.1 percent and Austrian
securities dropped 0.7 percent  To contact the reporter on this story:
