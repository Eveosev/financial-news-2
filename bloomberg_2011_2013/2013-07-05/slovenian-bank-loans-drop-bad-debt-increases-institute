Slovenian banks including Nova
Ljubljanska Banka d.d. continued to reduce lending and their bad
debt rose further in May amid the country’s second recession
since 2009, the government’s economic institute said.  Total lending fell 200 million euros ($258 million) in May,
bringing the decline to 850 million euros in the first five
months of 2013, the  Institute  for Macroeconomic Analysis and
Development said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The pressure with maturing debt owed to institutions
outside Slovenia increased in May and there are liquidity
pressures tied to household deposits,” the institute said.
“The quality of loan portfolio continues to worsen.”  Slovenia came to the fore of  Europe ’s debt crisis in March
after Cyprus’s bailout put the focus on the Adriatic nation’s
financial industry. Slovenians withdrew a combined 423 million
euros from banks in March and April, according to the central
bank, while the yield on the benchmark dollar-denominated bond
due in 2022 surged to a record 7.5 percent on June 24.  The government has pledged to help its banks, offering to
transfer bad loans to a state agency and increase capital of its
three biggest lenders, including NLB, by 1.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
