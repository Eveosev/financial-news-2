China’s net gold imports from  Hong
Kong  increased 40 percent in May from a month earlier as the
metal’s deepening slump continued to attract bargain hunters to
bullion shops.  Mainland buyers purchased 106 metric tons during the month,
after deducting flows from China into Hong Kong, compared with
76 tons a month earlier, according to calculations by Bloomberg
based on data from the Hong Kong government today. Inbound
shipments including scrap were 127 tons, from 75.6 tons a year
earlier and 126.1 tons in April.  Gold dropped 6 percent in May after falling into a  bear
market  in April amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve would rein
in stimulus that helped bullion cap a 12-year bull run. Mainland
investors took the rout as an opportunity to snap up jewelry,
coins and bars, while some consumers bought gifts early for
festivals and weddings later in the year, according to the  China 
Gold Association.  “Demand was quite strong in May with people rushing to
gold shops because they thought prices had hit bottom,” Bruce
Liu, gold trader at ANZ Bank China Co., said by phone from
 Shanghai  today.  Bullion of  99.99 percent  purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange fell 5 percent in May, dropping for a fourth month, and
was at 252.99  yuan  a gram ($1,283 an ounce) today. In  London ,
gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,234.27 an ounce, 26
percent lower this year.  Perth Mint  Exports of gold to Hong Kong from China were 21 tons in
May, according to a separate Statistics Department statement,
down from 50.2 tons in April, and compared with 32.7 tons in May
2012.  There are signs interest has slowed in other countries.
Gold sales from  Australia ’s Perth Mint, which refines nearly all
of the bullion mined in the country, declined for a second month
in June as the falling prices deterred buyers.  The  U.S. Mint  sold 57,000 ounces of American Eagle gold
coins in June from 70,000 ounces in May and 209,500 ounces in
April, according to data on its website. In  India , the largest
user last year, imports may drop 52 percent in the third quarter
after government curbs, according to the All India Gems &
Jewellery Trade Federation.  Trading of spot bullion of 99.99 percent purity on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange, China’s biggest market for bullion for
immediate delivery, exceeded 20 tons every day from April 16
until May 3, when gold had its biggest drop in 33 years in the
two days through April 15.  Biggest Consumer  Volume reached a record 43.3 metric tons on April 22. It
climbed above 20 tons for two days through June 21 during the
latest price decline, according to the exchange.  China may pass India as the largest bullion consumer as
early as this year after the government in  New Delhi  raised
 import taxes  while regulators in Beijing made investing in the
metal easier, the China Gold Association said.  China approved its first two domestic exchange-traded
products backed by gold last month. Huaan Asset Management Co.
and Guotai Asset Management Co. are began marketing the ETFs to
the public on June 24 and will close subscriptions on July 12.  China’s domestic gold consumption was 776.1 tons in 2012,
down from 779.8 tons the previous year, according to the
producer-funded World Gold Council. China and India account for
more than half of global demand.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
