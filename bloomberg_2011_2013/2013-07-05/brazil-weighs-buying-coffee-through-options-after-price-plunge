Brazil is considering introducing
coffee options allowing growers in the world’s top producer to
sell beans to the government at a fixed price after futures
plunged in  New York , according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  A decision to help growers through option contracts will be
made by the end of August at the latest, Gerardo Fontelles,
secretary of production and agroenergy for the Agriculture
Ministry, said in an interview at a conference in  London  today.
Discussions between the agriculture and finance ministries will
start as soon as a measure to compliment growers’ income is
approved, he said. Arabica coffee, down 15 percent in 2013, is
heading for a third year of declines, the longest slump since
1993.  Brazil will announce a program “soon” to subsidize coffee
growers by paying them the difference between the minimum price
of 307 reais ($137) a bag for arabica coffee and the market
price, Fontelles said. The amount of coffee the government may
buy through option contracts will depend on the harvest and how
other measures boost growers’ income.  The government approved a record 3.16 billion reais of
subsidies last month to expand storage and invest in
plantations.  Brazil  will harvest 48.6 million bags of coffee in
2013, a record for a year in which trees enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year cycle, Conab, the government’s crop
forecasting agency, estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
