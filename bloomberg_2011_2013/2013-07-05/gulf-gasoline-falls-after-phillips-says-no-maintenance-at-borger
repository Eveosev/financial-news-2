U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened
versus New York futures after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  said no planned
maintenance is under way at the Borger, Texas, refinery.  The discount for  conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB,
slid 0.25 cent to 20.5 cents a gallon below futures on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:52 a.m., widening for the first
time in five days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  dropped 0.5 cent to a 14.75-cent discount.  Phillips 66’s Borger plant conducted fluid catalytic
cracker work in June, the company said. No work was being done
as of July 3.  A government report earlier this week showed gasoline
 stockpiles  in the Gulf grew by 1.73 million barrels to 77.9
million in the seven days ended June 28. That’s the second
consecutive gain and the highest level since Feb. 8, according
to Energy Information Administration data.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , gained 58 cents to
$13.97 a barrel. The same spread based on Light Louisiana Sweet
oil rose 58 cents to $7.62 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
