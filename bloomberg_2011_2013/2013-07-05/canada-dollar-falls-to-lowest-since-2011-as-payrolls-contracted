The Canadian dollar weakened past
C$1.06 per  U.S. dollar  for the first time since October 2011 as
the country lost jobs in June, adding to speculation the Bank of
Canada may end its leaning toward raising  interest rates .  The currency fell to the lowest level since October 2011
against its U.S. counterpart as Canada lost 400 jobs in June
after adding 95,000 the month before,  Statistics Canada  reported
today. A Bloomberg economist survey had called for the country
to lose 7,500 jobs. The jobless rate was unchanged at 7.1. The
U.S. created 195,000 jobs in June, exceeding the 165,000 called
for in a Bloomberg survey. The Bank of Canada, which has
included language warning of rate increases in policy statements
for more than a year, will make its next rate decision July 17.  “It would likely contribute to the market’s possible
expectations that the tacit hawkish bias the Bank of Canada now
could be guided more dovishly,”  Jack Spitz , Toronto-based
managing director of foreign exchange at National Bank of
Canada, said before the report. “The reaction would be one of
disappointment from a monetary policy perspective in Canada.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, fell 0.9
percent to C$1.0607 per U.S. dollar at 8:37 a.m. in Toronto. One
loonie buys 94.28 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
