Swiss stocks  advanced, with the Swiss
Market Index rising for a second day, as investors awaited a
U.S. report that may show the unemployment rate fell in the
worldâ€™s largest economy last month.  The  SMI (SMI)  climbed 0.5 percent to 7,866.77 at 9:27 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark has  fallen 6.4 percent  since
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 that the
central bank may reduce its bond buying if the  U.S. economy 
recovers in line with its forecasts. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also added 0.5 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 31 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., a report at 8:30 a.m. in Washington may show
that employers added 165,000 jobs in June after a 175,000 gain
in May, according to the median forecast of 90 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The unemployment rate probably fell to
7.5 percent, according to the survey.  A sustained improvement in the labor market may influence
when and how quickly the  Federal Reserve  starts to scale back
its $85 billion monthly asset purchases as part of its monetary
stimulus program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
