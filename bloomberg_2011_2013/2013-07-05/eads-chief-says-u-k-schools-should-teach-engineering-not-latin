The U.K. should start teaching
engineering at schools, with qualifications available at age 16
and 18, the chief executive officer of  European Aeronautic,
Defence and Space Co. ’s British arm said.  Robin Southwell told reporters in London today that
engineering courses at school could help encourage women to
study the subject. Business Secretary Vince Cable is supportive
of the idea, according to a person familiar with his thinking.  “It’s only when you’re applying to university that you
come across engineering, and only then in specialist areas,
mechanical engineering or aeronautical engineering,” Southwell
said. “Encourage women and girls to get involved at an early
stage. Why not? My son was asked to do Latin. What a stupid,
stupid thing. I’d drop Latin and do engineering. That would have
a better effect creating value.”  Southwell said there was also a shortage of aeronautical
engineering university courses, meaning that he struggled to
recruit as many people as he wanted. He said EADS runs the
largest U.K. engineering apprenticeship course at its Broughton,
Wales plant, where it makes wings for Airbus SAS planes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
