The U.S.  Internal Revenue Service  has
proposed a change in tax rules to ease the impact on investors
should the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission force some
money-market mutual funds to abandon their fixed $1 share price.  The plan, outlined in a  notice  posted July 3, would exempt
small losses on the sale of money-fund shares from the wash-sale
rule, which prohibits investors from recognizing a loss when
selling a security if they repurchase the same security within
30 days.  “Tracking wash sales of money-market fund shares will
present shareholders of floating-NAV money-market funds with
significant practical challenges,” the agency said in the
notice. “Therefore, it is in the interest of sound tax
administration” to not treat redemptions from money funds as a
wash sale, the IRS said.  SEC commissioners on June 5 approved a proposal aimed at
making money funds less susceptible to runs that could
destabilize the short-term credit markets in which they invest.
One of the options in the proposal would require institutional
funds that invest in corporate debt to drop their $1 share price
for a floating price that tracks the market value of their
holdings.  The IRS invited public comment on the proposal through Oct.
28. The plan falls short of addressing an industry concern that
floating-value funds would introduce record-keeping burdens by
making small gains and losses taxable transactions, Joan
Swirsky, an attorney at Philadelphia law firm Stradley, Ronon,
Stevens & Young LLP, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
