The pound slumped below $1.50 to the
weakest level in more than three months against the dollar amid
speculation the  Bank of England  is ready to add more stimulus
that tends to weaken a currency.  Sterling posted its biggest two-day decline since September
2011 versus the greenback after the central bank under new
Governor Mark Carney signaled yesterday it will keep  interest
rates  at a record low for longer than investors anticipated. The
pound extended losses today after a U.S. report showed employers
in the world’s largest economy added more jobs in June than
analysts forecast, attracting investors to America’s currency.
U.K. government bonds fell.  “Carney caught the market unawares,” said Jane Foley, a
senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in London.
“He was attempting to ensure that market expectations remain
more focused on the U.K. economy than on the U.S. He wanted to
draw attention to the fact that the recovery is very nascent,
very fragile. That leaves the pound weaker.”  The pound fell 1.1 percent to $1.4914 at 4:43 p.m.  London 
time after dropping to $1.4858, the lowest since March 12. It
slid 2.4 percent in the past two days, the biggest two-day drop
since Sept. 21-22, 2011. The U.K. currency declined 0.4 percent
to 86.05 pence per euro after depreciating to 86.33 yesterday,
the weakest since April 17.  ‘Not Warranted’  The Bank of England in a policy statement yesterday said
the recent increase in market interest rates “was not warranted
by the recent developments in the domestic economy.” It said
it’s studying whether to pursue more formal guidance and the
analysis due for release next month will have “an important
bearing” on August’s policy discussions.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee kept its
benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent and its
asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds.  “ Monetary policy  looks likely to ease further,” Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. analysts Noah Weisberger and Aleksandar Timcenko in  New York  wrote today in a note to clients. “The BOE
is to consider more explicit forward guidance at its next
meeting in August,” and guidance tied to economic performance
may be adopted, they said.  The pound has weakened 1.8 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar strengthened 8 percent, the best
performer, and the euro gained 4.8 percent.  Payrolls Increase  U.S. payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a second month,
the Labor Department reported today in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a 165,000 gain after a
previously reported 175,000 increase in May. The jobless rate
stayed at 7.6 percent.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 19
that U.S. policy makers may start to trim bond purchases before
the end of the year as unemployment falls.  The pound will decline below $1.46 in the next month on
dollar-friendly U.S. data, said  Peter Frank , global head of
currency strategy at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA
in London.  The probability of a decline to that level in the next
month is 47 percent, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  Benchmark gilt yields rose the most in almost two weeks as
the improving U.S. data reduced demand for safer assets.  The 10-year yield climbed 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 2.48 percent, the biggest increase since
June 24. The 1.75 percent gilt due in September 2022 fell 0.78,
or 7.80 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.055.  U.K. government bonds handed investors a loss of 3.1
percent this year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg
World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped 1.2 percent and
Treasuries declined 2.9 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
