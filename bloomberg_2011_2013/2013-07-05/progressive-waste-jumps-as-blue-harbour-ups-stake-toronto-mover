Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd. (BIN) , the
largest publicly traded garbage company in Canada, surged the
most in almost two years after investor Blue Harbour Group LP
boosted its stake in the company.  Progressive Waste, based in Vaughan, Ontario, climbed 4.9
percent to C$23.38 at 4 p.m. in Toronto for the biggest gain
since August 2011. The stock has risen 8.9 percent this year.  In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, Greenwich, Connecticut-based Blue Harbour
said today it had paid $130.8 million to raise its stake in
Progressive Waste to 5.6 percent, the third-largest  investor  in
the company.  The fund had held a 3.9 percent position in Progressive
Waste prior to this purchase, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Our approach is only to invest in companies where we like
and respect the management team,” Clifton S. Robbins, chief
executive officer with Blue Harbour, said in a June 18
interview. Blue Harbour manages $1.6 billion in assets. “We’re
exclusively collaborative. Over nine years we’ve never done a
proxy contest, we’ve never sued a company, we’ve never taken a
publicly adverse position to our management teams.”  Progressive Waste operates across six provinces in  Canada 
and in 10 states across the northeastern and southern U.S. Can
slot this in.  “Blue Harbour Group has been a very supportive shareholder
in our company and we appreciate their ongoing confidence in our
business and management team,” Chaya Cooperberg, a spokeswoman
for Progressive Waste, said in an email.  To contact the reporter on this story:
