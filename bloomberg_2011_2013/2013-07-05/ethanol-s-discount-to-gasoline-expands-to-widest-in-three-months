Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded to the widest differential in three months on
speculation that above-average seasonal prices will attract
imports and help replenish stockpiles.  The spread, or price difference, gained 13.36 cents to
50.48 cents a gallon. Ethanol  imports  have averaged 19,000
barrels a day this year, up from 8,000 a year earlier, the
Energy Information Administration said July 3. Stockpiles last
week declined 5.2 percent to 15.4 million barrels, the lowest in
records going back three years.  “Ethanol spreads continue to be well-bid on Wednesday’s
DOE stock draw, but traders are expecting substantial imports on
the next report,” said Justin Dirico, manager of the biofuels
desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 3.2 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.392 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 9.2 percent in 2013 and are above the five-year average for this time of year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The July contract expired at $2.467 on July 3.  Gasoline for August delivery advanced 5.86 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.8968 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  fell 2.5 percent to 863,000 barrels a
day in the week ended June 28, the EIA, the Energy Department’s
research arm, said. That’s down 10 percent from the record
963,000 barrels a day in December 2011.  Corn Prices  Corn for July delivery climbed 6.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
$6.8475 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively-traded December
corn contract fell 11.5 cents to $4.9125 a bushel.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was minus 2
cents based on July futures, down from break-even on July 3 and
compared with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The U.S. tracks compliance with government mandates for
ethanol blending with Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
certificates attached to each gallon of the biofuel. Refiners
can submit the credits or trade them.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 2 cents to $1.02, data
compiled by Bloomberg show, while  advanced RINs , which cover
biodiesel or Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were unchanged
at $1.08.  In cash market trading, ethanol gained 5.5 cents to $2.44 a
gallon in  Chicago , 4.5 cents to $2.505 in New York, 2 cents to
$2.63 on the West Coast and 1.5 cents to $2.47 on the  Gulf
Coast , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf widened 0.5
cent to 16 cents, the largest differential since June 24, while
Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed 1 cent to 6.5
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
