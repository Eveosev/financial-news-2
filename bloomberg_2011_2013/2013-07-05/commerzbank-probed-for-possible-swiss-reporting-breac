Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest bank, is being investigated by  Switzerland ’s market
regulator over the possible breach of reporting obligations for
two structured products.  SIX Exchange Regulation  is seeking to determine whether
Commerzbank was late in submitting interest-rate fixings for two
floating reverse convertibles traded on the Scoach Switzerland
index, the Zurich-based watchdog said in a statement on its
website today.  Commerzbank, which has listed about 540 structured products
on the index, made interest payments on the products for the two
periods in due time, according to the statement.  “There was no damage or hassle for investors,” the bank
said today in a statement on its website. “Commerzbank emitted
hundreds of structured products on Scoach over the years for
which SIX’s reporting obligations were always respected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
