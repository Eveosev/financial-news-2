India ’s rupee completed its ninth
weekly drop, the longest losing streak in a year, after foreign
funds continued to pull money from the nation’s debt as the
Federal Reserve prepares to phase out its stimulus.  Overseas investors cut  holdings  of rupee bonds by $562
million in the first three days of this week after withdrawing a
record $5.4 billion in June, exchange data show. Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke signaled last month $85 billion a month of debt
buying, which has fueled funds flows to  emerging markets , could
be tapered this year and ended in 2014. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
cut its rupee forecast, saying India may find it tough to lure
capital to offset its record current-account deficit.  “The worsening funding environment for emerging markets
could continue to put currencies which have high current-account
deficits, such as the rupee, under pressure,”  Tushar Poddar , a
Goldman economist in Mumbai, wrote in a report released
yesterday. “Capital outflows from debt have had a large impact
on the rupee.”  The Indian currency fell 1.4 percent this week to 60.2400
per dollar in Mumbai, the worst performance in Asia, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It dropped 0.2
percent today, and touched a record low of 60.765 on June 26.
Goldman sees the rupee at 60 per dollar in 12 months, compared
with an earlier prediction of 56. It will depreciate to 62 by
end-2014, the lender forecasts.  Yield Spread  The rupee pared losses today, after earlier dropping as
much as 0.8 percent, on speculation the central bank sold
dollars, two traders said, asking not to be named as the
information isn’t public. The Reserve Bank of India intervenes
only to manage volatility and doesn’t have an exchange-rate
target or band, Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, rose 35 basis points,
or 0.35 percentage point, this week to 12.86 percent. It rose 21
basis points today.  India’s 10-year sovereign debt offers a premium of 493
basis points over U.S. Treasuries, down from this year’s high of
622 on April 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
shortfall in the Asian nation’s broadest measure of trade rose
to an all-time high of 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in
the year ended March 31, official data show.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 1.9 percent this
week to 61.41 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts dropped 1.3
percent to 61.48. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets
at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled
in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
