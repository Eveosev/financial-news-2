U.K. stocks  declined, paring their
biggest weekly gain in six months, after better-than-estimated
U.S. non-farm payrolls data stoked speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will begin to reduce the size of its asset purchases.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group, the world’s biggest
mining companies, fell at least 3 percent.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  dropped
2.8 percent after UBS AG downgraded the owner of the Costa
Coffee chain. British Land Co., the U.K.’s second-largest real
estate investment trust, advanced 1.2 percent after saying it
bought commercial property in London for 470 million pounds
($707 million).  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slid 46.15 points, or 0.7 percent, to
6,375.52 at the close of trading in London, paring its weekly
advance to 2.6 percent, the most since Jan. 4. The gauge has
still lost 6.8 percent since the Federal Reserve signaled that
it may start to taper its stimulus program if the  U.S. economy 
improves in line with its forecasts. The FTSE All-Share Index
slipped 0.7 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index tumbled 1.6
percent today.  “The short-term trend in payroll growth is back near
200,000 and right at the Fed’s perceived bogey,”  Tom Porcelli ,
chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York, wrote
in a note. “While we still think October is most likely when
the Fed will announce tapering, this report means an increased
risk of an earlier taper.”  U.S. Employment  Treasury yields rose to the highest level in almost two
years after a U.S. Labor Department report showed that employers
hired 195,000 workers in June, compared with the 165,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Payrolls in May
also rose a revised 195,000, from an earlier reading of 175,000.
The  unemployment rate  stayed at May’s level of 7.6 percent.
Economists had projected 7.5 percent.  BHP Billiton retreated 3.6 percent to 1,666.5 pence and  Rio
Tinto  dropped 4.4 percent to 2,636 pence. A gauge of mining
shares in the FTSE 350 tumbled 4.6 percent, the most in two
weeks. Fresnillo Plc declined 5.8 percent to 886.5 pence as the
price of silver, the metal it produces, fell in London.  Whitbread slipped 2.8 percent to 3,106 pence after UBS
lowered its recommendation on the shares to neutral from buy,
saying the retailer’s new initiatives do not change the near-term earnings outlook.  A  gauge of banking shares  in the FTSE 350 Index reversed
earlier gains, declining 0.5 percent.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) 
fell 1.8 percent to 1,470 pence and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc lost 2.6 percent to 276.7 pence.  British Land increased 1.2 percent to 591.5 pence after
saying it bought buildings and development sites near London’s
Paddington Station from Aviva Plc and other investors. The
company said it will own about 1 million square feet (93,000
square meters) of Paddington Central’s 1.6 million-square feet
space once the development is completed.  Redrow Plc (RDW)  rallied 3.2 percent to 245.6 pence as Deutsche
Bank AG increased its 12-month share-price estimate and profit
forecasts for 2013 and 2014. The U.K. builder yesterday jumped
the most in five months after saying pretax profit for the year
ended June will beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
