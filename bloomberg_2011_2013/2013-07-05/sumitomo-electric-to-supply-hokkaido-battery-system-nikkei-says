Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. (5802) 
will supply a storage battery system for  Hokkaido Electric Power
Co. (9509) , the Nikkei newspaper reported today without saying where it
got the information.  The company’s system, which will have 60 megawatt hours of
storage capacity, will be set up at a substation to expand the
utility’s grid capacity, according to the paper.  Mitsuyo Tsuruta, a Sumitomo Electric spokeswoman, declined
to comment, saying that the Osaka-based company isn’t the source
of the information.  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said in April
that it will set up a storage system after the utility received
applications for large-scale solar projects that would exceed
the grid’s capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
