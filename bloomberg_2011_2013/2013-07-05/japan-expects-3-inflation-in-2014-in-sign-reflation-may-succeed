Japanese consumers’ inflation
expectations remained at 3 percent for a second quarter in June,
in a sign that  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s
reflationary drive may be succeeding.  People expect prices to climb 3 percent over the next 12
months, the same as in March, according to the median result in
a Bank of  Japan   survey  released today in Tokyo. The indicator
doesn’t include the effects of a planned increase in the  sales
tax  to 8 percent in April from the current 5 percent.  Kuroda is counting on unprecedented monetary easing to
encourage spending and credit demand. The nation is still far
from achieving the bank’s 2 percent inflation target in 2 years,
with  consumer prices  falling or unchanged in the 13 months
through May.  “Japan’s deflation will turn into inflation,” Shuichi Obata, senior economist at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo, said.
“The problem is reaching the inflation target in 2 years.”  Banks including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. raised
 mortgage rates  for a third straight month in July. McDonalds
Holdings Co. Japan announced this week it would sell a limited
range of burgers at 1,000 yen ($9.97), its most expensive ever
offering.  The survey is conducted quarterly and includes questions on
economic conditions, consumption and employment. It’s one of
several  indicators  of inflation expectations and was conducted
from May 10 to June 5, with 2,273 people responding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
