Hungary  rejected European Parliament
criticism of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s consolidation of
power and accused the legislature of violating its sovereignty.  European lawmakers “wantonly” set new criteria for the
nation and overstepped their authority, Hungary’s parliament
said in a resolution proposed by Orban’s ruling Fidesz party and
passed today. It was also backed by the  Christian Democrats  and
the nationalist Jobbik party.  “We call on Hungary’s government not to yield to European
Union pressure, not to allow the impairment of the country’s
rights guaranteed by the basic treaty and to continue its
policies of making Hungarian families’ lives easier,” lawmakers
said, according to a copy of the resolution posted on
parliament’s  website .  Orban is eroding the rule of law, the EU’s legislature said
July 3, urging Hungary to change disputed legislation “as
swiftly as possible” to comply with the 28-member bloc’s
regulations. Orban said Hungary is being singled out unfairly,
telling parliament yesterday that the EU is “unjust, employs
double standards and abuses its power.”  The U.S. and the  United Nations  have joined the EU in
criticizing Orban, who’s ousted the chief justice of the  Supreme
Court , set up a media regulator led by Fidesz appointees and
used a two-thirds legislative majority to push through a new
constitution.  The EU’s “misuse of power against Hungary” is driven by
business interests after the country hurt international energy
companies by cutting household energy prices in January,
according to today’s resolution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
