The Australian and New Zealand
dollars failed to extend gains from yesterday against the
greenback before U.S. jobs data that may add to the case for the
 Federal Reserve  to pare back stimulus.  The Aussie rose against most of its major peers yesterday
as global stocks gained after the  European Central Bank  and  Bank
of England  indicated looser monetary policy. Australia’s
currency was 0.4 percent from the lowest since November 2008
against New Zealand’s dollar.  “The Aussie managed to emerge a little stronger after the
ECB and Bank of England both indicated that they were inclined
to loosen policy as needed,” said  Sean Callow , a senior
currency strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Sydney. The U.S.
payrolls data is “always a lottery as far as the number that
hits the screens. The kiwi has still been a much stronger
performer than the Aussie in recent weeks, but on the day it’ll
just watch the global mood.”  Australia’s dollar was little changed at 91.43 U.S. cents
at 4:45 p.m. in Sydney from yesterday, when it climbed 0.7
percent. It touched 90.37 on July 3, the lowest since September
2010. The Aussie added 0.2 percent to 91.68 yen. For the week,
Australia’s currency is little changed against the greenback and
has gained 1.2 percent versus the yen.  The Aussie traded at NZ$1.1699 from NZ$1.1678 yesterday,
after dropping to NZ$1.1653 on July 3, the weakest since
November 2008. The kiwi dollar declined 0.2 percent to 78.19
U.S. cents from yesterday, and was set for a 1 percent weekly
gain. It was little changed at 78.40 yen today.  Fed Tapering  The Labor Department will probably say the U.S. added
165,000 jobs in June after boosting nonfarm payrolls by 175,000
in the prior month, according to the median economist forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey before today’s report. The  jobless
rate  likely declined to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent in May.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 19 that U.S.
policy makers may begin slowing bond purchases this year if the
economy achieves sustainable growth.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday in Frankfurt the
central bank planned to keep the euro area’s main refinancing
rate at a record-low 0.5 percent or even lower for an “extended
period” and that it was injecting a “downward bias in interest
rates for the foreseeable future.”  The BOE said in a statement yesterday in London the
“implied rise in the expected future path of  bank rate  was not
warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy”
after officials left the bank’s benchmark rate and bond-purchase
program unchanged.  Shares Gain  The MSCI World Index of shares rose 0.5 percent yesterday,
while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 2.3 percent. MSCI’s Asia
Pacific Index increased 0.6 percent today.  The Aussie slid to an almost three-year low after  Reserve
Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  said on July 3 the
central bank board deliberated for a long time before its
decision to hold the key  interest rate  unchanged at a record low
2.75 percent the day before. Deputy Governor  Philip Lowe  said
yesterday the market misinterpreted the governor’s comments.  Swaps data compiled by Bloomberg show traders see a 48
percent chance the RBA will lower its key rate to 2.5 percent at
its next meeting on Aug. 6, compared with a 30 percent
likelihood indicated a week ago.  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year government bond rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.82 percent.  -- Editors: Garfield Reynolds, Rocky Swift  To contact the reporters on this story:
