Employees of Bay Area Rapid Transit,
the commuter train system that carries 400,000 riders a day
across  San Francisco , agreed to end their four-day strike while
negotiations on a contract continue.  The transit authority, known as BART, and worker unions
agreed late yesterday to extend the current contract for 30
days. Train service will resume by 3 p.m. today, with limited
charter bus service running in the morning and evening, BART
said in a statement on its website.  The strike, which began July 1 and forced thousands to
commute by car, bus or ferry, and thousands more to stay home,
was the first in 16 years for the system. The two sides’
differences “remain unresolved,” BART General Manager Grace
Crunican said in the statement.  “Despite lots of hard work, BART and its unions have
failed to come to an agreement on contract issues that matter to
all of us today and into the future,” Crunican said. “We still
have a wide gap of disagreements to bridge over the next 30
days.”  The trains were shut down by the  Service Employees
International Union , representing mechanics and clerical
workers, and the Amalgamated Transit Union, which includes train
operators and station agents, after their contracts expired June
30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
