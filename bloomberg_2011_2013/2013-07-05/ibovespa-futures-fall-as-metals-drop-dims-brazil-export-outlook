Ibovespa  futures  declined as lower
metal prices dimmed the outlook for Brazilian raw-material
producers.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the mining company controlled
by the billionaire  Eike Batista , may move after it suspended
iron-ore output at one of its mines for six months to reduce
spending. Fibria Celulose SA and Suzano Papel & Celulose SA may
be active after Banco Itau BBA SA raised both pulp producers to
the equivalent of buy.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August dropped 1.3
percent to 44,905 at 9:55 a.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier
rising.  Brazil ’s main equity gauge has slumped 25 percent this
year, the worst performance after  Peru ’s Lima General index
among 94 stock benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg. The real
weakened 0.7 percent to 2.2653 per dollar today. The Bloomberg
Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index sank 1.4 percent.  The Ibovespa  trades  at 11.3 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for the next four quarters, compared with 9.9 for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.
Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 4.6 billion reais
yesterday, when U.S. markets were closed for the Independence
Day holiday. That compared with a daily average of 7.91 billion
reais this year through July 3, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
