Wheat rose for the third straight
session, heading for the longest rally in a month, on signs of
improving demand for inventories from the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter. Corn and soybeans fell.  Exporters sold 120,000 metric tons of soft-red winter
wheat, grown in the eastern Midwest and used in pastries and
animal feed, to  China  for delivery in the 12 months that began
June 1, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a statement
today. On July 3, the USDA announced a sale of 360,000 tons of
wheat to China.  “China’s always been the big player in soybean markets,
and now they’re in buying wheat,” Jamey Kohake, a broker and
branch manager at Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake ,  Kansas ,
said in a telephone interview.  Wheat futures for September delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$6.6575 a bushel at 9:17 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. A
gain today would mark the longest rally since June 4. The price
through July 3 dropped 15 percent this year on speculation that
world production would increase. The market was closed yesterday
for the Independence Day holiday.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.1 percent to
$4.9725 a bushel in Chicago. The contract through July 3 was
down 16 percent in 2013 on speculation that global growers will
produce a record crop. Soybean futures for November delivery
slid 0.4 percent to $12.46 a bushel on the CBOT.  Hot, dry weather is expected in the U.S. Midwest for the
next six to 10 days, benefiting some corn and soybean plants
that are behind normal development for this time of year because
of cool, wet conditions, according to forecaster DTN. As much as
six times the normal amount of rain has fallen in the past 30
days in parts of Iowa, Illinois and  Indiana , National Weather
Service data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
