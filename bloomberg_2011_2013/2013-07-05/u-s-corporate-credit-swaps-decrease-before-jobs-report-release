A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell as investors await a report that may show the unemployment
rate fell last month.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
1.6 basis points to a mid-price of 82.4 basis points at 7:57
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are looking to the Labor Department report to
assess the strength of the economic recovery and determine when
the Federal Reserve may trim its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases. The 8:30 a.m. release in  Washington  will probably
show that the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7.5 percent in
June, matching its lowest level since 2008, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Payrolls grew by 165,000
workers, after rising 175,000 in May, the median of 91
projections shows.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
