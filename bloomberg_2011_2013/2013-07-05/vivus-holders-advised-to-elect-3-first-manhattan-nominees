Vivus Inc. (VVUS) ’s largest stockholder,
First Manhattan Co., said three of the nine directors it
nominated to the drugmaker’s board are being recommended for
approval by proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.  ISS advised investors to vote for  Alex Denner , Michael Astrue and David Norton at Mountain View, California-based
Vivus’s July 15 annual meeting. The “recommendation falls short
of what Vivus’ stockholders need to fix the company: an
immediate and complete change of leadership,” Sam Colin, senior
managing partner at First Manhattan, said in a statement.  First Manhattan, which holds 9.9 percent of the outstanding
stock, has criticized Vivus’s handling of early sales of the
obesity drug Qsymia and said that the board hasn’t acted
independently. Vivus said today that another advisory firm,
 Glass Lewis , recommended shareholders reject First Manhattan’s
slate of nominees to the board.  “As recognized by both Glass Lewis and ISS, the Vivus
board and management team have made substantial progress in
laying the foundation for Qsymia and have a clear plan to build
a successful brand,” Vivus said in its statement. “Vivus’s
progress has not gone without notice.”  Vivus shares have sunk 53 percent since Qsymia was approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2012. The stock
declined 2.2 percent to $12.31 on July 3.  Earlier this week, First Manhattan said Anthony Zook, a
former  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  executive, had agreed to serve as chief
executive officer of Vivus if First Manhattan gained control of
the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
