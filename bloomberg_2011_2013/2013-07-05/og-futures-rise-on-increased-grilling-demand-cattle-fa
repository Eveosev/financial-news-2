Hog futures climbed for the second
straight session on speculation that demand for U.S. pork will
remain strong heading into the Fourth of July weekend. Cattle
fell.  Meatpackers processed 1.27 million hogs this week as of
July 3, up 5.2 percent from a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Independence Day is the most  popular  day
for outdoor cookouts, according to the Hearth, Patio and
Barbecue Association.  “If demand stays strong, the futures can stay strong,”
Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview from  Michigan .  Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.5 percent to 97.35
cents a pound at 10:36 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Prices were up 13 percent this year through July 3.  Cattle futures for August delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$1.2185 a pound on the CME. Prices are down 7.8 percent this
year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.3
percent to $1.5145 a pound.  The markets were closed yesterday for the Independence Day
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
