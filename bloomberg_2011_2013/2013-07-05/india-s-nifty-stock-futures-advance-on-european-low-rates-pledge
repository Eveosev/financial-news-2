Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures gained,
signaling benchmark indexes may extend yesterday’s rally, after
European policy makers indicated record low borrowing costs will
be maintained.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for July delivery rose 0.8
percent to 5,880 at 10:34 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. climbed
1.1 percent to 5,836.95 yesterday, the biggest advance since
June 28. The S&P BSE Sensex gained 1.2 percent to 19,410.84. The
Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares
fell 0.9 percent.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to
keep interest rates at an all-time low for an “extended
period” yesterday. That contrasts with the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which signaled stimulus could be cut this year,
prompting investors to flee emerging-market assets and fueling a
global stock rout.  “We expect the markets to go up today on the back of
Draghi’s statement,” Surya Narayan Nayak, an analyst at
Networth Stock Broking Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai today.
“Our markets are driven by foreign inflows and a loose global
monetary policy will spur demand for riskier assets. This will
counter some of the concerns over tapering by the Fed.”  The European Union accounted for 17 percent of  India ’s
exports in the fiscal year ended March 2012, according to the
commerce ministry, making it India’s largest trading partner.
Shipments to the U.S. accounted for 11 percent, trade ministry
data show.  Overseas funds sold a net $97 million of Indian stocks on
July 3, data from the market regulator show. That pared this
year’s  net inflow  to $13.4 billion, still a record for the
period. Foreign investors withdrew a net $1.76 billion of
domestic stocks last month, the  most  since August 2011.  The Sensex has slid 4.3 percent from a two-year high set on
May 17 and  trades at  13 times projected 12-month earnings. The
valuation narrowed to 12.5 times on June 24, the cheapest since
April. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index trades at 9.7 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
