Free-agent guard  Andre Iguodala 
agreed on a four-year, $48 million contract with the Golden
State Warriors, Yahoo Sports reported today, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the deal.  The impact on the salary cap from Iguodala’s deal
effectively removes Golden State from the list of possible
destinations for center  Dwight Howard , the offseason’s highest-profile free agent, Yahoo said. Howard is choosing among the Los
Angeles Lakers, where he played last season; the Warriors; the
Dallas Mavericks; the  Houston Rockets , and the Atlanta Hawks,
according to ESPN.  A National Basketball Association All-Star in 2012,
Iguodala averaged 13 points per game last season as a member of
the Denver Nuggets. Prior to joining Denver, he spent eight
years with the  Philadelphia 76ers .  Iguodala, who also plays forward, would join a team that
advanced this season to the second round of the NBA playoffs for
the first time in six years. The team was led by guards Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, who combined for 39.5 points per game.  NBA signings and trades can’t be finished and formally
announced until July 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
