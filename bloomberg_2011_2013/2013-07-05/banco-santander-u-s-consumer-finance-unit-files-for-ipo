Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s U.S. consumer
lender, which originates about 40 percent of its loans for new-vehicle purchases and leases, filed for an initial public
offering in the U.S.  Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. filed to raise $50
million, according to a regulatory filing that didn’t disclose
how many shares will be offered or at what price. The amount is
a placeholder and may change.  Santander Consumer agreed in February to originate loans
and leases for Chrysler Group LLC, helping to more than double
the percentage of its business that comes from vehicle
financing, according to a June 3 filing. In the U.S., where
there were about $800 billion of auto loans outstanding as of
April 30, no individual lender accounts for more than 10 percent
of the market, Santander Consumer’s filing shows.  Santander Consumer, based in  Dallas , is 65 percent-owned by
Madrid-based  Banco Santander , the filing shows. Funds managed by
Centerbridge Partners LP, KKR & Co. and Warburg Pincus LLC own a
25 percent stake, and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Dundon owns
10 percent, according to the filing.  Net income attributable to Santander Consumer totaled about
$751 million in the 12 months through March 31, the filing
showed. The company didn’t name the IPO’s underwriters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
