No joy ride for a couple in Spain… AN UNCHARITABLE RESPONSE  (or lack thereof) from Avis. After much prodding, Ombudsman learned that the Málaga office had dropped the claim for $31,700 and said they had charged no additional fees, despite the $1,825 billed to the Gazaways’ credit card. The situation was complicated by the fact that Avis Spain operated independently from Avis Budget Group at the time, and we were given the runaround for months. Finally, a representative in Spain explained that the “damage charges” represented the deductible for the Gazaways’ personal auto insurance. Happily, Avis decided to issue a full refund and sort out the claim with the Gazaways’ insurance company. Much of the confusion surrounding the Gazaways’ case related to finding the right Avis representatives. Since the Gazaways’ experience, Avis says its customer service has been “streamlined” following the acquisition of European branches of Avis by the Avis Budget Group. A U.S. customer service agent should now be better able to assist with international claims. The Gazaways relied on their own car insurance and declined Avis’s collision damage waiver and theft protection, a decision they came to regret. A collision damage waiver limits the renter’s liability to a deductible (or “excess” in car rental lingo). If anything happens to the vehicle, the renter is responsible only for the deductible, which may still be significant (for Avis rentals in Spain, it ranges from $774 to $1,658). Another option is to rely on the rental coverage included with most credit cards. Typically this is secondary coverage for the deductible and items not covered by your own insurance. The main downside is that a claim may increase your premium. Or you can buy insurance through your credit card or a travel insurance company—American Express’s Premium Car Rental Protection plan, for example, provides $100,000 in primary damage and theft coverage, as well as medical and other expenses, for $25 per rental, with no deductible. But like the Gazaways, you may have to jump through hoops to be reimbursed, and some countries aren’t covered by credit cards and other plans. Ombudsman recommends looking closely at your auto policy and calling your credit card company before you next rent some wheels. GOT A PROBLEM? Ombudsman offers a free service of advice and mediation.
