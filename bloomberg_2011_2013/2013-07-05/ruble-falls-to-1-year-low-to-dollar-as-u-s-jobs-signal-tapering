The ruble weakened to a 13-month low
against the dollar and yields on  government bonds  jumped after
better-than-forecast U.S. data spurred bets the Federal Reserve
will pare stimulus.  The currency slid 0.5 percent against the dollar to 33.3495
by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when the central bank stops its market
transactions. The yield on benchmark OFZs due February 2027 rose
14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 7.94 percent, the
highest in a week.  Payrolls in the U.S. rose by 195,000 workers for a second
straight month, the Labor Department reported. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain after a
previously reported 175,000 increase in May.  Ten-year U.S.
Treasuries (USGG10YR)  declined, pushing the yield to 2.69 percent, the
highest since August 2011.  “As long as Treasuries are getting hammered, we’ll get
hammered too,” Dmitry Dorofeev, a fixed-income strategist and
trader at BCS Financial Group, said by e-mail.  The ruble depreciated 0.1 percent against the basket to
37.5977, bringing the weekly decline to 0.9 percent. An index of
emerging-market currencies compiled by Bloomberg declined 0.6
percent to 93.0291, the lowest since May 2009.  Positive signals from the  U.S. economy  are pushing the
 Federal Reserve  toward an “exit strategy” for reducing
stimulus, which puts pressure on emerging-market currencies
while bolstering the dollar, Anton Zakharov, foreign exchange
analyst at OAO Promsvyazbank, said by e-mail.  The ruble will match last year’s low of 34.1499 against the
dollar over the next two weeks, Zakharov said. Non-deliverable
forward contracts signal traders expect of the ruble to slide to
33.8452 against the dollar in the next three months, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
