Dean Maki , chief U.S. economist at 
Barclays PLC, and Neil Dutta, chief economist at Renaissance 
Macro Research LLC, say the view of a recovering U.S. labor 
market supported by the June employment report supports signals 
from the Federal Reserve that it will start tapering off on its 
bond purchase program in September and finish tapering by the 
middle of 2014.  Maki and Dutta talk with Bloomberg's Kathleen 
Hays and Vonnie Quinn on Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays Advantage."   (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 23:21
