Exports of North Sea Brent crude for
August are planned at seven cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, up
from a revised six this month, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  Brent is one of four North Sea oil grades that make up the
Dated Brent benchmark, which is used to price crude from the
Middle East,  Africa  and  Russia . The other blends are Forties,
Oseberg and Ekofisk.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
