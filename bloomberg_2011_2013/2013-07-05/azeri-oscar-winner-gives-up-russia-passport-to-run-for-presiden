Oscar-winning screenwriter Rustam Ibrahimbayov, the united opposition’s sole candidate to run for
the Azeri presidency, renounced his Russian citizenship to meet
qualification requirements.  Ibrahimbayov, 74, who is based in Moscow, gave up his
Russian passport, Eldar Namazov, head of the executive office of
the National Council of Democratic Forces, an alliance of the
country’s main opposition parties and groups, said today by
phone from the capital of  Azerbaijan , Baku. Azeri law bans
people with dual citizenship from running for the Caspian Sea
nation’s top post.  The challenger will face President  Ilham Aliyev , 51, in an
election slated for October. Aliyev is seeking a third term in
office after taking over from his father, Heydar, in a disputed
vote 10 years ago.  Ibrahimbayov co-wrote with Nikita Mikhalkov the 1994 film
“Burnt by the Sun,” which won an Academy Award for best
foreign-language film.  To contact the reporter on this story:
