Japanese shares rose, with the Topix
index capping the biggest  three-week gain  since April 2009,
after the yen weakened and the  European Central Bank  and Bank of
England signaled they will keep borrowing costs low.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which gets 37 percent of its sales
from Europe, gained 4.1 percent.  CyberAgent Inc. (4751) , a social
gaming and Internet company, jumped 10 percent after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. recommended its shares.  Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303) , a
lender that generates almost half of revenue from  consumer
credit , rose 3.9 percent after saying it plans to expand into
Asia within three years.  The Topix added 1.5 percent to 1,188.58 at the close in
Tokyo, the highest since May 24. It gained 4.8 percent this
week, bringing its increase over the past three weeks to more
than 12 percent. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 2.1
percent to 14,309.97. Shares rose as the yen’s weakness beyond
100 per dollar improved the outlook for Japanese exporters.  “The ECB and BOE gave the market confidence by trying to
contain the rise in yields, thus boosting shares,” said
Kuninobu Takeuchi, Tokyo-based executive portfolio manager at
DIAM Co., which oversees more than $124 billion globally. “The
yen’s current level is very good for corporate earnings. It’s
helping companies invest a bit more in Japan after increasing
capital spending abroad to escape from a stronger yen.”  Abenomics Expectations  The  Topix (TPX)  has gained 38 percent this year on optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe will succeed in beating deflation. Abe is
expected to push through economic reforms after winning upper-house elections on July 21.  “There is some more upside to the Japanese market ahead of
the upcoming elections,” said Masahiko Ejiri, a Tokyo-based
senior  fund manager  at Mizuho Asset Management Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $34 billion. “We’re pretty confident
Abe will win the election, enabling him to further transform the
economy. The weaker yen should be helping Japanese exporters.”  Shares gained after ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged to
keep  interest rates  at a record low for an “extended period”
yesterday, while BOE chief  Mark Carney  said increases in market
rates weren’t warranted.  Companies that do business in Europe advanced. Nippon Sheet
Glass gained 4.1 percent to 101 yen, the highest in a month.
 Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 29 percent of revenue from
the region, rose 1.7 percent to 3,375 yen.  Weaker Yen  Makers of cars and electric appliances provided the biggest
support to the Topix as the yen dropped against 15 of its 16
major counterparts. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
earnings at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , which generates 73 percent of sales
outside Japan, added 3 percent to 440 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
the world’s biggest carmaker, climbed 2.1 percent to 6,310 yen.
 Nintendo Co. (7974) , a maker of video-game consoles that gets 77
percent of revenue abroad, rose 1.8 percent to 11,970 yen in
Osaka.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1 percent,
signaling U.S. markets may open higher after yesterday’s
Independence Day holiday.  The U.S. unemployment rate probably fell to 7.5 percent in
June, matching April’s four-year low and down from 7.6 percent
in May, according to the median of 82 economists’ estimates in a
Bloomberg survey before the Labor Department report today.  CyberAgent Soars  CyberAgent soared 10 percent to 208,500 yen, the biggest
advance since Oct. 28, 2011, after Goldman resumed its buy
rating on the shares with a price target of 330,000 yen.  Shinsei Bank gained 3.9 percent to 243 yen. The lender is
studying Southeast Asian countries where household spending will
increase, Chief Executive Officer Shigeki Toma said in an
interview, declining to comment on locations. Shinsei aims to
boost consumer loans 33 percent by March 2016 as Japan recovers
from an industry crackdown on excessive rates, he said.  The Topix has swung an average of about 2.8 percent daily
since May 22. The measure’s 30-day  historic volatility  closed at
36.46 today, near its highest since the 2011 earthquake. The
Topix traded at 15 times average estimated earnings, compared
with 14.7 for the S&P 500 and 12.9 for the Stoxx  Europe  600
Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
