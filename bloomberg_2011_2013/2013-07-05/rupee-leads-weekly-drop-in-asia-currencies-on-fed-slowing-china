Asian currencies fell this week, led
by  India ’s rupee, as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will taper
stimulus and signs Chinese growth is slowing damped demand for
emerging-market assets.  Two manufacturing gauges in Asia’s largest economy fell in
June, reports showed this week, while data indicating an
improvement in the U.S. labor market bolstered the case for the
Fed to begin paring debt purchases that have spurred fund flows
to Asia. Overseas investors pulled $1.1 billion from Taiwanese,
South Korean and Indonesian stocks this week, exchange data show.
The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, climbed 0.7 percent since June 28.  “For Asian currencies, it’s been a story of dollar
strength and continued pressure of outflows this week,” said
Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at  Societe Generale  SA in  Hong
Kong . “The U.S. data this week was quite good and will probably
support the case for the Fed to start tapering soon. Asian
currencies still have a bit more weakness to go.”  The  Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies, declined 0.2 percent this
week to 115.45 as of 4:48 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee fell 1.6 percent to 60.37 per
dollar, and was poised for its ninth straight weekly loss.
Malaysia’s ringgit retreated 0.9 percent to 3.1885 and the
Philippine peso weakened 0.5 percent to 43.405.  U.S. Jobs  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first indicated on May 22 that
asset purchases could be reduced if there was a sustained
improvement in the jobs market in the world’s largest economy.  The U.S. Labor Department may report that companies added
165,000 workers last month, compared with 175,000 in May,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . Jobless claims decreased to 343,000 in the week
ended June 28 from a revised 348,000 in the prior period, data
on July 3 showed.  “The dollar is strong globally as the likely improvement
in U.S. employment is adding to concerns about the Fed’s early
stimulus exit,” said Son Eun Jeong, an analyst at Woori Futures
Co. in  Seoul .  The rupee headed for its longest weekly losing streak in a
year after foreign funds cut holdings of local-currency Indian
debt by $562 million in the first three days of this week,
following withdrawals of $5.4 billion in June, exchange data
show. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its rupee forecast, saying
India may find it tough to lure capital to offset its record
current-account deficit.  Goldman sees the rupee at 60 per dollar in 12 months,
compared with an earlier prediction of 56. It will depreciate to
62 by end-2014, the lender forecasts.  Malaysian Stocks  “The worsening funding environment for  emerging markets 
could continue to put currencies which have high current-account
deficits, such as the rupee, under pressure,”  Tushar Poddar , a
Goldman economist in Mumbai, wrote in a report released
yesterday. “Capital outflows from debt have had a large impact
on the rupee.”  Malaysia’s stock exchange released figures this week
showing foreign funds sold a net 3.5 billion ringgit ($1.1
billion) of local shares in June.  “The latest stock exchange data show that in June there
was net selling of Malaysian equities by foreigners for the
first time this year, so there’s a bit of pressure there,”
Societe Generale’s Chong said.  Elsewhere in Asia, Thailand’s baht weakened 0.3 percent to
31.14 per dollar this week. Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.2 percent
to 9,944 and Vietnam’s dong dropped 0.2 percent to 21,238.
Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.3 percent to 30.218, South Korea’s
won was little changed at 1,142.50, while China’s  yuan  rose 0.1
percent to 6.1326.  To contact the reporter on this story:
