Gold futures fell to a one-week low
as the dollar surged to the highest in almost three years after
U.S. payrolls rose more than forecast in June, fueling
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will scale back stimulus.  The greenback climbed as much as 1.6 percent against a
basket of major currencies, eroding the appeal of gold as an
alternative investment. Payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a
second straight month, the government said today. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures jumped after the jobs data.  “A better jobs report means there’s less flight to
safety,” Brian Booth, a senior market strategist at Long Leaf
Trading Group in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The
initial reaction to the report was a push higher in the dollar
and a rise in stocks, and for as long as that continues, gold
will struggle.”  Gold futures for August delivery slumped 3.1 percent to
settle at $1,212.70 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the price touched $1,206.90, the lowest for a
most-active contract since June 28. Trading was 25 percent above
the 100-day average for this time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Yesterday, the Comex floor was closed for the Independence
Day holiday, and spot gold dropped 0.2 percent. Today, the
Dollar Index, a gauge against six currencies, rose to the
highest since July 13, 2010.  Silver futures for September delivery tumbled 4.9 percent
to $18.736 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest decline since June
20. The metal has dropped 38 percent this year, the most among
the 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery retreated 1.5 percent to $1,326.40 an ounce,
the third straight loss. Palladium futures for September
delivery slid 1.2 percent to $677.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
