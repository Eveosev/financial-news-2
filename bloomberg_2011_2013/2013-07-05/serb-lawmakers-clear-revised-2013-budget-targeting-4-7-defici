Serbian lawmakers approved the
revised 2013 budget, raising the deficit target to 4.7 percent
of economic output and endorsing the government’s plan to sell
or close 179 companies that employ 54,000 people.  Lawmakers voted 129 to 55 in favor of the plan to increase
the shortfall to as much as 178 billion dinars ($2 billion) from
an initially planned 122 billion dinars, or 3.6 percent of gross
domestic product. The three-member  Fiscal Council , appointed by
parliament to oversee fiscal compliance, sees the gap at about
200 billion dinars. It reached 98 billion dinars at end-June.  The revised budget is part of Prime Minister Ivica Dacic’s
effort to stabilize public finances and will be accompanied by
“other reforms” which will take time, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic told lawmakers on July 1 when presenting the plan. “We
have cut spending wherever possible” and spared public wages
and pensions, fearing that the cut would further curb demand and
slow growth, he said.  Serbia ended 2012 with a deficit equivalent to 7.75 percent
of GDP, the biggest shortfall since the 2000 ouster of former
strongman Slobodan Milosevic. The deficit may soar to 8.3
percent this year without additional cost cuts, the
International Monetary Fund said July 3.  The government plans to spend $11.7 billion and collect
revenue of about $9.8 billion. The revised budget raised
financing needs to 631 billion dinars from 554 billion dinars.
The plan includes $2.5 billion of Eurobonds, leaving  Serbia  with
an outstanding issue of $1 billion after selling $1.5 billion of
seven-year bonds on Feb. 14.  Government Challenged  The government will find it “challenging” to raise 2.7
billion euros ($3.5 billion) by the end of 2013 and a further
4.5 billion euros in 2014 to finance the deficit and repay
maturing principal on public debt, the Fiscal Council’s chairman
Pavle Petrovic said yesterday, urging the authorities to seek a
deal with the IMF to ensure lower borrowing costs.  The budget is based on a 2 percent GDP growth projection
this year, led by expanding industrial output and exports, year-end inflation of 5.5 percent and the current-account gap of 8.4
percent.  Serbia wants to sell or close 179 state-owned enterprises
that have been subject to restructuring programs for 12 years
and cost the government 750 million euros annually. The plan, to
be implemented through 2014, may leave 54,000 people unemployed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
