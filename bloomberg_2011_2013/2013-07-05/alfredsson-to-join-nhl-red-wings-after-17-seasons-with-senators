Daniel Alfredsson  has agreed to a
one-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings after spending his
entire 17-year National Hockey League career with the  Ottawa
Senators .  The Red Wings announced the agreement on their Twitter page
yesterday, the first day of the NHL’s free-agent signing period.
The team also agreed to a five-year deal with center Stephen Weiss, who scored 20 goals in 2011-12 with the Florida Panthers
and missed most of last season with a wrist injury.  A six-time All-Star, Alfredsson has 426 goals and 682
assists in his career, both in the top six among active NHL
players. He also won an Olympic gold medal with Sweden in the
2006  Winter Games  in Turin.  Alfredsson had been the Senators’ captain since 1999.
Ottawa General Manager Bryan Murray told reporters two days ago
that he was confident Alfredsson would return to the Senators,
according to NHL.com.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporters on this story:
