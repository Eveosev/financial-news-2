U.K. stocks advanced, with the FTSE
100 Index heading for its biggest weekly gain in more than seven
months, as investors awaited data on U.S. jobs.  The FTSE 100 Index added 17.08 points, or 0.3 percent, to
6,438.75 at 8:38 a.m. in London. The equity benchmark surged 3.1
percent yesterday, the most since November 2011, after the  Bank
of England  signaled it will maintain  interest rates  at a record
low. The FTSE 100 is heading for a weekly advance of 3.6
percent, the most since November. The FTSE All-Share Index rose
0.2 percent and Irelandâ€™s ISEQ Index climbed 0.1 percent today.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington may show employers hired 165,000 workers in June,
from 175,000 a month earlier, according to the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The  unemployment rate  fell
to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent in May, economists projected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
