University of Michigan  students in
summer programs in  Egypt  have evacuated the country in the wake
of the July 3 military ouster of President Mohamed Mursi.  A total of 13 students flew out of Cairo today, Kelly
Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the Ann Arbor-based university,
said in an e-mail.  Andrew Pochter, an undergraduate at Kenyon College in  Ohio ,
was killed in a demonstration in Alexandria on June 28. Almost
274,000 U.S. students studied abroad in 2010-2011, according to
Institute of International Education, with a growing number of
them outside the stable Western European democracies that
traditionally hosted American students. The possibility of
further unrest in Egypt led Michigan to remove its students,
according to a July 3  statement .  “No one wants her summer-abroad experience cut short, but
the uncertainty of the situation in Cairo in the days ahead made
this decision very clear for us,” James Holloway, vice provost
for global and engaged education, said in the statement.  Eight  Michigan  students in a program affiliated with the
 American University in Cairo  are returning to the U.S. while an
additional five in other programs will relocate to Morocco and
Jordan to finish their studies. One Ph.D. student with family in
Egypt elected to stay, Cunningham said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
