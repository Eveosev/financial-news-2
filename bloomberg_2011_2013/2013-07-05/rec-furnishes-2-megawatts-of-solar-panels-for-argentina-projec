Renewable Energy Corp. (REC) , the Norwegian
solar-power manufacturer, has delivered 2 megawatts of panels to
a 360 Energy SA project in western Argentina.  REC, as the polysilicon company is known, installed 8,400
panels at the local developerâ€™s existing 5-megawatt Chimbera
solar farm, Sandvika, Norway-based REC said today in a
 statement . The installation was done in March, an company
official who asked not to be named because of policy said in a
