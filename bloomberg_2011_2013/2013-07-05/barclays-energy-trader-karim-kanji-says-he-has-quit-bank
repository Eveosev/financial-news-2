Karim Kanji, head of coal, dry-freight and iron-ore trading at  Barclays Plc (BARC)  in London, resigned
from the bank last week amid a financial-industry shift away
from energy and commodity markets.  Kanji, 36, left after seven years, including more than four
years as a carbon trader, he said yesterday by e-mail. He
previously traded power for ConocoPhillips, American Electric
Power Co. and Enron Corp.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp.  have shut
units trading commodities because of tighter regulation in
Europe and the U.S. after the global recession.  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
will exit power and natural-gas trading in Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic and Poland as it scales back involvement in
commodities, a person with knowledge of the matter said in June.  Barclays has scaled back its European energy-trading
business since early 2011, cutting bonuses and reducing risk,
people with knowledge of the matter said in August. Departures
at the London-based bank this year include Louis Redshaw, the
former head of carbon, coal and iron ore trading who left in
April, and  Trevor Sikorski , director of European energy-markets
research, who stopped working at Barclays in February.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  fired 10 to 12 European power and natural
gas traders in London as it cut staff trading physical
commodities, two people with knowledge of the matter said in
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
