The yield on Indian bonds due 2022
were little changed this week on optimism improved supply of
cash in the banking system will spur demand for debt, offsetting
concerns about a weaker rupee fuelling inflation.  Local lenders’ net daily  borrowings  from the central bank

billion) in the past two days, after averaging 417 billion in

is stepping up expenditure to boost  economic growth .  India ’s
spending in the first two months of the fiscal year ending March
2014 was 13.1 percent of the total budgeted expenditure,
compared with 12.8 percent a year earlier,  official estimates 
showed last week.  “There’s ample cash in the system as the government has
started spending,” said N.S. Venkatesh, the Mumbai-based head
of treasury at state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)   The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 was

points today as the Indian rupee weakened.  The overnight interbank borrowing  rate  was at 5.5 percent
