An Australian man was detained on
board a  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  Sydney to Manila flight after he
“allegedly” tried to enter the cockpit in a potential threat
to the aircraft’s safety, Australian Federal Police said.  “If the cockpit had been breached, the consequences could
have been disastrous,” police said in a  statement  on the
department’s website today. The unnamed 33-year-old was
restrained by air security officers yesterday after he ran to
the front of the aircraft and tried to open the cockpit door.  The passenger on flight QF19 hadn’t “compromised” the
safety of the aircraft, which landed about 7 p.m. local time in
Manila, Qantas spokesman Luke Enright said in an e-mailed
statement.  “Distracting the pilots of a commercial aircraft carrying
approximately 400 passengers and flying at an altitude of 10,000
metres is a very real threat” to flight safety, Assistant
Commissioner Shane Connelly said in the statement.  The man was handed over to Philippine authorities in
 Manila , according to the police statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
