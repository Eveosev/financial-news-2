Ike Davis, the New York Mets’ top
draft pick in 2008, reached based four times and drove in two
runs as he returned to Major League Baseball in a 12-5 rout of
the  Milwaukee  Brewers.  Davis rejoined the Mets last night after spending three
weeks in the minor leagues trying to break out of a hitting
slump. In the first of a three-game road series against the
Brewers, he went 3-for-5 with two run-scoring singles and a walk.  Before batting fourth in the lineup, Davis told reporters
he had made some adjustments to his swing.  “It’ll be noticed,” Davis said. “Obviously, it’s not
like I’m standing on my head. It’s going to look remotely close,
but there are just little things that we changed.”  The 26-year-old first baseman was demoted to the team’s
Triple-A affiliate in Las Vegas last month after hitting .161
with five home runs and 66 strikeouts through his first 55 games
of the MLB season. In 21 games with the  Las Vegas 51s , Davis
hit .293 with seven home runs and 21 runs scored, striking out
18 times.  “I think what he just went through, he’s probably grown
because of it,” manager Terry Collins said. “We know he’s a
quality major league player.”  Davis has hit .239 over parts of four MLB seasons with the
Mets. He played 156 games in 2012, hitting 32 home runs with 90
runs batted-in, both career highs.  At Miller Park in Milwaukee last night, Kirk Nieuwenhuis
drove in a career-best five runs and Zack Wheeler allowed one
earned run over five innings for the Mets.  Nieuwenhuis, who was recalled from Las Vegas on June 9, had
two singles, a triple, a double and two walks.  Wheeler (2-1) gave up three runs on seven hits and walked
three.  Brewers starter Johnny Hellweg (0-2) allowed seven runs and
walked five in 3 2-3 innings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
