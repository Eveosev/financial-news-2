Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (2208)  denied that it guaranteed a unit’s loan and used
it to sell equipment.  The unit, Vensys Energy AG, didn’t borrow 100 million euros
($129 million) and Goldwind didn’t offer its guarantee, the
biggest turbine maker in  China  said today in a filing to the
Shenzhen stock exchange. Goldwind was responding to a report in
the 21st Century Business Herald.  The Urumqi-based turbine maker halted trading on July 3
after the report and will resume on July 8. Goldwind used the
100 million-euro guaranteed loan to support the customer in
Cyprus to buy its 21 turbines, the Herald reported.  Vensys’s customer had obtained a 40 million euro loan from
China Development Bank Corp. Goldwind said it didn’t harm
legitimate interests of investors because Vensys supplied 21
1.5-megawatt turbines to the customer in Cyprus at the market
price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
