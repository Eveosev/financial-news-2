Hareon Solar Technology (600401)  Co., a
Chinese maker of solar panels, plans to build 479 megawatts of
solar power plants for Jiangxi  Shunfeng Photovoltaic (1165)  Investment
Co.  Hareon said it will also provide engineering and
procurement services for the unit of Shunfeng Photovoltaic
International Ltd. under a 4.19 billion  yuan  ($684 million)
contract, according to a  statement  to the Shanghai stock
exchange.  In addition to the construction contract, Jiangx Shunfeng
will buy a 95 percent stake in the plants, and another 20
megawatts of Hareon’s solar projects, for an undisclosed sum,
Hareon said in a separate statement.  Solar-component manufacturers are venturing into project
development after their profits declined on slowing demand and a
supply glut. Hareon and Jiangxi Shunfeng’s parent both reported
losses last year.  The projects “will benefit the company to further expand
photovoltaic power-plant development business, raise market
share and improve overall profitability,” said Hareon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
