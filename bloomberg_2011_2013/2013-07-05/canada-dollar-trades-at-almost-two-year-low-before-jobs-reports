The Canadian dollar traded at almost
a two-year low before separate reports forecast to show  Canada 
lost jobs in June while U.S. payrolls grew, providing further
evidence economic growth in the two countries is diverging.  The currency fluctuated before a report projected to show
Canada lost 7,500 jobs in June after posting its biggest monthly
gain in a decade the period before with 95,000 new positions
created, according to a Bloomberg survey of 20 economists. The
 U.S. economy  added 165,000 jobs in June, according to a survey
with 91 responses.  “The market is looking for a weaker Canadian and a
stronger U.S. number,” said Matthew Perrier, Toronto-based
director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal, by phone from
Toronto. “The risk is you get a stronger Canada number and a
not-so-strong U.S. number, which would obviously be negative for
the dollar, positive for the loonie.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, was little
changed at C$1.0514 per  U.S. dollar  at 7:51 a.m. in Toronto. It
touched C$10578 per U.S. dollar on July 2, the lowest since
October 2011. One loonie buys 95.11 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
