Loblaw Cos. (L) ’ real estate investment
trust fell 1.1 percent in its trading debut on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.  Choice Properties REIT (CHP-U) , created by Canada’s biggest grocery
store chain, fell to C$9.89 a unit at 9:41 a.m. in Toronto, down
from the C$10 IPO price.  Choice Properties raised C$400 million ($378 million) on
June 25 by selling 40 million trust units in its IPO, the
largest REIT initial sale in the country, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Loblaw, based in Brampton, Ontario,
created the REIT to spin off about 75 percent of its real
estate.  Loblaw sold a portfolio of 425 properties indirectly to
Choice Properties for about C$7 billion, the company said in a
statement today. Loblaw intends to sell the significant majority
of its remaining real estate holdings to Choice Properties over
the next 10 years.  REITs, which receive preferential tax treatment from the
government, are companies that invest in income-producing real
estate and pay out most of their income to investors through
unit distributions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
