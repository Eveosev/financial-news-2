India ’s Gujarat state, home to half
the nation’s solar power-plant capacity, is seeking to cut the
rate it pays to projects, citing the owners’ excessive profits.  Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., the state-run bulk buyer of
solar power, submitted a petition to regulators because of the
“unjustified and windfall gains” by plant owners, according to
a copy obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by P.K. Mishra,
chairman of Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission.  The purchaser has signed 88 contracts for a total of 971.5
megawatts of solar capacity with developers including  Adani
Enterprises Ltd. (ADE) ,  Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI) ,  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) , and
Welspun Energy Ltd. since 2010, according to the petition.  A “reasonable and prudent tariff” would be about 9 rupees
(15 cents) a kilowatt-hour, less than the average 12.54 rupees
over 25 years under current contracts, it said in the petition.  The first hearing on whether regulators will accept a case
based on the petition will be held on July 23, Mishra said.  Gujarat Urja Managing Director Raj Gopal didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail and two phone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
