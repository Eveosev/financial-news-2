U.S.  stocks  rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest rally in three weeks,
after government data showed the nation added more jobs than
forecast last month.  Lincoln National Corp. climbed 5.4 percent, leading a rally
among life insurers as bond yields surged on bets the  Federal
Reserve  will begin to reduce its asset buying. KeyCorp advanced
as  Wells Fargo & Co . said regional banks benefit more than
larger rivals from new rules on capital. Tesla Motors Inc. added
4.2 percent after saying it received enough orders to double the
number of electric cars in  Hong Kong . Homebuilders slumped amid
concern rising interest rates may curtail a housing recovery.  The  S&P 500  gained 1 percent, the most since June 13, to
1,631.89 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The index advanced 1.6 percent
for the week. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 147.29
points, or 1 percent, to 15,135.84. About 4.95 billion shares
changed hands, 24 percent below the three-month average. U.S.
markets were closed yesterday for the Independence Day holiday.  “The jobs report is pretty strong. It’s a good number for
equities because it’s supportive for earnings growth, which is
what we need,” Matthew Peron, head of active equities at
Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago, said by telephone. His firm
manages about $810 billion. “We have to digest the backup in
yields, we have to see how far do they go and get used to that
level of rates.”  Payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a second straight
month, the Labor Department reported today in  Washington . The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain
after a previously reported 175,000 increase in May. The jobless
rate stayed at 7.6 percent, while hourly earnings in the year
ended in June advanced by the most since July 2011.  Fed Stimulus  Economic growth amid monetary stimulus from the Federal
Reserve has helped send the  S&P 500 (SPX)  up 141 percent from its
bear-market low in 2009, including a 14 percent rally so far
this year. The index has slipped 2.2 percent from its last
record on May 21 after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank could begin to reduce bond purchases should the
employment market show sustainable growth.  “Part of this focus on the Fed easing is that they haven’t
been enthusiastic about the underlying economics,” said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $20 billion as chief
investment strategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in
 Cleveland . “If investors can be reassured about that, then it
opens the door to a more sustainable rally.”  Equities rose earlier today as European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  predicted that interest rates will remain
low for an extended period of time. Draghi said yesterday that
key interest rates will remain at their current levels or lower
for as long as necessary. The  Bank of England  signaled that it
will leave interest rates at a record low for longer than
investors had expected.  Earnings Season  Alcoa Inc. will unofficially start the second-quarter
earnings season as the biggest U.S. aluminum producer will
report results after the market closes on July 8.  Profits for S&P 500 stocks probably grew 1.8 percent,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
down from a projected increase of 6.2 percent at the beginning
of the quarter. Earnings are forecast to jump 5.5 percent for
the third quarter and 11 percent for the final three months of
this year, the data show.  “We know this is not going to be a terrific earnings
season,” Northern Trust’s Peron said. “The focus will be on
guidance - are we going to get improvement as the year
continues, which is in expectation? The criticism of the market
has been that it has been supported by Fed actions and now this
is the time for that hand-off to happen.”  Volatility Gauge  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , or
VIX, slipped 8.1 percent today to 14.89, the lowest level since
May 30. The equity volatility gauge, which moves in the opposite
direction as the S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, reached a
six-month high in June and has since fallen 27 percent.  Nine of 10 S&P 500 main industries gained as financial,
industrial and health-care companies rose more than 1.3 percent.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  added 2.3 percent to $53.99 and Bank of
America Corp. advanced 1.8 percent to $13.06.  Lincoln, the life insurer with more than $200 billion in
assets, climbed 5.4 percent to $38.98. Higher  interest rates  can
boost profits for life insurers, which invest premiums from
clients in bonds and other assets to back future payouts.
MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life insurer, gained 2.7 percent
to $47.52.  Regional Banks  Regional lenders rose as KeyCorp, Ohio’s second-largest
bank, jumped 5 percent to $12. Smaller banks face less onerous
risk weightings for residential mortgages under the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision ’s latest set of global
standards, Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Burnell wrote in a note.
The capital rules are scheduled to be decided next week.  SunTrust Banks Inc. advanced 4.2 percent to $34.31, while
Zions Bancorporation increased 4.3 percent to $30.97.  Tesla Motors Inc. added 4.2 percent to a record $120.09
after saying it received hundreds of orders for its new Model S
sedan, enough to double the number of electric cars on Hong
Kong’s streets. The company, headed by billionaire Chief
Executive Officer  Elon Musk , has forecast it will sell 21,000
units of the Model S globally this year, with deliveries to
 Europe  and  Asia  beginning in the second half.  Zoetis Inc., the animal-health company spun off from Pfizer
Inc., gained 3 percent to $30.17. Bank of America boosted the
stock’s rating to buy.  Homebuilders Sink  An S&P index of  homebuilders  fell 3.4 percent to the lowest
level since December as Treasury yields rose to the highest
level in almost two years. All its 11 members retreated. Toll
Brothers Inc. dropped 3 percent to $31.52 while Lennar Corp.
slipped 4 percent to $33.93.  A  Bloomberg index  of real estate investment trusts that buy
mortgage debt tumbled 3.9 percent for the biggest retreat since
October 2011. Annaly Capital Management Inc., the largest of the
companies, plunged 5.1 percent to $11.51 and American Capital
Agency Corp., the second biggest, slumped 5.3 percent to $20.76.  Gold producers declined as the metal’s price plunged 3.1
percent. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest miner of the
precious metal, sank 6.3 percent to $13.76. Newmont Mining Corp.
fell 4.3 percent to $27.78 for the biggest loss in the S&P 500.  Dell Inc. erased 2.1 percent to $13.03.  Michael Dell  and
Silver Lake Management LLC won’t sweeten their $24.4 billion
offer to take the personal-computer maker private, people with
direct knowledge of the situation said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
