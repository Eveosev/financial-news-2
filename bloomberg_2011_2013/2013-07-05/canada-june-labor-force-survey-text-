Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  In June, employment was virtually unchanged and the
unemployment rate remained at 7.1%. In the first half of 2013,
employment growth averaged 14,000 per month, slower than the
average of 27,000 in the last six months of 2012.  Over this 12-month period, employment grew by 1.4%
(+242,000), and the total number of hours worked increased by
0.6%.  In June, employment increased in Manitoba and Saskatchewan,
while it declined in  New Brunswick  and Prince Edward Island.  Employment rose in professional, scientific and technical
services, and declined in accommodation and food services as
well as information, culture and recreation.  In June, employment was little changed among the major
demographic groups.  Collection and estimates in Southern Alberta  Floods in parts of southern Alberta began after the June
reference week for the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which was from
Sunday June 9 to Saturday June 15. The flooding occurred towards
the end of the collection period.  While collection activities slowed in the affected
communities that were in sample, final response rates for these
communities were within normal range. Therefore, it is believed
that the impact of the floods on June estimates was negligible.  In July, questions on the impact of the floods on hours
worked will be added to the LFS, with estimates to be released
in mid-August.  Employment up in Manitoba and Saskatchewan  The number of workers in Manitoba rose by 7,300 in June,
offsetting declines earlier in the year. This gain pushed the
 unemployment rate  down 0.7 percentage points to 5.0%. Compared
with 12 months earlier, employment in the province was up 1.5%.  Following four months of little change, employment in
Saskatchewan increased by 4,300 in June. With this gain, the
unemployment rate fell 0.8 percentage points to 3.7%, the lowest
among all provinces. On a year-over-year basis, employment in
the province increased by 3.6%, the strongest growth rate in the
country.  In June, employment declined by 5,200 in New Brunswick,
returning to a level similar to that of December 2012. This
decline pushed the unemployment rate up 0.7 percentage points to
11.2%. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment was down 2.2%.  Employment declined by 1,100 in Prince  Edward Island  in
June, and was little changed from 12 months earlier. The
unemployment rate was 10.9% in June.  Following an increase in May, employment in Ontario was
little changed in June, as a gain in part-time work was offset
by a decline in full-time work. The unemployment rate rose 0.2
percentage points to 7.5%. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the province was up 1.6%.  In  Quebec , employment was little changed in June and the
unemployment rate was 7.9%. On a year-over-year basis,
employment rose 1.2%, with all the gains in the last six months
of 2012.  Gains in professional, scientific and technical services  Employment in professional, scientific and technical
services increased by 27,000 in June. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment grew by 4.9% (+63,000), one of the highest
growth rates among all industries.  In June, there were declines in accommodation and food
services (-20,000) and information, culture and recreation (-
15,000).  While employment in construction was little changed in June,
it increased 6.2% on a year-over-year basis. Employment in this
industry has been on an upward trend since the autumn of 2012.  Manufacturing employment has been little changed in recent
months, following a decline of 71,000 during the first three
months of 2013.  The number of private and public sector employees and the
self-employed was little changed in June. Compared with 12
months earlier, growth among private sector employees was 1.2%
(+137,000), with all the gains in the second half of 2012. At
the same time, the number of public sector employees was up 1.5%
(+55,000), with increases spread throughout the period. As for
the self-employed, growth was 1.9% (+51,000), the bulk of which
occurred in the first quarter of 2013.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects labour
market data about young people aged 15 to 24 who were attending
school full time in March and who intend to return to school
full time in the fall. The May and June survey results provide
the first indicators of the summer job market, while the July
and August data will provide further insight. The published data
are not seasonally adjusted; therefore, comparisons can only be
made on a year-over-year basis.  Among returning students aged 20 to 24, the employment rate
was 68.0% in June, up from 63.2% in June 2012. Their
unemployment rate was 11.4% in June, down from 13.0% a year
earlier.  The employment rate for 17- to 19-year-old students was
51.9% in June, similar to the rate observed 12 months earlier.
Over the same period, the unemployment rate for these students
declined from 17.3% to 15.7%.  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is produced
monthly in the form of three-month moving averages. The
following data are not seasonally adjusted; therefore,
comparisons should only be made on a year-over-year basis.  In Yukon, employment increased by 600 from June 2012 to
June 2013, and the unemployment rate fell from 7.8% to 5.3% over
the same period.  Employment in Nunavut and the  Northwest Territories  was
little changed in June 2013 compared with June 2012. Over the
same period, the unemployment rate was down 2.0 percentage
points to 13.7% in Nunavut, while it was little changed in the
Northwest Territories.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a
result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends
observed over longer time periods. Estimates for smaller
geographic areas or industries also have more variability. For
an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
“Estimates quality” section of the publication Labour Force
Information (71-001-X).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=eng ) .  Each year, the LFS revises its estimates for the previous
three years, using the latest seasonal factors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
