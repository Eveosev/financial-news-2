German 10-year bunds extended a
decline as a U.S. Labor Department report showed employers added
more jobs in June than economists forecast.  The 10-year yield climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 1:38 p.m. in London.  Payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a second straight
month, the Labor Department said in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain after a
previously reported 175,000 increase in May. The jobless rate
stayed at 7.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
