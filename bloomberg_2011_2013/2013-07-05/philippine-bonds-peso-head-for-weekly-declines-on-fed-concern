Philippine bonds maturing in 2037
headed for the biggest weekly loss in a month as odds the
 Federal Reserve  will taper debt purchases damped demand for
emerging-market assets, while local inflation accelerated.  The peso dropped for the week as global investors trimmed
their share holdings by a net 14 percent in 2013, stock exchange
data show.  Consumer prices  climbed 2.8 percent in June from a
year earlier, more than the 2.6 percent increase in May and the
2.7 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Yields on the longer-dated debt are higher, driven by
concern over outflow pressure arising from possible quantitative
easing in the U.S.,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist in  Hong
Kong  at Societe Generale SA. “Yields are expected to rise
further as there’s little sign the central bank will ease
borrowing costs from here.”  The yield on the 6.125 percent government notes due October
2037 surged 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 5.7
percent this week as of 12:33 p.m. in  Manila , according to
prices from Tradition Financial Services. The rate slipped five
basis points today and is up 135 basis points since May 31.  Policy makers last cut the overnight reverse-repurchase
rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent in October. Instead, they
opted to lower  interest rates  on special-deposit accounts three
times in 2013, with the most recent reduction on April 25.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will keep the key rate
unchanged this quarter, according to 15 of 17 economists in a
separate Bloomberg survey. Two forecast an increase to 3.75
percent.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. 10-year yields  advanced  48 basis points to 2.52
percent since May 22, when the Fed first indicated it may taper
its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases if there’s a sustained
improvement in the U.S. jobs market.  The U.S. Labor Department may report today that companies
added 165,000 workers last month, compared with 175,000 in May,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  The peso dropped 0.4 percent this week to 43.393 per dollar
and was little changed today, Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed.
It fell 5.5 percent last quarter, the biggest three-month drop
since the period ended June 2008.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 42 basis points
this week and 21 basis points today to 7.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
