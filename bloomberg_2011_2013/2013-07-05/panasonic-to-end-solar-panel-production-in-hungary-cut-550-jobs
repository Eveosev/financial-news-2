Panasonic Corp. (6752) , a Japanese
electronics maker, will close a solar panel manufacturing plant
in Hungary to consolidate production in Malaysia and Japan.  The company, which began developing solar panels in 1975,
plans to end production in September and dismiss about 550
workers at the factory, spokeswoman Chieko Gyobu said by phone
today, responding to a report in the Nikkei newspaper.  Panasonic will transfer production equipment at the
Hungarian plant to factories in Malaysia and Japan to keep
module production capacity at 900 megawatts a year, she said.  The companyâ€™s plant in  Oregon  ended solar wafer production
at the end of June while continuing to make silicon ingots,
according to the spokeswoman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
