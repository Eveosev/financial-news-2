Michael Oren,  Israel ’s ambassador to
the U.S., said today he will step down “in the fall” after
more than four years in the post.  “I am grateful for the opportunity to represent the state
of Israel and its government, under the leadership of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the United States,” Oren said
in a statement today. Oren didn’t say what he will do next or
who will replace him.  “I look forward to continue serving the people of Israel
in the future and further strengthening the historic U.S.-Israel
alliance,” Oren said.  Netanyahu plans to pick a former adviser, Ron Dermer, for
the ambassador’s post in Washington, according to the Jerusalem
Post, citing a report on Army Radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
