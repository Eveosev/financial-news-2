U.S. stocks  rose for the week, giving
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its second straight weekly
advance, as better-than-estimated economic data tempered concern
over a possible scaling back of Federal Reserve stimulus.  Auto companies and retailers rallied amid investor optimism
over sales gains. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. climbed
more than 4 percent, and  Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF)  Co. jumped 8.8
percent. U.S. regional banks rose as analysts said the group
would benefit from the latest round of global standards. Apple
Inc. climbed 5.3 percent. Homebuilders slumped as higher
Treasury yields fueled concern over rising  interest rates .  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  added 1.6 percent to 1,631.89 over the four
sessions in a holiday-shortened week. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rose 226.24 points, or 1.5 percent, to 15,135.84. U.S.
markets were closed for the July 4 holiday.  “Some investors have been worried that the tapering would
have a harmful effect, but if the real economy continues to show
decent improvement, those concerns will be mitigated,” Tanweer Akram, senior economist with ING U.S. Investment Management in
Atlanta, said by telephone, referring to the Fed’s stimulus
efforts. His firm oversees $180 billion.  A report on July 5 showed payrolls rose by 195,000 workers
for a second month, exceeding the 165,000 gain projected by
economists in a Bloomberg survey and indicating the  U.S. economy 
is poised for faster growth. The jobless rate stayed at 7.6
percent. Other data during the week showed jobless claims
decreased while manufacturing improved.  Fed Stimulus  Monetary stimulus from the Fed has helped send the  S&P 500 
up 141 percent from its bear-market low in 2009, including a 14
percent rally so far this year. The index has slipped 2.2
percent from its last record on May 21 after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank could begin to reduce bond
purchases should the employment market show sustainable growth.  Speculation over reduced central bank stimulus sent
 Treasury securities  plummeting. The yield on the  10-year (USGG10YR)  note
climbed to 2.74 percent, the highest level since August 2011.  “The employment number was 30,000 jobs higher than what
the world was looking for,” Peter Tuz, who helps manage more
than $500 million as president of Chase Investment Counsel Corp.
in Charlottesville, Virginia, said by phone. “Data points like
that help,” he said. “The Fed’s done a good job in
telegraphing what they’re going to do. The world and the economy
could easily live with the 10-year bond yield at 3 percent.”  European Rates  Global equities also rose as European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  predicted that interest rates will remain
low for an extended period of time, while the  Bank of England 
signaled it will keep borrowing costs at a record low for longer
than investors had estimated. U.S. stocks fell on July 2 as the
price of crude oil rallied after political unrest in Egypt
sparked concern of supply disruptions.  Investors will turn their attention to corporate earnings
in the coming week.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum
producer, on July 8 is the first company in the Dow scheduled to
report second-quarter results. Profits from S&P 500 companies
probably grew 1.8 percent, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from a projected increase of
6.2 percent at the beginning of the quarter.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, tumbled 12 percent for the week to 14.89. The equity
volatility gauge, which moves in the opposite direction as the
S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, reached a six-month high
in June and has  fallen  27 percent since.  Autos, Retailers  Nine out of 10 industries in the S&P 500 rose for the week,
with  utility companies  the only group to fall. Consumer-discretionary, technology and financial shares led gains, adding
more than 1.9 percent.  Auto companies rose 4.3 percent as a group for the biggest
gain out of 24 industries.  Ford (F)  surged 8 percent to $16.70, the
highest level since January 2011. The automaker’s sales of cars
and light trucks climbed 13 percent last month, beating the
average estimate of a 12 percent increase.  General Motors Co. jumped 4.1 percent to $34.67 after the
company’s 6.5 percent sales growth in June exceeded analysts’
projected gain of 2.1 percent.  Retailers advanced 2.7 percent. Sales at U.S. stores open
at least one year rose 2.9 percent for the week ended June 29 as
concern over increased inventory and markdowns eased, Johnson
Redbook Research said.  Abercrombie & Fitch climbed 8.8 percent to $49.24. The teen
retailer may see acceleration in margin expansion amid sales
stabilization and cost reductions, Piper Jaffray Cos. wrote in a
note, reiterating the stock as a top pick.  Basel III  All 24 companies in the the  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  rose at least
1.1 percent, as the measure climbed to its highest level since
October 2008. SunTrust Banks Inc. advanced 8.7 percent to $34.31
and KeyCorp added 8.7 percent to $12. Analysts from  Wells Fargo
& Co . to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said regional banks will
benefit more than the largest banks from requirements by Basel
III, the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ’s latest set of
global standards.  Apple climbed 5.3 percent to $417.42. The world’s most
valuable technology company is nearing a deal with Time Warner
Cable Inc. to give subscribers of the cable television service
access to channels via Apple TV, people with knowledge of the
negotiations said. Raymond James analyst  Tavis McCourt  lifted
the iPhone maker to a strong buy from outperform.  Tesla Motors Inc. added 12 percent to a record $120.09. The
electric-car maker said it received hundreds of orders for its
new Model S sedan in Hong Kong, enough to double the number of
electric cars in the city. Jefferies Group LLC analyst Elaine
Kwei lifted her price target on Tesla to $130 a share from $70.  Homebuilders Tumble  An S&P index of homebuilders fell 3.8 percent amid concern
rising interest rates may curtail a housing recovery.  KB Home (KBH)

lowest level since 2000.  Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. plunged 13 percent, the biggest

whether the prices of infant formula are too high.  To contact the reporters on this story:
