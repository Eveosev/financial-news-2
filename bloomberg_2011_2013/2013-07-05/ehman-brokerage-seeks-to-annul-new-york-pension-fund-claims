Defunct brokerage Lehman Brothers
Inc. asked a judge to expunge damage claims by  New York  State
and New York City pension funds arising from Lehmanâ€™s role as an
underwriter of Countrywide Financial Corp. securities before
2008.  The funds, plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against
Countrywide, released Lehman when they agreed to settle that
suit for $624 million in 2010, the brokerage trustee said in a
July 3 filing in U.S.  Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
