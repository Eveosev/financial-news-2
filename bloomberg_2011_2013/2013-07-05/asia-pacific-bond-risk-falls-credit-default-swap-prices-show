The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 5 basis points to
132 basis points as of 10:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The index is on course for its
lowest close since June 19 and a fall of 5.1 basis points this
week, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  slid 5 basis points to 158.5 as of 8:11
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close since July 2
and a 6.1 basis-point rise this week, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1.5 basis points to
104.5 basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The index is on track for its lowest close since
July 2 and a 5.3 basis-point drop this week, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
