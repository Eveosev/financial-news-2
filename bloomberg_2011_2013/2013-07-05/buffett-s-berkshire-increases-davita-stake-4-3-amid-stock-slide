  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  boosted a stake in  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA)  4.3
percent as the dialysis provider’s stock slid this week on a
proposal to cut U.S. Medicare payments to the industry.  Berkshire bought 639,200 DaVita shares on July 2 and 3 for
about $73.4 million, according to a regulatory filing today by
the Omaha, Nebraska-based investment company. The transactions
left Berkshire and entities it controls with more than 15.6
million shares, the filing shows. Davita, based in Denver, fell
6 percent during those two days after the payment proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
