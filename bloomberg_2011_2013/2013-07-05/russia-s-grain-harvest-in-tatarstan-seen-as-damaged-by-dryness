Russia’s Tatarstan Republic, the
country’s fifth largest grain-growing region, may need grain
from other areas to meet demand after dryness damaged plants,
said Marat Akhmetov, the area’s agriculture minister.  Harvesting starts in a week and there’s a “very low”
amount of moisture in the winter grain seeds, he said in a
report on the ministry’s website today. The region may have just
enough grain, or may need more from other areas, he said without
providing any figures.  It’s the fourth year that the region had dryness and
drought conditions, according to the report. Temperatures will
reach 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) tomorrow in
Tatarstan, which along with other regions in the Volga Federal
District is forecast to have 30 percent less rain than on
average in July, the state weather center said on its  website .  Temperatures in the Volga district are forecast to be 30
degrees to 33 degrees Celsius today and through July 7,
according to the center.  The Volga area accounted for about 21 percent of the 70.7
million metric tons of grains harvested in the country last
year, according to government data.  Tatarstan harvested about 3 million tons of grain last
year, according to state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
