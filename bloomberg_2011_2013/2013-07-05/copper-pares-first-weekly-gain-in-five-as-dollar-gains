Copper pared the first weekly climb
in five as the dollar strengthened after European policy makers
signaled borrowing costs will be kept lower for longer and as
investors awaited U.S. employment data.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange declined as much as 1.3 percent to $6,862.50 a metric
ton and was at $6,872 at 10:20 a.m. in Shanghai. The price rose
1.8 percent this week, the most since the week ended May 3.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to
keep  interest rates  at a record low for an “extended period”
yesterday, after Bank of England chief  Mark Carney  said
increases in market rates weren’t warranted. The  Dollar Index ,
which tracks the greenback against six major peers, jumped 0.8
percent, the most in two weeks. U.S. Labor Department data may
show companies added 165,000 positions last month after
increasing them by 175,000 in May, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  “The strong dollar is adding further pressure on copper
amid an already weak demand picture,” Cao Yanghui, an analyst
at Nanhua Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou. Commodities
priced in dollars tend to move counter to the currency.  Copper for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined 0.6 percent to 49,820  yuan  ($8,133) a ton.
Metal for delivery in September on the Comex fell 1.4 percent to
$3.1310 a pound.  On the LME, nickel and lead dropped, while zinc, tin and
aluminum were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
