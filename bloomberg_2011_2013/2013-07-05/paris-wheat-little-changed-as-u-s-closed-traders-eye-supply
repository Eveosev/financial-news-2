Milling wheat futures were little
changed in Paris as U.S. markets were closed and as traders
weighed signs of importer demand for the grain against an
outlook for bigger harvests in the  Black Sea region .  Russia harvested 10.3 million tons of grains as of July 4,
compared with 5.8 million tons a year ago, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said today. Pakistani importers bought 200,000 tons of
wheat from Russia, Ukraine and Romania, Karachi-based broker
Javed Yaseen Co. said. Trading will resume in Chicago today
after yesterday’s  Independence Day  holiday.  “We’ll have to sit around until this afternoon for a bit
of action, I can’t see Europe doing a lot before then,”  Dave
Norris , an independent U.K. feed trader, wrote on his website.  Wheat for November delivery added 0.1 percent to 197 euros
($253.72) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in the French capital by
11:37 a.m. The grain advanced 1 percent yesterday and 0.8
percent on July 3.  China may step up wheat imports as local output falls, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  Foreign Agricultural Service 
said July 3, while Egypt’s state grain buyer this week bought
180,000 tons in its first foreign wheat purchase since February.  “Markets are supported in the short term in the context of
buying interest in international markets,” Paris-based farm
adviser Agritel wrote.  November-delivery rapeseed slipped 0.2 percent to 397 euros
a ton, while corn for delivery the same month declined 0.1
percent to 177.50 euros a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
