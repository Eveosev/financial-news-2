The European Union and the U.S. will
begin talks on privacy and data protection next week alongside
the first round of free-trade negotiations in  Washington ,
European Commission President Jose Barroso said.  “Our American partners have agreed that these issues that
are a serious concern, relating to some intelligence activities,
will also be the subject of consultations,” Barroso told
reporters in Vilnius today. He said the results of the parallel
talks will be “very important to build and to enforce the
confidence that is necessary also to pursue a very ambitious
agreements” on trade and investment.  EU demands for clarifications come after the German
magazine Der Spiegel ran a story detailing allegations of spying
on EU institutions, both in Washington and New York, by the U.S.
National Security Agency. The allegations were made based on
documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor
who is seeking asylum in order to avoid extradition to face
espionage charges in the U.S.  “We are all very concerned, that has become clear in our
talks today, about certain activities that have happened,”
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on July 3 in Berlin. It’s
“the right idea” to start the processes in parallel, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
