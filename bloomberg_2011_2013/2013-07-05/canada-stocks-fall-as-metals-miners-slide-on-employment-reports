Canadian  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index headed to a weekly loss, after better-than-forecast jobs reports in the U.S. and  Canada  sent raw-materials
producers tumbling.  Torex Gold Resources Inc. and Yamana Gold Inc. slumped at
least 5.5 percent as the precious metal touched a one-week low.
Choice Properties Real Estate Investment Trust, a spinoff of
Loblaw Cos., slipped 1 percent in its first day of trading.
Bankers Petroleum Ltd. and Petrominerales Ltd. climbed more than
2.3 percent as crude rallied to a 14-month high.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 42.59
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,124.07 at 10:08 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge has lost 0.1 percent this week and is off 2.5 percent
for the year.  The  U.S. economy  added 195,000 jobs in June, ahead of
economists’ estimates of 165,000 jobs added in June according to
a Bloomberg survey. Canada lost 400 jobs last month, better than
analysts’ forecasts for a decline of 7,500.  Federal Reserve policy makers said last month they would
trim stimulus before the end of the year if unemployment
continues to fall. The jobs report fueled speculation the Fed
would being to curtail bond purchases in September, boosting the
 U.S. dollar  to the biggest gain in almost eight months.  Six of 10 groups in the S&P/TSX fell, led by a 2.5 percent
plunge among raw-materials producers. Metals prices tumbled
after the dollar advanced, with gold futures sliding to a one-week low. Copper and silver retreated more than 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
