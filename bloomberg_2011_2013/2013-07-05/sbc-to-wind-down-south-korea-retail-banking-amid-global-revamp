HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  plans to wind down
its retail banking and wealth management business in  South Korea 
as it seeks to revive profitability.  Europe ’s biggest lender plans to close 10 of its 11
branches in  Korea  pending regulatory approval, according to a
statement from the London-based bank today. HSBC “remains
committed” to Korea, where it will focus on its global banking
and markets business, it said.  Plans by the U.K. lender to withdraw from retail banking in
Korea suffered a blow when KDB Financial Group Inc. last year
abandoned talks to take over the operation. HSBC Chief Executive
Officer  Stuart Gulliver  has closed or sold at least 52
businesses since he took the job in 2011, including retail
operations in 17 markets, according to the statement.  Consumer banking in South Korea has been constrained by
rising household debt that’s also burdening the economy.
 Borrowing and credit purchases  by Koreans swelled to a record
963.8 trillion won ($844 billion) at the end of 2012, central
bank data show.  President Park Geun Hye, who took office in February, set
up a fund that is aimed at easing households’ debt loads by
purchasing and rescheduling overdue loans.  South Korean regulators are reviewing HSBC’s application,
according to an e-mailed joint statement from the Financial
Services Commission and Financial Supervisory Service.  Shares of HSBC rose 0.7 percent in  London  to 716 pence at
9:24 a.m., outperforming the 0.3 percent gain in the benchmark
FTSE 100 Index and taking their gain this year to 11 percent.  Three Attempts  HSBC has failed in at least three attempts to build up its
Korean retail business since it began operations in 1998. In
1999, the U.K. lender walked away from talks with the Korean
government to buy SeoulBank. In 2005, it lost a bid for Korea
First Bank to Standard Chartered Plc. HSBC also abandoned a $6
billion bid to acquire Korea Exchange Bank in 2008 after
authorities left the transaction in limbo for more than a year.  HSBC in April sold the stake it bought in 2007 in South
Korea’s Hana HSBC Life Insurance Co. back to  Hana Financial
Group Inc. (086790)   The bank plans to keep a branch in the country to serve
existing retail clients and its global banking and markets
business, according to the statement. HSBC, whose history in
Korea dates back to 1897, had 25 trillion won of assets in the
country as of the end of 2011, according to its  website .  KDB, South Korea’s largest state-owned banking group, said
last year that talks on buying HSBC’s local retail business
broke down because of conditions related to employment. KDB in
April 2012 had agreed to buy the lender’s assets and debt at 11
South Korean branches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
