as solar manufacturers rallied and  Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) 
advanced after winning market share.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded

Ltd. (TSL)  surged the most in six weeks on prospects margins will

in costs for raw materials for solar panels, may boost second-quarter profit margins at manufacturers, Bloomberg Industries
said in a report yesterday. The search engine that Qihoo started
in August now has 15 percent of  China ’s market, while  Baidu
Inc. (BIDU) ’s share slid below 70 percent, TechinAsia  reported , citing

said by e-mail. “We are hearing from multiple sources that the
market is picking up.”  The iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest Chinese
