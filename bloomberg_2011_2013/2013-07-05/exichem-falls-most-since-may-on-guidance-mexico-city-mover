Shares of  Mexichem SAB (MEXCHEM*) , Latin
America’s biggest plastic-pipe maker, declined the most in more
than a month following a second-quarter preliminary earnings
report showing profit tumbled.  Mexichem  fell  4.4 percent to 55.40 pesos at 1:41 p.m.
 Mexico  City time, the biggest drop since May 20, after the
company said earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and
amortization probably fell 11 percent to $260 million from a
year earlier. The shares have plunged 24 percent this year.  The company, based in Tlalnepantla, Mexico, said sales were
about $1.36 billion, a 5-percent increase in dollar terms.
Earnings were hurt by coolant gas prices, delays in Latin
American infrastructure projects and an adverse macroeconomic
environment in  Europe , the company said in a statement to the
Mexican stock exchange.  Fernando Perez, an analyst with Corporativo GBM SAB in
Mexico City, said in an e-mailed research note that while the
results didn’t meet his expectations, acquisitions should
bolster earnings going forward.  “We believe that the company should manage to turn around
the negative results through inorganic growth and synergies with
its latest acquisitions,” Perez wrote. “These strategies have
been proven positive in the past.”  He maintained Mexichem’s outperform rating. GBM has a 12-month price target of 71.54 pesos for the shares.  Mexichem will continue to restructure European operations
and carry out “strategic investments” to accelerate growth,
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Carrillo said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
