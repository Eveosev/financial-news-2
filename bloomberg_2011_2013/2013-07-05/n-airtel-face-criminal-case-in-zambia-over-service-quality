Zambia started criminal proceedings
against all three mobile-phone operators in Africa’s biggest
copper producer, saying they failed to meet minimum quality
standards.  Deteriorating service by the local units of  Bharti Airtel
Ltd. (BHARTI) ,  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)  and state-owned Zambia Telecommunication
Co. has made communications difficult, doing business harder,
and led to a public outcry, Lusaka-based Zambia Information and
Technology Authority said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The authority has resolved to take remedial measures
relating to enforcement of quality of service in order to
protect public interest,” it said.  New Delhi-based Airtel is Zambia’s biggest mobile provider
with more 4.6 million subscribers, while  South Africa ’s MTN had
3.47 million subscribers by Sept. 30. The country, with a
population of 13.8 million, has a mobile penetration rate of
nearly 63 percent, according to a  report  by Deloitte and GSMA, a
mobile-operator industry group. Sub-Saharan Africa has the
fastest-growing mobile market in the world, GSMA said.  Chabuka Kawesha, a spokesman for Airtel Zambia, declined to
immediately comment when called on his mobile phone in Lusaka,
as did Kennedy Mambwe, a spokesman for Zamtel.  Rich Mkhondo ,
MTN’s spokesman, also declined to immediately comment when
contacted by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
