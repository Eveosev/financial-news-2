Jefferies Group LLC hired Richard Thoms and Ming Lai from  Citigroup Inc. (C)  as managing directors for
the event-driven desk.  Thoms will be managing director of trading, while Lai will be
managing director of sales, they said in telephone interviews. They
left Citigroup on May 13, and will start at Jefferies on July 8.
Event-driven desks specialize in trading around company changes such
as mergers, spinoffs and bankruptcies.  Jefferies, which was acquired this year by  Leucadia
National Corp. (LUK) , its largest shareholder, has boosted its number
of employees by about 70 percent since the end of 2006 to about
3,800. The firm has lured bankers and traders from the world’s
biggest investment banks, offering year-end bonuses in
immediately available cash.  Thoms and Lai had previously worked at Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and Barclays Plc.  Citigroup CEO  Michael Corbat , who replaced the ousted
Vikram Pandit in October, is firing thousands of workers and
pulling back from some businesses as he seeks to cut costs. The
lender cut investment bankers’ bonuses by 10 percent to 20
percent globally in January, people familiar with the matter
said at the time.  Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos confirmed
Thoms and Lai left the New York-based financial services firm
and said replacements would be named shortly for their
positions. Jefferies spokesman Richard Khaleel had no immediate
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
