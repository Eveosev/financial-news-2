Britain’s opposition Labour Party has
asked the police to investigate whether a union that is one of
its largest financial backers tried to improperly influence the
selection of a candidate for a safe electoral seat in  Scotland .  Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday suspended Karie Murphy,
the Unite union’s preferred candidate for the seat of Falkirk,
after an internal investigation into allegations that the
selection process had been manipulated, with people signed up to
the party without their knowledge. Today the party passed its
findings to the police.  Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey described Murphy’s
suspension as a “stitch-up,” and said he had “no trust” in
the Labour leadership. Tom Watson, a friend of McCluskey, quit
yesterday as the party’s election coordinator, Unite has donated
11.8 million pounds ($17.5 million) of the 60.2 million pounds
Labour has received since the 2010 election.  “The Labour party I lead will select its candidates in a
fair and transparent way,” Miliband told reporters today. “We
will act without fear or favor. Instead of defending what
happened in Falkirk, Len McCluskey should be facing up to his
responsibilities. He should not be defending the machine
politics involving bad practice and malpractice that went on.”  Prime Minister David Cameron made much of the Falkirk row
during his weekly exchanges with Miliband in Parliament
yesterday, repeatedly saying in answers to questions on
different subjects that the Labour leader wasn’t standing up to
McCluskey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
