Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold  North Sea 
Forties at a five-month high after the latest loading program
showed August exports of the grade will decline to the least in
10 months. No buying interest for Russian Urals emerged for a
second day after the blend’s differential in the Mediterranean
stayed at the highest in at least 20 years.  Daily exports in August of North Sea Brent, Forties,
Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes, which make up the Dated Brent
benchmark, will fall 11 percent from July, loading programs
obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  will shut its Alvheim field in the North
Sea for nine days of maintenance from Aug. 16, Ingvar Solberg, a
company spokesman based in Stavanger,  Norway , said in an e-mailed response to questions.  North Sea  Shell sold Forties cargo F0713 for July 19 to July 21 to  BP
Plc (BP/)  at a premium of 40 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, 5 cents
higher than yesterday, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. That was the
highest price since Jan. 22.  This cargo was deferred by three days, said two traders
with knowledge of the loading program.  Total SA (FP)  failed to buy Forties for July 21 to July 25 at 35
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, while Morgan Stanley was
unable to purchase a shipment for the same period at a premium
of 30 cents, the survey showed.  Statoil ASA (STL)  didn’t manage to buy Forties for July 27 to
July 31 at 30 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent and Mercuria
Energy Trading SA sought to purchase, without success, at a  35-cent premium for July 29 to July 31, according to the survey.  BP didn’t manage to buy a second consignment for July 19 to
July 25 at 31 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey
showed.  There were no bids or offers for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was 43 cents more than Dated Brent, compared with
a premium of 44 cents yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $107.01 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $105.21 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $106.26 at the same time today, a discount of 75
cents to August.  Shipments of BFOE grades will average 754,839 barrels a day
next month, versus 851,613 barrels in July, according to the
plans.  Loadings of Forties crude are set to fall to 13 cargoes,
from 19 this month, because of a five-day planned shutdown of
the Forties Pipeline System. The maintenance is scheduled to
begin Aug. 1, according to a statement on the website of BP,
which operates the pipeline.  Exports of Aasgard will be steady at seven cargoes of
855,000 barrels each in August, while loadings of Statfjord will
drop to four shipments, including three lots of 800,000 barrels
and one of 855,000 barrels, compared with six in July, according
to loading plans.  Gullfaks crude exports will rise to seven cargoes of
800,000 barrels each, one more than July, a program showed.  Marathon Oil will also shut production at Volund and Vilje
fields, which feed into Alvheim’s floating production, storage
and offloading, or FPSO, vessel, Solberg said.  Alvheim’s exports for August will be unchanged at four
cargoes of 780,000 barrels each, a shipping schedule showed.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals in the Mediterranean was unchanged at a premium of 73
cents a barrel to Dated Brent, matching the highest level since
at least July 1991, when Bloomberg started tracking the data. In
northwest Europe, the  grade  rose by 1 cent to 40 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent.  OAO Bashneft offered one 140,000-metric-ton cargo per month
for loading from July through September from Novorossiysk on the
 Black Sea , say two traders who participate in the market, asking
not to be identified as the information is confidential. The
July cargo is for loading on July 18 to July 19, they said. The
tender closed today.  West Africa  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe rose 3 cents to $2.33 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
