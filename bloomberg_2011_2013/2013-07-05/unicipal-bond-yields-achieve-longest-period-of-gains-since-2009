Yields in the $3.7 trillion U.S.
municipal-bond market remained close to their highest level
since 2011 as employment increased more than forecast in June
and the U.S. jobless rate held close to a four-year low.  The interest rate on benchmark munis maturing in 10 years
was little changed today, rising about 0.01 percentage point to
2.76 percent as of noon in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Yields, the money that investors demand to hold the debt,
have increased for the past eight weeks, the longest period of
gains since at least 2009.  Yields on U.S. Treasuries maturing in 10 years jumped 19
basis points, climbing as high as 2.7 percent amid growing
concern that the Federal Reserve will trim bond purchases before
year end as unemployment falls and the economy gains momentum. A
basis point is equal to 0.01 percentage point.  With states and cities poised to sell about $7.4 billion in
debt next week, more than double the previous week’s total,
rising interest rates may challenge underwriters’ ability to
price issues.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if, again, a couple of deals will
be postponed,” said Ken Kollar, a trader with Arbor Research &
Trading Inc. in New York.  Top-rated issuers  Georgia  and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority in New York, which operates the biggest
U.S. transit system, delayed or canceled sales last month as
sales were the slowest since 2011.  Today, the Labor Department in  Washington  reported that
payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a second-straight month.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000
gain after a 175,000 increase in May. The  jobless rate  stayed at
7.6 percent, while hourly earnings in the year ended in June
advanced by the most since July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
