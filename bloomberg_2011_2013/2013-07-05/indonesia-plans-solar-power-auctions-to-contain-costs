Indonesia plans to use auctions to
award solar-power projects, taking a cue from countries such as
 India  and  Brazil  where competitive bidding has helped drive down
the cost of renewable energy.  Developers will bid at a discount to the state-set top
price of 25 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour of production, Alihuddin
Sitompul, director for new energy and renewable energy at the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said in an e-mail.  Emerging economies including India, Brazil and  South Africa 
are favoring clean-energy tenders to avoid the spiraling
subsidies seen in Europe, where nations set above-market tariffs
for wind and solar farms. The cost of solar in India and wind in
Brazil fell about 40 percent in the past three years, according
to average bids compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Winners of the Indonesian auction will sign 20-year
contracts to sell power to state utility PT Perusahaan Listrik
Negara, according to Sitompul. Projects must be built in 18
months, he said this week.  Indonesia  hasn’t announced when the first auction will be
held. The  government  plans to auction 172.5 megawatts of
capacity at 72 locations, Rida Mulyana, the ministry’s director-general of new, renewable and conservation energy, said in
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
