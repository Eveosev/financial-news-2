Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ’s
largest shareholder has decided to sue two of the Italian bank’s
former managers including ex chairman Giuseppe Mussari as well
as  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  over the alleged
use of derivatives to mask losses.  Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena took the decision at a
meeting of its council today, it said in an e-mailed statement.
The banking foundation will also support Monte Paschi in its
lawsuits.  Last month a judge approved the request by Siena
prosecutors to try Mussari and two other former managers on
charges that they helped hide a document that showed how the
world’s oldest bank entered into a derivative deal. The judge
scheduled a trial for Sept. 26 in an accelerated procedure,
according to three people with direct knowledge of the case, who
asked not to be identified because the decision hasn’t been made
public.  The expedited trial will demonstrate that Mussari is
innocent, his lawyer Tullio Padovani said by phone on June 11.
Spokesmen for Nomura and Deutsche Bank couldn’t immediately be
reached outside business hours. The two banks have both denied
any wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
