The Dollar Index climbed to the
highest level since 2010 after U.S. employers added more jobs
than forecast in June, fueling bets the  Federal Reserve  will
begin slowing unprecedented monetary stimulus.  The gauge, which  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  uses to
track the greenback versus six U.S. trade partners’ currencies,
has gained 4.8 percent since June 18, the day before Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may begin cutting
bond buying this year if growth continues. Today’s data gave him
reason to maintain his timetable. The pound slid on wagers the
 Bank of England  is ready to do more to aid the U.K. recovery.  “These are really strong numbers, and there was an
expected strong-dollar response across the board,” Dan Dorrow,
head of research at Faros Trading LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut ,
said of the U.S. data in a telephone interview. “This suggests
tapering sooner rather than later because the cumulative strong
momentum is there.”  The Dollar Index advanced 1.5 percent to 84.448 at 5 p.m.
in New York. It jumped as much as 1.6 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since November 2011, to 84.530, the highest level
since July 13, 2010. The gauge rose 1.6 percent over the past
five days in its third weekly increase, the longest winning
stretch since March.  The dollar appreciated 0.7 percent to $1.2829 per euro and
touched $1.2806, its strongest level since May 17. The greenback
rose 1.2 percent to 101.20 yen and reached 101.23, the highest
since May 31. The Japanese currency declined 0.5 percent to
129.82 per euro.  ECB, England  The 17-nation currency fell yesterday versus the greenback
as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to keep
rates at a record-low 0.5 percent for an extended period.  Sterling slid to the lowest since March against the dollar
after the Bank of  England , led by newly installed Governor  Mark
Carney , signaled yesterday policy makers will keep rates at a
record low for longer than investors had anticipated.  “ He wanted to draw attention to the fact that the
recovery is very nascent, very fragile,” said Jane Foley, a
senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in  London .
“That leaves the pound weaker.”  The U.K. currency slid 1.2 percent to $1.4890 and reached
$1.4858, the lowest level since March 12. The pound lost 0.6
percent to 86.18 pence per euro after touching 86.33 yesterday,
the weakest since April 17.  ‘Stronger Dollar’  There’s “a stronger dollar ahead, but not U.S.-growth
friendly,” as the ECB and BOE ease while Fed tapering looms,
 Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest fixed-income fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in a Twitter post.  The krone dropped for the first time in three days against
the dollar after  Statistics Norway  said the nation’s
 manufacturing production  declined 2.1 percent in May. The
Norwegian currency tumbled 2.3 percent to 6.2516 against the
dollar and touched 6.2654, the weakest since September 2010.  The dollar has strengthened 8.1 percent this year, the best
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has tumbled 8.9
percent, while the euro has advanced 4.8 percent.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $28 billion, compared with $18 billion yesterday and $33
billion on July 3, according to data reported by U.S. banks to
the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg.
Volume in options on the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to
$5.9 billion, the largest share of trades at 21.2 percent. Euro-dollar options totaled $5.5 billion, or 19.7 percent.  U.S. financial markets were closed yesterday for the
Independence Day holiday.  Below Average  Dollar-yen options trading was 38 percent below the average
for the past five Fridays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options trading was
93 percent above average.  U.S. payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a second straight
month, the Labor Department reported today in  Washington . The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain
after a previously reported 175,000 increase in May. The  jobless
rate  stayed at 7.6 percent, almost a four-year low.  “Coming into today, our call for a December first-taper
was already probably a little underwater, and after today’s
report we are moving to a call for a first reduction in asset
purchases at the September FOMC meeting,”  Michael Feroli , chief
U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a client note,
referring to the policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee .  Fed Purchases  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
bonds each month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs in
the third round of its quantitative-easing stimulus program. It
purchased $2.3 trillion of assets from 2008 to 2011 in the first
two rounds. The purchases tend to debase the currency.  Bernanke said June 19 after an FOMC meeting the Fed may
reduce the buying this year and end it in mid-2014 if growth
meets policy makers’ estimates. Fed officials forecast expansion
of as much as 2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014. A
plurality of economists in a June 19-20 Bloomberg survey said
the central bank will slow purchases at its Sept. 17-18 meeting.  Policy makers have also kept the key  interest-rate  target
at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy.  The probability of a rate increase of at least a quarter-percentage point by the Fed’s December 2014 meeting rose to 57
percent, from 39 percent on June 5, according to fed-funds
futures data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bernanke said June 19 a rate increase is “far in the
future.” The Fed has said it will keep the rate at almost zero
as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and the
outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
