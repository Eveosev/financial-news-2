German stocks  climbed, extending
yesterday’s biggest advance for the  DAX (DAX)  Index in more than two
months, before a U.S. non-farm payrolls report that may
influence the Federal Reserve’s stimulus policy.  Commerzbank AG and Deutsche Bank AG both gained as a gauge
of lenders in the euro region climbed for a second day. Lanxess
AG and BASF SE also rose.  The DAX added 0.2 percent to 8,012.65 at 9:46 a.m. in
Frankfurt, extending its rally in the last two days to 2.3
percent after the European Central Bank pledged accommodative
monetary policy for the foreseeable future. The broader HDAX
Index also advanced 0.2 percent today.  Today’s U.S. data at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  may show
employers added 165,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate
fell to 7.5 percent, matching the lowest level since 2008,
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A sustained
improvement in the labor market may influence how quickly the
Fed pares its $85 billion monthly asset purchases.  The DAX had declined as much as 9.8 percent from its record
on May 22 when the Fed signaled it may pare stimulus if the U.S.
economy strengthens in line with its forecasts. The gauge has
since pared its retreat to 6 percent.  Investors also awaited German factory orders data. The
report, due at noon in  Frankfurt , may show orders increased 1.2
percent in May, after dropping 2.3 percent in the previous
month, according to economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
