Thailand’s baht headed for a weekly
decline on concerns over slowing growth in  China  and the Federal
Reserve’s plans to cut stimulus if the U.S. economy improves.
Government bonds gained.  The nation’s exports fell 5.3 percent in May after rising
2.9 percent in April, with shipments to China, the country’s
largest export market, sliding 16 percent, official data showed
on June 26. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the
greenback against 10 major currencies, gained for a second day
after data from ADP Employer Services yesterday showed U.S.
companies added more jobs in June than forecast.  The baht weakened 0.3 percent this week to 31.14 per dollar
as of 9:08 a.m. in Bangkok, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
currency, which dropped 0.16 percent today, lost 1.8 percent
this year. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, declined 92
basis points, or 0.92 percentage point, to 7.11 percent this
week. The gauge fell 14 basis points today.  “Asian currencies will be cautious heading into monthly
data releases next week” particularly from China, said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
 Singapore . Signs of an improvement in the U.S. economy
“reinforces the notion of a stronger dollar trend,” he added.  China’s non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index
slipped to 53.9 last month from 54.3 in May, official data
showed on July 3. The nation suspended the release of industry-specific data from a monthly survey of manufacturing purchasing
managers, with an official saying yesterday that there’s limited
time to analyze the large volume of responses.  China is
scheduled to release data on exports and new  yuan  loans in the
period July 10 to 15.  Bonds Gain  Government bonds headed for a second weekly gain as data
from the Thai Bond Market Association showed foreigners were  net
buyers  of local assets this week through yesterday, purchasing
$126 million more than they sold.  The yield on the 3.625 percent debt due June 2023 dropped
two basis points in the past five days to 3.74 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate fell one basis
point today.  Thailand ’s finance ministry cut the nation’s 2013 economic
growth forecast to a range of 4 percent to 5 percent on June 27,
from 4.8 percent to 5.8 percent, citing the slow recovery of
trade partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
