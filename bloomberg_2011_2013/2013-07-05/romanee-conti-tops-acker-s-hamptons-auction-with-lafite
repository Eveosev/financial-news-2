Two magnums of Romanee-Conti 1988
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy sold for $39,360 at an
Acker Merrall & Condit auction, taking top slot ahead of a case
of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 and wines from  Harlan Estate .  The 12 bottles of Lafite, a first-growth Bordeaux from
Pauillac, sold for $34,440 while seven half-cases of Harlan
Estate Red from  California ’s Napa Valley, spanning vintages from
1991 to 1997, fetched $29,520, according to Acker’s  website .  The sale raised a total $3.4 million as demand persisted
for rarer Burgundies and landmark vintages from top Bordeaux
growers. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 5 percent this
year, with a 3 percent decline since mid-March following a gain
of 8 percent in the previous 10 weeks.  “The market’s still pretty healthy and active,” Acker Chief
Executive Officer  John Kapon  said in a telephone interview. The
first-half of the year has “ended on a bit of an uptick heading
into the fall.”  The sale, held at Bridgehampton,  New York , on June 29,
brought Acker’s total sold at auction so far this year to $33.5
million, compared with $46 million it reported in July last
year. That reflected pressure on wine auction volumes globally
after a 17-month slide in Bordeaux prices ending last November.  The presence of a Harlan lot in the sale’s top three
mirrored broader interest in Californian wines, with four three-bottle lots of Screaming Eagle  Cabernet Sauvignon  2007 fetching
$6,765 each.  “California’s been very healthy recently,” Kapon said. “It
has its loyal and devoted collectors.”  Acker sales resume in New York on Sept. 7 and  Hong Kong  a
week later.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
this year, with the total sold. Links are to auction websites or
