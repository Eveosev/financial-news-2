Pope Francis approved John Paul II
for sainthood by officially recognizing a miracle attributed to
the deceased former pontiff.  Francis decided to convene a meeting of cardinals to
canonize John Paul, the Polish prelate known as Karol Wojtyla
before his reign as pope from 1978 until his death in 2005, the
Vatican said today on its  website .  John Paul was beatified in 2011 under Francis’s
predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. The miracle certified by Francis
wasn’t specified in the Vatican bulletin. It was the second
recognized by the Vatican after the curing of a French nun from
Parkinson’s disease, from which John Paul also suffered.  When Wojtyla was elected in 1978, he became the first pope
from  Poland  and took advantage of his position as the head of
the world’s billion Catholics to denounce totalitarianism and
promote personal freedom and human rights. Poles credit him for
helping hasten the fall of Communist regimes throughout the
former Soviet bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
