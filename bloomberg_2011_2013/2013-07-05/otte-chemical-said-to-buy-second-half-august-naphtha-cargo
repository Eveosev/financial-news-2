Lotte Chemical Corp. (011170)  bought a naphtha
cargo for delivery to South Korea in the second half of August,
said three traders who participate in the market.  The Seoul-based company purchased 25,000 metric tons
earlier this week at a premium of about $4 a ton to Japan
prices, the traders said, asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
