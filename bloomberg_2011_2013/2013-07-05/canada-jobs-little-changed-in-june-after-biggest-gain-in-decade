Canadian  employment  was little
changed in June, government figures showed, following the
biggest gain in a decade the month before.  Employment fell by 400 last month after May’s surge of
95,000 while the  jobless rate  was unchanged at 7.1 percent,
Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  projected a 7,500 job decline and an unchanged
jobless rate, according to median forecasts of surveys with 20
responses.  “It’s a flat number but it’s probably the most shocking
flat number we have seen in a while,” said  Jimmy Jean , a fixed-income strategist at Desjardins Capital Markets in  Montreal .
“The concern was we were going to see a big payback after a
strong month,” he said. “I was skeptical we could even hang on
and we did that.”  The report adds to other evidence of an inconsistent
expansion, including a record string of 17 monthly  trade
deficits  and inflation that has been below the central bank’s 2
percent target for more than a year. Jean said future job gains
will probably be closer to a range of between 10,000 and 20,000
than the 95,000 recorded in May.  The Canadian dollar fell to the lowest since October 2011
after the job decline contrasted with a U.S. payrolls gain of
195,000. The currency fell 0.7 percent to C$1.0583 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:44 a.m. in Toronto. One dollar buys 94.49 U.S.
cents.  Government bonds  fell, with the yield on the two-year
benchmark rising 5 basis points to 1.23 percent and the 10-year
climbing 14 basis points to 2.55 percent.  Slowing Gains  Canada’s job gains have slowed so far this year, with the
average monthly gain of 14,000 less than the 27,000 recorded in
the second half of last year,  Statistics Canada  said.  Full-time employment fell by 32,400 in June, following a
76,700 gain the prior month. Part-time positions rose by 32,200,
Statistics Canada said.  Private companies cut 5,300 workers last month after May’s
94,600 increase, while public-sector employment rose by 1,000.  By industry, construction employment rose by 1,400 in June
after May’s gain of 42,700. The biggest rise was the 27,000
increase for professional, scientific and technical workers and
declines were led by accommodation and food services at 20,300.  Workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees fell
by 4,400 after May’s 101,200 surge. The self-employed category
rose by 4,000.  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 2 percent
in June from a year earlier, matching the prior reading.  Curb Spending  Consumer spending  underpinned by  job creation  and a housing
boom has led growth in the world’s 11th largest economy since
the global financial crisis of 2008. Bank of Canada Governor
Stephen Poloz has said households should curb record debts and
the expansion needs to be led by business spending and exports.  “We spent our way through the crisis and recouped our lost
jobs earlier than the U.S. did,” said  Derek Holt , Scotiabank’s
vice president of economics in Toronto. “The U.S. is going to
be leading Canada on growth as they unleash pent-up demand.”  Unemployment will remain close to where it is now over the
next year, according to a Bloomberg economist survey that
forecasts a 6.9 percent rate for the third quarter of next year.  The compilation of the report was slowed in  Alberta  by
flooding last month, which appears to have had a “negligible”
impact on the results, Statistics Canada said. The next job
survey will add special questions on the impact of the flooding
on hours worked in the oil-rich western province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
