U.K. gilts fell for the first time
in five weeks as Bank of England minutes signaled policy makers
won’t cut interest rates and showed they voted 8-1 to halt their
asset-purchase program, or quantitative easing, this month.  The pound depreciated for a second week versus the euro
amid optimism European policy makers are taking steps to stem
 Greece ’s fiscal crisis. Sterling advanced against the dollar for
the first time in a month on bets U.S. lawmakers will forge a
deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic spending
cuts and tax increases, damping demand for the world’s reserve
currency. The 10-year gilt yield climbed to the  highest level  in
three weeks.  “The minutes were quite bearish for gilts, suggesting the
bar for more QE has been set higher,” said Jason Simpson, a
rates strategist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  in London. “They also
expressly ruled out a near-term rate cut and seem to be moving
to a new view on the economy that more QE is not going to solve
the underlying economic growth issues.”  The benchmark  10-year gilt  yield climbed 11 basis points,
or 0.11 percentage point, this week to 1.84 percent as of 5 p.m.
London time yesterday, the first weekly increase since Oct. 19.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.99, or 9.90
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,603) face amount, to 99.18. The rate
rose to 1.87 percent on Nov. 22, the highest since Nov. 2.  BOE Minutes  The minutes released on Nov. 21 showed that policy maker
David Miles dissented from the majority on the nine-member
Monetary Policy Committee, calling for a 25 billion-pound
increase in the bond-purchase  target  to 400 billion pounds. The
committee voted unanimously to keep its benchmark interest rate
at a  record-low  0.5 percent and said it was “unlikely to
reduce” it in the foreseeable future.  The pound fell 0.8 percent from Nov. 16 to 80.84 pence per
euro. It reached 81.09 pence yesterday, the weakest level since
Oct. 24. The U.K. currency rose 0.9 percent this week to
$1.6028, its first weekly advance since Oct. 26.  Sterling has weakened 1.9 percent in the past six months,
the third-worst performer after the yen and the dollar of the 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The yen fell 7.9 percent, the dollar dropped
4.2 percent and the euro slid 1 percent.  A report due to be published on Nov. 27 will show the U.K.
 gross domestic product  grew 1 percent in the third quarter,
confirming an earlier reading, according to the median estimate
of 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The data comes
after Prime Minister David Cameron defended the U.K.’s demand
for a budget rebate in talks with European leaders yesterday.  Gilts returned 2.6 percent this year through Nov. 22,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.4 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
