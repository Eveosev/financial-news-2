Workers at 30  oil wells  in the
western Venezuelan state of Zulia have gone on strike,
paralyzing production,  El Universal reported , citing union
leader Luis Diaz.  The workers say they haven’t been awarded retroactive pay
of 29 million bolivars ($6.75 million) due collectively since
July following the renegotiation of contracts, the Caracas-based
newspaper reported.  Houston-based  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , Maracaibo-based Petrosema
CA, Kuala Lumpur-based Scomi Group Bhd. and Tuboscope Brandt de
Venezuela SA have told workers they can’t pay them while they
haven’t been paid themselves by state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, El Universal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
