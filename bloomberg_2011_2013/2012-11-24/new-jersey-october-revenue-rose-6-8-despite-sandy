New Jersey  collected $1.9 billion in
tax revenue last month, up 6.8 percent from October 2011, even
though superstorm Sandy depressed receipts from casinos, the
state treasurer’s office said.  While revenue is up 3.4 percent for the first four months
of fiscal 2013 compared with the same period a year earlier,
receipts still trail budget forecasts by $263.8 million, or
about 4.1 percent. The spending plan projected $31.8 billion.  Gross income-tax collections, the state’s largest revenue
source, climbed to almost $890.6 million, or 25 percent more
than in October 2011, according to a statement from Treasurer
Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff. Receipts from the levy exceeded
projections for the month by 4.2 percent, he said. Revenue from
the tax has topped budgeted amounts by 1.6 percent year to date.  “The strength of the income-tax revenue is striking and
reflects sustained growth in personal incomes going into the
storm,”  Charles Steindel , the Treasury Department’s chief
economist, said in the press release.  Sandy, which battered the state Oct. 29, came ashore near
 Atlantic City , home to casinos that produce more revenue than
any other group in the U.S. outside of  Las Vegas , after weather
forecasters had been predicting a devastating “Frankenstorm”
for days. The storm affected revenue from gambling operations,
as well as sales-tax receipts and state lottery sales, Sidamon-
Eristoff said. Sandy’s full effects will be better gauged in
November’s figures, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
