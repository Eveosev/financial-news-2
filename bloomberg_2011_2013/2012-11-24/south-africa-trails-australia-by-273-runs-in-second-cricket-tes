Rory Kleinveldt claimed three late
wickets as South Africa kept alive its chance of winning the
second cricket Test against Australia in Adelaide.  Kleinveldt took 3-14 yesterday as Australia was reduced to
111-5 at stumps on day three to lead by 273 runs.  Dale Steyn  and
Morne Morkel also took a wicket each after the host team started
its second innings 77-0.  Earlier, Faf du Plessis scored 78 and Jacques Kallis had 58
as South Africa finished with 388 in response to Australia’s
first-innings’ 550. The two shared a 93-run partnership to
rescue the Proteas from 250-7.  Australia resumes today with Michael Clarke on nine and
 Michael Hussey  on five.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
