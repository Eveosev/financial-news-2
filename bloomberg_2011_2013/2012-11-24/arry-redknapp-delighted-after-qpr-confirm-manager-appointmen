QPR confirmed it has appointed
 Harry Redknapp  as its new manager on a two-and-a-half year
contract.  The former Tottenham boss replaces  Mark Hughes , who was
sacked by the Premier League’s bottom side yesterday.  “I’m delighted to be back in the managerial hot-seat at
QPR,” Redknapp said in a  statement  on the club’s website today.
“When I spoke to the shareholders and they told me about their
plans, I knew this was too good an opportunity to turn down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
