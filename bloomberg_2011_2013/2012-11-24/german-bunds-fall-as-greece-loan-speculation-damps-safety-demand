Germany ’s bunds fell for the first
week in five as optimism European leaders are taking steps to
stem  Greece ’s fiscal crisis damped demand for the euro-area’s
safest assets.  Ten-year yields rose to the highest in two weeks before
euro-area finance ministers hold a conference call today to
prepare for a Nov. 26 meeting on an updated aid package for
Greece. While making “good progress” at talks in Brussels on
Nov. 20-21, European Union lawmakers differed over how to plug a
14 billion-euro ($18.1 billion) gap in a Greek debt-reduction
plan, German finance minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said in Berlin
on Nov. 21. Greece’s 10-year yields fell to an eight-month low.  “There are expectations of an agreement on loans to be
released for Greece and that has driven bund yields higher,”
said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING
Groep NV in Amsterdam. “I expect the selloff will continue and
yields to move towards the upper-end of the trading range around
1.60 percent by year-end.”  German 10-year bund  yields  climbed 11 basis points from
Nov. 16 to 1.44 percent at 5 p.m. London time yesterday, after
rising to 1.45 percent, the highest level since Nov. 7. The 1.5
percent bond maturing in September 2022 dropped 0.96, or 9.60
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.58. The  two-year  yield
rose three basis points in the week to minus 0.002 percent,
after reaching 0.017 percent on Nov. 22, the most since Nov. 2.  At the Brussels gathering, finance ministers failed to
tackle the dual task of steering the extra funding to Greece
while finding a way to tame the resulting increase in the
nation’s debt.  Greek Loans  Greece, facing a sixth year of recession in 2013, has been
negotiating with the euro area and  International Monetary Fund 
over the steps needed to qualify for the release of loan
instalments frozen since June.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on Nov. 21 she saw a
chance for a Greek aid deal as soon as next week, while
Schaeuble said the Eurogroup is united on the idea of a bond
buyback for Greece, although some “technical questions”
remained open.  The yield on Greece’s 2 percent bond maturing in February
2023 plunged to the lowest since the nation’s debt was
restructured in March. The rate dropped 1 percentage point this
week to 16.48 percent after falling to 16.10 percent on Nov. 22.  France ’s 10-year bond yields climbed nine basis points from
Nov. 16 to 2.16 percent, the biggest increase in seven weeks,
after Moody’s Investors Service lowered the nation’s credit
rating by one level to Aa1 from Aaa on Nov. 19, citing a
worsening economic growth outlook.  Standard & Poor’s  affirmed
the country’s AA+ rating in a statement yesterday and maintained
a negative outlook on its debt.  German bonds returned 3.4 percent this year through Nov.
22, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish debt also
earned 3.4 percent and French securities gained 8.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
