ArcelorMittal (MT)  may eliminate as many
as 400 jobs at its Liege plants after unions refused to accept
planned cutbacks, L’Echo  reported , citing the company and trade
unions.  ArcelorMittal told unions yesterday that it was starting an
employment commission to cut staff, L’Echo said. The newspaper
cited Bernard Dehut, the head of ArcelorMittal’s Liege unit, as
saying the unions were denying economic realities by rejecting
an earlier social plan that would have cut 86 jobs.  Some 12,000 metric tons of steel deliveries have been
delayed by workers’ blockades at the Liege plants since the
start of November, L’Echo said.  Giles Read, a spokesman for ArcelorMittal in  London , didn’t
immediately return voice messages and an e-mail seeking comment.
The FGTB Metal Liege trade union didn’t immediately respond to a
call and an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
