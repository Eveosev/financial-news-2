Tina Maze  of Slovenia won her second
consecutive World Cup skiing giant slalom as  Lindsey Vonn 
finished 21st in her return to the slopes.  Maze, 29, had a combined time of 1 minute, 59.39 seconds
for two runs in Aspen, Colorado, to beats  Austria ’s Kathrin
Zettel by 0.90 seconds. It was the same top-two finish as at
last month’s season-opening race in Austria and keeps Maze at
the top of the overall World Cup standings.  Vonn, a 28-year-old American, was racing for the first time
since being hospitalized three days last week with severe
intestinal pain. The four-time World Cup overall champion was in
10th place after her opening run, but had the third-slowest
second pass.  Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal beat Austria’s Max Franz by
0.64 seconds to take the first men’s downhill of the season in
Lake Louise, Alberta. It was the 17th World Cup victory for the
29-year-old.  Austria’s Klauss Kroell, the defending World Cup downhill
champion, and American Marco Sullivan tied for third.  The women will race a slalom tomorrow in Aspen, while the
men run a super-G in Lake Louise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
