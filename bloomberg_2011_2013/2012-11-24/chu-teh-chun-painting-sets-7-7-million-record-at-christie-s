An abstract oil painting by 20th-
century Chinese-French master Chu Teh-Chun sold for HK$60
million ($7.7 million) at Christie’s International in Hong Kong
today, setting an auction record for the artist.  The work, entitled “La foret blanche II,” is a 1987 oil
on canvas diptych measuring 1.3 meters by 3.9 meters. It was
sold to a telephone buyer after five minutes of fierce bidding
against an Asian woman in the saleroom.  The artist’s previous top price was $5.9 million at a
 Sotheby’s (BID)  Hong Kong auction in 2009, according to the  Artnet 
database. Chu was born in China in 1922 and moved to Paris in
1955.  Muse highlights include  Richard Vines  on food,  Jeremy
Gerard  on New York theater,  Robert Heller  on music and  Greg
Evans  on film.  To contact the writer on the story:
