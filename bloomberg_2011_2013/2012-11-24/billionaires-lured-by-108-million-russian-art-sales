Russian art valued at as much as
67.8 million pounds ($109 million) will go on sale in London
starting this weekend.  Auction houses are attempting to lure the U.K. capital’s
growing population of wealthy residents from  Russia  and the
former  Commonwealth of Independent States .  At the height of the previous art-market boom in 2007,
auctions of Russian works at Sotheby’s, Christie’s International
and MacDougall’s raised almost 100 million pounds.  Demand subsequently cooled as buyers’ tastes became more
international and questions were raised over the authenticity of
some of works offered for sale.  “Back then, they were buying just about anything signed in
Cyrillic,” the London-based art adviser  Wendy Goldsmith  said in
an interview. “Then they got clever, asked themselves why they
were paying so much for these things and bought in other areas.
There was also the issue of fakes.”  This latest series of auctions will test whether the market
has been reinvigorated by an influx of new residents in London.
The population of Russian and former C.I.S. nationals living in
the U.K. capital and south-east  England  has increased to as many
as 500,000, the Art Newspaper said this month.  England’s schools, luxury real estate and tax regime have
become an increasingly powerful magnet for oligarchs and their
families.  Highly Valued  Specialist auction house  MacDougall’s  has the most highly
valued sale. In two parts on Nov. 25 and Nov. 28, it carries an
estimate of 17.8 million pounds to 27.1 million pounds.  Mikhail Larionov’s impressionistic 1904 interior “Une
journee de mai” is priced at 900,000 pounds to 2 million
pounds.  Christie’s and Sotheby’s auctions on Nov. 26 and Nov. 27
are estimated to raise as much as 16.3 million pounds and 24.4
million pounds respectively. The Christmassy 1923 Boris
Kustodiev canvas “The Coachman,” showing a bearded figure
standing in sunlit snow, is the star at Christie’s, valued at
1.5 million pounds to 2 million pounds.  Sotheby’s (BID)  has a large-scale Vasily Vereshchagin painting
inspired by the Russo-Turkish war, “Transportation of the
Wounded.” Widely exhibited in the U.S. in the 1880’s, this is
priced at 800,000 pounds to 1.2 million pounds.  Art Fund  Moscow-based billionaire Andrei Filatov has set up a fund
to buy Soviet works that left Russia after the collapse of the
U.S.S.R. in 1991.  Co-owner of the port and railway company N-Trans, Filatov
plans to buy between 10 and 12 works a year. The Socialist
Realist pieces, dating from between 1917 to 1991, will be made
available for public view to further the understanding of the
art of the period, the billionaire said in an email.  A plaster model for Vera Mukhina’s landmark stainless steel
sculpture “Worker and Kolkhoz Woman” made for the 1937 World’s
Fair in Paris, and subsequently moved to Moscow, are among the
works that have so far been acquired.  Filatov has been collecting this type of art for the last
five years, spending about $100 million. The billionaire said in
an e-mail that he couldn’t divulge how much he’d invest
annually.  Paris Wine  The Paris restaurant La Tour d’Argent is selling bottles of
Cognac and other spirits, some of which are more than 200 years
old.  Christie’s will be offering 180 lots of digestifs from the
cellars of the Seine-side haunt for celebrities since  1582 , in
its pre-Christmas auction of wines and spirits in  London  on Dec.
13-14. The collection is estimated to raise more than 160,000
pounds.  “It is unusual for our diners to request some of our
rarest and oldest spirits, and without wishing for such premium
spirits to be left forgotten, we requested  Christie’s  help in
ensuring these excellent bottles are enjoyed by those who will
truly appreciate them,” Andre Terrail, owner of La Tour
d’Argent, wrote in an emailed note.  Two dust-caked jeroboams (each equivalent to 2.5 liters) of
1805 Grande Fine Champagne Cognac “La Tour d’Argent” carry
estimates of 10,000 pounds to 15,000 pounds each. They were
bottled on-site at the restaurant during the same year as
Napoleon’s victory at the Battle of Austerlitz.  A bottle of 1788 Vieux Cognac Grande Fine Champagne “Clos
de Griffier” Cafe Anglais is priced at 3,000 pounds to 4,000
pounds. It is one of the oldest wines or spirits ever offered at
Christie’s, the London-based auction house said.  Muse highlights include  Richard Vines  on food,  Jeremy
Gerard  on  New York  theater,  Robert Heller  on music and  Greg
Evans  on film.  To contact the writer on the story:
