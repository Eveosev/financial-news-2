A case of Romanee-Conti 1988 Domaine
de la Romanee-Conti fetched HK$1.05 million ($135,100) and six
bottles of the 1995 sold for HK$511,700 as the Burgundy vintner
swept seven of the top eight lots at a  Bonhams   Hong Kong  sale.  The Bonhams auction on Nov. 21 followed sales in the city
by Zachys and Acker, Merrall & Condit earlier this month, with
the three events raising a total of $14 million.  The focus of Chinese investors has switched to rarer
Burgundy vintages from top Bordeaux wines as collectors seek
greater variation for their cellars. Three bottles of 2005
Romanee-Conti brought a record HK$541,200 at the Acker sale.  “Burgundy’s been very strong,”  John Kapon , Acker’s chief
executive officer, said in a telephone interview from  New York .
“DRC catches a lot of the headlines. It’s a big chunk of the
Burgundy market by itself.”  Following are auction results this year from the five
biggest houses: New York-based Acker Merrall & Condit Company
Inc., Christie’s, based in London,  Sotheby’s (BID) , with its
headquarters in New York,  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  of Chicago
and Zachys in  White Plains , New York. Internet-only auctions
aren’t included.  Links on auction-house names are to results or catalogs on
their websites, while those on city names are to post-sale
statements where available.
