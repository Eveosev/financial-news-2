Quicksilver Resources Inc. (KWK)  rose the
most in two weeks after the company agreed to sell a 25 percent
stake in Barnett Shale assets to Tokyo Gas Co. for $485 million,
more than its market value.  Quicksilver gained 16 percent to $2.60 at the close in  New
York , the most since March 14, after earlier rising as much as
41 percent.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay down some of
Quicksilver’s $2 billion debt, the  Fort Worth , Texas-based
company said in a March 29 statement. The sale price was more
than the company’s $397 million  market value  as of March 28.  It was also a third higher than predicted, analysts at
investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. wrote in a note to
clients today.  More than 76 percent of Quicksilver’s daily average gas
production last year came from the  Barnett Shale  and the company
expects about two-thirds of 2013 output from the area in north
Texas, according to its annual report. Quicksilver held 127,000
net acres in the Barnett Shale at the end of 2012.  Quicksilver has been seeking joint venture partners to help
pay for drilling costs after U.S. gas prices fell to a 10-year
low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
