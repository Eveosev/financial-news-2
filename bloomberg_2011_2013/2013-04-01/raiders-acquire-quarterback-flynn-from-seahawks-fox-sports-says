The Oakland Raiders acquired
quarterback Matt Flynn from the Seattle Seahawks for a fifth-
round draft pick in 2014 and an undisclosed selection in 2015.  “Matt is a tough football player, and talented
quarterback,” Raiders General Manager Reggie McKenzie said in a
statement. “He will get the opportunity to compete to be a
starter with the Raiders.  Flynn, who has started only two National Football League
games, set Green Bay Packers’ franchise records by passing for
480 yards and six touchdowns in the final game of the 2011
regular season. He then signed a three-year contract during the
offseason with Seattle worth $26 million.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
