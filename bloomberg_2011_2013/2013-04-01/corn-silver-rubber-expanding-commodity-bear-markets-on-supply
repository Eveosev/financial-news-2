Corn, silver and rubber tumbled into
bear markets, joining slumps in commodities such as sugar and
wheat, on signs that expanding supplies will outpace demand amid
increasing concern that global growth will falter.  The price of corn in  Chicago  plunged the most in 24 years
yesterday, leaving futures down 23 percent from last year’s
closing high and exceeding the 20 percent benchmark for bear
markets. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Index of eight
raw materials touched a nine-month low yesterday, falling 21
percent from its 2012 peak. Silver in  New York  and rubber in
 Tokyo  were down more than 20 percent from closing highs.  A gauge of  manufacturing  in  China  showed expansion was
slower than analysts forecast, and a U.S. factory index fell
more than expected in March, reports showed yesterday. The U.S.
predicted last week that farmers will plant the most corn acres
this year since 1936. Last month, Cyprus became the fifth nation
to seek a rescue since the start of  Europe ’s debt crisis in
2009, and the 17-nation euro area is mired in recession.  “You really need Europe to switch into neutral instead of
reverse to get any kind of excitement about commodities,”  John Stephenson , senior vice president and portfolio manager, who
helps manage about C$2.7 billion ($2.66 billion) at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview. There’s “decent global growth, but just still not
enough to move the needle,” he said.  Rising supplies  The S&P GSCI agriculture gauge is down 7.1 percent this
year, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose
5.5 percent. The dollar added 3.7 percent against a basket of
six trading partners. Treasuries lost 0.3 percent, a Bank of
America Corp. index shows.  Production will exceed demand in aluminum, copper, lead,
nickel and zinc in 2013, Barclays said in a March 14 report.
Cotton and sugar also will see surpluses, according to Rabobank
International.  Corn  inventories  in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower
and exporter, totaled 5.399 billion bushels on March 1, the
Department of Agriculture said March 28. While down from a year
earlier, that’s still above the 4.995 billion forecast by
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Farmers will plant 97.282
million acres this year, the most in 77 years, the USDA said.  ‘Distorted pricing’  Corn futures for May delivery plunged 7.6 percent yesterday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest drop since 1988, to
close at $6.4225 a bushel. Prices touched $6.365, the lowest for
a most-active contract since June 29. The grain has tumbled from
last year’s closing high on Aug. 21 of $8.3875. Corn is the
most-valuable in the U.S., followed by soybeans, hay and wheat,
government data show.  Last year’s drought in the U.S., the worst since the 1930s
last year, cut domestic corn output by 13 percent and sent
prices to a record $8.49 on Aug. 10. Wheat surged 19 percent
last year as the dry conditions left fields in their worst
condition since the government began keeping the data in 1985.
Demand slowed as prices increased.  “You’ve got the agricultural sector coming off the
drought-distorted pricing,” said  James Paulsen , the
Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells Capital
Management, which oversees about $325 billion of assets. “Some
of those prices are starting to come back to earth, keeping
commodity-price trends somewhat depressed.”  Bear Markets  The S&P’s GSCI Agriculture Index settled at 419.14
yesterday, down 21 percent from last year’s closing high of
533.03 on July 20. The gauge fell as much as 4.1 percent to
417.16, the lowest since June 25.  Wheat entered a bear market in January as prospects for
crops improved and speculation increased that last year’s price
gain would prompt farmers to plant more. Futures for May
delivery dropped 3.5 percent to $6.64 a bushel in Chicago, after
reaching $6.5975, the lowest for a most-active contract since
June 20. Prices have fallen 30 percent from the last year’s
closing peak of $9.4325 a bushel on July 20.  Soybean futures for May delivery declined 1 percent to
$13.9075 a bushel on the CBOT yesterday, after touching
$13.8625, the lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 14.
Prices are down 21 percent from the last year’s closing peak of
$17.6825 a bushel on Sept. 4.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to
51.3 from an almost two-year high of 54.2 in February, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group’s figures showed yesterday. The
Chinese Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.9, the National Bureau
of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
said yesterday in Beijing. The median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was 51.2.  Rising inventories  On the Comex in New York, silver futures for May delivery
fell 1.3 percent to settle at $27.944 an ounce. The price is
down 20 percent from a close of $35.101 on Oct. 4. Imports by
China, the biggest user of the metal after the U.S., fell the
most in two years in February, the fifth decline in six months,
the latest customs data show. Silver reached a 31-year high in
April 2011 as global central banks increased monetary easing,
boosting its appeal as an inflation hedge.  Inventories of silver monitored by the Comex on March 26
reached the highest since August 1997. Sales of American Eagle
silver coins by the  U.S. Mint  have declined for two straight
months.  “Silver has taken it on the chin,”  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “China slowdown worries and fear of
stimulus measures ending in the U.S. have worked against
silver.”  Rubber Drop  Rubber also fell into a bear market as expanding stockpiles
in China signaled easing demand from the world’s largest
consumer of the commodity used in tires. Rubber for delivery in
September on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, the international
benchmark, dropped 2.6 percent to 266.9 yen a kilogram ($2,844 a
metric ton), a 20 percent decline from this year’s highest
settlement for a most-active contract of 334 yen reached Feb. 6.  Inventories in warehouses in Qingdao, China’s main shipment
hub, reached an all-time high on March 15 as the nation’s
industrial production and retail sales in China had the weakest
start to a year since the global recession in 2009.  “I’d be cautious,” said  Stanley Crouch , who helps oversee
$2 billion of assets as chief investment officer at  New York- 
based Aegis Capital Corp. “I’m not convinced we’re going to see
this great bull run yet. The emerging economies, while they’ve
grown tremendously, there’s not enough intrinsic domestic demand
to drive the whole complex.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
