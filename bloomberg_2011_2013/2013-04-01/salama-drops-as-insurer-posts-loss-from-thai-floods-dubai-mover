Islamic Arab Insurance Co. (SALAMA)  dropped
to the lowest level in more than a year after the Dubai-based
company reported a 2012 loss linked to claims for flooding in
Thailand.  Shares of the insurer known as Salama plunged 8.1 percent
to 56.5 fils, the weakest level since January 2012, at the close
in Dubai. Islamic Arab was the biggest decliner on a percentage
basis on the benchmark DFM General Index, which lost 0.2 percent
to 1,825.76.  Salama said it wouldn’t pay a dividend for 2012 after the
insurance provider reported a loss of 394 million dirhams ($107
million) compared with a 60 million-dirham profit a year
earlier. The losses were linked to claims filed for flooding in
 Thailand  made to BEST RE, in which Salama owns a stake, it said.  “The company reported larger-than-expected losses as their
technical profits took a hit from having to provide for the
losses flood in Thailand,” Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities, said. Al Fajer had estimated a
loss of around 50 million dirhams, he said.  The insurer was placed on credit watch by Standard and
Poor’s in January on concern BEST RE’s capital adequacy may
weaken further. Salama holds an A- rating at S&P, the seventh-
highest investment grade. Shares of Salama have dropped 7.5
percent this year, underperforming a 13 percent advance for the
benchmark gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
