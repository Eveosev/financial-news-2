The San Francisco 49ers acquired
quarterback  Colt McCoy  today in a trade with the Cleveland
Browns as a backup to starter Colin Kaepernick.  The Browns said in an e-mailed release that they received
two 2013 draft picks from the 49ers in exchange for McCoy and a
draft pick. Cleveland did not specify the round of those picks.  McCoy, 25, was a third-round draft choice by the Browns in
2010 and went 6-15 in 21 starts for Cleveland, completing 409 of
702 passes for 4,388 yards with 21 touchdowns and 20
interceptions.  The 49ers traded Alex Smith to the Kansas City Chiefs in
March. Smith was taken No. 1 overall in the 2005 draft and was
the 49ers’ starter before being replaced by Kaepernick, who took
San Francisco to the  Super Bowl .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
