Treasury 10-year note yields traded
at almost a four-week low after a measure of manufacturing in
the U.S. last month was weaker than forecast, increasing demand
for safer assets.  U.S. 10-year yields dropped as the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  fell to 51.3 in March from 54.2 a
month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said. Employers
may have hired 195,000 workers in March, after a gain of 236,000
in February, according to another report due April 5. The
Federal Reserve purchased $3.18 billion in notes today as part
of its program to strengthen the economy.  “The market is concerned about the spring-time swoon,”
said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in  New York  at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “You get one weak number and
the market is like, ‘the bad times are coming back.’ We’ll
remain closer to the bottom of the range until we get Friday’s
number.”  U.S. 10-year  yields  declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.83 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 1.8297
percent, almost the lowest since March 4. The price of the 2
percent note due in February 2023 gained 5/32, or $1.56 per
$1,000 face value, to 101 1/2.  Treasury 30-year bonds lost 3.1 percent in the first
quarter, versus a 0.3 percent loss for the broader market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  ISM Levels  Treasuries due in a decade or more have been trading at
almost the cheapest level in 19 months relative to global peers
with comparable maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch bond indexes. Yields on the Treasuries reached 57 basis
points higher than those in an index of other sovereign debt on
March 25, the most since August 2011, the data showed. The
spread was 56 basis points on March 28.  U.S. government securities underperformed the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index in March as Fed efforts to spur the economy
boosted stocks.  Government bonds  returned 0.1 percent through
March 28, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index,
versus a return by the  stock index  of 3.75 percent including
reinvested dividends. The  S&P 500  rose to a record on March 28,
wiping out losses from the financial crisis, and the Dow Jones
Industrial Index climbed to its highest ever.  Economists projected an ISM index reading of 54 for gauge,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, with
estimates ranging from 51.6 to 55. Figures higher than 50 signal
expansion.  Widening Spread  Treasury 10-year yields climbed March 8 to 2.08 percent,
the highest since April 5, after the Labor Department reported
February’s employment increase and a drop in the  unemployment
rate , to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent.  “The market will be focused on the job front to force
higher rates,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors. “The economic data has been
showing some good signs recently.”  Personal spending rose 0.7 percent in February, after a 0.4
percent increase in January, the Commerce Department reported
March 29, when the Treasuries market was closed for Good Friday.  Investors last week demanded the highest  yield premium  to
own 30-year bonds instead of 10-year notes in 18 months. The
spread widened to as much as 1.26 percentage points, and it was
1.25 percentage points today.  The last time the difference was so wide was September
2011. The gap contracted on Sept. 21 of that year when the
 Federal Reserve  announced Operation Twist to buy longer-term
Treasuries and sell shorter-term debt from its holdings to put
downward pressure on borrowing costs.  Debt Holdings  While that program has expired, the Fed is currently
purchasing $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month as
it seeks to support the economy by capping yields. It purchased
securities today maturing between May 2020 to February 2023.  The Fed’s  measure  of traders’ forecasts for costs in the
economy for the period from 2018 to 2023, known as the five-year
five-year forward break-even rate, was 2.72 percent. The average
for the past decade is 2.75 percent.  International investors bought more Treasuries last quarter
than any other start to a year since 2009, with holdings
approaching $3 trillion.  The Fed’s  holdings  of  U.S. government debt  on behalf of
foreign central banks rose $63.5 billion, or 2.4 percent, to
$2.95 trillion as of March 27, according to the central bank.
 China , the largest foreign lender to the U.S., has been buying
Treasuries at the fastest pace since 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
