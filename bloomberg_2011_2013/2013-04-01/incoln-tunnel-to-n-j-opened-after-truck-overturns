The Lincoln Tunnel, connecting  New
York  City and New Jersey, opened after a tractor-trailer
overturned and early commuters were diverted to other Hudson
River crossings.  The tunnel, which handled about 19 million vehicles headed
into the city last year, returned to normal operations about
8:15 a.m., said Chris Valens, a spokesman for the  Port Authority 
of New York & New Jersey.  A truck traveling on the so-called Helix outside the tunnel
in New Jersey overturned about 5 a.m., Valens said. At one
point, delays of 45 minutes were reported as the westbound
roadway was closed along with a bus lane, according to the Port
Authorityâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
