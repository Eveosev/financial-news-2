GD Midea (000527)  Holding Co.  shares  surged
the most in more than two years in Shenzhen trading after the
household appliance maker’s parent announced plans to buy out
the listed company.  The maker of air conditioners and rice cookers rallied by
the 10 percent daily limit to 10.10 yuan at the 11.30 a.m. break
in Shenzhen, ending a trading suspension of more than seven
months. The shares posted the biggest intraday gain since
February 2011.  China ’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
declined 0.2 percent.  Midea Group , whose businesses range from selling appliances
to providing logistics services, is taking its unit private as
part of plans to list the group, according to a  Shenzhen stock
exchange  filing yesterday. The group, which holds 41 percent of
GD Midea, will offer the equivalent of 15.96  yuan  for each share
in the unit through a stock swap, according to the statement.
That’s a 74 percent premium to the closing price on Aug. 24,
before the shares were halted.  Under the transaction terms, GD Midea shareholders will get
0.3582 shares of the parent for every share they own, the
company said. The stock swap is still awaiting approval from
China’s commerce ministry and the nation’s securities regulator,
Midea Group said.  Midea Group plans to sell about 713.2 million shares priced
at 44.56 yuan each on the Shenzhen stock exchange, it said. The
company, founded by billionaire He Xiangjian, said net income
fell 6.1 percent in 2012 to 3.26 billion yuan ($525 million) and
forecast net income will rise to 4.42 billion yuan this year,
according to yesterday’s statement.  GD Midea said in a separate statement yesterday that 2012
net income was 3.48 billion yuan versus a restated 3.71 billion
yuan in 2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
