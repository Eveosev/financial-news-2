Russia’s biggest grain growing and
exporting region will have sufficient moisture this month to
support spring sowing even with below-average precipitation
forecast, according to the  Federal Hydrometeorological Center .  Crops will have “a sufficient moisture level” to develop
in the Southern and North-Caucasus federal districts, the center
said on its website. Precipitation will be 20 percent to 30
percent below the monthly norm and temperatures will be about 1
degree Centigrade (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the norm during
April in the two districts, the center’s data show.  The normal level of rain varies from 19 millimeters to 86
millimeters, and normal temperatures are 9.2 degrees to 12.1
degrees Centigrade across 10 regions in the two federal
districts tracked by the center.  The deviation from the normal level is not considered to be
big, and moisture accumulated during March in the two areas will
help crops develop normally, Tamara Maksimenkova, head of the
weather center’s crops laboratory, said by phone today in
Moscow.  The two districts accounted for about 35 percent of the
national harvest last year, according to the state statistics
data. Russia harvested 70.9 million metric tons of grains in
2012, the state statistics data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
