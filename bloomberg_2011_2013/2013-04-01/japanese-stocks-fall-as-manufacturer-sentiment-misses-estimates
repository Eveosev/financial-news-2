Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index dropping the most since March 2011, as a central bank
survey of manufacturer sentiment missed economists’ estimates
and the yen climbed.  Mazda Motor Corp., the Japanese automaker with the highest
proportion of exports, lost 4.3 percent.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the
unprofitable electronics maker, dropped 3.4 percent after the
Wall Street Journal reported a unit that makes entertainment and
communications systems for airlines is under a bribery
investigation by U.S. regulators.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  lost 4.3
percent after Japan’s biggest brokerage was sued by a trust over
an alleged breach of contract involving $1.14 billion of
mortgage-backed securities.  The Topix dropped 3.3 percent to close at 1,000.57 in
Tokyo, the biggest drop since March 15, 2011. The  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  slid 2.1 percent to 12,135.02. Volume on the gauge
was 9.8 percent below the 30-day intraday average with markets
in Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand closed for a holiday.
The Bank of Japan holds a policy meeting April 3-4.  “The market is taking a hit as the Tankan missed forecast
a bit and buy orders by foreign investors are low due to
Easter,” said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Tokyo-based
Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of about
6 trillion yen ($64 billion). “Stocks may be sold after the
market digests all the major factors at the BOJ meeting.”  Relative Value  The cost of bearish options on the Nikkei 225 traded near
an eight-month high as investors bought protection against
declines amid concern the BOJ will fail to deliver stimulus at
this week’s meeting, the bank’s first with Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda at its head.  Japan’s benchmark share gauge has rallied 40 percent from
Nov. 14 amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe government and
the BOJ will take more steps to beat deflation. The measure
traded at 1.5 times book value, compared with 2.2 for  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Confidence among big Japanese manufacturers improved less
than economists expected. The quarterly Tankan survey of
sentiment for large makers of cars and electronics rose to minus
8 in March from minus 12 in December, the BOJ said in Tokyo
today. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was minus 7. A negative number means pessimists outnumber
optimists.  Exporters dropped as the yen rose against all 16 of its
major peers, damping the prospects for overseas earnings. Mazda
fell 4.3 percent to 269 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the country’s biggest
electronics exporter, dropped 4 percent to 1,572 yen.  China Manufacturing  Shares also dropped after a Chinese manufacturing gauge
rose to an 11-month high, even as it missed estimates. The
Purchasing Managers’ Index climbed to 50.9 in March from 50.1 in
February, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing said today in Beijing. Readings
above 50 indicate expansion.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  slid 0.2 percent as the U.S. market
reopens today following the Good Friday holiday. The gauge rose
to a record on March 28 as data on the housing market bolstered
confidence in the world’s largest economy while concern over
Europe’s debt crisis faded.  Panasonic fell 3.4 percent to 632 yen after the legal
department of Panasonic Avionics, based in Lake Forest,
California, told executives and employees to preserve documents
that may be relevant to the bribery investigation, the Wall
Street Journal said, citing company documents. Chieko Gyobu, a
spokeswoman for the Osaka, Japan-based parent company, declined
to comment when reached by phone.  Nomura Suit  Nomura lost 4.3 percent to 552 yen. HSBC Bank USA, National
Association filed a suit in state Supreme Court in Manhattan,
accusing Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. of failing to comply with
obligations associated with 5,292 residential mortgages it
purchased and sold to the trust.  Among stocks that gained,  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the
utility at the center of the 2011 nuclear crisis, rose 4.3
percent to 266 yen, the most on the Nikkei 225. The utility said
it plans to cut cost by an extra 100 billion yen per year and
President Naomi Hirose vowed to do whatever it takes to return
to profit.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index rose 5.5 percent
to 27.09 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.8
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
