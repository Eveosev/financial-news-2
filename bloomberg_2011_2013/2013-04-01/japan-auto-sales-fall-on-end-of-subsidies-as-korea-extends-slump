Japanese vehicle sales fell the most
in six quarters after government subsidies ended, while
deliveries in  South Korea  extended their slump.  The number of vehicles sold in Japan,  Asia ’s second-largest
auto market, fell 9.4 percent to 1.53 million during the
quarter, with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  seeing a 15 percent drop,
according to association data released yesterday. In South
 Korea , the region’s fourth-largest vehicle market, deliveries
declined 2.5 percent as  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  saw a 0.7 percent
contraction, based on company statements.  Slumping demand at home underscores how Asian carmakers may
need to increase their reliance on overseas markets this year.
Toyota-led Japan Inc. is better off because the yen has
depreciated against all major currencies since mid-November,
while Hyundai and other Korean exporters have seen the won
appreciate more than 13 percent against the yen.  Japanese vehicle sales -- including cars and buses --
dropped for a second straight quarter after government subsidies
on fuel-efficient cars expired in September. Deliveries will
probably shrink 12 percent to 4.74 million units this year,
according to the  Japan  Automobile Manufacturers Association.  “There won’t be many major launches this year,” said
Yoshiaki Kawano, a Tokyo-based analyst at industry researcher
IHS Automotive said by phone. “Until the Tokyo Motor Show at
the end of the year, the sales decline will likely drag on.”  Deliveries in the quarter at  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s
second-largest carmaker, fell 6 percent to 165,931 units in its
home market and  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s sales tumbled 43 percent to
92,579 units.  In Korea, vehicle sales fell to 321,420 units last quarter,
based on tallies of company statements. The Korean government
last week cut its economic growth forecast for the second time
in four months, prompting the  Finance Ministry  to say it will
unveil a stimulus package this month.  Toyota fell 3.1 percent to close at 4,615 yen, its lowest
close since Feb. 27, in Tokyo trading today. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 1.1 percent. Hyundai declined
1.1 percent in  Seoul , while Korea’s benchmark Kospi index lost
0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
