Peru’s inflation rate unexpectedly
quickened last month after a jump in schooling and food costs
fueled the steepest rise in consumer prices since 2008.  Consumer prices climbed 0.91 percent after a 0.09 percent
decline in February, the national statistics agency said in an
e-mailed statement today. The median forecast of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.55 percent increase. The
annual inflation rate quickened to 2.59 percent from 2.45
percent the previous month.  The central bank has kept its  benchmark lending rate 
unchanged for 22 consecutive months on the expectation inflation
will ease to 2 percent this year amid the fastest growth among
South America’s major economies. Policy makers target inflation
at 2 percent plus or minus 1 percentage point. Their next
meeting will be April 11.  Monthly fees at private schools in the capital Lima jumped
8.3 percent for the academic year that started last month while
registration costs at state schools also rose, the agency said.
Food and drink prices climbed 0.8 percent from February.  The consumer-price index is based on a survey of businesses
in the Lima Metropolitan area. Food and drink products
constitute 38 percent of the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
