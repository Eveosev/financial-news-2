The ruble weakened against Bank
Rossii’s dollar-euro basket to the lowest level in three months
as oil declined and the tax period ended, removing support from
exporters buying the currency to make local payments.  The ruble slid 0.3 percent against the basket to 35.1053 by
7 p.m. in Moscow, the weakest since Dec. 25. The Russian
currency lost 0.2 percent against the dollar to 31.1150, the
lowest level since Nov. 28.  “The ruble is declining now that exporters are no longer
in the market,” OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  analysts led by Vladimir Kolychev
wrote in a note to clients today.  Oil fell 1.3 percent to $96.06 per barrel in New York. Oil
and gas revenue comprise about 50 percent of  Russia ’s budget
income. Without tax payments to support the currency, the ruble
may weaken to 35.30 rubles against the basket, the Rosbank
analysts said. The next tax period starts on April 15.  The implied six-month NDF rate dropped one basis point to
6.29 percent, the lowest since March 5. The yield on OFZs due
June 2015 rose five basis points to 5.99 percent after touching
a record-low 5.94 percent on March 29.  The refinancing rate will remain at 8.25 percent when
policy makers meet in Moscow tomorrow, according to 16 of 20
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “The bet on declining yields in short-term notes may be
premature,”  ING Groep (INGA)  analyst Dmitry Polevoy, who also forecast
no change in rates, wrote in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
