Air India Ltd. will seek at least 2
billion rupees ($37 million) from  Boeing Co. (BA)  to compensate
losses at the state-owned carrier following grounding of its 787
aircraft, a person familiar with the matter said.  The carrier will raise the claim with Boeing shortly, said
the official, who declined to be identified citing rules. G.
Prasada Rao, a spokesman at Mumbai-based Air India, didn’t
immediately respond to two calls to his mobile phone. Boeing
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Air India may resume local flights of the 787 later this
month after the planemaker carries out safety modifications to
the plane’s batteries, the official said. Air India joins LOT
Polish Airlines SA in pushing ahead with compensation claims
after Boeing’s global fleet of Dreamliners was grounded
following a battery fire on an All Nippon Airways’ jet Jan. 16.  Boeing added safety modifications to the batteries and
plans a second 787 test flight before submitting the changes to
the Federal Aviation Administration as it seeks approval to
restore the grounded planes to service.  Air India has six 787 aircraft in its fleet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
