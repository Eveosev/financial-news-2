First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  bought the 150-
megawatt Solar Gen 2 project in California from an affiliate of

unnamed partner. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  Construction is expected to start this year and the project
will be done in 2014, Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar said in a

agreement.  First Solar said 40 megawatts of solar modules from another
supplier were already purchased and will be used on the project.
