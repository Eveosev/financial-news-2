Azerbaijan ’s State Oil  Fund  plans to
invest as much as $200 million in infrastructure projects in
 emerging markets  as it diversifies reserves.  Sofaz, as the fund is known, committed $150 million in the
first closing of the newly created IFC Global Infrastructure
Fund, almost a third of the $500 million contributed by other
sovereign wealth funds and pension managers, the Baku-based fund
said today in an e-mailed statement.  IFC Asset Management Company LLC, a unit of the
International Finance Corp., the  World Bank ’s private lending
arm, will manage the infrastructure fund, which plans to channel
capital into industries including power, transportation,
utilities, telecommunications, urban infrastructure and
infrastructure services, according to the statement.  Established in 1999 to manage Azerbaijan’s income from the
sale of oil and natural gas, Sofaz had $34.1 billion in assets
as of Jan. 1, equivalent to almost 50 percent of the Caspian Sea
nation’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
