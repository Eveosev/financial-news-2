Australia’s dollar gained against
most of its 16 major peers on speculation the  Reserve Bank  will
hold  interest rates  unchanged and refrain from indicating any
prospect that a reduction may soon be needed.  Local bonds rose, with 10-year yields touching a four-week
low, amid signs the global economy is slowing. Manufacturing
data in the U.S. and China yesterday trailed economists’
estimates, while a report today is forecast to show euro-area
unemployment rose to a record.  New Zealand ’s dollar climbed
after the nation’s commodity export prices gained.  “The market is not as convinced as it was that the RBA’s
going to ease further, as the economic data has stabilized,”
said  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at  Bank of New Zealand  in
Wellington. “Whenever offshore markets descend into turmoil,
particularly Europe, the relativities of the Australian economy
and Australian assets shine brighter than they normally do, and
you see a kind of safe-haven flow into Aussie dollars.”  Australia’s currency added 0.3 percent to $1.0450 as of
1:53 p.m. in Sydney from yesterday. It fetched 97.26 yen from
97.18. The Aussie rose 0.2 percent against the greenback last
quarter and 8.9 percent versus the yen.  New Zealand’s kiwi dollar was up 0.2 percent to 83.89 U.S.
cents. The currency traded at 78.06 yen, after a 9.7 percent
quarterly gain.  Yields on Australian 10-year bonds touched 3.386 percent,
the lowest level since March 6, before trading at 3.41 percent.  RBA Policy  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see an 6 percent chance the RBA will cut the 3 percent benchmark
rate today, compared with 20 percent odds priced in one month
ago. The central bank decision is due at 2:30 p.m. Sydney time.  The  jobless rate  in the euro area probably rose to 12
percent in March, the highest on record going back to July 1990,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  before the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg releases the data today.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index of Chinese manufacturing
released yesterday was 50.9 for March, below the 51.2 median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg poll. In the U.S., the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to 51.3
last month from 54.2 in February.  In New Zealand,  commodity export prices  gained 7.4 percent
in March in local currency terms from the previous month, when
they rose a revised 1.1 percent, ANZ National Bank Ltd. said in
a report today.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a floating rate was at 2.86 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
