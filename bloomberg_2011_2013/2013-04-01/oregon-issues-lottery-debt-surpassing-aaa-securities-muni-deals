Oregon’s Department of
Administrative Services  is selling $204 million of bonds backed
by lottery revenue as previously issued debt beats top-rated
securities.  Included in the borrowing, rated AAA by Standard & Poor’s,
is $122.5 million in tax-exempt debt. Proceeds will go toward
maintenance and improvement work as well as refunding debt for
the Oregon University System, which is composed of seven schools
and a branch campus. Among the projects is a seismic remediation
program, bond documents say.  After declining during the 18-month recession that ended in
June 2009, Oregon’s lottery revenue will continue its “recently
resumed path of incremental growth,” S&P said in a release. The
state expects it to total $1.1 billion from 2011 through 2013,
$1 million more than was projected in December, according to
bond documents.  Competition from possible Indian gaming or expansion of
neighboring Washington’s lottery poses a challenge, said Moody’s
Investors Service, which rates the debt Aa2, third-highest.
Oregonians spent an average of about 1 percent of personal
income, or $371, on gambling in 2011, unchanged from the prior
two years, deal documents say.  Lottery bonds maturing in 2025 traded March 8 at a yield of
2.1 percent, down about 50 basis points from Jan. 31, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Top-rated 12-year state and local
debt yields  rose  about 6 basis points over the same period. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Oregon plans to sell $92.5 million in lottery debt next
year and $62.9 million in 2015, bond documents say. Lottery
players in Oregon get back 67 percent of what they pay for
tickets in winnings, second-best among states, according to 2010
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
