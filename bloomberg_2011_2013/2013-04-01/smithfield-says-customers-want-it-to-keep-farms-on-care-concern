Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , the world’s
biggest hog and pork producer, said major customers don’t want
it to let go of its farms so the company can control supply and
animal care.  U.S. customers want pregnant sows to live in group housing
rather than small gestation crates, a shift Smithfield started
in 2007, and export clients want pork free of the feed additive
ractopamine, the Smithfield, Virginia-based company said in a
slide presentation in a  filing  today. The company didn’t specify
which customers suggested keeping the farms.  Kroger Co. (KR)  and McDonald’s Corp., both Smithfield customers,
have in the last year asked suppliers to move to group housing
for sows.  A decision several years ago by Smithfield to move toward
group housing “is becoming very important to our customers and
is an important factor in the recent growth in our food-service
business,” Chief Executive Officer C. Larry Pope said on a Dec.
6 conference call.  Continental Grain Co., which holds a 5.8 percent stake in
Smithfield, said in a letter last month that the company should
consider splitting into three businesses -- one selling pork and
packaged meats, another that runs hog farms, and a third based
outside the U.S. -- because the unprofitable hog-raising unit
hurts returns. Pope said last month that selling the farms would
be a mistake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
