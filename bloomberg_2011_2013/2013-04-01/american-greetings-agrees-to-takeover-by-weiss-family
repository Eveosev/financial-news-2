American Greetings Corp. (AM) , the
biggest publicly traded greeting-card maker, agreed to be taken
private by a group led by Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss for
about $524 million.  The group, including Chairman Morry Weiss and Chief
Operating Officer Jeffrey Weiss, offered $18.20 a share in cash,
27 percent more than the close of the Class A stock on Sept. 25,
the day before the Weiss family first proposed to acquire the
company. A 15 cent-a-share dividend may also be offered, which
would give stockholders $18.35 a share for the deal, the
Cleveland-based company said today in a statement.  The Weiss brothers had made an offer of $17.18 a share in
September, saying that they wanted to return American Greetings,
which was founded more than a century ago and began trading
publicly in 1958, to family ownership. They raised that offer to
$17.50 in January.  American Greetings  rose  12 percent to $18.05 at the close
in New York. The shares had dropped 4.7 percent this year
through March 28, compared with a 10 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The deal’s total value of about $878 million includes the
assumption of the company’s notes due in 2021, the settlement of
some stock options and the repayment of borrowings under a
credit facility.  The acquisition is being financed by the Weiss family, cash
funded by a $240 million non-voting preferred stock investment
by a unit of Koch Industries Inc. and $600 million in debt
financing, the company said.  Hallmark Competition  Revenue at American Greetings, which counts Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and Target Corp. as its biggest customers, rose 6.1 percent
to $1.7 billion in the year ended Feb. 29, 2012.  American Greetings, which competes with closely held
Hallmark Cards Inc., sells cards under brand names such as
Carlton Cards and Papyrus, as well as gift packaging, party
goods and stationery, according to a filing last year. More than
80 percent of Americans, mainly women, buy greeting cards each
year with the average customer in the mid- to late 40s, American
Greetings has said.  Peter J. Solomon Co. is acting as financial adviser to the
special committee of American Greetings’ board while Sullivan &
Cromwell LLP is providing legal advice.  KeyBanc Capital Markets
is financial adviser to the Weiss family and Jones Day is acting
as legal counsel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
