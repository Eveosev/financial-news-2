The euro fell against 12 of its 16
most-traded peers as a report showed unemployment in the
currency bloc climbed to a record in February, adding to concern
the economy will struggle to emerge from recession.  The 17-nation currency declined against the dollar as a
purchasing-manager index of manufacturing stayed below the level
that shows contraction. Sweden’s krona gained for a second day
versus the dollar after a factory index for the country rose.
New Zealand’s dollar climbed after the nation’s commodity export
prices jumped. The  European Central Bank  meets on April 4.  “It’s a mix of the weaker-than-expected PMI data and the
rise in the  unemployment rate ,” Brian Daingerfield, a currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities
unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a phone interview. “With
those two pieces of data coming in soft, along with general
weakening in some of the macro data we’ve seen, there may be
some expectations being priced in for additional ECB easing.”  The euro depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.2820 at 5 p.m. in
 New York . It was unchanged at 119.79 yen after sliding earlier
to 119.15, the weakest level since Feb. 26. Japan’s currency
declined 0.2 percent to 93.44 per dollar.  The euro trimmed early losses versus the greenback after
Commerce Department data showed orders placed with U.S.
factories rose 3 percent in February, the most in five months.  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  rose for the first time in four days. The
gauge, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to track the
greenback against the currencies of six U.S. trading partners,
gained 0.2 percent to 82.920.  Mexico’s peso rose to its strongest level in 19 months as a
bill in the nation’s Senate designed to boost competition in the
telecommunications industry fueled optimism about the outlook
for foreign investment. The currency appreciated 0.7 percent to
12.2754 per dollar and reached 12.2592, the strongest level
since September 2011.  New Zealand’s dollar climbed after data showed the nation’s
commodity  export prices  increased 7.4 percent in March, the most
in more than three years. The kiwi, as the currency is
nicknamed, appreciated 0.5 percent to 84.14 U.S. cents and
touched 84.46, the strongest level since Feb. 20.  The Australian currency gained as the  Reserve Bank  of
 Australia  kept its key  interest rate  unchanged and Governor
 Glenn Stevens  said “there are a number of indications that the
substantial easing of monetary policy during late 2011 and 2012
is having an expansionary effect on the economy.”  The Aussie dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.0450 and advanced
0.5 percent to 97.64 yen.  Unemployment Rises  The euro declined as the European Union’s statistics office
said  unemployment  in the currency region increased to 12 percent
and the January figure was revised up to the same level from
11.9 percent estimated earlier. That’s the highest since the
data series started in 1995.  A gauge of manufacturing in the region slid to 46.8 last
month from 47.9 in February, Markit Economics said. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  “The PMI data was universally soft, and that’s pushed the
euro lower,”  Jack Spitz , Toronto-based managing director of
foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada (NA) , said in a telephone
interview. “There’s still downside risk with respect to
structural issues and ahead of the ECB, which is expected to
guide more dovishly given the economic misses.”  Pound Drops  Sterling was the biggest loser among the euro’s 16 most-
traded peers, weakening for the first time in four days after a
report showed U.K.  factory  output contracted in March more than
forecast. The pound touched $1.5099, a 0.9 percent drop, its
biggest since March 8. It weakened 0.6 percent to 84.88 pence
per euro.  The krona gained versus most of its major peers as
Stockholm-based Swedbank ABA said a PMI for the country advanced
to 52.1 in March from 50.9 the previous month. The Swedish
currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 6.4904 per dollar. It rose
0.6 percent to 8.3204 per euro.  Europe ’s shared currency declined 1.8 percent over the past
month versus nine developed-nation peers, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar was fell 0.1 percent,
while the yen gained 0.1 percent.  “The euro should continue to weaken against a wide range
of currency,”  Simon Derrick , London-based chief currency
strategist at Bank of New York Mellon Corp., said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with Francine Lacqua and  Guy Johnson . “For the euro-dollar, $1.23 or $1.24
doesn’t seem entirely unreasonable before the summer.”  Italy Deadlock  The common currency slid 2.8 percent versus the dollar last
quarter as inconclusive elections in  Italy  on Feb. 24-25 left a
political deadlock. President Giorgio Napolitano has formed a
10-person committee to negotiate a new government for the nation
before his term expires in six weeks.  The delay drags out the uncertainty over budget discipline
in the third-largest euro-area economy as cracks in the 17-
member currency are exposed by bank-deposit losses imposed in
Cyprus in return for a bailout.  Italian Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani said at
a press conference today a broad coalition government would be
the wrong choice. Italy needs leadership, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
