Corn plunged the most in 24 years,
entering a  bear market , as bigger-than-expected U.S. stockpiles
and increased planting signal ample supplies. Wheat tumbled to a
nine-month low and soybeans dropped.  U.S. corn  inventories  on March 1 totaled 5.399 billion
bushels, the Department of Agriculture said March 28. While down
from a year earlier, that’s still above the 4.995 billion
forecast by analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Farmers will
plant 97.282 million acres this year, the most since 1936, the
USDA said. Prices reached the lowest since June today.  After last year’s drought cut U.S. output by 13 percent and
sent futures to a record, demand slowed as high grain costs
forced livestock producers including Cargill Inc. to close beef
plants, while ethanol producers including Poet LLC shut
distilleries. Lower prices may further erode  global food costs 
that fell for a fifth month in February, according to a gauge
compiled by the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization.  “The market expected a bullish report last week and got
the opposite,”  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing adviser at Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois , said in a
telephone interview. “Today we’re just seeing follow-through
selling from being caught on the wrong side of the market.”  Corn futures for May delivery tumbled 7.6 percent to settle
at $6.4225 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $6.365, the lowest for a most-active contract
since June 29. Today’s decline was the biggest percentage drop
since July 18, 1988.  Trading was three times the average of the past 100 days at
that time of day. On March 28, the grain plunged by the 40-cent
limit after the USDA report. Prices in Chicago are down 23
percent since last year’s closing high of $8.3875 on Aug. 21,
meeting the definition used by some investors to identify a bear
market.  Daily Limit  The daily trading limit for corn was widened to 60 cents,
the exchange  said  in a statement. The crop is the most-valuable
in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter, followed
by soybeans, hay and wheat, government data show.  Prices rallied to an intraday record of $8.49 on Aug. 10 as
the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s scorched crops. Since
then, farmers in  South America  have boosted output, and Midwest
growers are planning to expand production. Corn has dropped in
seven of the past eight months.  In the week ended March 25, hedge funds and other large
speculator increased their  bets  on a corn rally by 32 percent to
192,561 futures and options contracts, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. That’s the highest since Dec. 11 and was a
fourth straight gain.  Supply Surprise  Investors who increase their long position before the
bearish stockpiles report will be “looking to get out,” Rich Feltes, the vice president of research for R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in  Chicago , said by telephone. “It’s going to take
some time” for prices to find support after inventories beat
expectations, he said.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 3.5 percent to $6.64 a
bushel in Chicago, after slipping to $6.5975, the lowest for a
most-active contract since June 20. The price dropped 6.7
percent on March 28.  Soybean futures for May delivery declined 1 percent to
$13.9075 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $13.8625, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
