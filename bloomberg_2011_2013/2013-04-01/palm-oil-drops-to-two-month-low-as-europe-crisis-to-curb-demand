     April 1 (Bloomberg) -- Palm oil  fell to the lowest level in
more than two months on concern that exports from Malaysia, the
second-biggest producer after Indonesia, may decline as Europe’s
debt crisis and a slowing Chinese economy curb demand.  The contract for delivery in June dropped as much as 1.1
percent to 2,353 ringgit ($760) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest level for the most-active
contract since Jan. 11, and was at 2,360 ringgit at 12:13 p.m.
in  Kuala Lumpur . Prices fell 2.5 percent in the first quarter,
the fourth quarterly loss in the worst streak since 1999.  “European debt crisis and  China economy  will remain the
key to palm oil price outlook,”  Phillip Futures Pte.  said in a
report today. “There are concerns that property and investment
curbs in China might slow the economy more than necessary and
damp the demand outlook for palm oil.”  Europe’s economy will contract for a second straight year
in 2013, according to the median of analysts’ forecasts compiled
by Bloomberg. China’s largest cities, including Beijing and
Shanghai, tightened rules on home purchases after the nation
asked local governments to step up efforts to cool the  property
market . Europe is the largest buyer of palm after India and
China, the U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows.  Inventories in China, which reached a record at the start
of March, fell 60,000 tons last week to 1.19 million tons,
Grain.gov.cn, a state-owned researcher, said in an e-mailed
report. Exports from Malaysia rose 2.8 percent to 1.36 million
tons in March from a month ago, surveyor Intertek said today.  Soybean oil for May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to 49.78
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May fell 0.4 percent to $13.99 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery fell 1.5 percent to
6,150  yuan  ($991) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  for delivery in the same month retreated 1.2 percent
to at 7,834 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
