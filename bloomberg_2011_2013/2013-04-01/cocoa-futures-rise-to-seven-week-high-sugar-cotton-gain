Cocoa futures rose to a seven-week
high on speculation that supplies will be limited from  Ivory
Coast , the world’s biggest producer. Sugar, cotton, orange juice
and coffee gained.  On March 29, Ivory Coast lowered by 3.6 percent the minimum
guaranteed price that farmers will get for the mid-crop harvest
that starts today, saying the shorter season usually results in
smaller beans. From Oct. 1 to March 24, bean deliveries to
Ivorian ports slid 1.3 percent, Commodities Risk Analysis in
Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania , said on March 27.  “This season’s mid-crop production is expected to produce
lower quality beans,” and “port arrivals have been running
behind schedule,” John Caruso, a senior commodity broker at RJO
Futures in  Chicago , said in an e-mail.  Cocoa for May delivery increased 0.5 percent to $2,181 a
metric ton at 10:26 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Earlier, the commodity reached $2,198, the highest for a most-
active contract since Feb. 11.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to
17.73 cents a pound on ICE.  Cotton futures for May delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
88.74 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery climbed 0.1 percent
to $1.353 a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery gained 0.1 percent
to $1.366 a pound. Earlier, the price reached $1.4135, the
highest since March 14.  ICE was closed on March 29 for the Good Friday holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
