A BP Plc-led group developing
 Azerbaijan ’s biggest natural gas project is starting its final
evaluation of two pipeline proposals vying for the right to
export the fuel to  Europe  from the Caspian Sea.  The group will choose between the OMV AG-led Nabucco West
link and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, or TAP, developed by
 Statoil ASA (STL) , EON Ruhrgas and EGL AG, by the end of June, the BP
office in Baku, the Azeri capital, said today by e-mail.  The transportation proposals are expected to become legally
binding by end of April, the U.K. oil and gas producer said.
They include “substantial” information about the technical,
regulatory, and financial aspects of the Nabucco West and TAP
projects, according to the statement.  The partners in the Shah Deniz gas deposit, which also
include Statoil,  Total SA (FP)  and State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or
Socar, expect to receive binding bids from potential gas
customers in Europe within the next month, it said.  The $25 billion project to develop phase two of the Shah
Deniz deposit in the  Caspian Sea  will start production in 2018
and in 2019 the first gas will be exported to  Turkey ’s border
with the European Union  through the planned Trans-Anatolia
pipeline, or Tanap, BP Vice President for Shah Deniz Al Cook
said in January.  The Shah Deniz deposit, estimated to contain 1.2 trillion
cubic meters of gas, will deliver 10 billion cubic meters of gas
to Europe a year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
