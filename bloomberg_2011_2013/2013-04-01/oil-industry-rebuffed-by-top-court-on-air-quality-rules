The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an
oil-industry challenge to new clean-air standards that the
Environmental Protection Agency says will improve  air quality 
around the nation’s busiest roadways.  The  American Petroleum Institute  was seeking to overturn
the EPA’s first-ever rule protecting people from short-term
exposure to nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas linked to asthma
attacks. The nation’s highest court today left intact a federal
appeals court ruling upholding the standards.  The EPA rule will limit concentrations of nitrogen dioxide
in the atmosphere to 100 parts per billion. Nitrogen oxides are
byproducts of combustion, primarily coming from vehicle engines
and power plants.  The case is American Petroleum Institute v. Environmental
Protection Agency, 12-760.  To contact the reporter on this story:
