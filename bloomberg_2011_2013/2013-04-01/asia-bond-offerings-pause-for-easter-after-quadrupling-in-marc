Borrowers in  Asia  outside of  Japan 
paused sales of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds after issuance
quadrupled in March. Debt risk in the region rose, poised to
close at the highest level in more than four months.  Offerings surged to $17.6 billion last month from $4.4
billion in February as monthly borrowing costs averaged 3.59
percent, the least since January, according to HSBC Holdings Plc
indexes and data compiled by Bloomberg. 1Malaysia Development
Bhd., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and  Bharti Airtel
Ltd. (BHARTI)  led $45.4 billion of sales in the region since Dec. 31,
making the first three months of 2013 the busiest quarter on
record, the data show.  Markets in  Australia , New Zealand and Hong Kong, home to
one of Asia’s largest bourses, are closed for Easter today.
Notes denominated in the U.S. currency sold by companies in Asia
returned 1.04 percent last quarter, the least since the three
months ending Sept. 30, 2011 when they lost 4.57 percent, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  “Bond performance was lackluster this quarter partly due
to a record amount of issuance,” said Krishna Hegde, the
Singapore-based head of Asia credit research at Barclays Plc.
“Credit market activity should be muted today with Hong Kong
and  London  away.”  1MDB Bonds  1Malaysia Development, the state investment company also
known as 1MDB, sold $3 billion of bonds on March 19, according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction. 1MDB is
developing an $8 billion financial district in  Kuala Lumpur 
called the Tun Razak Exchange development.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing issued $1.5 billion of
securities in a two-part sale last week. Its $1.15 billion of
1.625 percent notes due 2018 were yielding 1.712 percent as of
10:50 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
on Bloomberg show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1.5 basis points to 122.5 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in  Hong Kong , RBS prices show. The
benchmark, which ranged from 100.5 to 122.3 in the first three
months of the year, is poised for its highest close since Nov.
16, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 113
basis points as of 9:58 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The gauge has tumbled 46 basis points so far
this year, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
