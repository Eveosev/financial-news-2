Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
biggest Latin American non-state oil producer by market value,
rose to a two-week high on plans to buy a stake in a Brazilian
exploration block.  Shares advanced 0.5 percent to 38,700 pesos at 1:28 p.m. in
Bogota, the highest level on a closing basis since March 18. The
IGBC benchmark index retreated 0.5 percent.  Rubiales will exercise an option to acquire a 35 percent
interest in the S-M-1166 oil exploration block in Brazil’s
Santos basin from  Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. (KAR) , Karoon said in a
statement March 28.  “The blocks are located in areas with high
prospectivity,” Valeria Marconi, an analyst at Correval SA,
said in a telephone interview from Bogota. “It increases
Pacific Rubiales’s exposure to Brazil, which is a good thing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
