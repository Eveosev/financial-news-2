Defending champion Chelsea beat
 Manchester United  1-0 to advance to a semifinal match against
Manchester City in English soccer’s F.A. Cup.  Demba Ba scored with a right-foot volley in the 49th minute
of the quarterfinal replay at Stamford Bridge stadium in London.  After 60 minutes of play, Chelsea goalkeeper  Petr Cech 
saved a close-range effort from  Javier Hernandez  to deny United
an equalizer.  Chelsea is aiming for its fifth F.A. Cup title since 2007
and eighth overall. Millwall and Wigan will contest the other
semifinal.  Manchester United, which leads the Premier League by 15
points from Manchester City with eight of 38 games left, won the
last of its record 11 F.A. Cup trophies in 2004.  “We lacked the composure to win the game,” United coach
 Alex Ferguson  told ITV. “We had a lot of possession but didn’t
make the best use of it.”  Chelsea, which is fourth in the Premier League, had fought
back from 2-0 to draw 2-2 at Old Trafford stadium on March 10 to
force today’s replay.  To contact the reporters on this story:
