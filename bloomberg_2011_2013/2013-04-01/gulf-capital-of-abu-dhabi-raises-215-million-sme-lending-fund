Gulf Capital, the Abu Dhabi-based
investment firm with $2 billion of assets under management, said
it raised $215 million for a fund that will lend money mostly to
small and medium-sized businesses in a region where bank loans
have shrunk 64 percent since the financial crisis.  The International Finance Corp., an arm of the  World Bank (BOWEMBA) ,
which invested $20 million in the Gulf Credit Partners’ Credit
Fund, was among institutional investors as well as sovereign
wealth funds and family offices, El Solh said at a signing
ceremony between Gulf Capital and the IFC in Abu Dhabi.  “The reason we are doing it is because there is an acute
shortage of lending to small and medium enterprises in the
 Middle East , specifically in the Gulf,” El Solh, a former
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette leveraged-buyout executive, said
today. “Banks prefer to lend to larger corporations,
government-related entities, and no one is looking at this
segment.”  Bank lending in the Middle East has dropped from $110
billion in 2007 to $39 billion in 2012, with lending to small
and medium-sized enterprises accounting for 2 percent of total
lending in the Gulf, El Solh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
