Serbia extended by a month to April
30 the deadline for potential investors to place bids for
Galenika AD, an unprofitable state-owned pharmaceutical company.  The  Finance and Economy Ministry  is giving investors
another month to propose a “privatization model” as the
government seeks to turn around the money-losing drugmaker, the
ministry said on its  website  over the weekend. This is the
second extension since offers were first invited on Jan. 15. The
previous deadline was today.  The government is looking for a partner in Galenika among
international pharmaceutical companies active in the industry
for at least five years and with operating revenue of more than
200 million euros ($256 million) in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
