The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in Asia excluding  Japan 
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1.5 basis points to 122.5 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The benchmark, which ranged from 100.5 to
122.3 in the first three months of the year, is poised for its
highest close since Nov. 16, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 113
basis points as of 9:58 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The gauge has tumbled 46 basis points so far
this year, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.

bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
