Genworth Financial Inc., the
mortgage guarantor and life insurer, said it won approval for a
plan to distance its unit that backs home loans from the rest of
the company.  The insurer still has the option to implement a “NewCo”
type structure for its mortage-guarantee business and continue
writing new policies in all 50 U.S. states, the Richmond,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement distributed by
PRNewswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
