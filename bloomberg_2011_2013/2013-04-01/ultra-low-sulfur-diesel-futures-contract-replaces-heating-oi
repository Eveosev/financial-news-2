CME Group Inc. (CME) ’s heating oil
contract on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange has been renamed
ultra-low-sulfur-diesel futures after the April contract, the
last to reflect higher-sulfur fuel, expired March 28.  The name change comes after CME Group Inc. amended its
benchmark heating oil futures contract last April, lowering
sulfur specifications to 15 parts per million from 2,000 parts
and expanding the listed months an additional three years
beginning with the May contract. New York state switched to ULSD
in July last year, and other states in the northeast plan to
phase in reductions in coming years.  The revisions are intended to “make a smooth transition to
new lower-sulfur diesel standards for heating oil ahead of
changes in environmental regulations” in the U.S. Northeast,
Gary Morsches, managing director of global energy at CME Group,
said in a statement in 2012.  The contract will now serve as a dual-use price benchmark
for heating oil and on-road diesel markets and more closely
match diesel specifications in international markets, including
the European ultra-low sulfur diesel market, according to the
statement.  The delivered fuel will be free from renewable fuel,
biodiesel, alkali, mineral acid, grit, fibrous or other foreign
matter, meeting the delivery specifications of Colonial Pipeline
Co.’s Fungible Grade 62 for ultra-low sulfur diesel, according
to the  CME rulebook .  ULSD for May delivery on Nymex rose 2.17 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $3.0687 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
