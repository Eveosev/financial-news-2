Peru ’s sol rose for the first time
in a week as companies sold dollars to pay local taxes.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5890 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, according to prices from Datatec.  Peruvian companies have until tomorrow to meet their
obligations for the 2012 tax year. The central bank said on its
website it bought $20 million in the foreign-exchange market
today, paying an average 2.5899 soles per dollar. The central
bank bought $4.4 billion in the first quarter to weaken the sol.  “Volumes traded today were very small so the central
bank’s intervention was minimal,” said Antonio Diaz, a trader
at  Banco Internacional del Peru SAA. (INTERBC1)   The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 3.77 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price rose 0.10 centimo to 125.83 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
