Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s
biggest maker of construction and mining machines, wants more
visas for engineers and a path to legal status for undocumented
immigrants.  “We have trouble filling highly-skilled positions like
engineers and scientists,” said  Doug Oberhelman , chairman and
chief executive officer of Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar,
according to an e-mailed draft of a speech delivered at the
Illinois Business Immigration Coalition today in Chicago. “We
also have trouble filling many lower-skilled positions.
Immigrant employees are helping us compete today.”  Caterpillar, which gets two-thirds of its sales outside the
U.S., has seen foreign workers it has trained go work for
competitors overseas because they could not stay in the country,
which is “unacceptable,” Oberhelman said.  Reforms should include safe borders, changing visa laws to
better reflect business needs and providing a path to a legal
status for undocumented immigrants with the understanding that
they meet strict conditions, Oberhelman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
