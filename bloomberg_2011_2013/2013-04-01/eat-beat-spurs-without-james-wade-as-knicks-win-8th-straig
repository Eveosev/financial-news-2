The Miami Heat beat the San Antonio
Spurs 88-86 without LeBron James and  Dwyane Wade , as Chris Bosh
hit a winning 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds left in a matchup of
the two top teams in the National Basketball Association.  Bosh finished with 23 points last night in San Antonio,
Texas, to lead the Heat, who were without James, Wade and  Mario Chalmers  because of injuries.  “We are the defending champions no matter who we put out
there,” Bosh told reporters after Miami won for the 29th time
in its past 30 games. “We are still the Miami Heat.”  The previous time Miami and San Antonio played in January,
the Spurs were fined $250,000 by the NBA for holding  Tim Duncan ,
Manu Ginobili and  Tony Parker  out of the game. The Spurs won
that meeting 105-100.  Duncan and Kawhi Leonard each scored 17 points last night
for the Spurs (55-18). Miami is now an NBA-best 58-15.  The New York Knicks extended their winning streak to eight
games with a 108-89 home win over the Boston Celtics. Carmelo Anthony had 24 points and 10 rebounds for the Knicks (46-26),
who beat Boston for the third time in four meetings to win the
season series for the first time since the 2003-04 campaign.  The Heat host the Knicks tomorrow night in a meeting of
Eastern Conference division leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
