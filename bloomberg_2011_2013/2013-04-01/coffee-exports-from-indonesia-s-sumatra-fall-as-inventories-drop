Coffee shipments from  Indonesia ’s
southern Sumatra, the main growing region in the third-largest
producer, dropped 40 percent in March on depleting stockpiles.  Shipments from Lampung, South Sumatra and Bengkulu
provinces, which mostly grow robusta, plunged to 14,337 metric
tons last month from 23,912 tons in February, the Lampung trade
and industry office said in statement today. Exports were 5,070
tons in March last year.  Falling supplies from Indonesia, the largest grower after
Brazil and  Vietnam , may help to sustain a 6.6 percent gain in
the price of bitter-tasting robusta variety used in instant
drinks and espresso this year. Robusta for May delivery fell 0.2
percent to $2,051 a ton on the NYSE Liffe in  London  on March 28.  “There aren’t too many beans left, only big foreign
exporters still have stocks, but that’s also very limited,”
said Mochtar Luthfie, head of research and development at the
Lampung chapter of the Association of Indonesian Coffee
Exporters and Industry. “Supplies will gradually rise as
harvest starts.”  The three provinces account for about 75 percent of sales
from Indonesia. Coffee was shipped from Panjang port in Lampung.
Indonesia’s harvest runs from April to July, with a smaller crop
through September.  Shipments in the first three months of the year surged 154
percent to 45,460 tons from 17,887 tons a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the trade
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
