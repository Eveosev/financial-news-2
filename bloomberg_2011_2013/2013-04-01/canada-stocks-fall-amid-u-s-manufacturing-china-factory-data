Canadian stocks  fell as industrial
and commodity shares led declines amid reports showing U.S.
manufacturing slid and  China ’s factory output trailed forecasts.  Nine out of  10 groups  in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index dropped. Canadian National Railway Co. slumped
1.5 percent, while Canadian Pacific Railway lost 2 percent.
First Quantum Minerals Ltd. and Silver Wheaton Corp. sank more
than 1.7 percent, as the S&P’s GSCI measure of 24 commodities
dropped 0.8 percent.  The S&P/TSX fell 49.28 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,700.62
at 11:31 a.m. in Toronto. The benchmark gauge for Canadian
equities is up 2.2 percent this year. Trading volume was 37
percent below the 30-day average.  “This is the beginning of a choppy period that may lead
into a traditional May, June correction, which is why I’m
positioning myself conservatively,” Keith Richards, fund
manager with ValueTrend Wealth Management, said by telephone
from Barrie, Ontario. His firm manages about C$100 million ($98
million). “The market looks for a trigger, whether it’s
manufacturing data or something else.”  U.S. manufacturing expanded less than forecast in March as
factories slowed production and orders waned. Factory output in
China, the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals, rose
less than estimated. The Bank of  Japan ’s Tankan index showed
pessimism among large manufacturers. The U.S and China are
 Canada ’s two largest trading partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
