An online music service that allows
consumers to buy and sell used digital songs infringed music
copyrights, a federal judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan granted a motion by
Vivendi SAâ€™s Capitol Records for judgment without a trial,
according to a ruling in district court in Manhattan dated March
30. He denied a motion by ReDigi Inc. To dismiss
the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
