Nelson Mandela ’s condition didn’t
change significantly as he spent part of his fifth day in the
hospital with his family, the office of South African President
 Jacob Zuma  said.  Mandela’s family appreciates “the support they have been
receiving from the public,” the office said today in a
 statement  on its website.  South Africa ’s first black leader is being treated for
pneumonia at a hospital in the capital, Pretoria. Doctors
drained excess fluid from around his lungs, Zuma’s spokesman  Mac
Maharaj  said over the weekend.  Mandela’s condition improved yesterday and he had a
“restful day,” Zuma’s office said. The Nobel Peace Prize
laureate, 94, was breathing “without difficulty,” Maharaj said
yesterday.  Mandela was admitted for his second hospital stay this year
before midnight local time on March 27, less than three weeks
after a check-up. His health took a “downturn” that day and he
was brought to the hospital to prevent the infection from
spreading, Maharaj told broadcaster eNCA on March 28.  Mandela’s lung infection developed into a pleural effusion,
which was tapped, Maharaj said in a statement on March 30. He
said the former president was responding to treatment.  Mandela was hospitalized from Dec. 8 to Dec. 26 to treat a
lung infection and have gallstones removed. He contracted
tuberculosis while imprisoned on Robben Island during his 27-
year incarceration for fighting white minority rule.  Mandela led South Africa for five years after the  African
National Congress , or ANC, won the first all-race elections in
1994 that marked the end of apartheid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
