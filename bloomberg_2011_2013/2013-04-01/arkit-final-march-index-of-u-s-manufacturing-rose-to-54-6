The Markit Economics  final index  of
U.S. manufacturing increased to 54.6 in March from 54.3 a month
earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 for the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The preliminary reading was 54.9.  Markit’s purchasers figure is based on responses from about
85 percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  The Markit gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May 2012.
The company surveys purchasing managers in more than 30
countries and regions, including Europe and  China .  Chinese manufacturing expanded at a faster pace in March,
according to a gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit. The
index climbed to 51.6 from a four-month low of 50.4 in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
