Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  declined to the lowest level in more than three months
after a Chinese manufacturing indicator missed analysts’
estimates and inventories of the building material swelled.  The contract for delivery in October dropped as much as 2
percent to 3,733  yuan  ($601) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange, the lowest level since Dec. 14, and traded at
3,736 yuan at 10:36 a.m. local time. Futures lost 4.5 percent in
the first quarter.  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.9 in March, the
National bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said today. That’s lower than the 51.2 median
estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Readings above 50
indicate expansion.  China ’s  rebar inventory  was estimated at
10.1 million tons by March 29, more than double the level seen
at the end of 2012, according to Shanghai Steelhome Information.  “The Chinese PMI data just confirmed investors’ previous
expectations that the economy wasn’t as strong as the market had
anticipated at the beginning of this year,” Wu Jingchen, an
analyst at Capital Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing.
“Inventory is also too high.”  The average spot  price  of rebar fell 0.4 percent to 3,655
yuan a ton on March 29, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was little changed
at $137.30 a dry ton March 28, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
