Russia’s communications watchdog
said it withdrew a threat to block  Facebook Inc. (FB)  after the
social network removed a page on suicide, while  Google Inc. (GOOG)  is
suing another government agency over demands to delete a video.  The regulator, known as Roskomnadzor, can blacklist
websites featuring content banned under a  law  to protect
children that restricts child pornography and depictions of drug
use or suicide. The law came into effect last year.  When content has been deemed harmful to children, the
watchdog calls for the website owner to delete the questionable
material and may shut down the site, Vladimir Pikov, a spokesman
for Roskomnadzor, said by phone in Moscow.  Facebook agreed to cooperate and won’t be banned from
Russia, he said. Varvara Fefilova, a Moscow-based spokeswoman
for Facebook, declined to comment.  YouTube, Google’s video service, is suing  Russia ’s public-
health safety watchdog over a call to block a video showing how
to apply scary Halloween makeup, and had nothing to do with
infliction of bodily harm, according to the company’s press
office in Moscow.  The Halloween video was temporarily blocked, and the next
court hearing is scheduled for April 26, according to YouTube.  To contact the reporter on this story:
