U.S. Gulf Coast fuels strengthened
after Citgo Petroleum Corp. shut a fluid catalytic cracker at
the Corpus Christi East refinery in  Texas  and two plants began
planned maintenance.  The No. 2 FCC at the  Corpus Christi refinery  was halted
today following a leak on the unit’s power train, according to a
filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  and  Phillips 66 (PSX)  began scheduled work at
plants in Texas. Valero expects a five-week turnaround on the
108,000-barrel-a-day No. 2 crude unit at the McKee refinery,
while Phillips 66 carries out unspecified work at the Borger
plant, the companies said today.  The discount for  reformulated , 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf narrowed 1.25 cents to 4.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 3:27 p.m.
Conventional gasoline strengthened 0.38 cent a gallon to a
discount of 19.75 cents.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel 
strengthened 0.13 cent to 0.75 cent a gallon below futures.  The Corpus Christi, McKee and Borger refineries have the
ability to process 481,000 barrels a day, or 5.3 percent of Gulf
Coast capacity, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Work at the sites may shrink regional  gasoline supplies ,
which totaled 73.4 million barrels in the week ended March 22,
according to the Energy Information Administration. Distillate
stockpiles were 35.1 million barrels, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm said.  Crack Spreads  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , widened 68 cents to $27.44 a barrel. The same spread
based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil shrank by 57 cents to $10.45.  The spread for refineries in New York Harbor, based on
Brent oil in  Europe , declined 16 cents to $13.41 a barrel, the
lowest level since March 7, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The discount for r eformulated , 84-octane gasoline in
the region widened 0.5 cent to 24.75 cents a gallon versus
futures.  Gasoline in the New York Harbor traded  20.24 cents  a gallon
below the same fuel on the U.S. Gulf Coast, compared with 12
cents a gallon a week ago.  CME Group Inc.’s heating oil contract on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  was renamed ultra-low-sulfur-diesel futures
following the expiration last week of the April contract, the
last to reflect higher-sulfur fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
