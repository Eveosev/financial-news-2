Overcoming skeptical industry buzz, “ Motown: The Musical ” is selling lots of tickets prior to its opening on April 14.  The show, based on the life of Berry Gordy and scored with the iconic music he produced, sold $1.2 million of tickets last week, according to figures provided by the  Broadway League  trade association.  The show has taken in more than $1 million in each of the three weeks of previews so far, a feat that has the producers on “Cloud Nine.”  Other winners, in a week that included the Easter holiday, were “Matilda,” $961,000 as it rolls toward an April 11 opening; “Cinderella,” which grossed $1.4 million, up 26 percent from a week earlier; “Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark,” leaping 62 percent to $1.9 million and “Wicked,” which took in $2.6 million over nine performances.  ‘Kinky Boots,” a new musical set to open Thursday night, took in $894,000. That’s little changed from a week earlier, but the production gave away tickets to reviewers.  With mixed reviews, “ Hands on a Hardbody ,” about contestants in a small Texas town competing for a Nissan truck, showed some life, jumping 52 percent for a weekly gross of $321,000.  Even with press comps, Nora Ephron’s “Lucky Guy” with  Tom Hanks  grossed $1.3 million and is on track to be one of Broadway’s bestselling plays.  “Ann,” Holland Taylor’s ode to Ann Richards, the former Texas governor, grossed $287,000 with ticket sales dropping 21 percent.  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on Tom Hanks’s Broadway debut and Daniel Akst on  books .  To contact the reporter on this story: Philip Boroff in  New York  at  pboroff@bloomberg.net .
