Crude oil options volatility rose as
the underlying futures fell for the first time in six days after
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut its Pegasus pipeline following a spill in
 Arkansas .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 17.43 percent at 3:30 p.m. on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, up from 16.57 percent on March 28.  West Texas Intermediate oil for May delivery dropped 16
cents to settle at $97.07 a barrel on the Nymex. The shutdown of
Pegasus, which carries oil to the Gulf Coast from  Illinois ,
stoked concern that U.S. stockpiles will build.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $90 puts, which were unchanged at 9 cents a barrel on volume
of 2,319 contracts at 3:41 p.m. June $105 calls were the second-
most active, with 1,597 lots traded. They declined 4 cents to 30
cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume.
Calls made up 51 percent of the trading volume of 103,438
contracts on March 28.  May $90 puts were the most active options traded in that
session, with 5,693 contracts changing hands. They fell 1 cent
to 9 cents a barrel. June $110 calls gained 2 cents to 12 cents
a barrel on 3,988 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
36,119 contracts. Next were December $100 calls at 34,150 and
December $110 calls at 32,238.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
