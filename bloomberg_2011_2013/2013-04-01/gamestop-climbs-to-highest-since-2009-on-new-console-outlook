GameStop Corp. (GME) , the world’s largest
video-game retailer, rose to its highest level since 2009 after
analysts predicted that sales will increase as console makers
introduce new models this year.  The shares  advanced  6.4 percent to $29.76 at the close in
New York, the highest closing price for Grapevine, Texas-based
GameStop since April 30, 2009.  A new version of  Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT)  Xbox console and the
introduction of  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s PlayStation 4 will lift GameStop’s
sales later this year and in 2014, Edward Woo, an analyst with
Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, said today in a note to
investors. Woo, who is based in Irvine, California, boosted his
price target on the shares to $34 from $29.  “The new core gaming consoles by Microsoft and Sony will
drive consumer interest and demand for video games over the next
several years,” wrote Woo, who has a buy rating on the shares.  Tony Wible , at Janney Montgomery Scott, wrote in a note
today that GameStop is likely to gain market share because the
new consoles will increase demand for games. Wible, based in
Philadelphia, reccomends investors buy the shares.  Last month, GameStop reported fourth-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates, led by digital and mobile products.
The retailer said the second half of the year is expected to be
“strong” with the release of the “Grand Theft Auto V” game
and at least one new console.  To contact the reporter on this story:
