Rescuers suspended work at the site
of a landslide that buried 83 people at a  copper mine  in  Tibet 
owned by  China Gold International Resources Corp. (2099)  on safety
concerns, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Thirty-six bodies have been recovered from the mine site
after the landslide struck a workers’ camp at the Jiama copper
mine in Maizhokunggar county, approximately 68 kilometers (42
miles) from the regional capital Lhasa, at about 6 a.m. on March
29, according to Xinhua. Rescue work was suspended yesterday
after four fissures with lengths of more than 600 meters were
found at the site, posing risks of a subsequent landslide,
Xinhua reported.  The fatalities follow three deaths in January at a copper
mine in the eastern province of Fujian owned by Zijin Mining
Group Co.,  China ’s third-biggest gold producer by output.
China’s history of mining incidents includes the world’s worst
safety record at its coal mines, which saw 1,973 people killed
in accidents in 2011 and 2,433 the year before that, according
to the State Administration of Work Safety.  China Gold International, a unit of state-owned China
National Gold Group, owns the Jiama mine. Three calls to the
mobile phone of Wu Zhanming, senior vice president of China Gold
International, went unanswered yesterday.  China Gold International, based in  Vancouver ,  fell  13
percent to close at C$3.33 yesterday in Toronto, the biggest
drop since Dec. 16, 2011. Zhongjin Gold Co., China National
Gold’s publicly traded unit in Shanghai,  declined  2.5 percent to
13.86  yuan  yesterday, the lowest level in  almost a year .  China National Gold’s President Sun Zhaoxue held an
emergency meeting at the mine site on March 30, the company said
on its website on  March 31 . More than 4,500 rescuers and 200
pieces of construction machinery have been used to search for
the buried miners in the debris, Xinhua said.  About 2 million cubic meters of rock and earth was set
loose by the landslide, Xinhua said, citing Li Yuelin, a rescue
expert from northwestern  Gansu Province .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
