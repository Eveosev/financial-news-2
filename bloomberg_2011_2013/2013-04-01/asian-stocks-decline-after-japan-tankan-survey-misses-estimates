Asian  stocks  fell, with Japan’s
Topix Index falling the most since March 2011, after a survey of
sentiment among the country’s largest manufacturers missed
estimates and an official gauge of China’s factory output
expanded at a slower-than-expected pace.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Japanese automaker that led gains on
the Nikkei 225 Stock Average since mid-November, lost 4.3
percent as the yen strengthened against all its major peers.

brokerage was sued by a trust over an alleged breach of contract
involving $1.14 billion of mortgage-backed securities. Inner

producer of rare-earth minerals, slid 2.6 percent after
reporting a slump in earnings  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  lost 1.2 percent to 133.97 as
of 7:29 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than three shares falling for
each that rose. The gauge has rallied in the past five months
amid signs the U.S. economy is recovering and speculation Japan
will introduce aggressive measures to stimulate the world’s
third-largest economy.  “We need to see the economy showing signs of improvement
and inflation numbers picking up in Japan,” Vasu Menon, head of
content and research at OCBC Bank Ltd. in Singapore, told
Bloomberg Television. “We’ve seen too many flashes in the pan
in Japan. Rethoric is not enough. We need to see concrete
action. We need to see economic numbers react to that action.
China is recovering but the recovery is going to be a modest
one.”  Japan’s Topix  Japan’s Topix declined 3.3 percent, the most since March
15, 2011, as the Bank of Japan’s quarterly Tankan survey showed
confidence among big Japanese manufacturers improved less than
economists estimated. Japan’s broadest share gauge gained 36
percent since mid-November amid speculation Shinzo Abe’s new
government will take steps to pull the economy out of deflation.  The cost of bearish options on the Nikkei 225 traded near
an eight-month high as investors bought protection against
declines amid concern the Bank of Japan will fail to deliver
stimulus at this week’s meeting. The Nikkei 225 fell 2.1 percent
today.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.1 percent. The
official Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.9 in March, the
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said today in Beijing.  While the reading was the highest in 11 months, it fell
short of the 51.2 median estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. A separate gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics rose to 51.6 in March from 50.4. Readings above
50 indicate expansion.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  slid 0.4 percent, while Taiwan’s
Taiex Index lost 0.2 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index
was little changed. Markets in Hong Kong, Australia and New
Zealand are closed today for a holiday.  U.S. Futures  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 4.8 percent this year

average, compared with 14.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the S&P 500 lost 0.1 percent today. The gauge
rose to a record on March 28 as data bolstered confidence in the
world’s largest economy. U.S. markets were closed on March 29.

at 54 for March, little changed from February’s 54.2, which was
the highest since June 2011, economists estimated before data
today.  Manufacturers declined today. Mazda dropped 4.3 percent to
