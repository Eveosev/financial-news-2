Colombian peso bond yields rose as
Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said last month’s surprise
half-point interest-rate reduction may bring to an end a cutting
cycle that began in July.  Yields on peso bonds due 2024 climbed seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.97 percent at 9:47 a.m. in
Bogota, according to the central bank. The price fell 0.819
centavo to 142.665 centavos per peso. Colombian markets were
closed March 28-29.  Policy makers accelerated the pace of borrowing-cost cuts
on March 22 when they lowered the target lending rate by 50
basis points to 3.25 percent, surprising most analysts, who
expected a 25 basis point cut. They have reduced the key rate 2
percentage points since the beginning of cuts in July.  “It does look like we’ve reached the end of the easing
cycle,” said Daniel Lozano, the head analyst at Serfinco SA
brokerage in Bogota. “That goes against the view of some who
are still expecting more cuts.”  The peso appreciated for a second straight day, advancing
0.1 percent to 1,823.79 per  U.S. dollar . It has slumped 3.1
percent this year.  Colombia  is “getting close to the end of what the central
bank can do in terms of cutting its  interest rates ,” Cardenas,
who is also president of the monetary authority’s board, said on
RCN Radio today. He also said he expects the peso to weaken
toward 1,900 and hopes “we get there quickly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
