Saudi Arabian women are allowed to
ride bicycles in public so long as they are still accompanied by
a male guardian and wear “fully modest dress,” the al-Yaum
newspaper reported on its website.  The male guardian is also necessary in the event the women
have an accident while riding the bicycle, the newspaper said,
citing an unidentified official from the Commission for the
Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, the country’s
religious police.  The women should ride the bicycles or buggies on a beach or
the outskirts of a city and only for recreation, not as a means
of transportation, al-Yaum said.  Saudi Arabia , which has the world’s second-largest oil
reserves, enforces constraints on women stemming from the
Wahhabi version of Islam. Men and women are segregated in
public, including at schools, restaurants and lines at fast-food
takeouts. Women need permission from a male guardian to go to
school or get married, and are barred from driving.  King Abdullah  in 2011 appointed female members to the
Consultative Council for the first time, naming 30 women to the
150-member advisory body.  To contact the reporters on this story:
