STX Pan Ocean Co. (028670) , a commodities
shipping operator, led drops among STX Group units in  Seoul 
trading after failing to draw buyers for a  stake  as part of
plans to raise 2.5 trillion won ($2.2 billion) to pay debt.  Pan Ocean fell 10 percent, the biggest decline in almost
two months, to 3,970 won at the close in Seoul.  STX Corp. (011810) , the
South Korean group’s holding company and Pan Ocean’s biggest
shareholder, dropped 6.9 percent to 6,310 won, the lowest
closing price since Feb. 2, 2005.  STX Group is selling assets and working with creditor  Korea
Development Bank  on ways to improve its finances. The moves
follow a slump in dry-bulk freight rates and a collapse in
demand for new vessels that hit earnings at the group’s
shipbuilding businesses and at Seoul-based Pan Ocean, the
nation’s biggest commodities-shipping company.  “STX Pan Ocean needs to eliminate risk by separating from
the group and to raise funds by reinforcing its  credit rating  or
conducting a rights offering,” Park Eun Kyung, an analyst at
Samsung Securities Co. in Seoul, wrote in a note dated March 29.
“A Korea Development Bank-led private equity fund will likely
accelerate efforts to acquire the firm.”  The group didn’t receive any letters of intent for a 36
percent stake in Pan Ocean, STX Group said March 29 after the
market’s close. The group said it will discuss the sale plan
with its main creditor bank.  State-owned Korea Development Bank, the main creditor bank
and Pan Ocean’s second-largest shareholder, said last month it
will consider buying the stake in the commodities shipping
company if STX Group fails to find a buyer in the public bid.  Container Ships  Pan Ocean operates a fleet of about 400 owned and chartered
ships, including dry-bulk vessels, container ships and tankers.  STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. (067250) , the third-biggest
shareholder of Pan Ocean, fell 6 percent.  STX Heavy Industries
Co. (071970)  dropped 3.8 percent.  STX’s three main companies, Pan Ocean, STX Offshore and STX
Corp., have 1.16 trillion won in bonds and loans maturing this
year, about 20 percent of their outstanding debt, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The group’s companies are
interlinked through cross-shareholdings.  The group in December sold its entire stake in  STX OSV
Holdings Ltd. (SOH)  for 455 million euros ($582 million) to
Fincantieri SpA of Italy. In October, it raised 360 billion won
by agreeing to sell a 43 percent stake in unit STX Energy Co. to
Tokyo-based  Orix Corp. (8591)   To contact the reporter on this story:
