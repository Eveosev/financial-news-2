PMI Group Inc. (PPMIQ) , the mortgage insurer
that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2011, said a “well-
known private-equity investor” ended talks about taking a
minority stake in the reorganized company.  “The potential investor recently terminated such
negotiations, and the company expects not to proceed with a
transaction,” San Ramon, California-based PMI said today in a
regulatory filing.  The insurer said it hasn’t yet decided whether it will
pursue other outside investors. PMI didn’t give a reason why the
talks, disclosed in December, ended.  A rebound in the housing market is fueling investor
interest in mortgage insurance after companies like PMI and
 Triad Guaranty Inc. (TGIC)  were hobbled by losses in the real estate
slump. NMI Holdings Inc. raised $550 million last year to open a
mortgage insurer, and  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  and  Radian Group
Inc. (RDN)  have sold common stock and convertible senior notes this
year to bolster their units that back home loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
