Invermar SA,  Chile ’s best-performing
salmon farmer stock in the first quarter, plunged the most since
August 2011 after saying it received an offer for a controlling
stake in the company valued at half the current market price.  Invermar dropped 14 percent to 104 pesos at 12:41 p.m. in
Santiago. Trading volume was 3.9 times the daily average of the
past three months. Chile’s Ipsa index slipped 0.3 percent.  The salmon farmer, the smallest by market value in Chile,
received on Jan. 29 a $20 million offer for a 54 percent stake
from  Canada ’s Cooke Aquaculture Inc., according to a March 29
regulatory  filing . The proposal valued the company at 13 U.S.
cents per share, according to the filing. Invermar closed on
March 28 at 120.84 pesos, or about 26 U.S. cents.  “The shares are falling because of the price offered,”
Andres Galarce, an analyst at brokerage Euroamerica Corredores
de Bolsa SA, said in a phone interview from Santiago. “It’s way
below the current market price.”  Invermar’s shares had increased 75 percent in 2013 before
today, after falling 60 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
