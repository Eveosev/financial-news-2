BlackBerry shares gained 4.6 percent
after Paradigm Capital Inc. raised its rating on the stock to
“speculative buy,” saying rumors of the smartphone maker’s
demise have been “greatly exaggerated.”  Gabriel Leung, an analyst at Paradigm in Toronto, upgraded
the shares from a hold rating and now expects the stock to reach
$19 over the next 12 months, compared with a previous estimate
of $16.  The company posted better-than-expected earnings last
quarter, even as sales missed projections, a sign that profit
margins are improving, Leung said in a report. Adding to the
optimism: The BlackBerry Q10, a model with a physical keyboard
that’s expected to be popular with corporate customers, is due
soon, he said. Leung also cited the imminent departure of
BlackBerry inventor  Mike Lazaridis  from the board, a move that
could make the company more likely to be sold.  “While the company is certainly not out of the woods, we
believe the stock is worth a second look given the stabilized
operational results, pending launch of the highly anticipated
Q10 keyboard device (which should be supported by a strong
corporate refresh), and a possible rejuvenation of takeover
speculation,” he said in the report.  The stock climbed to $15.11 at the close in  New York . The
rise pushed the shares gains this year to 27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
