Mongolia plans to build a $3.5
billion cross-country highway between its Russian and Chinese
borders, state-run  news agency  Montsame reported.  The 627-mile-long highway will be built under a concession
agreement and operated privately from 2015 to 2040, the news
agency reported March 29. Foreign investors will provide the
funding for 70 percent of the cost of construction while a
Mongolian investment group called Chinggisland Development will
bear the remainder, according to Montsame. North American and
Italian companies will be involved, the agency reported, without
identifying specific firms.  Construction of the road from Altanbulag on the Russian
border to Zamyn-Uud on the Chinese frontier will start in May
and is expected to finish in late 2015, Montsame reported.  The road will facilitate trade between China, Russia and
 Europe , the agency reported. It will also boost Mongolian trade
volume and help develop towns, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
