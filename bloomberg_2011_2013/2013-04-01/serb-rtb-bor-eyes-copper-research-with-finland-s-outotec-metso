RTB Bor, Serbia’s sole copper
producer, may team up with units of  Finland ’s  Outotec OYJ (OTE1V)  and
 Metso OYJ (MEO1V)  in exploring deep ore deposits and reprocessing more
than a billion tons of tailings.  The Bor-based miner and smelter plans to search for copper,
gold and silver at depths of more than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile)
and may work with  Geological Survey of Finland , or GTK, with
Outotec and Metso Minerals Oy, Blagoje Spaskoski, RTB Bor’s
chief executive officer, said in a phone interview after meeting
with company officials today. They may also reuse RTB’s 1.4
billion tons of tailings that contain 0.1 percent copper, he
said.  “We already obtained drills for depths of up to 3.2
kilometers,” after a plan to explore deposits with Freeport
McMoRan Exploration Corp. fell through last year, he said.  Metso and Outotec are already working on upgrades at state-
owned RTB Bor, including new flotation facilities and a smelter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
