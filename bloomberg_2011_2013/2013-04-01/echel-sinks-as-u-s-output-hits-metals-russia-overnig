OAO Mechel (MTL)  declined to a four-year
low in  New York , leading a slump in Russian stocks, after data
showing U.S. manufacturing expanded less than economists
estimated last month sank commodities.  American depositary receipts of  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s largest
maker of steelmaking coal, slid 2.4 percent to $4.94, the lowest
level since April 7, 2009. Mechel was the biggest decliner on
the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian
equities in New York, which slipped 0.1 percent. The  Market
Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated Russian exchange-
traded fund, dropped 1.2 percent to $27.41.  Commodities, which made up more than  80 percent  of Russian
export proceeds in 2011, slid 0.3 percent, according to the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index. The  Institute for Supply
Management ’s U.S. factory index fell to 51.3 last month, from an
almost two-year high in February, with 50 the dividing line
between growth and contraction. Concern over OAO Rosneft’s plan
to borrow from TNK-BP and not pay dividends is also deterring
investment in Russia, according to Kazimir Partners Ltd.  “There is no reason for the market to rise and there seems
to be every reason for it to fall instead,” Mansur Mammadov,
who helps manage $100 million at Kazimir Partners in Moscow,
said by phone yesterday. “U.S. manufacturing data raised
concerns over demand for commodities, while Rosneft’s approach
toward minority investors does a lot of damage to the Russian
investment climate.”  Futures expiring in June on Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS
Index fell 0.1 percent to 139,610 in U.S. hours, while the RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock
futures , gained 1.4 percent to 18.76.  Slowdown Concern  Mechel slipped 0.7 percent to 152.80 rubles, or $4.92, in
Moscow yesterday. The ADRs lost 27 percent in the January-March
period, the worst quarterly drop since the end of June, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. manufacturing grew less than forecast in March as
orders and production cooled, highlighting the risk of a U.S.
economic slowdown this quarter. Manufacturing in  China  also
expanded less than forecast as the country’s  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index was 50.9 in March, government data released
yesterday showed, below the 51.2 median estimate of 26
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  OAO TNK-BP Holding, TNK-BP’s traded unit, slid the most on
record March 26 after state-run Rosneft, which bought the
company from BP Plc and a group of billionaires, said it would
borrow funds from the oil producer. Rosneft Chief Executive
Officer  Igor Sechin  said March 22 that they won’t buy shares
held by minority investors and said in October that TNK-BP’s
 dividend policy  may be terminated.  Oil Outlook  Prosperity Capital Management Ltd ., which oversees about $4
billion in Russian assets, may team up with other TNK-BP Holding
investors to seek redress after the stock’s slide, CEO Mattias Westman said March 28. TNK-BP Holding shares slid 1.2 percent to
38.01 rubles, or $1.22, in Moscow yesterday. Rosneft is the
world’s biggest publicly traded oil producer.  “It’s not about Rosneft, it’s about the market,”
Kazimir’s Mammadov said yesterday.  Kazimir Partners owns ADRs of OAO Sberbank, OAO Lukoil, OAO
Novatek and OAO MegaFon and is “looking closely” at ADRs of
OAO Mobile TeleSystems and OAO VTB Bank, Russia’s second-biggest
bank after Sberbank, Mammadov said.  “There is still room for further decline as the market is
pessimistic on oil’s outlook and Russian equities suffer from
that,” Mammadov said. “Valuations are already low and some
stocks, such as Novatek and VTB, look attractive at their
current levels.”  Lowest Valuation  Russia’s Micex Index trades at 5.3 times estimated
earnings, the lowest valuation among 21  emerging markets  tracked
by Bloomberg. It compares with a valuation of 11.3 for  Brazil ’s
Bovespa index and 9.5 times for  the Shanghai Composite Index  of
domestic Chinese shares. The Russian gauge slipped 0.7 percent
to 1,428.47 yesterday.  OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY)  gained 1.3 percent to $24.15 in New York
yesterday, settling at a 3.2 percent premium to the company’s
Moscow-listed shares, the widest gap since Sept. 21, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Rostelecom dropped 0.6 percent to
121.25 rubles, or $3.90, in Moscow yesterday.  OAO VTB Group is purchasing  Tele2 AB (TEL2B) ’s Russian unit for
$3.55 billion in cash and debt. VTB may later merge the company
with the mobile assets of state-run Rostelecom, which would form
a fourth nationwide wireless carrier in Russia, Otkritie Capital
said last week.  Brent Gains  Ruble futures  showed the currency weakening less than 0.1
percent to 31.75 per dollar in U.S. hours. Russia’s ruble fell
0.1 percent to 31.0845 per dollar yesterday and dropped 0.2
percent to 35.0704 against the dollar-euro basket used by the
central bank to manage swings that erode exporter
competitiveness.  Crude oil for May delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $97.07 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, declining
for the first time in six days. Brent oil for May settlement
increased 1 percent to $111.08 a barrel.  Urals crude , Russia’s
major export oil blend, increased 0.3 percent to $107.58 per
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
