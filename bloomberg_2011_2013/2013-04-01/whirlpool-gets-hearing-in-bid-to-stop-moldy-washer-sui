Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  will get a new
hearing in its bid to stop a class action lawsuit over moldy
washing machines as the U.S. Supreme Court told a lower court to
revisit the case.  The justices today ordered reconsideration in light of an
opinion they issued last week throwing out a class action case
against  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   A federal appeals court let the Whirlpool case go forward
as a class action on behalf of 200,000 Ohio residents. The suing
consumers say their front-loading washers developed a smelly
buildup of mold.  Whirlpool says a class action is inappropriate under the
rules governing federal lawsuits because the mold problem
affected fewer than 3 percent of the appliance manufacturer’s
washers.  Whirlpool, based in  Benton Harbor ,  Michigan , says the case
is one of nine it faces around the country over the washers.
Together, the suits involve more than 1.5 million buyers, the
company said in its appeal. At least seven other manufacturers
and sellers of front-loading washers are defendants in similar
suits.  Philadelphia-based Comcast was accused of monopolizing its
hometown market. The suing customers said Comcast swapped
territories and subscribers with competitors to ensure it could
control the market and charge higher prices. Comcast has denied
the allegations.  The high court, ruling 5-4, said the customers didn’t meet
requirements for outlining a common method that could be used to
determine monetary damages for each of the thousands of
individual parties to the lawsuit.  The case is Whirlpool v. Glazer, 12-322.  To contact the reporter on this story:
