Western Canada Select weakened
against domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate after  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut a pipeline carrying crude from Illinois to
refineries along the Gulf Coast.  Exxon shut the 20-inch Pegasus line from Patoka, Illinois,
to Nederland, Texas, on March 29 following a leak of Canadian
heavy crude in central Arkansas. The line can transport 96,000
barrels a day.  “Certainly, the main story is the pipeline spill,” said
Andrew Lebow, a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in
New York. “I think it’s unknown how long it’s going to be down
for.”  Western Canada Select slipped 65 cents a barrel to trade at
a $15 discount to WTI at 1:49 p.m. New York time, according to
data from Calgary energy broker Net Energy.  Oil produced on the Gulf Coast strengthened as WTI  weakened
against Brent  by $1.57 a barrel to a discount of $14.36 a barrel
at 2:03 p.m. in New York. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  “The volumes have been pretty light,” Lebow said. “It’s
Easter Monday in Europe, and maybe that’s exacerbating some of
this trading we’re seeing.”  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1.25 to $18
a barrel at 2:01 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1.25 to a premium of
$17.  Poseidon’s premium gained $1.70 to $13.20. Southern Green
Canyon strengthened $1.15 to an $11.15 premium. Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI rose by $1.25 to $13 a barrel.  The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
strengthened by $1.30 to $15.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
