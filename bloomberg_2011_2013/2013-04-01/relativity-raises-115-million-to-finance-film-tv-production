Relativity Media LLC, the
independent movie and television studio run by Ryan Kavanaugh,
raised a $115 million credit facility to buy and produce movies
and television shows.  The five-year revolving credit facility was arranged by
OneWest Bank, Barclays Plc and City National Bank, the companies
said in a statement yesterday. OneWest and Barclays plan to seek
additional participants to boost the facility to $300 million
over the next year, according to the statement.  Relativity, whose investors include Yucaipa Cos. founder
 Ron Burkle , plans to double its release slate to 10 films this
year, with movies including the Mafia drama “Malavita,”
starring Robert DeNiro and Tommy Lee Jones, and  “Out of the
Furnace,” featuring  Christian Bale .  The new financing follows a $350 million loan Relativity
raised last year, also to fund expansion.  Burkle acquired a stake in Relativity in January 2012 by
purchasing Elliott Management Corp.’s minority holding, two
people with knowledge of the situation said at the time. In
July, Yucaipa and Relativity formed Relativity Sports, a
management agency for professional athletes, according to the
studio’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
