The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers today, with clickable links to the
web.  Gerrard Contract  Liverpool plans to offer team captain Steven Gerrard a two-
year contract extension,  the Sun  reported.  Reds coach Brendan Rodgers says Gerrard, who turns 33 next
month, can carry on playing in the Premier League into his late
30s, according to the Sun.  ‘Easy’ Draws  Manchester United coach Alex Ferguson says Chelsea -- which
won the FA Cup four times since 2007 -- hasn’t had “one hard
game” in reaching the semi-finals in recent years, the  Daily
Telegraph  reported.  The Telegraph said Chelsea, which hosts United in a
quarterfinal replay today, was drawn against lower-league teams
19 times out of 26 between the third and sixth rounds of the
competition since the 2006-2007 season.  Bridge Move  Manchester City defender Wayne Bridge could sign
permanently for Brighton, where he is playing on loan this
season,  the Sun  reported.  Bridge, who played 42 games for City since a 10 million
pound ($15 million) move from Chelsea in 2009, is also a target
for second-tier Cardiff, the Sun said.  Newcastle Target  Newcastle may hire Celtic’s English center half Kelvin
Wilson for 5 million pounds, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  Wilson would replace Fabricio Coloccini, who wants to
return home to  Argentina , according to the Mirror.  To contact the reporters on this story:
