Cotton production next year will
drop less than forecast a month ago, and the anticipated gain
will be smaller, according to the International Cotton Advisory
Committee.  Output will total 23.47 million metric tons in the year
starting Aug. 1, 4 percent more than 22.56 million forecast in
March, the Washington-based ICAC said today in an e-mailed
statement. Production this year will be 26.01 million.  Global consumption will reach 23.71 million tons, down
70,000 tons from last month’s projection, though still higher
than the 23.41 million estimated for the 2012-2013 season, the
group said. Stockpiles on July 31, 2014, will total 16.44
million tons, or 670,000 higher than the March’s estimate.  Cotton prices are up 16 percent this year on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York “due to concerns about a tightening supply-
demand balance outside of  China ,” where mills continue to build
reserves, the committee said.  Midway through this season,  Australia , the seventh-largest
producer, surpassed both  India  and the U.S. as the biggest
suppliers of the fiber to China, the world’s top consumer and
importer, according to the report. The U.S. is the leading
exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
