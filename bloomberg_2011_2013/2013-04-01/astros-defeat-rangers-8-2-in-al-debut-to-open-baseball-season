The Houston Astros won their first
game as an American League team, beating the Texas Rangers 8-2
to open Major League Baseball’s regular season.  Rick Ankiel had a pinch-hit three-run home run last night
at Minute Maid Park in Houston, while Justin Maxwell had two
triples and drove in two runs for the Astros, who switched to
the AL in the offseason after 51 years in the National League.  Bo Porter had a winning debut as manager for the Astros,
who had baseball’s worst record the past two seasons, including
a 55-107 mark last year. The Astros’ estimated Opening Day
payroll of $18.7 million is the lowest in Major League Baseball
since the 2006 Florida Marlins, according to ESPN.  Houston starting pitcher Bud Norris allowed two runs over 5
2/3 innings to pick up the win and Erik Bedard threw 3 1/3
scoreless innings for the save as the Astros opened the season
with a victory for the first time since 2006.  Houston is the first major-league team to change leagues
since 1998, when the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the NL Central
division from the AL Central.  The Rangers, who lost 2010 AL Most Valuable Player Josh Hamilton during the offseason along with Michael Young and Mike Napoli, were limited to six hits. Texas scored both of its runs
in the sixth inning on singles by David Murphy and Nelson Cruz.  Baseball has 12 Opening Day games scheduled for today,
starting with the  New York  Yankees hosting the Boston Red Sox
and Miami Marlins visiting the Washington Nationals. Both games
are scheduled to start at 1:05 p.m. Eastern time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
