Volatility in Mexico’s peso dropped
to a three-week low as foreign investors poured money into the
country’s higher-yielding assets, supporting the currency.  One-month historical volatility, a gauge of the magnitude
of the peso’s fluctuations over the period, fell to its lowest
level since March 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 12.2940 per dollar at 7:47
a.m. in Mexico City, extending its 2013 rally to 4.5 percent,
the biggest increase among 16 major dollar counterparts tracked
by Bloomberg.  Volatility in the peso has been falling as global investors
pile into the country’s bonds, seeking higher yields after
policy makers indicated last month that their first interest-
rate  cut  since 2009 was a one-off reduction.  “In periods of risk-off, you’re not seeing the currency
reacting as it used to,” Roberto Torres, the head of peso
trading at BNP Paribas, said by phone from New York.  The most recent data from the central bank show the
percentage of fixed-rate government bonds held by global
investors is holding at almost a 13-year high of 56 percent.
Foreign ownership is likely to continue to rise, Nick Chamie,
the global head of foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of
Canada, said in a research note to clients.  Yields on peso-denominated bonds due in 2024 declined one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.10
centavo to 144.30 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
