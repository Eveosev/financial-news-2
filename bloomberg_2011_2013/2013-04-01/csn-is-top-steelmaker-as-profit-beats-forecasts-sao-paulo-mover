Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (SID)  rose
the most among global steelmakers after profit exceeded
analyst’s estimates and the the company denied making a binding
offer for ThyssenKrupp’s CSA mill.  Shares of Brazil’s second-biggest steelmaker by market
value, also known as CSN, jumped 5.6 percent to 9.64 reais at
12:52 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the biggest gain on Brazil’s benchmark
Bovespa index and among global steelmakers with a market value
of at least $1 billion.  Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter was 332 million
reais ($164 million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg
after the company released results on March 28. That compares
with an average estimate of 183 million reais among seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. CSN executives in a conference
call today forecast reductions in debt levels and further
increases in Brazilian steel prices.  “The stock is reacting positively today because profit
exceeded forecasts and the steelmaker denied an offer for CSA,”
 Pedro Galdi , chief analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW
Corretora, said in a phone interview.  David Salama, CSN’s head of  investor relations , said on
today’s call that “up until now the company hasn’t made a
binding offer” for ThyssenKrupp’s CSA. Investors were concerned
that buying the asset would push up CSN’s debt levels, Galdi
said.  CSN shares fell 23 percent in the first quarter, three
times the Bovespa’s 7.6 percent decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
