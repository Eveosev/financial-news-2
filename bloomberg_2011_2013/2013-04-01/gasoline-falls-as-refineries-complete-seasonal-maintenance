Gasoline fell as refineries
restarted units after maintenance, boosting operating rates.  Futures declined as refiners processed the most crude and
other feedstocks in two months during the week ended March 22,
according to Energy Information Administration data. Today’s
loss follows the smallest first-quarter gain in five years.  “Everything has returned from turnaround on the East Coast
and refineries have been increasing operating rates, adding to
supply,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  Gasoline for May delivery declined 2.35 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.0871 a gallon at 9:52 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 5.3 percent below the
100-day average for the time of day.  Today is the first day of trading since March 28 because
the market was closed March 29 for Good Friday.  The ultra-low-sulfur-diesel contract for May delivery
declined 1.89 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $3.0281 a gallon on
volume that was 43 percent below the 100-day average. Today is
the first day of trading the contract that represents ULSD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
