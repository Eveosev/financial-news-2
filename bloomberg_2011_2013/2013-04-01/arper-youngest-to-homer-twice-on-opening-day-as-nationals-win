Bryce Harper became the youngest
Major League Baseball player to hit two home runs in his team’s
first game of the season as the  Washington Nationals  beat the
Miami Marlins 2-0.  Harper, 20, hit solo home runs off of Marlins starter Ricky Nolasco in the first and fourth innings today at Nationals Park
in Washington. It was the first of 12 games to finish today on
baseball’s first full day of the season.  Harper’s two home runs accounted for Washington’s only
scoring as another No. 1 draft pick,  Stephen Strasburg , allowed
three hits in seven innings and former  New York  Yankees closer
 Rafael Soriano  recorded the save.  The top pick in 2010, Harper hit .270 with 22 home runs
last year. He was the National League’s Rookie of the Year in
2012, and at 19 years old, became the youngest position player
to participate in an All-Star game.  Don Money was 21 years old when he hit two home runs in the
Philadelphia Phillies’ first game in 1969. Harper finished the
game 2-for-4.  Strasburg, the No. 1 pick in 2009, struck out three in his
first MLB game since being shut down last September and withheld
from the team’s postseason roster to protect his arm as he
recovered from 2010 elbow surgery.  Soriano, who saved 42 games for the Yankees last year in
place of the injured  Mariano Rivera , struck out two in a perfect
ninth inning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
