Federal Reserve announcements of
bond buying have prompted declines in the value of the dollar
similar to the reduced valuations following cuts in the main
 interest rate , according to San Francisco Fed researchers.  “Changes in the dollar’s value immediately following
surprise policy announcements are comparable before and after
the crisis,” said Reuven Glick and Sylvain Leduc in a  paper
released today  by the San Francisco Fed. “This suggests that
changes in unconventional monetary policy have affected the
dollar about as much as changes in the federal funds rate did
before the financial crisis.”  While the Fed isn’t mandated to target the dollar, a
decline in the currency can improve the competitiveness of U.S.
exports and help the central bank spur economic growth. The Fed
is purchasing bonds to bring down long-term borrowing costs and
reduce 7.7 percent unemployment.  Prior to 2008, the  Federal Open Market Committee  relied on
alterations in its target interest rate to guide the economy.
Glick and Leduc looked at the impact on the dollar from Fed
announcements of bond buying to compare the effectiveness of
asset purchases with changes in the benchmark interest rate.  “One way to measure the effectiveness of unconventional
monetary policy tools is through the U.S. dollar  exchange
rate ,” said Glick and Leduc, who are San Francisco Fed
economists.  No Target  “Although the Fed does not target the exchange rate
specifically, monetary policy decisions ultimately affect the
dollar’s value, which can have important effects on the
economy,” they said. They focused on the impact from surprise
policy announcements.  The dollar has risen 3.7 percent so far this year against a
basket of other currencies. The Fed is purchasing $85 billion in
securities every month and has said it will continue the bond
buying until the labor market improves “substantially.”  “We find that a quantitative easing surprise equivalent to
a 1 percentage point decrease in federal funds rate futures
leads to a 0.5 percentage point depreciation in the dollar,”
they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
