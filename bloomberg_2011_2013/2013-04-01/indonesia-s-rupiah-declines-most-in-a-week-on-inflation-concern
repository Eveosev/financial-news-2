Indonesia ’s rupiah declined the most
in more than a week as overseas investors pulled money out of
the nation’s bonds before data forecast to show faster inflation
and a wider trade deficit.  Global holdings of local  sovereign debt  fell 560 billion
rupiah ($58 million) last month through March 27, heading for
the first decline since August.  Consumer prices  probably gained
5.56 percent last month, the most since May 2011, after a 5.31
percent increase in February, according to the median estimate
of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Local financial markets
were closed March 29 for a holiday.  “The sell-off in bonds is probably because of fears of
higher inflation,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , an economist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Singapore. “The trade
deficit will likely be persistent this year without significant
measures to curb fuel imports, which will weigh on the rupiah.”  The rupiah dropped 0.2 percent from March 28 to 9,738 per
dollar as of 10 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest decline since March
20, prices from local banks show. It traded at a 0.6 percent
premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which lost
0.2 percent to 9,792, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The spot
rate declined for a seventh quarter in the three months through
March, the longest losing streak since 1998.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,719 on March 28 by the Association of Banks in  Singapore ,
compared with 9,730 the previous day. Today’s rate will be
released at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.74 percent.  Official figures may show today that the  trade gap  widened
to $206 million in February from $171 million in January,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 dropped
one basis point to 5.56 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
