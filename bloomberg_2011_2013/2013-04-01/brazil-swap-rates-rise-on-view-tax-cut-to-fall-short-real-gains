Brazil ’s swap rates rose to a one-
week high on speculation renewed tax breaks for vehicles will
fail to contain inflation, spurring the central bank to increase
borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 climbed four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.53 percent at 10:09
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , the highest level on a closing basis since
March 21. The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0209 per  U.S.
dollar .  The  Finance Ministry  said March 30 that it would extend a
reduction of the so-called IPI tax on vehicles to December. It
was set to expire today. The central bank said last week that
inflation has spread, boosting the probability that price
increases will breach the upper limit of the target range for
the first time in a decade.  “What’s reverberating in the market is this extension of
the IPI tax for the automotive sector,” Jayro Rezende, the head
of the derivatives desk at CGD Investimentos in Sao Paulo, said
in a telephone interview.  Policy makers estimate there is a 25 percent chance
inflation will exceed 6.5 percent this year even under a
scenario in which they raise the benchmark  interest rate  to 8
percent from a record low 7.25 percent, according to the
quarterly inflation report published last week. In December,
they saw a 14 percent chance of breaching the inflation ceiling.
They reduced the 2013 economic growth forecast to 3.1 percent
from 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
