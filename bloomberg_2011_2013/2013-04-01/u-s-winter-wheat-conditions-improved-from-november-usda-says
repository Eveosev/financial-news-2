U.S. winter-wheat conditions
improved since the last time they were measured in November as
rain and snow boosted prospects in  Kansas  and Oklahoma, the
biggest growers, according to the Department of Agriculture.  The crop was rated 34 percent good or excellent in the
first rating of the season, up from 33 percent in November,
before the plants went dormant, the USDA said in a  report  today.
In Kansas, the biggest winter producer, 31 percent earned top
ratings versus 29 percent. In Oklahoma, 27 percent was in good
or excellent condition, up from 14 percent, USDA data show.  “We’ve had the moisture over here,” Jamey Kohake, a
broker and branch manager at Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake ,
Kansas, said in a telephone interview. “We had really good
snowpack cover that melted and the panhandle area of  Oklahoma 
had really good rains.”  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 3.5 percent to $6.64 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price earlier dropped
to $6.5975 a bushel, the lowest since June 20. On the Kansas
City Board of Trade, futures retreated 2.3 percent to $7.0975 a
bushel after reaching $7.045, the lowest since June 22.  The crop was rated 58 percent good or excellent at this
time last year, USDA data show. The southern Great Plains, where
the worst drought since the 1930s has led to blowing dirt storms
reminiscent of the Dust Bowl, will need moisture and above-
freezing temperatures to ensure crops will grow before harvest
in May and June, Kohake said.  “We’re going to need some more rain,” he said. “The crop
isn’t made yet, and there’s some time for frost damage to be
done. So far, it doesn’t seem like it’s staying cold enough long
enough to do damage.”  The U.S.  rice crop  was 12 percent planted, down from 14
percent at the same time a year earlier, and sorghum was 16
percent seeded, unchanged from March 31, 2012, according to the
USDA report. Oats were 32 percent sown, down from 44 percent a
year earlier, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
