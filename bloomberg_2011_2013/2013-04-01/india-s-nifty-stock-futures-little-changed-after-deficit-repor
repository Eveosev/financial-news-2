big concern for the rupee,”  Arun Kejriwal , director at Mumbai-

yesterday. “We expect the market to open lower.”  The deficit in the current  account , the broadest measure of
trade, was $32.6 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, or

by Bloomberg.  “The next trigger for the markets is the corporate
earnings,” Kishor Ostwal, managing director of  CNI Research (CNIR) 
(India) Ltd., said by phone on March 29. “The current account
deficit and other macroeconomic numbers suggest some tough
measures are needed to boost the economy. Any bad news can
trigger a sell-off as investors are very cautious. The positive
thing is buying by foreign investors is still continuing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
