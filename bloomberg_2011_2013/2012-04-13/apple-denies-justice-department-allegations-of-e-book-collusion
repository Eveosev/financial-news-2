Apple Inc. (AAPL)  denied allegations by
the U.S. government that it conspired with book publishers to
fix prices of digital books to undermine Amazon.com Inc.’s
dominance of the market.  The Department of Justice’s “accusation of collusion
against Apple is simply not true,” said  Natalie Kerris , a
spokeswoman for Apple. The company’s digital bookstore,
introduced in 2010, “fostered innovation and competition,
breaking Amazon’s monopolistic grip on the publishing
industry.”  Apple and book publishers Macmillan and Penguin were sued
this week by the U.S. over claims they conspired to fix prices
of digital books. Three other publishers named in the
government’s antitrust lawsuit,  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s Simon & Schuster,
Lagardère SCA’s Hachette Book Group and News Corp.’s
HarperCollins, settled their cases after the government’s
complaint was filed this week in federal court in  Manhattan .  As a result of Apple’s entry into the market, “customers
have benefited from eBooks that are more interactive and
engaging,” Kerris said. “Just as we’ve allowed developers to
set prices on the  App Store , publishers set prices on the
iBookstore.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
