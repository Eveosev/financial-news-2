Gulf Coast gasoline fell against
futures after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
restarted refinery units and Motiva Enterprises LLC was said to
be starting a new crude unit.  Valeroâ€™s Memphis, Tennessee, refinery restarted its West
crude unit yesterday, said  Bill Day , a spokesman based at
company headquarters in San Antonio. The unit can process 80,000
barrels a day for the 195,000-barrel-a-day refinery, Day said
this month.  Exxon Mobil finished maintenance at the Baytown refinery in
Texas and restarted units, Patricia Errico, a company
spokeswoman in Irving, Texas, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Motiva plans to start a new 330,000-barrel-a-day crude unit
and coker at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery by the end of the
month, according to two people with knowledge of operations.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  widened 1.5 cents to 14.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:58 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The prompt-delivery
price fell 2.56 cents to $3.2011 a gallon.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor widened 2.25 cents to 4
cents a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
