The cost for banks to convert euro
interest payments into dollars fell for the third day to the
cheapest level in two weeks, according to a money-market
indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 50 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:11 a.m. in
London from minus 53 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The measure was minus 57 on April 10, the most expensive since
March 19.  The one-year basis swap was 52 basis points below Euribor
from minus 53. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  European banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was
little changed with the Euribor-OIS spread, the difference
between the borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, at
41 basis points. The measure reached an eight-month low of 40
basis points on April 10.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday, placing 706 billion euros ($930 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based bank, up from 653 billion euros on
April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
