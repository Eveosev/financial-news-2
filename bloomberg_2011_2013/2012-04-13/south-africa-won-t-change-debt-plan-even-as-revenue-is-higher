South Africa ’s National Treasury
won’t change its debt plans even as the government collected
more revenue than forecast because of a rebound in the economy,
Director General Lungisa Fuzile said.  “It is hardly consequential in the bigger scheme of things
to necessitate a change in plans,” Fuzile told reporters in
Johannesburg today. “Economic data released since the budget
have actually been generally positive, which supports our view
that the economy is on more-sure footing.”  The government collected 742.7 billion rand ($93.8 billion)
in the year through March 31, which is 4 billion rand more than
forecast, trimming the  budget deficit . The government’s
borrowing requirement had been estimated to increase to 168.8
billion rand in the year through March 2013, from 152.7 billion
rand this fiscal year, the Treasury said in February.  Economic growth will probably expand faster than the
government’s forecast of 2.7 percent this year as manufacturing
rebounds from two quarters of contraction, according to Trade
Minister  Rob Davies . Manufacturing, which accounts for about 15
percent of the economy, grew 4.1 percent February from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since September.  ‘Cautiously Optimistic’  South Africa can achieve a budget deficit of 4.6 percent in
the 12 months through March 2013, Deputy Finance Minister
Nhlanhla Nene said yesterday, according to a copy of his speech
posted on the Treasury’s website. The fiscal gap narrowed to 4.5
percent in 2011-12, smaller than the 4.8 percent the government
forecast in the February budget.  The worst expectations for the first half of the year
aren’t likely to come to fruition, Davies said in an interview
yesterday. Gordhan told reporters on April 1 that he is
“cautiously optimistic” growth will be higher than the
government’s estimate of 2.7 percent for 2012.  While some analysts have raised their estimates for growth,
there are still risks to the economy, including the advance in
oil, Fuzile said. Reserve Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  raised the
bank’s estimate to 3 percent from 2.8 percent on March 29.  The rand dropped 0.6 percent to 7.9165 per dollar at 11:05
a.m. in Johannesburg, cutting the currency’s gain this year to
2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
