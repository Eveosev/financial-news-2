Air Canada (AC/A) , the country’s largest
carrier, canceled about 30 flights this morning after pilots
failed to show up for work, the latest episode in a spate of
labor unrest for the airline.  “We have had to cancel a small number of flights,”
because some pilots called in sick this morning, Air Canada
spokesman  Peter Fitzpatrick  told CP24 TV news station at
Toronto’s Pearson Airport today. “Right now we’re talking about
30 flights. We’re doing our best to get folks moving as quickly
as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
