Lithuania is in talks with  Norway ’s
 Statoil ASA (STL)  over possible liquefied natural gas supplies for the
country’s gas terminal on the Baltic sea, the Lithuanian energy
ministry said.  Gas tankers from Statoil’s Snohvit export terminal would
reach Lithuania’s  Klaipedos Nafta (KNF1L)  AB LNG terminal within five
days, which is an attractive alternative because of lower
transportation costs, the  ministry  in Vilnius said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Klaipedos Nafta, which is 70.63 percent owned by the state,
plans to begin operations at a floating LNG terminal at the end
of 2014. Klaipedos is also in talks with other potential gas
suppliers such as the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, known as
Socar, Spain’s Gas Natural Fenosa and   Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  of
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
