The  National Football League  will
allow teams to accept advertising from casinos during the next
two years.  A memo sent to all 32 teams yesterday and seen by Bloomberg
News said franchises could sell ads in game-day programs, on
club-controlled radio and in stadiums. The casinos must be in a
team’s market. Under the altered policy, advertisers can’t take
bets on any sports other than horse and dog racing.  “We remain steadfast in our opposition to the
proliferation of gambling on NFL games,”  Brian McCarthy , a
spokesman for the NFL, said in an e-mail last night. “There is
a distinction between accepting advertising in a limited fashion
and gambling on the outcome of our games.”  Other state-licensed gambling establishments will also be
able to buy ads, the memo said. Players, coaches and other team
and league employees are not allowed to appear in any of the ads
or endorse the entities or their products.  Teams are already able to sell ads to horse and dog-racing
tracks, municipal lotteries and off-track betting organizations
that don’t take wagers on sporting events.  To contact the reporter on this story:
