Vietnam’s government bonds
completed their biggest weekly gain in six weeks after the
central bank cut its benchmark  interest rates  to support the
economy. The dong weakened.  Five-year yields slumped by the most since the five days
ended March 2 as the  State Bank  of Vietnam cut its repurchase
rate to 12 percent from 13 percent, the second reduction in a
less than a month. The monetary authority also trimmed its
refinancing and discount rates by a percentage point each.  “Bond yields’ downtrend is confirmed now because of the
central bank’s rate cuts and good liquidity at banks,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based  Ocean
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank .  The  yield  on five-year notes fell 20 basis points, or 0.20
percentage point, this week to 11.22 percent, according to a
daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It rose two basis
points today. Two-year yields dropped 22 basis points this week
to 11.21 percent.  Vietnam  Bank for Social Policies will offer 2 trillion dong
($96 million) of three- and five-year bonds on April 17,
according to a statement on the Hanoi Stock Exchange website.  The dong fell 0.4 percent today and for the week to 20,918
per dollar as of 4:20 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The central bank set the reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editor: James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
