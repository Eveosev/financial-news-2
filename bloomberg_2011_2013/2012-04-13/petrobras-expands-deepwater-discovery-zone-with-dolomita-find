Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, found “good quality” oil in a
new region of the Santos Basin that holds the country’s largest
discoveries.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
drilled the Dolomita South well 177 kilometers (110 miles) off
the coast in the so-called pre-salt region, the company said in
a statement late yesterday. The discovery is closer to shore
than a cluster of fields in Santos including Lula, the country’s
biggest.  “This discovery confirms the potential of the pre-salt
region, outside the limits of the first discoveries,” Petrobras
said in the statement.  Brazil is developing the largest discoveries in the
Americas since 1976 in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean where
oil is trapped under miles of water, rock and salt. Oil
companies including  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Statoil ASA (STL)  are waiting
for Brazil to offer new exploration licenses off the country’s
coast.  Dolomita is located in block BM-S-42 where Petrobras has a
100 percent stake. Petrobras will continue drilling the well to
find deeper reservoirs, the company said.  Petrobras rose 3.1 percent yesterday to 22.01 reais, the
biggest gain in a month. The stock is up 2.4 percent for the
year to date, less than the 11 percent gain in the benchmark
stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
