Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , eastern
 Europe ’s second biggest lender, rejected a report that it was
selling properties in Vienna to fill a 166 million-euro ($217
million) capital gap by June.  The potential sale of properties is related to Erste’s new
company building --  Erste Campus  --, which is due to be
completed in 2015, said Hana Cygonkova, a spokeswoman for the
Vienna-based lender. The new complex will combine 4,000
employees currently working at 23 sites, she said, adding that
only seven of those buildings were owned by Erste, while the
others were rented.  “The sale has nothing to do with the remaining capital
gap,” Cygonkova said. Erste’s capital ratio under European
Banking Authority rules was 8.9 percent at the end of last year
and will be above 9 percent at the end June, she said.  Erste plans to keep the building housing its headquarters
in downtown Vienna and its IT center in the capital’s eleventh
district, she said.  WirtschaftsBlatt newspaper reported today that Erste is
selling property to fill its EBA capital gap, citing
unidentified sources. The lender’s headquarters may be worth 60
million euros while a separate building near the city’s former
stock exchange may be valued at 30 million euros, the paper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
