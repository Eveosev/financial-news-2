A liquefied natural gas carrier
owned by  Mitsui (9104)  O.S.K. Lines Ltd. is sailing toward Asia from an
import terminal in Spain, where the gas is 39 percent cheaper.  The LNG Ebisu left Spain’s Cartagena LNG terminal on April
9 and is currently nearing the Suez Canal, according to ship-
tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. In the past year the ship
sailed to Japan,  South Korea  and Taiwan after loading in
Malaysia, Australia and Nigeria, data show.  While Spain lacks a facility to liquefy natural gas for
shipping, cargoes delivered to the country under longstanding
contracts can be re-exported when overseas prices are higher.
One million British thermal units of Nigerian LNG costs $17.44
in Japan, compared with $10.60 in Spain, according to March data
from New York-based shipbroker Poten & Partners.  Akika Hamakawa, a spokeswoman for Mitsui in  Tokyo , declined
to comment by e-mail. LNG is natural gas that’s been chilled to
a liquid state for transportation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
