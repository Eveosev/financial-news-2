Lynas Corp. (LYC) , an Australian mining
company building the world’s largest rare earths refinery in
Malaysia, climbed the most in a month in Sydney trading after a
 Kuala Lumpur  court rejected an attempt to review its permit.  The stock surged 7.8 percent to close at A$1.11, rising the
most since March 9. Sydney-based Lynas is the second-biggest
gainer on the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index, which was up 1
percent.  The  High Court  of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur denied the request
for a review because there was a separate appeal lodged with the
Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation to challenge the
temporary operating license granted by the Malaysian Atomic
Energy Licensing Board, Lynas said in a statement yesterday.  The company’s initial plan to start production in September
was delayed after the Malaysian government imposed extra safety
standards recommended by an international review panel in
response to protests by residents who expressed fears over
possible radiation and contamination.  The court request was filed by a group of people who live
in  Malaysia ’s central Pahang state where Lynas’s plant is
located, the company said in February. The appeal to the
minister is expected to be heard this month, it said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
