Brazil ’s government for next year
expects faster growth and a weaker currency than economists
forecast, according to the 2013 budget guidelines proposed by
the administration of President Dilma Rousseff today in
Brasilia.  The real will trade at an average exchange rate of 1.84 per
 U.S. dollar , while the economy will expand by 5.5 percent in
2013, according to the proposal the government will present to
Congress before April 15.  Economists expect gross domestic product to expand by 4.2
percent and the real to trade at an average of 1.78 next year,
according to a central bank survey of about 100 analysts
published April 9. The real has averaged 1.71 against the dollar
over the past 12 months.  “We don’t have a fixed  exchange rate . But we’ll work so
that the currency doesn’t harm the economy,” Budget Minister
Miriam Belchior told reporters in Brasilia after presenting the
legislative proposal.  A strong currency, which hit a 12-year high in July last
year, has helped turn the  trade balance  in manufacturing goods
from an $8.7 billion surplus in 2005 into a $93 billion deficit
last year, according to the Trade Ministry. The government has
bought dollars in the foreign-exchange market and expanded taxes
on foreign loans and bonds issued abroad in response to what
Rousseff called a “monetary tsunami” from developed nations
seeking to weaken their currencies and foster export growth.  The government also cut  interest rates  by 275 basis points
since August to 9.75 percent and last month extended tax cuts
for appliances to stimulate  consumer spending  and help fuel
economic growth.  Brazil’s inflation should slow ll to the government’s
target of 4.5 percent next year, with the country’s benchmark
rate at 9 percent by the end of 2013, according to the budget
plan.  Annual inflation slowed to 5.24 percent through March, a
17-month low.  The government-fixed  minimum wage  will rise 7.3 percent to
667.5 reais ($364) next year, according to the proposed budget
guidelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
