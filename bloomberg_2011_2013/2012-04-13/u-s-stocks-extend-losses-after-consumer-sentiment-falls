U.S. stocks extended losses as
confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in April.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index decreased 0.6 percent to
1,378.98 at 10:03 a.m. New York time.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment for April fell to 75.7 from 76.2 at
the end of last month. Economists projected a reading of 76.2,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. stocks fell earlier as  China  reported slower-than-
expected economic growth and the cost of insuring against a
Spanish default approached a record.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
