Telefonica Czech Republic AS (SPTT) , the
country’s biggest phone company, ended an eight-day decline,
rebounding from its lowest level in almost two months.  The stock rose 1.1 percent to 375 koruna by 2:48 p.m. in
Prague, outperforming the  PX (PX)  index, which dropped 0.5 percent.  The unit of Spain’s  Telefonica SA (TEF)  retreated 4.9 percent in
the previous eight days, the longest stretch of losses in four
months. The drop cut the stock’s 14-day relative strength index
to 26 yesterday, below the 30 level that suggests to technical
analysts a security may rise. The RSI climbed to 35 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
