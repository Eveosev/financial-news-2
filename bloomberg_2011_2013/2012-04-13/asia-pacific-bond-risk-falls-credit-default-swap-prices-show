The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 5 basis points to 161 basis points
as of 8:59 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show.
The gauge is on course for its lowest close since April 4 and
biggest daily drop since March 15, according to data provider
CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index declined 5 basis points
to 151 as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The benchmark is set for its lowest close since April 5
and biggest one-day decline since Feb. 6, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 4.5 basis points to
161.5 basis points as of 9:30 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. Thatâ€™s on course for its lowest close since April 6
and biggest decline since March 27, according to CMA prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
