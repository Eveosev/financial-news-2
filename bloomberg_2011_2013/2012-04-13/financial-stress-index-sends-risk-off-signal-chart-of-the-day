Concern about the global financial
system’s stability has grown so much during the past two weeks
that investors ought to take less risk, according to Bank of
America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the firm’s Global Financial
Stress Index, derived from indicators of volatility, solvency,
ease of trading, demand for hedges and money flows. The chart
also shows the MSCI All-Country World Index, a gauge of share
prices in developed and emerging markets, for comparison.  Forty market-related gauges go into the Bank of America
indicator, and 10 of them surged far enough to send a so-called
critical stress signal three days ago. The “risk-off” warning
was the first since July 12, just before a second-half retreat
in stocks got under way.  “We recommend caution,” Benjamin Bowler, head of global
derivatives research, and two colleagues wrote in a report two
days ago. The MSCI All-Country World declined by an average of
3.8 percent in periods when the signal was in place since 2000,
the report said.  The stress index’s components reflects the potential
worsening of a euro-region debt crisis, according to Bowler,
based in  San Francisco , and Anders Armelius and Abhinandan Deb,
his London-based colleagues.  Credit-default swap rates for government borrowers are
showing the most stress, according to their data. A CDS-based
based indicator was at 4.1 three days ago. Readings above zero
show stress is higher than normal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
