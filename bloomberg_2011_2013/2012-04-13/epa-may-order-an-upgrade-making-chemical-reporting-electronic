The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency proposed requiring companies to electronically file
reports on the chemicals they use, a step designed to expand
access to information now filed in  Washington .  Much of this information is now contained on paper in EPA’s
document library, hindering the ability of the public to review
it and for outside groups to assess the risks of chemicals,
according to Richard Denison, a senior scientist at the
Environmental Defense Fund in Washington.  “This is an incremental, but I still think significant,
improvement that will over time address a big problem,” Denison
said in an e-mail.  Under the  Toxic Substances Control Act , the EPA requires
companies to provide analyses of certain chemicals they make or
use, when they started making or using the chemicals, and on any
related safety tests.  The agency today proposed mandating that those reports be
submitted through its electronic system. It’s not changing what
information the manufacturers or sellers must submit. Companies
and other interested parties will have 60 days to comment on the
proposal before the EPA finalizes it.  The EPA is committed to “increasing the public’s access to
chemical information,” Jim Jones, acting assistant
administrator for the EPA’s office on chemicals, said in a
statement. “The agency is also committed to reducing reporting
burdens.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
