Colombia ’s peso bonds posted their
best weekly performance in eight months as investors bet on
slower-than-expected inflation.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 7.08 percent at the close of trading in Bogota,
according to the central bank. That pushed the weekly drop to 16
basis points. The price rose 0.489 centavo today to 123.395
centavos per peso.  Colombia’s central bank is “very confident” that
inflation will slow to 3 percent, bank chief Jose Dario Uribe
said in an interview today in Cartagena.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.4 percent in March, the
national statistics agency said in an April 4 report, below the
median estimate of 3.63 percent in a survey of 23 economists
conducted by Bloomberg. The central bank targets inflation
between 2 percent and 4 percent this year.  “Inflation expectations are helping TES bonds,” said
Camilo Contreras, a fixed-income analyst at Ultrabursatiles SA
brokerage in Bogota. “Some of this is seasonal, but the
fundamentals are in favor of the TES bonds.”  Strong growth this year will boost tax revenue, leading the
government to sell fewer TES bonds in the future, Contreras
said. He said he expects the yield on the 2024 bonds, the most
traded of the peso debt, to “technically correct” to about 7.2
percent before falling below 6.5 percent by September. Seasonal
inflation during the fourth quarter will push the yield to about
6.9 percent by the end of the year, he estimated.  Policy makers expect the economy to grow 5 percent this
year, Uribe said. The central bank remains concerned by the pace
of credit growth, which could create risks if it continues at
its current pace for a prolonged period, Uribe said.  The peso slid 0.1 percent this week to 1,775.5 per dollar.
It has jumped 9.2 percent this year, the best performance among
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
