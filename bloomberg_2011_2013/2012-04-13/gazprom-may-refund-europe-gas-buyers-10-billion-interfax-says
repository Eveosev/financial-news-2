OAO Gazprom may have to refund
European customers as much as $10 billion in retroactive
discounts after the Russian natural-gas exporter reduced prices
in long-term contracts, Interfax said today, citing an
unidentified person with knowledge of the matter.  The amount owed has grown from about $7 billion estimated
at the start of the year, Interfax said. Of the total, Gazprom
has confirmed $5 billion of refunds.  Gazprom’s agreement in March this year with  Eni SpA (ENI)  to
lower the price of fuel deliveries applied the discount
retroactively from the beginning of 2011, Interfax said.  Changes in Gazprom’s price formula led to an average
discount of 10 percent for some of Gazprom’s biggest customers,
the Financial Times reported Feb. 16, citing Deputy Chairman
 Alexander Medvedev .  Gazprom spokesman  Sergei Kupriyanov  was not immediately
available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
