Mauritius’s  port  will accommodate
vessels that can hold 8,000 containers by 2014 after the
extension works at its terminal are finished, l’Express
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The container terminal currently handles vessels which hold
5,000 containers, the Port Louis-based newspaper said. After the
completion of the 3.5 billion-rupee ($120 million) project, two
bigger ships will be handled at a time, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
