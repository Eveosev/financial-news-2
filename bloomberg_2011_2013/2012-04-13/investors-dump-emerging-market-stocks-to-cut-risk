Investors pulled the most money
this year from emerging-market stock funds in the week ended
April 11, amid renewed fears  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis may
curb growth and as slowing job gains boosted worries of a U.S.
slowdown, according to EPFR Global.  Emerging-market equity funds lost $859 million and bond
funds specializing in developing markets surrendered $99
million,  Cameron Brandt , EPFR’s director of research, wrote in
an e-mail. The stock fund outflows were the largest since the
third week of December, he said. Equity funds saw net outflows
of $9.26 billion, the highest this year, according to an e-
mailed statement from data provider EPFR.  Yields on Spanish and Italian debt jumped amid concern the
countries may struggle to repay their debt. The U.S. added
120,000 jobs in March, the fewest in five months.  Emerging-
market stocks  fell for five days through April 10, losing 3.7
percent.  “People are just generally more nervous, given what
they’ve been through in recent years,” Brandt said by phone.
The outflows are “indicative of a change in sentiment, but not
a panic.”  Net investment into emerging-country stock funds has
totaled $24.78 billion this year, compared with outflows of
$15.97 billion in the same period of 2011. Developing-nation
bond funds recorded inflows of $14.87 billion this year.  Russia-focused equity funds saw redemptions for the first
week since January, and investors pulled cash from Brazilian
stock funds for a fourth week. Vietnamese equity funds saw their
15th straight week of inflows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
