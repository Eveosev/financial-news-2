Sales of shipping fuel in
 Singapore , the world’s biggest market for so-called bunker,
climbed 17 percent in March as a drop in prices spurred demand.  Bunker sales rose to 3.6 million metric tons last month,
compared with 3.1 million tons in February, the lowest in at
least 13 months, according to  data  from Singapore’s Maritime and
Port Authority today. Cargo volume at Singapore rose to 47.9
million tons, the most since April 2011.  “High fuel prices have limited bunker sales in February,
while I expect sales to rebound further in April given the fuel
cost is supposed to go down with crude prices, ” said Oliver Imaizumi, a senior trading manager at PetroSummit Pte in
Singapore, a unit of  Sumitomo Corp. (8053) ,  Japan ’s third-largest
trading company.  The Singapore 380-centistoke  bunker  spot cargo price has
fallen 3.2 percent since rising to the highest in more than
three years in February, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was at $721.50 a ton yesterday.  Lower rates in Singapore compared with ports in other
regions may also attract more ships to buy fuel in the island
state, Imaizumi said. Bunker at  Fujairah (.F-SBUNK)  in the  United Arab
Emirates  cost $7 a ton more than Singapore prices on April 12,
according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
