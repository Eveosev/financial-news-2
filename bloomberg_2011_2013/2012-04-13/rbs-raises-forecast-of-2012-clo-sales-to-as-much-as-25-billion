Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  is
boosting its forecast for the issuance of new collateralized
loan obligations in the U.S. this year to a range of $20 billion
to $25 billion.  CLOs, which finance buyouts and mergers, were previously
expected to raise between between $12 billion to $14 billion in
new funds, according to a report published today by Britain’s
biggest government-controlled bank.  RBS is revising its projection of the formation of new
CLOs, a type of collaterlalized debt obligation that pools
leveraged loans and slice them into securities of varying risk
and return, after the funds raised more than $8.3 billion this
year. Sales are picking after $11.7 billion were raised last
year, down from $91.1 billion issued at the peak of the market
in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Morgan
Stanley.  “Dealers managed to pump out just shy of $2.5 billion in
new deals in March,” Justin Pauley, a CLO strategist at RBS,
wrote in the research report. “Given the current rate of growth
over the past months, we would expect close to $25 billion of
issuance in 2012.”  RBS’s revised forecast was kept in the range of $20 billion
to $25 billion due to uncertainty surrounding  Europe , global
growth and new financial regulations.  “If volatility spikes again for a few months, we would
expect a full quarter with only about $2 billion of issuance as
in August through October of 2011,” Pauley wrote.  Leveraged loans are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
