Klaus Toepfer, a former environment
minister and possible candidate to become  Germany ’s next
president, has called on the government to develope a masterplan
for energy conversion,  Berliner Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview with Toepfer.  Failure to adopt such a plan might mean that Germany’s
energy program would fail, Toepfer told the newspaper.  He added that it would also be useful to set up an
independent professional commission to monitor large projects
and set an implementation plan with target objectives, BZ
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
