Ethanol futures fell to the lowest
level in more than two weeks in  Chicago  as supply outpaced
demand amid lower production costs.  Futures dropped for the first time in three days after an
Energy Department report this week showed  stockpiles  were 6.1
percent higher than a year earlier at 21.8 million barrels in
the seven days ended April 6. Refiners used 824,000 barrels a
day of ethanol to blend into fuel last week, 4.4 percent more
than the year before, the department said.  “There’s a lot of people selling and only a few buyers,”
said Jim Damask, a manager at Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter,
Florida-based alternative energy broker. “There’s a lot of
ethanol for sale.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery declined 2.4 cents, or
1.1 percent, to settle at $2.217 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the lowest price since March 29. Futures have gained
0.6 percent this year.  Corn, the primary ingredient used to make the biofuel in
the U.S., decreased on speculation rain in the Midwest will
boost crops.  Ethanol production last week averaged 896,000 barrels a
day, the Energy Department said, equal to about 13.7 billion
gallons on an annual basis. That’s above the 13.2 billion
gallons required under a 2007 energy law.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.25 a gallon. In Chicago, the
biofuel decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.20, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slipped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.28 a gallon, and on the West Coast the additive dropped 0.5
cent to $2.355.  Corn for May delivery fell 8.25 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$6.2925 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
