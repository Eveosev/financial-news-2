The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell 1 percent to 930.70 at the end of trading in Prague, paring
the weekly gain to 0.4 percent.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, slid
2.1 percent to 772.5, the steepest drop since Feb. 28.  New World
Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-coal producer,
slipped 2.2 percent to 127.6 koruna.  Stocks and commodities fell after China reported a slower-
than-forecast growth for the world’s second-largest economy.  Telefonica Czech Republic AS (SPTT)   rose 1.1 percent to
375 koruna. The phone company slid 4.9 percent in the previous
eight days, cutting the stock’s 14-day relative strength index
to 26 yesterday. Readings below 30 suggest to technical analysts
a security may rise. The RSI increased to 35 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
