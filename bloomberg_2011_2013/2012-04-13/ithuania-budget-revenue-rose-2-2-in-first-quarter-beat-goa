Lithuania’s budget revenue exceeded
the government’s target in the first quarter, rising 2.2 percent
from a year earlier.  Revenue increased to 4.83 billion litai ($1.84 billion),
the  Finance Ministry  in the capital, Vilnius, said today in an
e-mailed statement. The government’s target was 4.64 billion
litai.  The Baltic nation plans to narrow the budget deficit to 3
percent of  gross domestic product  this year from an estimated
5.3 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
