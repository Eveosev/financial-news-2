Qatar Airways  Ltd. plans to start
flights to Atlanta, Chicago, Boston and Detroit within the next
year, doubling its U.S. network, as the carrier begins receiving
 Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliners.  A daily New York service will also be increased to three
flights a day, with the addition of links via cities in Eastern
and Western Europe, Chief Executive Officer Akbar  Al Baker  said
yesterday in Montreal. The airline has daily flights to
Washington and Houston.  “Qatar Airways is in the midst of a very aggressive
expansion plan,” Al Baker said. “The only thing that stopped
us from going earlier is the delayed delivery of the 787s,” he
said about the U.S. flights.  The carrier has placed orders for 60 Dreamliners as it
works toward boosting its global network to 170 destinations
from 113 over three years. Like Dubai-based Emirates Airline and
Etihad Airways PJSC, the carrier is using a Middle East hub to
link markets in  Asia , Europe and the Americas.  Qatar Air also plans to resume services to Rangoon, Myanmar
in October, Al Baker said. The carrier’s order backlog also
includes 60 A350s and 10 A380s made by Airbus SAS.  Boeing began delivering 787s last year ending more than
three years of delays caused by struggles with new materials and
production techniques.  To contact the reporter on this story:
