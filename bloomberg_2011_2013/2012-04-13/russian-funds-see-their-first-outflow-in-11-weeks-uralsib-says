Russia-focused equity funds had
their first outflows in 11 weeks on concern the Chinese economy
is slowing and  Europe  is struggling to contain its debt crisis,
 UralSib Financial Corp.  said, citing EPFR Global data.  Outflows from Russian funds reached $40 million in the
seven days to April 11 after cumulative inflows of $1.3 million
in the prior 10 weeks, the data compiled by Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based research firm  EPFR Global  show.  “The markets are obviously at a crossroads these days with
concerns around  China  on one hand and weak data from Europe and
positive data from the U.S. on the on other,” Leonid Slipchenko, a senior analyst at UralSib, wrote in a report.  Oil,  Russia ’s biggest export, fell as much as 0.4 percent
to $103.18 a barrel in  New York  after government data today
showed China’s gross domestic product growth slowed to 8.1
percent from a year earlier in the first quarter after an 8.9
percent gain in the final three months of 2011.  Saudi Arabia ,
the world’s biggest crude exporter, isn’t happy with prices and
is working to reduce them, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said today.  Russia’s benchmark  Micex index  rallied 8.2 percent in the
first three months of the year, the biggest quarterly gain in
more than a year, on signs the global economy recovery is
spurring demand for commodities. The gauge trades at 5.5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies, below the
11.8 ratio for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
