Moody’s Investors Service said it
has pushed back the timeline for its review of Western European
banks and of firms with global capital markets operations.  Moody’s expects that the next rating action will occur in
early May, with a conclusion to the reviews by the end of June,
it said in a statement today. The rating company said in  March 
it planned to complete the reviews by the middle of May.  “Moody’s is taking an appropriately deliberate approach
during this review process and will conclude when it is
confident that all relevant information has been received and
analyzed,” the company said in a statement.  Moody’s first announced in February that it was putting 114
European banks and an additional eight non-European firms with
large capital-markets businesses under review to assess the
impact of the European sovereign-debt crisis. After abating
earlier this year in the wake of the  European Central Bank ’s
long-term lending program, the crisis flared again in recent
weeks, driving the cost of insuring against a Spanish default to
a record today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
