A tornado touched down in Norman,
 Oklahoma , today and more twisters are expected across the
central U.S. tomorrow.  The storm in Norman knocked out power and telephone service
and damaged City Hall, Keli Cain, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma
Department of Emergency Management, said in a telephone
interview from  Oklahoma City . Norman is 20 miles (32 kilometers)
south of Oklahoma City.  “They’re working on getting their Internet services and
phone service back up,” Cain said. “Right now, they’re working
off a generator at City Hall.”  Tornadoes are expected to sweep across the central U.S.
tomorrow from  Nebraska  to  Texas , according to the National
Weather Service  Storm Prediction Center  in Norman. The highest
chance for severe weather will be in central  Kansas  and
Oklahoma, according to a center bulletin.  The storm in Oklahoma follows one that struck the Dallas
area earlier this month, causing the cancellation of more than
1,900 flights and damaging aircraft at  Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport .  An outbreak March 2 to March 3 across the Ohio Valley and
the Southeast killed at least 40 people and caused more than
$1.5 billion of damage, according to NOAA. It is the first $1
billion weather-related disaster of the year. In 2011, the U.S.
recorded 14 weather-related disasters that caused $1 billion in
damage or more, according to NOAA.  In March, 223 tornadoes were reported in a month that
normally has about 80, according to NOAA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
