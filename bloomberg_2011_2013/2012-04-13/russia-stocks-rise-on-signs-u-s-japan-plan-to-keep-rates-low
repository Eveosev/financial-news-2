Russian  stocks  gained after signals
from  Japan  and the U.S. that they will pursue monetary stimulus
to bolster their economies.  The Micex Index of 30 shares rose 0.1 percent to 1,502.65
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring an earlier gain of as
much as 1 percent and taking its weekly advance to 0.4 percent.
OAO Transneft, Russia’s oil pipeline monopoly, surged 5.4
percent. OAO Aeroflot, the country’s biggest airline, advanced
3.2 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index slumped 0.5
percent to 1,612.74.  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  and William C.
Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ,
endorsed the view that borrowing costs will stay near zero
through 2014. The  Bank of Japan  “will pursue powerful easing”
to overcome deflation, according to Governor Masaaki Shirakawa.  “The mood in global markets has improved markedly in
recent days as central banks from the U.S., European Union and
Japan reaffirm their commitment to monetary easing in order to
ensure that economic growth remains positive,”  Chris Weafer ,
chief strategist at Troika Dialog in Moscow, wrote in an e-
mailed report today.  Russian stocks rallied 8.2 percent in the first three
months of the year, the biggest quarterly gain in more than a
year on signs the global economy recovery is spurring demand for
commodities. The gauge trades at 5.5 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for member companies, below the 10.5 ratio for the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
