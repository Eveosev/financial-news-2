Rapeseed in the northeast of  France 
was “seriously” damaged by frost in February, and estimates of
the area to be plowed under have risen, oilseed researcher
Cetiom said.  Most damage occurred in the Lorraine region, northern
Burgundy and the south and east of Champagne-Ardennes, where all
fields were “very affected,” Paris-based Cetiom wrote in a
 report  on its website today.  About 50 percent of rapeseed will be plowed under in the
Moselle department in Lorraine, according to the researcher.
Yields in the majority of damaged fields not plowed under will
range from less than 1 metric ton per hectare (2.47 acres) to 2
tons per hectare, according to Cetiom.  “Many fields have been left in place despite having above-
ground biomass that is weak to very weak,” Cetiom wrote.
“Production potential for these fields is very feeble.”  Rain this week benefited the crops and should accelerate
rapeseed development, as well as allow uptake of nitrogen
fertilizer and sulfur, Cetiom wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
