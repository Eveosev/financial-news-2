Cooking-oil imports by  India , the
world’s second-biggest buyer, climbed for the second month in
March as an increase in domestic prices spurred buying.  Purchases climbed to 727,706 metric tons from 435,735 tons
a year earlier, the  Solvent Extractors’ Association of India 
said in an e-mailed statement today. Imports climbed 21 percent
to 3.79 million tons in the five months ended March 31, it said.  Rising Indian imports may help palm oil futures in  Malaysia 
extend a rally from the highest price in more than a year.
Futures reached 3,628 ringgit ($1,187) a ton on April 10, the
highest price since March 8, 2011, on concern that global
cooking-oil supplies may decline as drought curbs soybean output
in Brazil and  Argentina .  Imports of crude  palm oil  from Indonesia and Malaysia
climbed 55 percent to 278,696 tons in March, and refined palm
oil more than doubled to 186,788 tons, the association said.  “The share of refined oil is likely to increase as current
Indonesian inverted duty structure will encourage larger export
of refined oils over crude oil,” B.V. Mehta, executive director
of the association, said in the statement. “Also, the gap
between crude and refined oil has further reduced.”  Refined cooking oils bought overseas were about $30 a ton
cheaper than domestic supplies, Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive
officer of Mumbai-based Sunvin Group, said on April 5. Vegetable
oil purchases may average 850,000 tons to 950,000 tons a month
until October, he said.  Soybean oil imports rose to 100,615 tons in March from
81,131 tons a year earlier, while sunflower oil purchases
climbed to 104,150 tons from 76,230 tons, the association said.  India also imported 21,526 tons of rapeseed oil, it said.
Stockpiles at ports and in pipelines fell 15,000 tons to 1.45
million tons as of April 1 from a month earlier, the association
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
