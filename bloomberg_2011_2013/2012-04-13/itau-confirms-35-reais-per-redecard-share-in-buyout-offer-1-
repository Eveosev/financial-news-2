Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  maintained
its offer to pay 35 reais ($19.2) per  Redecard SA (RDCD3)  share to buy
out minority shareholders in its card-payment unit, the company
said in a regulatory filing yesterday.  Itau,  Brazil ’s largest bank by market value, said the share
price was within the range calculated by NM Rothschild & Sons
Ltda of 34.18 reais to 37.59 reais, announced in a filing on
April 5. Redecard shareholders had hired Rotschild to value the
company for the deal.  The Sao Paulo-based bank also said two-thirds of Redecard
shareholders must accept the offer, as Itau plans to delist its
unit.  Itau in February offered to buy out Redecard’s minority
shareholders for as much as 11.8 billion reais, less than five
years after the card-payment processor went public.  -- Editor: Tais Fuoco  To contact the reporter on this story:
