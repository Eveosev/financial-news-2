Austrian companies are attempting
to revamp the country’s image, aiming to highlight its industry
rather than its culture and tourism.  A group of 17 companies, including  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI) ,  Voestalpine AG (VOE)  and  OMV AG (OMV) , together with the
Austrian National Bank and the Vienna Stock Exchange have
started the  initiative , which was the brain child of Raiffeisen
Chief Executive Officer Herbert Stepic and is headed by Central
Bank President Claus Raidl.  As part of the enterprise, the chief executive officers of
the companies have agreed to meet with “opinion leaders”
whenever they go on investor roadshows to the U.S. and the U.K.
and highlight the “hidden champions” of Austrian industry,
Raidl told reporters in Vienna yesterday.  People often have an “undifferentiated” picture of
 Austria , Raidl said, adding that the initiative cost a few
100,000 euros a year to pay public relations companies in
 London ,  New York  and Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
