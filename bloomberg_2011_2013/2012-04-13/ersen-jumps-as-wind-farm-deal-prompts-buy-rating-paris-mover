Mersen (MRN) , a French maker of graphite
and electrical goods, jumped in Paris after a contract to supply
components to a wind farm prompted analysts at Gilbert Dupont to
lift their rating from ‘add’ to ‘buy.’  Gilbert Dupont cited the company’s announcement that it has
been chosen by REpower Systems SE to supply components for the
Thornton Bank wind farm near Ostend in  Belgium .  Analyst Francoise Delva raised the target price on the
stock to 31.7 euros from 30.9 euros. The fact that first-quarter
sales will suffer from a high year-earlier comparison has
already been factored into the stock price, Delva wrote.  The stock gained as much as 7.7 percent and was up 6.2
percent at 26.30 euros at 09:27 a.m. in Paris, making it the
best performer on the SBF 250 Index today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
