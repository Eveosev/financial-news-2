South  Korea ’s won rebounded from a
three-month low and stocks rallied as the government said a
rocket launch by North Korea failed.  The won gained 0.5 percent to 1,134.45 per dollar as of
11:11 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched a one-week high of 1,131.25 earlier. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  stock
index advanced 0.8 percent to 2,002.94. North Korea fired the
rocket from its Sohae Satellite Launching Station at about 7:39
a.m. today and it exploded within minutes, South Korean Defense
Ministry said in Seoul.  “Investors are just shrugging off this launch,” said Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  fund manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion. “The
news came out before the market opened that the rocket launch
failed, so investors didn’t have to worry about it.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.4 percent in  New
York  yesterday as U.S. policy makers signaled borrowing costs
will stay low. South Korea’s government bonds were little
changed as the central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 3.25 percent for a 10th month at a review today.
The decision was forecast by all 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The currency touched 1,144.88 yesterday, the weakest since
Jan. 18. One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined 40 basis
points, or 0.4 percentage point, to 8.63 percent today.  Centennial Celebration  “This would be the way a rocket launch would affect the
market the least as it happened before onshore markets opened in
Korea, and also it fell into the sea right after launch,” said
Ryoo Hyun Jung, a Seoul-based chief currency dealer at Citibank
Korea Inc. “Markets will reflect U.S. stock gains.”  The North has said the projectile was to carry a satellite
into orbit as part of celebrations marking the centennial of
state founder  Kim Il Sung . It acted in defiance of international
pressure including U.S. warnings that doing so would nullify a
food aid deal to the impoverished nation.  The U.S. military tracked the launch of a North Korean
rocket and said that its first stage tumbled into the Yellow Sea
165 kilometers (102 miles) west of  Seoul  and the “remaining
stages were assessed to have failed,” it said in a statement.  Nuclear Tests  South Korea’s central bank will closely monitor stocks,
bonds and  currency markets , Deputy Governor Park Won Shik said
at an emergency meeting in Seoul today. The military is
monitoring for any further missile tests and for a potential
nuclear test by the North, Major General Shin Won Sik, the
director of policy planning at the defense ministry, said in a
televised briefing in Seoul.  Victek Co. (065450)  led declines in South Korea’s defense-related
stocks. The maker of electronic warfare equipment plunged 12
percent to 2,365 won.  Huneed Technologies (005870) , a military
communication equipment maker, slipped 11 percent to 3,480 won.  “Markets see this as posturing rather than as a genuine
threat,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps oversee about $1 billion
at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “ North Korea  is a
pest we’ve gotten used to. Life goes on.”  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  and New York Fed
President William C. Dudley endorsed the view that borrowing
costs will stay low through 2014 yesterday, with Dudley noting
it’s “still too soon to conclude that we are out of the
woods.”  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 was 3.50 percent, unchanged from yesterday, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. Three-year debt futures fell 0.01 to 104.01
and the one-year interest-rate swap was little changed at 3.51
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
