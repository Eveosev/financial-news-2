Quest Software Inc. (QSFT) , which agreed
last month to be bought by private-equity firm Insight Venture
Partners for about $2 billion, received another bid at the same
$23-a-share price.  An unidentified financial firm made the alternative
proposal on March 6, the  Aliso Viejo , California-based company
said in a regulatory  filing . The new prospective investor also
indicated it was willing to participate in the Insight-led
transaction.  Quest, a provider of business software for managing and
protecting data, decided to proceed with the Insight agreement,
announced March 9, because it includes 60 days to shop for a
better deal. Quest will pay Insight $4.2 million if it finds
another buyer during the so-called “go-shop” period.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , Quest’s financial adviser, approached the
unidentified bidder as part of the process of assessing the
Insight transaction, according to the filing.  The Insight Venture is  paying  a premium of about 13 percent
to Quest’s average 20-day stock price prior to the announcement.
That compares to an average premium of 17 percent on more than
1,000 applications-software acquisitions in the past five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tom Johnson , a spokesman for Quest, declined to comment
beyond the filing.  Quest rose 1.5 percent to $23.43 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained climbed 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
