Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan  signed a 4.697 trillion naira ($29.8 billion) budget
into law for 2012, less than lawmakers proposed.  The spending plans are based on an oil price of $72 a
barrel, Jonathan said in a speech today, $2 higher than he
originally proposed in December. Lawmakers in the Senate and
House of Representatives last month proposed expenditure of 4.9
trillion naira.  Jonathan, who won a four-year term in office last year, is
under pressure to curb governance costs and wages to free up
funds that can be used to build power plants and houses in
 Africa ’s most populous nation.The budget excludes 180 billion
naira already appropriated by the government from savings from a
January cut in fuel subsidies to fund welfare projects.  “One of the main goals of this administration is to
complete and exit the large stock of ongoing projects and
programs,” said Jonathan. The “2012 budget is focused on
completing viable ongoing projects, in accordance with the
transformation agenda, which will quickly deliver tangible and
significant added value to Nigerians.”  Recurrent expenditure, such as salaries, accounts for 3.357
trillion naira, a decline to 72 percent of  government spending ,
from 74 percent in 2011, he said. Capital expenditure will
amount to 29 percent of aggregate spending at 1.34 trillion
naira, Jonathan said. The fiscal deficit will be 2.85 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
