Sterling Bank Plc (STERLNBA) , a Nigerian
lender, rose to the highest in more than three weeks after
announcing it will pay a dividend for 2011.  The stock rose by the daily limit of 5 percent to 1.26
naira, the highest since March 22, as of 12:43 p.m. in Lagos.
The shares have risen 25 percent this year.  Sterling will pay a dividend of 10 kobo per share for full-
year 2011, it said in a Nigerian Stock Exchange statement today.
Net income rose 60 percent to 6.69 billion naira ($42.5
million), the Lagos-based lender said. Revenue surged to 45.17
billion naira from 30.39 billion naira.  “It’s the decision to pay a dividend that is pushing the
price,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Kundila
Finance Ltd., said by phone. “It is a pointer to improved
performance in the future.”  Sterling didn’t pay a dividend in 2010 after returning to
profit. Earnings are improving for the lender after  Nigeria ’s
central bank implemented banking reforms following a debt crisis
in 2008 and 2009 that threatened the industry with collapse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
