Brazil, Russia, India and China --
the major emerging markets known as BRIC -- will jointly declare
their support for a candidate to lead the  World Bank , Brazilian
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said.  Mantega, speaking to reporters in Brasilia, said
negotiations to select the candidate are ongoing though should
finalize today.  “Brazil, Russia, India and China should take a position
today because the choice will be made on Monday,” Mantega said.
“We want a candidate with technical qualifications who looks
out principally for the interest of emerging markets. The World
Bank doesn’t exist to help rich nations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
