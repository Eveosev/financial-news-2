Coffee farmers in  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of robusta beans, are holding back 25
to 30 percent of their crop, according to Volcafe, the coffee
unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Vietnam will produce a record 22.1 million bags of coffee
in the season ending Sept. 30, up from 20 million bags a year
earlier, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader estimates. A
bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). Robusta coffee
prices have fallen 7.3 percent in London since reaching this
year’s high of $2,174 a metric ton on Feb. 16.  Farmers “are still waiting for a higher price,” Volcafe
said in a report e-mailed today. “The local activity is
steady.”  Vietnamese coffee for May and June shipments was trading at
a discount of $10 a ton to the price on NYSE Liffe in  London ,
unchanged from last week, Volcafe data showed.  The volume of coffee being offered for nearby shipment is
“good,” while offers for export for later dates are “next to
nothing,” according to the report.  In  Indonesia , the third-largest robusta grower, buyers are
paying a premium of $100 a ton to the price on NYSE Liffe to
obtain coffee for May and June shipments, Volcafe data show. The
premium was unchanged from last week.  The local industry “remains the best buyer,” which is
keeping the coffee at a premium, Volcafe said.  Robusta coffee was up 0.6 percent to $2,016 a ton by 4:23
p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
