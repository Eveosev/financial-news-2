Air routes in North Asia began
returning to normal today after airspace restrictions imposed in
advance of a North Korean rocket launch were lifted.  South Korea  returned routes to normal at 8:35 a.m.  Seoul 
time, Kim Jae Young, director of aviation policy at South
Koreaâ€™s transport ministry, said by telephone.  Japan Airlines Co. and All Nippon Airways Co., which
altered routes to Manila, Jakarta and  Singapore , plan to restore
their regular flight paths, according to separate statements.
Japan Airlines had said the diversions added as much as 20
minutes to flight times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
