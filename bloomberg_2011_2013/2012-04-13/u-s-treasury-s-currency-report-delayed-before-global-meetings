The U.S. delayed a report on the
 exchange-rate  policies of trading partners, including  China ,
until after global meetings scheduled for the next several
weeks.  The report, due April 15, was postponed “so that progress
may be assessed following several upcoming international
meetings,” including the  International Monetary Fund  and World
Bank sessions April 20-21 in Washington, the Treasury said in a
statement today.  The Treasury frequently delays the report. The last one,
due Oct. 15, was released Dec. 27. The previous one, due April
15, 2011, was released May 27.  The Obama administration says China uses an undervalued
currency to give its exporters an unfair advantage in overseas
markets. In the December report, the Treasury called for China
to adopt “greater exchange-rate flexibility” while declining
to brand it a currency manipulator.  “It’s important to us that China continue to allow their
exchange rate to rise against the dollar,” Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  told a House Appropriations subcommittee
March 28. “They have some ways to go. We’d like them to push
further.”  The yuan is up about 14 percent against the dollar in
inflation-adjusted terms over about 20 months and 40 percent in
the last five years, Geithner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
