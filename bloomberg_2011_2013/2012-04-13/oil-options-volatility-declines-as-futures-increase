Oil options volatility dropped as
the underlying futures fell after  China ’s growth slowed and
Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said his kingdom is determined to
see prices decline.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.87 percent as of 3:10 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 26.97 percent yesterday. It
was the third straight decline.  “You’re seeing some premium come out of the market before
the weekend, and there’s a very small trading range and nobody
wants to buy options,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for May delivery fell 81 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to settle at $102.83 a barrel on the Nymex, capping the fifth
weekly decline since February. Crude this week traded between
$100.68 and $104.24 a barrel.  Brent oil for May settlement climbed 12 cents to $121.83 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Saudi Arabia  is working toward its goal of seeing prices
drop by highlighting there’s no shortage of supply, Oil Minister
Ali al-Naimi said in a statement in  Seoul  today. Stockpiles held
by consumer nations are rising and the kingdom is producing 10
million barrels a day, he said. That’s close to the fastest rate
in at least 31 years, official data show.  China’s Growth Slows  In China, the National Bureau of Statistics said gross
domestic product in the world’s second-biggest oil-consuming
country expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, the smallest gain since 2009.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
