Zhongjin Gold Co. (600489) , the listed unit
of  China ’s biggest producer of the precious metal, and  Shandong
Gold Mining Co. (600547)  are competing for two mining companies in the
eastern province of Shandong to boost their resources.  Zhongjin Gold plans to bid for Shandong Shengda Mining Co.
and Shandong Tiancheng Mining Co., which are auctioning their
assets, the company said today in a statement to the Shanghai
stock exchange. Shandong Gold is seeking controlling stakes in
both the companies, it said yesterday. Shares of Shandong Gold
and Zhongjin Gold were suspended from trading.  Chinese gold producers are vying for domestic and overseas
mining resources as the nation is set to displace India this
year as the biggest gold user. Gold has rallied for 11 years on
rising investment and jewelry demand, led by consumers in Asia.  “The targeted assets have large gold resources,” said
Peggy Ye, a Shanghai-based analyst with SWS Research Co.,
without giving details.  Shengda also produces  iron ore , with output at its
Dazhuohan mine exceeding 500,000 metric tons of concentrate a
year, according to the company’s website. Tiancheng, a gold
producer, doesn’t provide information about mines on its
website.  Gold prices for immediate delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$1,677.73 as of 3:12 p.m. Shanghai time. The metal has gained
7.1 percent this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
