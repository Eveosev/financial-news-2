Yasuyuki Watanabe, the manager of
the investment-planning department at Dai-ichi Life Insurance
Co., said pessimism about  Europe ’s debt crisis has eased.  Dai-ichi, based in Tokyo, is Japan’s second-biggest life
insurer with 30.9 trillion yen ($381 billion) in assets.
Watanabe made his comments in an e-mail, and his comments were
translated from Japanese.  “Excessive pessimism has eased” because of measures
including the Longer-Term Refinancing Operations by the  European
Central Bank , the European Financial Stability Facility and the
European Stability Mechanism.  “We don’t expect confusion that’s deeper than what we saw
late last year. We judge that Italy and Spain can restructure on
their own.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
