The Agricultural Bank of  Zimbabwe 
(Pvt) Ltd. is negotiating a $30 million loan from the Industrial
Development Corp. of  South Africa , the Zimbabwe Independent
said, citing a statement.  The Zimbabwean lender, known as Agribank, expects to
receive the funds in the second quarter of this year, the
Harare-based newspaper said today. State-owned Agribank, which
lends to farmers, narrowed losses in the 12 months through
December to $286,409 from a loss of $8.1 million a year earlier,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
