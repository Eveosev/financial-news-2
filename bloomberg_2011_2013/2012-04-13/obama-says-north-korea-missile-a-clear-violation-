President  Barack Obama  called the
failed launch of a long-range rocket by North Korea “a clear
violation” of United Nations Security Council resolutions and
said the U.S. will work with other nations to further isolate
the country.  In his first public comments on North Korea’s launch
attempt, Obama said in an interview with Telemundo that a
promise of food aid to the impoverished nation was contingent on
the government abiding by “international rules and
international norms.”  “So we will continue to keep the pressure on them and
they’ll continue to isolate themselves until they take a
different path,” Obama said in the interview taped in Tampa
today and scheduled for broadcast this evening.  The UN Security Council imposed sanctions against  North
Korea  after its first nuclear test in 2006 and followed up with
more sanctions after its second test in 2009, also banning the
Asian nation from developing missile technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
