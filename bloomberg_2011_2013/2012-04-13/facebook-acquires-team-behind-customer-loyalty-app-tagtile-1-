Facebook Inc. (FB)  is acquiring the team
of developers behind customer-loyalty application Tagtile,
adding to its expertise in mobile software.  “We’re happy to confirm that Tagtile’s founders are
joining Facebook, and that Facebook is acquiring substantially
all of the company’s assets,”  Menlo Park , California-based
Facebook said today in an e-mailed statement. Financial terms
weren’t disclosed.  The world’s largest social-networking service is bolstering
its talent pool in preparation to take the company public this
year. The Tagtile deal follows Facebook’s $1 billion planned
acquisition of mobile photo app Instagram, announced earlier
this week.  The co-founders of San Francisco startup Tagtile, Abheek
Anand and Soham Mazumdar, are engineers with experience working
at  VMware Inc. (VMW)  and Google Inc., according to their  website .  Facebook also announced today that businesses can send
people coupons that consumers then print out or redeem using
mobile phones.  The company is preparing to raise $5 billion in its initial
public offering, which would the biggest Internet IPO ever.
Facebook will be valued at as much as $100 billion in the stock
sale, people familiar with the matter have said.  Technology blog TechCrunch  previously reported  the Tagtile
acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
