Dedini SA Industrias de Base, the
Brazilian company that builds ethanol mills, has received 20
requests to supply quotes this year to companies considering new
production facilities as the industry seeks to meet rising
demand for the renewable fuel.  The company provided five quotes to companies last year for
ethanol projects in  Brazil , Sergio Leme, president of
Piracicaba-based Dedini, said today in a telephone interview.  Brazil doesn’t have enough mills to meet demand from a
growing fleet of flex-fuel cars that may run on pure ethanol or
standard gasoline, he said. Investments in new sugar-cane
plantations and the mills that produce fuel from the crop
plummeted following the 2008 financial crisis .  “The market was frozen” for the last two years, he said.
“At least five of those quotes will turn into contracts” by
the end of the year.  Brazil has mills online to crush about 700 million metric
tons of cane a year, and needs about 800 million tons of
capacity to meet demand, he said.  Dedini expects to sign its first agreement for an ethanol
plant since 2009 after July and generate 1 billion reais ($544
million) of revenue this year, up from 800 million reais in
2011, he said.  “We need 100 mills built through 2020 to satisfy the
market,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
