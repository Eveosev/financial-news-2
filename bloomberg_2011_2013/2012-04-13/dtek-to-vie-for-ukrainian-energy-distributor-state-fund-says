Ukraine’s State Property Fund plans
to auction a 50 percent stake in energy distributor PAT
Dniprooblenerho next week.  The fund authorized DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private coal
and power producer, and TOV Luhanske Energetychne obiednannya,
to bid for the holding on April 17, according to a statement on
the fund’s  website  today.  Bidding for the stake will start at 600 million hryvnia
($74.7 million), the fund said.  Kiev-based DTEK, owned by  Rinat Akhmetov , Ukraine’s richest
man, last month acquired 25 percent of energy producer  PAT
Dniproenergo (DNEN) , marking its fourth purchase in a power company
since December.  DTEK has also acquired 25 percent of PAT  Kyivenergo (KIEN) , a
state-owned energy generating and distribution company, 40
percent of power distributor PAT  Donetskoblenergo (DOON) , and 45
percent of electricity producer PAT  Zakhidenergo. (ZAEN)   -- Editors: James Kraus, Torrey Clark  To contact the reporters on this story:
