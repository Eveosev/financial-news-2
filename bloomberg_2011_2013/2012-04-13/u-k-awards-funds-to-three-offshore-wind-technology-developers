The U.K. Department of Energy and
 Climate Change  awarded about 2 million pounds ($3 million) to
three British companies to help develop technologies that will
help to lower the costs of offshore wind power.  NGenTec Ltd. won 782,991 pounds to make magnet generator
technology for large offshore turbines, according to a  statement 
on DECC’s website. The equipment will ease the manufacturing
process for the turbines and increase reliability.  Osbit Power was given 615,000 pounds to design a system
that will enable safe access to sea-based turbines in difficult
conditions. OGN North Sea Ltd. received the remaining funds for
building foundations for turbines to be installed at water
depths of 30 meters (98 feet) or more.  The funds will help it to create as many as 1,000 long-term
jobs.  “Making  wind turbines  more efficient is common sense and
will help bring down the costs making them more attractive to
build and helping us increase the amount of electricity we get
from clean, green sources,”  Greg Barker , energy and climate
change minister, said in a statement released by OGN.  The U.K. is aiming for 15 percent of its energy to come
from renewable sources by 2020. It’s planning to build 18
gigawatts of offshore wind by 2020 from about 2 gigawatts now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
