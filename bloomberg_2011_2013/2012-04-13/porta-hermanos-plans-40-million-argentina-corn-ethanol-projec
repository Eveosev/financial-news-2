Porta Hermanos SA , an Argentine
ethanol producer, plans to build a $40 million project in the
central city of Leones as the nation seeks to boost the amount
of renewable fuel it mixes with regular gasoline.  The 90 million-liter (23.7 million gallons) a year plant
will be owned with commodity trader  BLD SA , which will organize
a supply of corn feedstock for the facility, Jose Porta,
president of Porta Hermanos, said today in a telephone
interview.  Argentina  may double the amount of ethanol it mixes with
regular gasoline to cut the nation’s use of fossil fuel, Porta
said.  “We could go from 5 to 10 percent in the next four
years,” he said.  The company, based in Cordoba, may start operating its
first ethanol fuel plant in the city of Rio Cuarto in August,
with a similar capacity to the Leones project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
