Peru’s central bank bought $833
million in the  currency market  this week, the most in two
months, as policy makers seek to stem gains in the sol spurred
by surging foreign investment.  The  purchases  are the most since the week ending Feb. 10
when it bought $966 million and come after inflows pushed the
sol to its strongest level in 15 years.  “Big investment projects are underway and as they advance
they’re bringing in dollars,” Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru, said in a phone interview from Lima.
“The central bank is the biggest buyer in the market.”  Companies may have brought forward their dollar sales on
the expectation the U.S. currency will continue to lose ground
against the sol, Diaz said. Almost $1.5 billion changed hands
yesterday, more than twice the amount traded in the previous
session, according to the central bank.  Peru  will expand 5.7 percent this year, the most among
 Latin America ’s biggest economies, central bank president Julio Velarde said March 23. The bank raised its growth forecast from
5.5 percent as improved business confidence boosts the outlook
for private investment. Mining and energy will account for 60
percent of the $35 billion in investment projects expected this
year and next, according to the bank.  The sol was little changed at 2.6580 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, from 2.6590 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit. It earlier touched 2.6560, the strongest level
since October 1997,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator show.  The central bank has bought $6.59 billion this year,
including $165 million today, compared with $3.51 billion
purchased in all of 2011. The purchases buoyed the nation’s
foreign currency reserves to $56.9 billion on April 11 from $49
billion on Dec. 31, according to the bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
