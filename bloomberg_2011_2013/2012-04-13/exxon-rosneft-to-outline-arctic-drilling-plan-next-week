Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S.
oil producer, and Russian energy company  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  will
present details of their $3.2 billion joint-exploration
agreement to analysts in New York on April 18.  Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson,
Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov and Igor Sechin, Russia’s deputy
prime minister, will make presentations at the event, Exxon said
on its  website  today.  In exchange for gaining access to billions of barrels of
crude in the Russian sectors of the Arctic Ocean and Black Sea,
Exxon will grant Rosneft the right to invest in Texas shale
fields and deep-water projects in the Gulf of Mexico, according
to a joint statement issued when the agreement was announced in
August.  Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, replaced  BP Plc (BP/)  as Moscow-
based Rosneft’s partner in the Arctic exploration project after
the U.K. explorer’s billionaire partners in the  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) 
venture blocked the agreement last year.  Russian President-Elect Vladimir Putin yesterday proposed
tax breaks to help make foreign investment in the nation’s oil
industry more profitable.  The export duty for new offshore projects may be canceled
and the extraction tax may be set at 5 percent of the
hydrocarbon sales price for some Arctic offshore fields, Putin
said yesterday in Moscow during a meeting of government and
energy industry officials. Incentives may be granted for as long
as 15 years from the start of production, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
