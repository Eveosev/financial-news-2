EON AG (EOAN) , which got non-binding bids
of as much as 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) for its energy-
from-waste unit, will probably see interested parties reducing
their offers in the next round,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The unit, which has annual sales of 544 million euros and
1,300 employees, is likely to see earnings decline in coming
years because of the “hard competitive situation” in the
industry, the German newspaper said.  Companies in the bidding process include  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s
infrastructure fund, EQT Partners AB,  Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT) ,
Sembcorp,  MVV Energie AG (MVV1) , Remondis AG and GP Guenter Papenburg
AG, FAZ said. EON plans to complete sale by the summer, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
