Russia may extend limits on
fertilizer price growth into next year, First Deputy Prime
Minister  Viktor Zubkov  said in an interview with the Moscow-
based  Krestyanskie Vedomosti  media group.  Russia’s agricultural sector will use about 3 million
metric tons of fertilizer this year, or 600,000 tons more than a
year earlier, Zubkov was cited as saying on the group’s website.
Under a government-promoted agreement between farmers and
producers, fertilizer price increases are restricted to 7
percent to 12 percent this year, according to Zubkov, who didn’t
specify whether the same limit may apply in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
