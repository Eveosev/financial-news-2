Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s largest
social-networking website, won a court ruling denying cost-per-
click advertisers the ability to sue as a group for alleged
overcharges.  U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland,
 California , said in an order today that the advertisers hadn’t
shown their claims have enough in common to justify certifying
the lawsuit as a class action, or group, case.  Facebook was sued in 2009 over claims that advertisers,
charged based on the number of clicks or views they receive,
were wrongfully billed for non-existent, fraudulent or invalid
clicks.  The plaintiffs are advertisers that contracted with  Menlo
Park , California-based Facebook through an automated self-
service process available to the general public. They sought to
represent all cost-per-click advertisers that paid money to
Facebook from May 2009 to the present.  Class certification allows plaintiffs’ lawyers to work
together, giving them more leverage to gain a settlement or
victory at trial.  Larry Yu, a Facebook spokesman, and Rosemary Rivas, an
attorney for the plaintiffs, didn’t immediately return voice-
mail messages seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is In Re Facebook PPC Advertising Litigation, 09-
3043, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
