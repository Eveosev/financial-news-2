HidroAysen, a hydroelectric project that the company is

environmental impact study to regulators at year-end rather than

website of Fox Business.  Colbun SA (COLBUN CC) fell 0.3 percent to 139.82 pesos.  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  ,  Chile ’s largest retailer by
market value, was the most active stock today with 116 billion
pesos ($240 million) changing hands, almost 25 times the average

$218 million corresponded to cross trades by Santiago-based
brokerage Larrain Vial SA, according to data from the Santiago
exchange. Larrain Vial refused to say on behalf of whom it did
the operations, it said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Vina Concha & Toro SA (CONCHA)   fell 2.7 percent to
1,039.5 pesos, its fifth day of losses. Chile’s largest wine
exporter has slumped this week on concern the sovereign debt
crisis in  Europe , which accounts for 43 percent of the company’s
sales, will crimp earnings growth, said German Guerrero, a
partner at Santiago-based brokerage MBI Servicios Financieros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
