International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  agreed to buy Varicent Software Inc., a Canadian provider
of analytics software to manage compensation and sales
performance.  Toronto-based and closely held, Varicent automates and
integrates sales information, allowing companies to determine
compensation and sales-force deployment, IBM said in a statement
today. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, didn’t disclose terms of
the acquisition.  The world’s largest computer-services provider expects to
generate $16 billion of analytics revenue in 2015. Varicent
follows IBM acquisitions of companies, including Algorithmics
Inc., Clarity Systems, OpenPages, Cognos Inc. and SPSS as it
adds analytics tools to help businesses uncover trends and
better deploy their employees in sales, finance, customer
service and marketing. IBM’s five-year plan includes boosting
software to half of its total earnings.  “Sales performance management is still viewed by many in
the industry as an art versus a science, but there is plenty of
opportunity for this mindset to change,” said Dan Shimmerman,
chief executive officer of Varicent. “As part of IBM, we can
now bring our technological expertise in maturing and advancing
the efficiency and effectiveness of the sales function to a
broader range of clients across the globe.”  IBM fell 1.2 percent to $202.80 at the close in  New York .
The shares have risen 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
