Spanish bonds fell, pushing 10-year
yields to 6 percent, amid speculation budget cuts and European
Central Bank measures are failing to stem the region’s sovereign
debt crisis.  Spanish  securities  dropped for a second week as data showed
the country’s banks increased borrowing from the ECB by almost
50 percent in March. Italian bonds declined for the first time
in three days.  Germany ’s bunds rallied as reports showed the
country’s inflation slowed in March and  China ’s economic growth
cooled, spurring demand for  Europe ’s safest securities.  “Spain’s significant budget measures have proved unable to
convince the market that the new government has the fiscal
situation fully under control,” said Norbert Aul, a fixed-
income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “The
market reaction to the more-or-less-expected borrowing increase
only shows the nervousness in the current environment. Spain
should remain under pressure.”  The Spanish 10-year yield rose 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 5.98 percent at 4:36 p.m. London time after
reaching 6 percent. The yield has increased 22 basis points
after jumping 40 basis points last week. The 5.85 percent bond
due in January 2022 dropped 1.375, or 13.75 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,308) face amount, to 99.06.  Borrowings by Spanish banks from the ECB climbed to a
record last month after the region’s central bank boosted its
support for the region’s lenders by offering unlimited three-
year loans. Average net borrowings by Spanish banks climbed to
227.6 billion euros, the Bank of  Spain  said.  Bailout Concern  Spanish  10-year yields  are getting closer to the 7 percent
level that triggered the bailouts of  Greece , Ireland and
 Portugal , as Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the country’s
future is on the line.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by French securities, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps. The change in Spanish 10-year yields was
1.9 times the 90-day average.  The cost of insuring against a Spanish default surged to a
record. Credit-default swaps on Spain rose 17 basis points to an
all-time high of 498, according to CMA prices.  Italy’s  10-year yield  climbed 12 basis points to 5.52
percent, increasing the extra yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of similar-maturity bunds by 18 basis points
to 379 basis points.  Bunds Gain  German bunds advanced as the decline in the debt securities
of peripheral nations increased investor appetite for havens.  German inflation , calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, slowed to 2.3 percent in March from 2.5 percent a
month earlier, matching a preliminary estimate, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. China’s gross domestic
product expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, the least in almost three years, the National Bureau of
Statistics said in Beijing.  “We have seen some recent disappointments in the macro
data, so adding all this together the balance of risk is more to
some risk-off sentiment,” said Niels From, chief analyst at
 Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  in Copenhagen. “We could see a bit more sour
sentiment in the market. There’s a risk that bund yields could
break lower.”  The 10-year bund yield fell six basis points to 1.73
percent. The benchmark rate slid to 1.639 percent on April 10,
within a basis point of the record 1.636 percent set Sept. 23.  The two-year yield declined one basis point to 0.13 percent
after falling to a record 0.091 percent on April 10.  German bunds returned 0.8 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds gained 9.5 percent,
and Spanish securities lost 1.5 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
