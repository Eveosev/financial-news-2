Hong Kong   stocks  rose, driving the
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  to its biggest two-day advance since January,
after China bank lending surged in March to the most in a year.
Shares pared gains momentarily after mainland economic growth
slowed more than forecast.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
biggest lender by market value, jumped 3.2 percent. Li & Fung
Ltd., the biggest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., rose 2.2
percent after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled U.S.
interest rates will remain low. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.,
the nation’s largest producer of the metal, climbed 2.7 percent
as commodity prices increased.  “China’s well-controlled policy to make banks increase
lending is definitely positive for markets,” said Masahiko Ejiri, a Tokyo-based senior  fund manager  in Tokyo at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. China’s economic figures “are unlikely to
be a catalyst for selling because if the figures are bad,
expectations for monetary easing will increase.”  The Hang Seng Index rose 1.8 percent to 20,701.04 at the
close in Hong Kong, with all but three stocks advancing among
its 48 members. Volume on the gauge was almost a third above the
30-day average. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland companies climbed 2.6 percent to 10,936.90.  -- With assistance from Saeromi Shin in Seoul and Zhang Shidong
