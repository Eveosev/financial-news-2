Almost one million job openings in
 Germany  remain unfilled,  Bild  reported in a preview of an
article due to appear today.  Companies nationwide are looking to fill 966,000 positions,
theoretically amounting to 3.2 unemployed persons for each job
available, the publication said, citing the IAB Institute for
Labor Market and Occupational Research.  That compares with 4.2 unemployed per vacancy a year
earlier, Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
