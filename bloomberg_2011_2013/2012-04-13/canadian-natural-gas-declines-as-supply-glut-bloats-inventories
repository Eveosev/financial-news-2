Canadian natural gas fell,
extending its drop this week to 9.7 percent, as rising
production boosted stockpiles of the fuel.  Alberta  gas declined 2.3 percent. Stockpiles in the U.S.
were 2.487 trillion cubic feet as of April 6, 59 percent above
the five-year average, according to the  Energy Department (DOENUST5) . Total
marketed gas production in the U.S. will increase 4.5 percent
this year, the department said.  “The market is sending a message to throttle back on
output,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst with Citi Futures
Perspective in  New York .  Alberta gas for May delivery dropped 3.5 cents to C$1.47 a
gigajoule ($1.39 per million British thermal units) as of 2:55
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 49 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 0.2 cent to settle at a 10-year low of $1.981 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
declined 6.77 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $1.8742 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas slid 6.31 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $1.7364 per
million Btu. At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices dropped 5.92 cents, or 3.2 percent,
to $1.814.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 116 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.13 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.16 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1.06 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.6 billion cubic feet today, or 60 percent of
its capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.01
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
