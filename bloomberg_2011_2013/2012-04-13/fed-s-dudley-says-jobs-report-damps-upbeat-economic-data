Federal Reserve Bank of  New York 
President William C. Dudley said the economy may be gaining
strength even as the weakest job growth in five months
highlights risks to growth.  “The incoming data on the  U.S. economy  generally has been
a bit more upbeat over the past few months, suggesting that the
recovery may be finally establishing a somewhat firmer
footing,” Dudley said according to the prepared text of a
speech to the Buffalo-Niagara Partnership in Buffalo, New York.
His remarks on the national economy were the same as in two
speeches yesterday in Syracuse.  Dudley said yesterday that the central bank may need to
keep  interest rates  low through 2014 in order to lower
unemployment from 8.2 percent, remarks echoed by Fed vice
chairman  Janet Yellen .  Central bankers next meet in two weeks to consider policy
for an economy that Dudley, vice chairman of the policy setting
Federal Open Market Commmittee, said may be sapped by cuts in
 government spending  and the European debt crisis. Dudley and
Yellen backed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s view that progress in
reducing joblessness may not be sustained as growth cools.  As president of the New York Fed since January 2009,
Dudley, 59, holds a permanent vote on the central bank’s
monetary policy committee.  He spoke today on the second day of a two-day tour of
upstate New York, which featured speeches in Syracuse, a visit
Welch Allyn, a manufacturer of medical devices in Skaneateles
Falls, New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
