HidroAysen, which is developing a
2,750-megawatt hydroelectric project in southern  Chile , will
submit a transmission line environmental study later than
scheduled to conduct additional interviews with local residents,
Dow Jones Newswires  reported  today, citing project Chief
Executive Officer Daniel Fernandez in an interview.  HidroAysen, which is owned by Chilean power companies
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA and  Colbun SA (COLBUN) , will submit
the study to regulators at year-end rather than June as
previously planned, Dow Jones reported on the  website of Fox
Business .  To contact the reporter on this story:
