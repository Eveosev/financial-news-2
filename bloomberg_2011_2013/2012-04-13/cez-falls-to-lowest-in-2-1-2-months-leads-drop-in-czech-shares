CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility
in the Czech Republic, fell toward its lowest in 2 1/2 months,
leading a drop in the country’s shares as China’s slower-than-
forecast economic growth drove investors from riskier assets.  The stock slumped 1.8 percent to 774.5 koruna by 3:07 p.m.
in Prague, headed for its lowest closing price since Jan. 30.
The  PX (PX)  equity gauge, where CEZ has a 21 percent weighting, slid
0.4 percent to 936.00, paring this week’s gains to 0.9 percent.  Global stocks and commodities fell after China said gross
domestic product in the world’s second-largest economy rose 8.1
percent in the first quarter, the smallest gain since mid-2009.
The cost of insuring bonds against a Spanish default approached
a record high as Premier  Mariano Rajoy  struggles to prevent the
nation from becoming the fourth euro member to need a bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
