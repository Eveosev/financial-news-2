Japanâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions
for the year ended March 2011 rose 4.2 percent as the economy
recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, the  Environment
Ministry  said today, exceeding a previous estimate.  The ministry had announced in December a preliminary figure
of a 3.9 percent increase in emissions. Greenhouse gas output
rose to 1.258 billion metric tons as record hot summer in some
regions and a cold winter that followed contributed to higher
power consumption, it said today.  Japan committed to reduce production of gases blamed for
global warming by 6 percent from 2008 through 2012 from 1990
levels under the  Kyoto Protocol  which limits releases by
industrial nations. The country cut emissions by an average 11
percent annually under the first three years of the treaty,
according to the ministry. Those figures include credits  Japan 
earned for emission offsets outside the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
