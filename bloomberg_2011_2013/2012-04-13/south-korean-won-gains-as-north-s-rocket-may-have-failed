South Korea ’s won climbed the most
in almost three weeks after the government said a rocket launch
by its northern neighbor failed.  The won gained 0.6 percent to 1,133.73 per dollar as of
9:11 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Kospi index of stocks jumped 0.7 percent as U.S policy makers
signaled that interest rates will remain low.  North Korea 
launched a rocket around 7:39 a.m. local time, South Korean
defense ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok said in a televised
briefing. The South’s government said the launch was a failure,
while Japan said the projectile likely fell into the sea.  “This would be the way a rocket launch would be best 
accepted by the market as it happened before onshore markets 
opened in Korea, and also it fell into the sea right after 
launch,” said Ryoo Hyun Jung, a Seoul-based chief currency 
dealer at Citibank Korea Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
