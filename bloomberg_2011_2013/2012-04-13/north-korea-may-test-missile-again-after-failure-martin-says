Bradley K. Martin, author of “Under
the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader:  North Korea  and the Kim
Dynasty” and a former reporter for Bloomberg News, comments on
North Korea’s missile and nuclear tests after South Korea’s
defense ministry said today’s rocket launch by the North may
have failed:  “They keep failing with their missile tests and they will
continue to test until they stop failing.  “They have to test if they’re going to develop their
technology, and it’s clear they have not given up on developing
that technology.  “As for nuclear tests, those can be either necessary for
development of technology or simply a demonstration of power. I
doubt we’ve seen the last of those, in whatever category.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
