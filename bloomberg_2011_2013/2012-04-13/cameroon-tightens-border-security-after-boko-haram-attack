Cameroon increased the number of
security officers along its border with  Nigeria  after an attack
by suspected members of the Islamist group Boko Haram this week
that left 15 people dead.  “We have deployed more elements of the Rapid Intervention
Brigade, gendarmerie and police to prevent the assailants from
entering Cameroon,” Albert Friki, senior divisional officer for
Mayo-Sava in the Far North province, said by phone today.  On April 10, Boko Haram attacked Banki, a town on the
Nigerian of the border, Friki said. No Cameroonians were killed
in the attack, he said.  Some of the wounded are receiving treatment in Cameroonian
hopsitals at Amchide, Limani and Kolofata, Friki said. The dead
include a pastor, whose church was set on fire, he said.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a
sin,” has claimed responsibility for a rise in attacks in
northern Nigeria since 2009. Cameroon and Nigeria share a 1,690-
kilometer (1,050-mile) border that stretches from the Atlantic
Ocean in the south to Lake Chad in the north.  To contact the reporter on this story:
