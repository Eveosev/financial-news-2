Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold a North
Sea  Forties (EUCSFORT)  crude cargo for less than a deal yesterday. No bids
or offers were made for Russian Urals in northwest  Europe  as the
differential of the blend to Dated Brent fell to the lowest in
11 months.  Daily exports of the 12 main grades of North Sea crude for
loading in May will increase by 4 percent from this month,
according to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Shell sold the Forties consignment with parcel number F0501
for May 3 to May 5 loading to Morgan Stanley at 30 cents less
than  Dated Brent (EUCRBRDT) , according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts trading window. Yesterday,
Mercuria Energy Trading SA bought one cargo for May 6 to May 8
from Shell at a discount of 5 cents.  Mercuria failed to sell the shipment it bought yesterday at
a premium of 20 cents to Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Total SA was unable to sell the grade for May 2 to May 4
for the fourth day even after it lowered the offer from
yesterday by 10 cents to a discount of 25 cents to Dated Brent,
according to the survey.  Trafigura Beheer BV didn’t manage to sell Forties with
parcel number F0411 for April 30 to May 2 at 40 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent, the survey showed. This is the second
delay for the cargo. It was first deferred to April 28 to April
30, compared with an original loading period from April 14 to
April 16, according to three traders who participate in the
market.  Statoil ASA was unable to sell Forties for May 4 to May 6
at 15 cent a barrel more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported  North Sea  trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 17 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent, the lowest since March 23, compared with
a premium of 28 cents yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $121.38 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $120.80 yesterday. The June contract was at
$120.97, a discount of 41 cents to May.  Exports of Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk, Statfjord,
Gullfaks, Alvheim, Aasgard, DUC, Flotta, Grane and Troll will
total 69.3 million barrels, or 2.23 million barrels a day, the
most since February, the plans showed.  Exports of Aasgard crude for May will drop to eight cargoes
of 855,000 barrels each, one less than this month, a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Loadings will total 6.84 million barrels, or 220,645
barrels a day, compared with 256,500 barrels for April,
according to the plan.  Mediterranean/Urals  Tenergy Trading failed to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals
for April 23 to April 27 delivery to Augusta,  Italy , for the
second day. It offered at $2.90 a barrel less than Dated Brent,
30 cents lower than yesterday, according to the survey.  Urals (EUCSURNW)  was $3.75 a barrel less than Dated Brent in northwest
Europe, the lowest since May 3, compared with a discount of
$3.60 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Iraq will ship 19 cargoes of Basrah Light crude from the
 Persian Gulf  in the second half of April, four more than the
first half of the month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg
News showed.  The schedule comprises 12 cargoes of 2 million barrels
each, five 1 million-barrel lots, one 1.9 million-barrel and one
shipment of 630,000 barrels. Total exports from the Basrah Oil
Terminal will be 31.53 million barrels, or 2.1 million barrels a
day, compared with 1.54 million a day in the earlier period.  West Africa  Trafigura failed to sell 950,000 barrels of Nigerian Bonny
Light crude for May 3 to May 4 loading at $2.00 a barrel more
than Dated Brent, free-on-board basis, according to the survey.  Indian Oil Corp. bought 2 million barrels of  Nigeria  Qua
Iboe from BP Plc, and 1 million barrels each of Bonga and
Forcados from Trafigura via a tender, said two traders who
participate in the market. All cargoes are for loading in June.  Eni SpA, which relies on Nigeria for about 10 percent of
its oil and gas production, said a rebel group attacked one of
its facilities in the country.  A pipeline between the Clough Creek and Tebidaba flow
stations was targeted, Eni said today in a statement, without
elaborating. The Movement for the Emancipation of the  Niger
Delta , known as MEND, claimed responsibility.  “More attacks and a full statement will follow,”  Jomo
Gbomo , a spokesman for MEND, said today in a statement. A well-
head was also destroyed, he said.  Qua Iboe (AFCSQUA1)  blend was at a premium of $2.36 a barrel to Dated
Brent, up 1 cent from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
