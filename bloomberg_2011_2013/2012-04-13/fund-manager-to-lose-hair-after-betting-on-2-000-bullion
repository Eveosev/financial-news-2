Charles Oliver, a Sprott Asset
Management Inc. portfolio manager in Toronto, will have his head
shaved today after losing a bet on the gold price.  Oliver joined Sprott in January 2008 and told clients at a
meeting four months later he was so convinced bullion would
reach $2,000 an ounce by April 16, 2012, he was willing to stake
his hair on it. Gold was at $945 an ounce at the time.  “We got to $1,923 last September, I thought it was all
good and easy straight from there on in,” Oliver, who co-
manages the C$500 million ($501 million) Sprott Gold and
Precious Metals Fund, said in a telephone interview today. “The
markets can sometimes tease you.”  Gold futures for June delivery slid 1.5 percent to
$1,654.70 at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . Gold on the
Comex peaked at a record $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6.  Oliver, who’s been letting his hair grow out for about two
years, said he still expects gold will reach $2,000 and that
there’s a “very strong chance” it will get there this year.  “I’m not going to make any new bets yet,” he said.  Gold prices  will rise as countries increase money supplies,
he said. Investor demand for gold has surged as the  Federal
Reserve ’s accommodative monetary policy spurred declines in the
dollar, boosting the appeal of precious metals as an alternative
asset. Gold surged 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as
the central bank set  interest rates  at a record low and bought
$2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of quantitative easing.  “Governments are going to continue to run large deficits
and to fund it they are going to print,” he said. “That’s
great for gold.”  Oliver is also running a charity event associated with the
bet, he said. He’s pledged C$100,000 and is hoping to raise more
than C$1 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
