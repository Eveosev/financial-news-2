Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s proposed stock
restructuring plan, which would add a class of nonvoting shares,
was criticized by shareholder-advisory firm Egan-Jones Ratings
Co.  “As a trusted adviser to institutional investors, we
strongly oppose governance structures, such as currently exists
at Google and as proposed, in which the holders of one class of
common stock have voting rights with fewer votes per share,” the
firm said today in a statement.  Google announced the plan yesterday, saying it would help
preserve the voting power of founders  Larry Page  and Sergey
Brin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
