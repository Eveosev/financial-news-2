Oscar De La Renta Ltd ., the
privately held luxury womenswear chain, plans to pay 500,000
pounds ($793,000) to gain a lease for its first London store,
according to a person with knowledge of the plan.  The New York-based company, which was started in 1965 and
sells $5,150 silk organza cocktail dresses, will open an outlet
at 130 Mount St., adjacent to Lanvin, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the agreement is private. The
payment is for a 10-year lease for the 3,200 square-foot space
over three floors, according to the person.  Clothing from Oscar De La Renta, whose chief executive
officer Alex Bowen is the son-in-law of the founder, is
currently sold at Harrods Ltd. and the A La Mode boutique in
Chelsea, according to its website. The luxury store will take
over from the existing  Nicky Clarke  hairdresser, who has been
relocated to a nearby location on Carlos Place after over 20
years on Mount Street, the person said.  The exclusive Mount Street shopping street, owned by the
Grosvenor Group Ltd., a property company of the family trust of
Britain’s Duke of Westminster, also has the only U.K. stores for
Balenciaga and luxury luggage chain Goyard.  Calls to a spokeswoman at Oscar De La Renta weren’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
