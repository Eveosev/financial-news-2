(Corrects runoff date in second paragraph.)  Soldiers have taken control of
large areas of the capital of Guinea Bissau in a coup attempt,
the British Broadcasting Corp. reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Gunfire was heard in the city and at the residence of
President Carlos Gomes, the  BBC  said. Gomes is due to take part
in a presidential runoff election, later this month, which
opposition leader, Kumba Yala, has said he will boycott, the BBC
reported.  The whereabouts of Gomes are unknown, the BBC said, citing
unspecified reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
