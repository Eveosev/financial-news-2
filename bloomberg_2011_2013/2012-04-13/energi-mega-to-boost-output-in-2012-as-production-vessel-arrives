PT  Energi Mega (ENRG)  Persada forecasts
its average oil and gas output will increase this year as the
arrival of a floating production vessel boosts supply from its
Kangean block.  Energi Mega estimates that it will produce the equivalent
of 40,000 barrels of oil a day this year compared wwith 16,700
in 2011, President Director Imam Agustino said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The production vessel arrived on April 6 from Singapore’s
Sembawang shipyard and will be used to pump 300 million cubic
feet of gas from the block’s Terang field in June, the company
said. Additional output will come from the Offshore Northwest
Java block and the Bentu block in Sumatra.  Energi Mega  owns a 50 percent stake in Kangean in East
Java, which produced 15.5 million cubic feet of gas a day and
pumped 1,360 barrels of oil daily in 2011, according to the
company’s website.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and  Japan Petroleum (1662) 
Exploration Co. equally own the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
