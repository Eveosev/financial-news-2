Singapore ’s economy rebounded last
quarter, prompting the central bank to unexpectedly tighten
monetary policy by allowing faster currency gains to contain
inflation. The local dollar rose.  Gross domestic product  rose an annualized 9.9 percent in
the three months through March 31 from the previous quarter,
when it dropped 2.5 percent, the Trade Ministry said today. The
median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey was for a 6.8
percent gain. The central bank, which uses the  exchange rate  to
manage inflation, said it will increase “slightly” the slope
of the currency trading band and raised its inflation forecast.  The island’s stance contrasts with Asian nations from
 Indonesia (IDBIRATE)  to South  Korea , which have kept  interest rates 
unchanged in recent weeks as policy makers grapple with rising
inflation risks and the economic impact of slowing growth in
China. The local dollar is the region’s best performer this year
as investors bet the Monetary Authority of Singapore will
tolerate a stronger currency to curb price pressures that it
said were more persistent than expected.  “Singapore not only has high inflation relative to its own
past but it has high inflation relative to most other Asian
countries,” said  Robert Prior-Wandesforde , a Singapore-based
director of Asian economics at Credit Suisse Group AG. “With
growth having bounced back rather sharply, it gave them room to
tighten slightly.”  Currency Climbs  The  Singapore dollar  rose 0.4 percent to S$1.2491 against
its U.S. counterpart at 1:05 p.m. local time today. It has
gained 3.8 percent this year. The benchmark Straits Times Index
added 0.7 percent.  The central bank also said it is restoring a narrower
policy band for the currency, while maintaining a “modest and
gradual appreciation.” It widened the trading band at its
October 2010 policy review.  The narrower band will ensure that the currency’s strength
isn’t “overdone,” said Vishnu Varathan, a Singapore-based
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.  “The decision to tighten is a clear signal that the
central bank thinks that inflation may be more persistent than
expected,” said Edward Lee, Singapore-based regional head of
rates strategy at Standard Chartered Plc. “At the same time,
they are noting that inflation will ease in the second half and
growth remains modest, thereby suggesting that they see the new
changes as sufficient for now.”  Faster Inflation  Singapore’s  inflation  will average 3.5 percent to 4.5
percent in 2012, the central bank said today, compared with a
previous forecast range of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. It raised
the core inflation projection to a range of 2.5 percent to 3
percent from 1.5 percent to 2 percent. Higher oil costs, rising
housing rents, more expensive private transportation and
unemployment at a 14-year low have sustained price pressures in
the city state.  GDP (SGDPYOY)  increased 1.6 percent from a year earlier last quarter,
after rising 3.6 percent the previous three months. The
expansion was more than the median forecast of 1 percent in a
Bloomberg survey.  Singapore’s retail sales growth accelerated in February as
vehicle purchases surged and consumers spent more at gas
stations, the statistics department said in a separate report
today. The  retail sales index  climbed 19 percent from a year
earlier after gaining a revised 1.8 percent in January.  The Singapore monetary authority guides the local dollar
against a basket of currencies within an undisclosed band. It
adjusts the pace of appreciation or depreciation by changing the
slope, width and center of the band. The central bank, which
releases a policy statement every six months, eased its stance
at its last review for the first time since 2009.  ‘Aggressive’ Move  It was forecast to maintain the rate of the local dollar’s
advance and refrain from altering its trading band, according to
19 of 21 analysts at financial companies surveyed by Bloomberg.
Two said there was a chance it would increase the band’s slope.  “We acknowledge that there are upside risks to inflation,
but on balance the growth-inflation matrix should not
necessarily have triggered such an aggressive MAS move,” said
 Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in
 Hong Kong . The move to a steeper slope could trigger further
bets on the Singapore dollar and potentially derail the current
growth momentum, while narrowing the band would reduce the
flexibility needed at times of uncertainty, she said.  External inflationary pressures are likely to be sustained
on higher  oil prices , and the domestic labor market “remains
tight”, the central bank said today.  China Slows  “This policy stance will help anchor inflation
expectations, ensure medium-term  price stability , and keep
growth on a sustainable path,” the central bank said.  The outlook for the global recovery remains cloudy. In the
U.S., payrolls missed estimates in March after the best six
months of job gains since 2006, and Federal Reserve officials
have said more monetary accommodation may be needed to fuel
expansion.  China ’s economy expanded 8.1 percent last quarter,
the slowest pace in almost three years, a report showed today.  Investors have demanded higher yields for Spanish and
Italian bonds, reviving concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis isn’t
over even after  Greece ’s second bailout package in February.  Korean Rates  Indonesia  kept interest rates unchanged yesterday for a
second meeting after cutting its benchmark in February, while
the  Bank of Korea  held borrowing costs today for the 10th
consecutive time.  “The vast majority of central banks have finished their
easing policy,” said Prior-Wandesforde at Credit Suisse. “I
don’t think there are wider implications for policy rates across
the region” based on Singapore’s decision.  Singapore, located at the southern end of the 600-mile
(965-kilometer) Malacca Strait and home to the world’s second-
busiest container port, has remained vulnerable to fluctuations
in overseas demand for manufactured goods even as the government
boosts the financial services and tourism industries to cut its
reliance on exports.  Manufacturing fell 2 percent from a year earlier last
quarter, after climbing 9.2 percent in the three months ended
Dec. 31, the Trade Ministry said today. The services industry
grew 2.9 percent, while construction expanded 6.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
