Infosys Ltd. (INFY) ,  India ’s second
largest software-services exporter, sank the most in a year in
 New York  trading after forecasting sales that missed analysts’
estimates.  American depositary receipts  of the Bangalore, India-based
company tumbled 13 percent to $49.15 at the close in New York,
their biggest drop since April 15, 2011. The stock earlier slid
as much as 15 percent for the biggest decline in nine years.
Infosys’  Mumbai-traded shares  lost 13 percent to 2,402.55
rupees, the equivalent of $46.64.  Sales in the year that began April 1 may be between 384.3
billion rupees ($7.5 billion) and 391.4 billion rupees, Infosys
said in a statement today. Analysts  expected  revenue of 396.3
billion rupees for the period, the median of 64 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company also reported fourth-quarter
 sales (INFO)  that were lower than analysts predicted.  “Their growth rate for next year is below industry
levels,” Joseph Foresi, a Boston-based analyst at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC. who has rated Infosys ADRs neutral since
Feb. 28, said by phone. “Infosys has typically outperformed the
industry.”  ADRs of  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , India’s third-largest software
exporter, dropped 7.2 percent in New York to $9.99, the biggest
drop since August.  The  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. India ADR Index  slid 6.5
percent, the largest drop since August, to 1,016.63, the lowest
level since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
