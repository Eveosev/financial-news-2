Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , the
Portuguese energy company investing in  Brazil , increased oil
output in the first quarter and processed 49 percent more crude.  Average working-interest production rose 19 percent from a
year earlier to 22,600 barrels a day, beating a February target
of 22,000 barrels a day. Average net entitlement output leapt 72
percent to 16,500 barrels a day, Galp said today in a statement.  The Lisbon-based  oil company ,  Portugal ’s largest, plans to
invest 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) a year from 2013 to 2016
as it explores in Brazil’s offshore  Santos Basin , where its Lula
project is located, and in Angola. By expanding access to crude
supplies, Galp is seeking to curb dependence on refining and
sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain .  The stock  advanced  as much as 1.9 percent to 11.895 euros
in Lisbon, and traded at 11.85 euros as of 8:41 a.m. local time.
The shares have gained 4.2 percent this year, valuing the
company at 9.8 billion euros.  Galp aims to exceed 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day
in working-interest production by 2020. It has stakes in four
offshore blocks in the Santos Basin, including 10 percent of
Lula, the largest find in the Americas since  Mexico ’s Cantarell
field in 1976. Lula, formerly known as Tupi, holds an estimated
6.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil and equivalents. Galp and
Brazil’s  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  are also partners at Cernambi,
which holds 1.8 billion barrels of estimated reserves.  Refinery Upgrades  Galp processed 20.3 million barrels of oil in the quarter,
up 49 percent, after year-earlier results were affected by the
suspension of the Sines refinery to install new units. The
company is investing in upgrades at its Sines and Oporto plants
to increase diesel production. The Oporto facility can process
about 90,000 barrels a day, while Sines has a 220,000-barrel-a-
day capacity.  The benchmark refining margin, a measure of profit from
turning a barrel of crude into fuels, was negative at 60 U.S.
cents in the quarter, compared with a negative margin of 50
cents a year earlier, Galp said today. Natural-gas sales climbed
7.5 percent to 1.73 billion cubic meters in the period.  Galp is due to report first-quarter earnings on April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
