Germany ’s Bundesbank agreed to sell
Excalibur, a vehicle created by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
to a fund managed by Dallas-based  Lone Star  Funds.  The asset sold has a nominal value of 1.4 billion euros
($1.8 billion), the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank said in an e-
mailed statement today. Excalibur had a nominal value of 2.16
billion euros in 2008, which declined to 1.3 billion euros at
the end of 2011 after interest and redemption payments, the
Bundesbank said on Jan. 19.  Excalibur Funding No. 1, which contains packaged property
loans, is one of 33 securities which Lehman Brothers Bankhaus
AG, the German arm of the defunct U.S. bank, pledged as
collateral to access  European Central Bank  funding through the
Bundesbank in 2008. The Bundesbank said in January it has
completed the sale of 28 assets and was looking for investors
for the remaining five, among them Excalibur.  “With the sale of Excalibur the Bundesbank is on the right
path to be able to complete the sale of Lehman assets by the end
of the year,” the central bank said.  The transaction should be competed by the end of April, the
Bundesbank said. A spokeswoman for the German central bank
declined to comment on the sale price.  To contact the reporters on this story:
