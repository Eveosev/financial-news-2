Rainfall in  Colombia , the world’s
second-biggest producer of arabica coffee, is delaying the
drying of beans from the smaller of two annual crops that
started this month, according to Volcafe.  Production there will “struggle to reach” 7 million bags
in the 2011-12 season started in October, Volcafe, the coffee
unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. said in
February. That is down from 7.8 million bags in 2010-11, data
from the trader shows. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132
pounds).  Growers in Colombia usually harvest the main crop from
October to December and the smaller crop, known as mitaca, is
collected from April to June.  “The flow of mitaca coffee was rather low due to the
Easter festivities and some rains delaying the drying process,”
Volcafe said in a report to clients e-mailed today.  Colombian coffee for May and June shipments was trading at
a premium of 30 cents a pound to the price on the ICE Futures
U.S. exchange in  New York , unchanged from last week, Volcafe
data showed.  Arabica coffee for July delivery dropped 1.6 percent to
$1.8130 a pound by 12:13 p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
