Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
East African nation’s biggest lender by assets, touched the
highest level in more than nine months as its price estimate was
raised at Standard Investment Bank Ltd.  The shares climbed as much as 2.1 percent to 24.25
shillings, the strongest since June, before closing unchanged at
23.75 shillings in Nairobi, the capital.  “We have revised the valuation we gave in December of
31.49 shillings to 32.52 shillings,” Francis Mwangi, head of
research at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank, said in a
phone interview today. “The company will continue delivering
benefits from cost restructuring launched two years ago”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
