New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson
will buy the city’s  National Basketball Association  team,
the Hornets, NBA Commissioner  David Stern  said.  Benson will pay $338 million, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the transaction who was granted 
anonymity because the price isn’t public. League spokesman Tim
Frank declined to comment. Greg Bensel, a spokesman for the
Saints, didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.  “We have really found the perfect owner,” Stern said at a
news conference in New York after a league owners meeting.  The NBA took control of the Hornets in 2010. Benson has
owned the National Football League Saints since 1985.  To contact the reporter on this story:
