(Corrects spelling of governor’s name in first paragraph.)  The governor of Argentina’s Jujuy
province, Eduardo Fellner, denied a media report that Argentina
seeks a stake in  YPF SA (YPFD) , the nation’s largest oil company, and
said no decision has been made on the matter.  Fellner spoke to reporters in  Buenos Aires . Argentine
newspaper Clarin earlier reported the nation will take as much
as 50.01 percent stake in YPF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
