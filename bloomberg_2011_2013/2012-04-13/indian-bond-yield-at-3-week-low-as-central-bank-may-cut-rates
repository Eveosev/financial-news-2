India ’s benchmark bond completed
its first weekly advance this month on speculation slowing
economic growth will prompt the central bank to cut  interest
rates  next week.  The government’s 10-year debt rallied the most in more than
two months yesterday after official data showed  factory output 
rose 4.1 percent in February from a year earlier, less than the
6.7 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. Seventeen of 22 economists in a separate Bloomberg
survey predict the  repurchase rate  will be cut by 25 basis
points to 8.25 percent on April 17. Five expect no change, while
two forecast a reduction of 50 basis points.  “The economic growth scenario looks grim,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank in
Mumbai. “That has strengthened expectations of a rate cut.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, to 8.47 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
yield rose three basis points today. Local financial markets
were closed for public holidays on April 5 and 6.  The  Reserve Bank  of India, which raised its benchmark rate
by 3.75 percentage points from March 2010 through October 2011,
signaled a readiness to lower borrowing costs to bolster growth
at its last policy review on March 15.  Deutsche Bank AG predicted India’s inflation will slow to
6.6 percent in March from 6.95 percent in February. Lower
inflation and “persisting weak” economic momentum will spur
the central bank to cut the repurchase rate next week and in
June, analysts Taimur Baig and  Kaushik Das  wrote in a note.  The wholesale price  index  may rise 6.65 percent in March,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before the data is
published on April 16.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell nine basis
points to 7.93 percent this week, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The contracts dropped four basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
