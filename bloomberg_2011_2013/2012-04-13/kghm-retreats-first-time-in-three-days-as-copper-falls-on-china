KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
producer with the largest mine output in Europe, fell for the
first time in three days as the metal declined in the wake of
weaker-than-expected economic growth in  China .  The shares retreated as much as 1.8 percent to 140.5 zloty
and traded 0.7 percent lower by 12:27 p.m. in Warsaw.  Copper slid in London, extending a second weekly drop, as
slower-than-estimated growth in China stoked concern the
weakening trend in the worldâ€™s biggest consumer of the metal may
continue.  The Chinese economy expanded 8.1 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said today.
That was below the 8.4 percent median estimate from economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
