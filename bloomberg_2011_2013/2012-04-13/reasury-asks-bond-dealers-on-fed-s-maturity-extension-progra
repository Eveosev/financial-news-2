The U.S. Treasury Department asked
bond dealers for their views on a Federal Reserve maturity
extension program scheduled to end June 30.  The survey, released in a statement today, is for an April
26-27 meeting between Treasury officials and bond dealers in
advance of the government’s quarterly auctions of notes and
bonds next month.  The survey asked dealers what impact the end of the
maturity extension program, known as “Operation Twist,” would
have on the Treasury market. The central bank is pursuing a
program announced in September to replace $400 billion of short-
term debt in the Fed’s portfolio with longer-term securities.  The Treasury also requested dealers’ latest economic and
fiscal forecasts for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, and asked
whether the current auction schedule is well-suited to meet the
Treasury’s expected financing needs.  Dealers were also asked to discuss “the increased
utilization of electronic trading platforms in the Treasury
market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
