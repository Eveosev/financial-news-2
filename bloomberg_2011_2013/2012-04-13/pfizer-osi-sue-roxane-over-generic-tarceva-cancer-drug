Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s largest
drugmaker, and its business partners OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc.
and Genentech Inc. sued Roxane Laboratories Inc. over its plans
to market generic copies of the lung-cancer drug  Tarceva .  Pfizer, based in  New York ; OSI, a unit of Tokyo-based
 Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503) ; and Genentech, a unit of  Roche Holding AG (ROG) 
of Basel, Switzerland, contend Ingelheim, Germany-based
 Boehringer AG (0205298D) ’s Roxane has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for permission to sell its version of Tarceva
before the patents expire.  The patent owners, Pfizer and OSI, and licensee Genentech
“will be substantially and irreparably harmed” if a judge
doesn’t stop the infringement, their lawyers said in a complaint
filed today in federal court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Roxane, based in Columbus, Ohio, is facing another patent
suit filed April 10 in the same court. In that case, drugmaker
Abbott Laboratories contends Roxane is infringing patents for
the HIV drug  Norvir .  Angela Chirico, a spokeswoman for Roxane, said in an e-
mailed statement that the lawsuit is “an expected response” to
its abbreviated new drug application for a generic copy.  “Roxane Laboratories Inc. complies with all FDA
regulations and will not comment further on pending
litigation,” she added.  The case is OSI v. Roxane, 12-cv-465, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
