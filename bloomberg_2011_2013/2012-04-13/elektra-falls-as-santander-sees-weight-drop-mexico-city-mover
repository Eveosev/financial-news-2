Grupo Elektra SA recorded the
biggest two-day drop since at least 1994 as  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
said Mexican stock exchange rule changes may cut the company’s
weight in the benchmark index in half.  The retail and banking company controlled by billionaire
Ricardo Salinas fell 16 percent to 865.93 pesos at the close  in
Mexico City, following an 18 percent decline yesterday. The
shares closed at the lowest price since Aug. 15.  Investors are selling Elektra after the Mexican stock
exchange said April 11 that its index would use a new method for
calculating shares that are freely available for trading. While
Elektra has a free float of 29 percent based on today’s rules, a
derivative instrument the company holds keeps most of those
shares from being openly traded.  Under the new rules, Elektra’s free float could fall below
the 12 percent threshold required by the IPC index, Gonzalo Fernandez, a Santander analyst, wrote in a research note dated
today.  “Nevertheless, it is worth clarifying that depending on
the maturity of the derivatives, probably not all shares held in
the trust would necessarily be eliminated in the free float
calculation,” Fernandez wrote.  Elektra’s weight in the IPC would fall to 2.15 percent from
4.2 percent if half of the shares involved in the derivative are
deducted from the free float, according to Ferndandez.  Dan McCosh, an Elektra spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
