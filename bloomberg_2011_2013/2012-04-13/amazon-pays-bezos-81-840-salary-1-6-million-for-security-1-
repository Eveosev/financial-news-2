Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  paid Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey P. Bezos a salary of just $81,840 last
year and he received no stock awards, making him one of the
lowest-paid CEOs among large technology companies.  The rest of his $1.68 million in total compensation was for
security arrangements at “business facilities” and for
corporate travel, the Seattle-based company said today in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Amazon said it aims to give its top executives “a minimum
level of cash compensation” because it wants their pay to be
tied to building  shareholder value . As Amazon’s founder, Bezos
owns almost 88 million outstanding shares of the company, a
stake of about 20 percent. The value of  those holdings  has
increased about 9 percent this year to $16.6 billion.  Bezos has ramped up investments in fulfillment, Kindle e-
readers and Web services, sending operating expenses up more
than 40 percent in 2011 and shaving 2.3 percentage points off
margins. That spending is meant to spur sales, which rose 41
percent last year, by ensuring that consumers start and end
their shopping process at Amazon.  These efforts “are not zero-sum,” Bezos said in a letter
to shareholders today. “They create win-win situations and
create significant value for developers, entrepreneurs,
customers, authors and readers.”  Stock awards helped push Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook’s 2011
compensation to $378 million. Oracle Corp. CEO  Larry Ellison 
received 2011 compensation valued at $77.6 million. At Microsoft
Corp., Steve Ballmer’s pay package was worth $1.38 million.  Amazon’s shares fell 1.2 percent to $188.46 at the close in
 New York . The stock has climbed 8.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
