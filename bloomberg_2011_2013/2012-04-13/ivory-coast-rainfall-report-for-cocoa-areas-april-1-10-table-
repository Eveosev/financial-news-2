The following are rainfall figures
for  Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest cocoa producer, for April 1
to April 10, according to the National Meteorological Service.  The central-western Daloa region is the West African
nation’s biggest cocoa-growing area geographically, with average
annual production of about 300,000 metric tons.  The southwestern Soubre region, including the western
coastal towns of  San Pedro , Tabou and Sassandra, also produces
about 300,000 tons a year.  The figures are tabulated under weather station, the amount
of rainfall received, long-term average rainfall over the last
