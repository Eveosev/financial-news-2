Jay Luo, who ran SAC Capital
Advisors LP’s Asia-Pacific operations, quit the hedge fund after
10 years to pursue other opportunities, said three people with
knowledge of his resignation.  Luo will leave the $13 billion hedge fund run by  Steven A. Cohen  after a transition period, said one of the people who
asked not to be identified because the information is private. A
replacement has yet to be determined, the person said.  Luo, who was a managing director based in Hong Kong, ran
SAC’s Asia-Pacific operations for almost six years, according to
his profile on the LinkedIn social-networking site. He
previously was part of SAC’s risk-management team based in the
firm’s Stamford, Connecticut-based headquarters, the person
said.  SAC Capital was in talks last year to expand its offices in
Hong Kong after adding employees in the city state, two people
with knowledge of the matter said in June.  A spokesman for SAC declined to comment on Luo’s departure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
