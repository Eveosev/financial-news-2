Bank of America Corp. ’s Merrill
Lynch unit won a $146 million judgment in federal court as part
of a lawsuit against UISA Finance and Usinas Itamarati SA.  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan assessed the damages
in a breach-of-contract suit involving a derivatives transaction
in 2008, according to a filing dated April 10 in  Manhattan .
Sullivan conducted a five-day trial without a jury last June.  “Defendants made a bet on an interest-rate swap that
carried the potential to save the companies millions in interest
payments,” Sullivan said in his opinion. “Defendants will be
required to live up to the obligations they knowingly
accepted.”  Merrill Lynch sued in 2009 seeking $146 million in damages.
UISA borrowed $125 million from Merrill in 2007, according to
court filings. After the loan UISA made an agreement with the
bank for an interest-rate swap in order to reduce its interest
payments. When the financial crisis deepened in late 2008, UISA
was unable to provide acceptable collateral to Merrill and the
swap was terminated, according to the April 10 filing. At that
time UISA and Itamarati, the guarantor of the agreement, owed
$146 million.  ‘Disastrous Loser’  Sullivan said in his opinion that the financial crisis of
2008 made UISA’s bet “a disastrous loser.” He granted Merrill
Lynch’s motion for judgment in 2010 on the issue of liability.
The trial was over damages.  “We are pleased with the court’s decision,”  Bill Halldin ,
a spokesman for Merrill Lynch, said in an e-mail. Richard
Werder, a lawyer for UISA, didn’t immediately respond to
messages seeking comment.  Usinas Itamarati is a Brazil-based manufacturer of sugar
and ethanol. UISA and Usinas are owned by Companhia Itamarati de
Investimentos.  The case is Merrill Lynch Capital Services v. UISA Finance,
09-02324, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
