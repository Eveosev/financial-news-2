JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, is “very conservative” in investing the
firm’s excess cash, said Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon .  “We create deposits around the world, and we’re very
conservative,” Dimon said today in a conference call with
reporters after the New York-based firm reported first-quarter
earnings. “The portfolio does change over time as we change our
views.”  Bruno Iksil, a London-based trader in JPMorgan’s chief
investment office, built positions in contracts linked to the
value of corporate debt that market participants said were so
big that they moved the market. JPMorgan’s chief investment
office has been transformed in recent years by Dimon into a unit
that makes bigger and riskier speculative bets with the bank’s
money, five former employees said this week.  Holdings in the chief investment office include about $70
billion of European mortgage-linked debt, said Dimon, 56. The
bank’s regulators can see everything the company does whenever
they want, he said.  The firm has more money from deposits than it has extended
in loans and it invests the difference, about $360 billion, “in
a variety of very high-grade securities,” Chief Financial
Officer Douglas Braunstein said.  “That generates earnings for us, and it also balances our
interest-rate risk,” Braunstein said on the call. “We are very
comfortable with the positions we have.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
