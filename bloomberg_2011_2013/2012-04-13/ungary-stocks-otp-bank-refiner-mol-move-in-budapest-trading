Hungary’s benchmark  BUX (BUX)  stock index
fell 2.8 percent to 17,337.42 at the close in Budapest, the
biggest daily drop since Dec. 1, taking the weekly decline to
4.8 percent.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender,
retreated 6.1 percent to 3,375 forint, on concern disputes
obstructing the country’s international bailout request will
escalate and the government will introduce a new banking tax.  Hungary would consider it an act of “blackmail” if the
International Monetary Fund were to pose political criteria for
starting financial assistance talks and is ready to go to court
to defend his position, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an
interview on public radio MR1-Kossuth.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, retreated 2
percent to 17,100 forint. Oil dropped for the first time in
three days after China’s economy grew at the slowest pace in 11
quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
