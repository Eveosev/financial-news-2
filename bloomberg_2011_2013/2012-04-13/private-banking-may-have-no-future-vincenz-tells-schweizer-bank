Traditional private banking as
practiced in  Switzerland  may not have a future, as clients
prefer cash holdings to investments, Raiffeisen Schweiz Chief
Executive Officer Pierin Vincenz was quoted as saying by
Schweizer Bank magazine.  An ageing population, low  interest rates  and volatile
securities are all reasons for this trend, Vincenz said. Cash is
of little interest to private banks, which donâ€™t normally
provide loans and would have to reinvest the money, he said,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
