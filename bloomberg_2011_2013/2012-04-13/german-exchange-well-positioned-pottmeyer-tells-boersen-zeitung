Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) , the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange owner blocked in a bid to acquire NYSE Euronext,
remains strong and well-positioned even without a partner, Chief
Financial Officer Gregor Pottmeyer said in an e-mailed preview
of an interview in Boersen Zeitung.  Pottmeyer added that he expects a pause in the
consolidation of exchanges, with no major international stock
exchange transactions probable in the next year or two, the
newspaper said.  The German exchange is now concentrating on “accelerated
organic growth” and any acquisitions will probably be small-
scale ones that provide immediate value to the company,
shareholders and customers, Boersen Zeitung cited the executive
as saying.  Potential growth lies in products for unsecured and
unregulated markets, in  developing countries  led by  Asia , and in
the expansion of technology services, Pottmeyer also told the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
