Major League Baseball  “has
issues” with the sale of the  Los Angeles Dodgers  that include
objections to who will own stadium parking lots, a lawyer for
the league said at a hearing.  Attorney Thomas E Lauria raised a series of objections
today, just hours before a legal deadline that the Dodgers say
they can’t violate. The sale documents allowing Dodgers owner
Frank McCourt to sell the team for $2.15 billion appear to
violate MLB rules, Lauria said.  Without changes, “we may have problems with this deal
closing,” Lauria said.  The Dodgers are in court seeking approval for the sale from
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross in Wilmington, Delaware.
Without approval today, the team may not be able to close the
transaction by April 30, when McCourt is required to pay his ex-
wife Jamie McCourt about $130 million, Dodgers attorney  Bruce
Bennett  said in court.  Under the sale agreement,  Frank McCourt  would be a co-owner
of the parking lots. Those lots would be leased to the Dodgers
for about 99 years, Bennett said in court.  The case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-12010, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
