The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt rose, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings jumped 14 basis
points to 656 at 9:51 a.m. in London, and is heading for a
fourth weekly rise. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2.5 basis points to 136.5 basis
points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased six basis points to 242 and the
subordinated index climbed 5.5 to 390.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
