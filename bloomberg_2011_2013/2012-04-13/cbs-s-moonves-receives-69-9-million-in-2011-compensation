CBS Corp. (CBS)  Chief Executive Officer
Leslie Moonves received $69.9 million in 2011 total
compensation, 21 percent more than a year ago.  Moonves’s package included a salary of $3.5 million, a
bonus of $27.5 million, stock grants of $8.5 million and options
awards of $27.3 million, New York-based CBS, owner of the most-
watched U.S. television network, said today in a regulatory
filing.  The CEO oversaw a 42 percent increase in the company’s
stock last year after paying down debt and developing a plan to
add $3 billion in new revenue, including through sales of TV
shows outside the U.S. and to online streaming services
including  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)   Moonves’s total compensation is more than double the $33.4
million provided to  Robert Iger , chairman and CEO of  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) , which reported about three times the revenue of CBS last
year. Disney’s stock was little changed in 2011.  Chairman Sumner Redstone, who controls CBS and Viacom Inc.
through his family’s holding company National Amusements Inc.,
received $20.3 million in total compensation from CBS last year,
including a $1.75 million salary and a $10 million bonus.  Redstone’s compensation as chairman of Viacom was $21
million last year, according to regulatory filings.  CBS climbed 1 percent to $32.51 today at the close of
trading in New York. The stock has climbed 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
