U.S. stocks fell, sending the
 Standard & Poor’s 500  to its first back-to-back weekly decline
since November, after employers added fewer jobs than estimated
and investor concern over global economic growth intensified.  All  10 groups in the S&P 500  also slipped after  China ’s
gross domestic product slowed more than forecast. Financial
shares fell the most, sinking 2.8 percent, as  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  tumbled 6 percent.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world’s largest company
by market value, sank 4.5 percent for the biggest weekly loss
since October.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the first company in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to disclose quarterly results, rose 2.3
percent after posting an unexpected profit.  The S&P 500 dropped 2 percent to 1,370.26, its worst week
since Dec. 16. The decline came even as the benchmark index for
American equities had its best two-day gain of the year on April
11 and 12, sparked by optimism about earnings and signals from
the  Federal Reserve  that  interest rates  will remain low. The Dow
lost 210.55 points, or 1.6 percent, to 12,849.59.  “There are still macro concerns that are weighing on the
market right now,” Joseph Veranth, chief investment officer at
Dana Investment Advisors in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a
telephone interview. The firm manages $3.4 billion. In the U.S.,
“economic numbers haven’t gone off a cliff, but the key is they
are a little weaker than people expected,” he said. China and
Europe “are concerns for us as part of the overall puzzle.”  Jobs Report  Equities fell as U.S. employers added 120,000 jobs in
March, less than the median economist forecast of 205,000 in a
Bloomberg survey. Consumer confidence dropped and more Americans
than forecast filed claims for jobless benefits. A surge in
Spanish and Italian bond yields fueled concern Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening, while China said its economy expanded 8.1
percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace since 2009.  The  S&P 500  has slumped 2.7 percent in April, poised for
the biggest monthly loss since September. The index finished the
previous three months with a 12 percent gain, producing the best
first-quarter rally since 1998.  The benchmark gauge jumped 0.7 percent on April 11
following Alcoa’s results, and added 1.4 percent April 12 as Fed
Vice Chairman Janet Yellen and New York Fed President William C.
Dudley endorsed the central bank’s view that borrowing costs are
likely to stay low through 2014. Stocks retreated 1.3 percent on
the final day of the week as the cost of insuring against a
Spanish default rose to a record.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, jumped 17 percent to 19.55. The gauge, known as
VIX, rose for a fourth week, the longest streak since August. It
reached 14.26 in March, the lowest level since 2007.  Financials Tumble  Concern about the global economy drove financial shares
lower even as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) 
reported earnings that beat estimates. Bank of America tumbled 6
percent to $8.68 for the biggest decline in the Dow. JPMorgan
lost 2.6 percent to $43.21, while Wells Fargo dropped 2.6
percent to $32.84.  Alcoa rose 2.3 percent to $9.85. The largest U.S. aluminum
producer reported a first-quarter profit after customers from
automakers to beverage-can manufacturers ordered more of the
metal and the company closed higher-cost smelting capacity.  Ninety-one companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to
announce results next week. They include Citigroup Inc., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America and some of the largest
technology companies such as International Business Machines
Corp., Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.  Slowing Earnings  S&P 500 per-share profit growth slowed to 1.7 percent
during the first three months of the year from 4.9 percent in
the fourth quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. “Expectations for earnings have really come down
significantly over the last three to six months,” Veranth said.
“It might have been overdone.”  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  plunged 9.9 percent to $19.95,
leading energy companies to a 2.7 percent retreat. The second-
largest U.S. natural-gas producer announced $2.6 billion in
asset sales that will cut debt and fund drilling after slumping
gas prices eroded cash flow.  The S&P 500  Information Technology Index (S5INFT)  fell 2 percent,
dropping for the first time this year and ending its longest
string of weekly gains since at least 1989. Apple sank 4.5
percent to $605.23. After rising to a record on April 9, the
shares fell four days in a row for the longest losing streak
since December.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  advanced 6.3 percent to $24.57. Gartner
Inc. said the global personal-computer industry unexpectedly
grew in the first quarter and the Palo Alto, California-based
company remained a market leader.  Supervalu Inc. (SVU)  rose 25 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$6.41. The supermarket and pharmacy chain forecast 2013 earnings
excluding some items of at least $1.27 a share, beating the
average analyst forecast of $1.19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
