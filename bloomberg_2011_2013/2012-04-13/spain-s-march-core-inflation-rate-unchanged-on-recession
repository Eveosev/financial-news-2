rose 1.2 percent from a year earlier, matching the February
rate, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today.
Headline inflation, based on European Union calculations, was
1.8 percent, matching an initial estimate on March. 29.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government presented the
deepest budget cuts in more than three decades on March 30 even
as it forecasts an economic contraction of 1.7 percent this
year.  Retail sales  fell 6.4 percent in February from a year ago,
the statistics institute said on March 30.  The government forecasts household spending will decline
