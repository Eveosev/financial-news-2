L’Oreal SA (OR) , the world’s largest
cosmetics maker, surged to a four-year high in Paris trading
after reporting quarterly sales that beat analysts’ estimates
and saying trends are favorable for all its brands.  The shares climbed as much as 3.71 euros, or 4.1 percent,
to 94.80 euros, the highest intraday price since Jan. 8 2008.
The stock traded 3 percent higher at 94.08 euros as of 9:15 a.m.
and was the  best performer  on the benchmark  CAC 40 index. (CAC)   First-quarter revenue climbed 9.4 percent to 5.64 billion
euros ($7.44 billion), the Paris-based maker of Garnier shampoo
said after markets closed yesterday. The average of 10 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 5.53 billion euros. Sales
grew in all regions, led by the Asia Pacific, while the luxury
division was L’Oreal’s best performing unit.  “The worldwide cosmetics market remains strong and trends
are favorable for all brands,” L’Oreal Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Paul Agon said yesterday.  While the economic environment “remains uncertain, the
first three months have reinforced our confidence in the group’s
ability to outperform the market in 2012, to strengthen its
global positions and to achieve another year of growth in both
sales and profits,” he said.  L’Oreal’s 11 percent increase in like-for-like sales in so-
called New Markets was a “pleasant surprise,”  Andrew Wood , an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote yesterday in a note to
clients. He has an underperform rating on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
