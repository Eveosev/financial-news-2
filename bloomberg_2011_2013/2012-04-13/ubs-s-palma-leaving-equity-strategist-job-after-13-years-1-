Jeffrey Palma, the global equity
strategist at  UBS AG (UBSN) , said in an e-mail to clients that he’s
leaving the firm after almost 13 years.  “Today is my last day at UBS as I move on to a new
opportunity,” Palma wrote today.  Concerns about the U.S. and Chinese economies are
“overdone” and corporate fundamentals “remain solid,” Palma
wrote in a note dated yesterday. He recommended buying European
shares in July as he downgraded his rating on U.S. stocks,
before the intensifying debt crisis drove the Stoxx Europe 600
Index down 21 percent through Sept. 22. That was worse than the
16 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Palma’s prediction proved prescient when he said on Jan. 3
that the U.S. should beat global markets. The  S&P 500  rose 10
percent in 2012 through yesterday, exceeding the 7.7 percent
gain from the version of the MSCI All-Country World Index that
excludes American equities.  He joined UBS in 1999 after working at Bankers Trust Corp.
as an economist, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He has
a master’s degree in business administration from  Columbia
University  and a bachelor’s degree in economics from  Rutgers
University , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
