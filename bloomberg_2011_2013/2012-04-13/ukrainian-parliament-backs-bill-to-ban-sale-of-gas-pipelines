Ukraine’s parliament barred any
sale of NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy after officials said Russia sought
a stake in the state-run energy company’s natural-gas pipelines
in exchange for cheaper supplies of the fuel.  A bill to boost the efficiency of Naftogaz’s pipeline
system while maintaining state ownership was backed by 242
lawmakers in the 450-seat legislature, parliament said today on
its website. Any reorganization of Naftogaz’s pipelines or
storage facilities will now require Cabinet approval.  The former Soviet nation’s pipelines carry 80 percent of
Russian gas shipments to  Europe . The legislation was submitted
by Yuriy Karmazin from the Our Ukraine block.  To contact the reporters on this story:
