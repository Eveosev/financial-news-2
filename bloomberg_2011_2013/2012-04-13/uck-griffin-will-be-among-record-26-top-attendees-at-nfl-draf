Quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III are among the record 26 top prospects attending the
National Football League draft in  New York  City on April 26.  A record five players from the national champion University
of Alabama will also travel to Radio City Music Hall in New York
for the draft, the NFL said in an e-mailed statement last night.
They are Mark Barron, Dont’a Hightower, Dre Kirkpatrick, Trent
Richardson and Courtney Upshaw.  The  Indianapolis Colts  have the first pick and have said
they’ll take Stanford University quarterback Luck. The Colts
released Peyton Manning in March and the four-time league Most
Valuable Player joined the Denver Broncos.  The  Washington Redskins  last month reached an agreement
with the St. Louis Rams to move up to the second pick, giving
the team the chance to select Heisman Trophy winner Griffin from
Baylor University.  The  Minnesota Vikings ,  Cleveland Browns  and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers have the next three picks.  Morris Claiborne, Fletcher Cox, Justin Blackmon, Ryan
Tannehill and Quinton Coples, who are top-10 prospects according
to ESPN’s Scouts Inc., will also be at the draft.  The first round is scheduled for April 26, with rounds two
and three the following night and rounds four through seven the
next day. NFL Network and ESPN will televise the draft on all
three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
