 The Argentine government
attempting to wrest control of oil company YPF SA from  Spain ’s
 Repsol YPF SA (REP)  will have “consequences,” Deputy Finance
Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said.  “Going against Spanish interests abroad by not respecting
the legal context or the rules of the game goes against the
government, and there will be consequences,” Latorre told
journalists today in Madrid.  Argentine newspapers including Clarin have reported this
week that the government may announce the acquisition of a stake
of as much as 50.01 percent in YPF.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
