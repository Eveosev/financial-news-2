The  Los Angeles Dodgers , the
bankrupt Major League Baseball team, has reached an agreement
with Fox Sports to end the broadcaster’s objection to the $2.15
billion sale of the club, lawyers said in court today.  Fox Sports’ Net West 2 LLC, a unit of New York-based  News
Corp. (NWSA) , plans to drop its opposition to the sale later today once
final documents are presented in bankruptcy court in Wilmington,
Delaware, Fox attorney Gregory W. Werkheiser said in court
today.  Fox had objected to the sale, seeking written assurances
that competitor  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  isn’t part of the group
buying the Dodgers. The Dodgers are preparing court documents
that should address Fox’s concerns, team attorney Sidney
Levinson said in court.  “We believe we do have an agreement in principal,”
Werkheiser told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross today.  The team is being bought by a group including former
basketball player  Magic Johnson , Guggenheim Partners Chief
Executive Officer Mark Walter and former Atlanta Braves and
Washington Nationals President Stan Kasten.  Under the team’s television contract with Fox, the Dodgers
can’t begin negotiating a new media-rights deal until November.
Fox argues that allowing Time Warner to buy a stake in the team
may violate that television contract.  Later today, Gross will consider approval of the sale of
the team as part of the Dodgers’ bankruptcy reorganization plan.  The case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-12010, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
