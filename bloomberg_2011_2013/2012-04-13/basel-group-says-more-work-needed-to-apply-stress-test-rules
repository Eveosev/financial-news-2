The  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  said that “more work remains to be done” by
regulators to fully apply its rules on bank stress tests.  “Stress testing has become a key component of the
supervisory assessment process as well as a tool for contingency
planning and communication,” the group said in a statement on
its website. “Countries are, however, at varying stages of
maturity in the implementation” of guidelines the group issued
in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
