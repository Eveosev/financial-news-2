A Czech court convicted Vit Barta,
a senior member of the smallest ruling-coalition member, of
bribery in a case that raised questions over party financing
within the government last year.  The court in  Prague  found Barta, head of Public Affairs’
parliamentary caucus, guilty of bribing Kristina Koci, a party
colleague, according to presiding judge Jan Sott, who handed
down an 18-month sentence, suspended for 30 months. Barta was
found to have paid Koci 500,000 koruna ($26,500) in exchange for
her loyalty and an end to critical comments against him, Sott
said today as he read the verdict live on Czech television.  Barta, who owned a security and detective agency before
joining parliament, denied the charges and said he only lent the
money to Koci. He immediately appealed the verdict.  Barta resigned as transportation minister last April when
Prime Minister Petr Necas said there were suspicions of
“possible corrupt behavior” in relation to Public Affairs’
financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
