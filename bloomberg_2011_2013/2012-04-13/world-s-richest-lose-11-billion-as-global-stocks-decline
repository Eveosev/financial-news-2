The 20 wealthiest people on Earth
lost a combined $10.7 billion this week as  Europe ’s debt turmoil
and concerns over the pace of economic growth in China and the
U.S. sent stocks lower worldwide.  Amancio Ortega , the Spanish retail tycoon, saw his fortune
fall by $1.38 billion as shares of his Industria de Diseno
Textil SA, owner of the Zara fashion chain, tumbled 4 percent.
That drove his estimated net worth down to $38 billion, which
places the 76-year-old as the world’s sixth-richest man,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “It’s hard to find any market that came through
unscathed,” said Geoffrey Pazzanese, who helps manage $800
million in stocks at Federated Investors Inc. in New York.
“Should they be worried about their billions? No. Maybe there
are some good opportunities for them to put their money to
work.”  Global markets dropped this week as the cost of insuring
against a Spanish default reached a record high, U.S. consumer
confidence weakened and  China  posted slower-than-forecast
economic growth. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell by 2
percent, ending the week at 1,370.26.  Carlos Slim’s fortune declined by $1.62 billion during the
week as the American depositary receipts of his telecom
operator, America Movil SAB, dropped by 0.7 percent. The Mexican
investor, 72, remains the wealthiest individual on the planet.  Gates, Buffett  Microsoft Corp. co-founder  Bill Gates , 56, saw his net
worth fall by $1.17 billion to end the week at $62.1 billion. He
holds second place on the index.  Warren Buffett , 81, is third
with $44.1 billion, after losing $1.07 billion this week. While
the world’s three richest people lost ground in the past week,
they have gained a combined $13.3 billion in 2012.  Brazilian Eike Batista, who ranks 10th on the index, lost
about $600 million after shares of his oil producer, OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, dropped for a fourth straight
week, sliding 4.4 percent. Batista, 55, has a net worth of $32.8
billion.  Sheldon Adelson, the 78-year-old chairman and chief
executive officer of  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , was among the few on
the index who got richer this week. He gained about $800 million
as shares of his  casino operator  climbed 3.4 percent. He trails
Batista with a fortune of $27.6 billion.  Li Ka-Shing , 83, the richest person in Hong Kong and 14th
in the world, lost some $300 million to $23.5 billion after
shares of his property developer Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd.
declined by 1.9 percent.  Bernard Arnault , who controls 46 percent of luxury-goods
maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, saw his fortune
decline by about $600 million, ending the week at $41.2 billion
and making the 63-year-old the world’s fifth-richest person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
