Stocks fell, giving U.S. equities
the longest slump since November and driving Spanish shares to
the lowest level since 2009, after  China  posted slower-than-
forecast economic growth and American consumer confidence
weakened. Commodities slid and Treasuries rose.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  lost 1.3 percent to
1,370.26 at 4 p.m.  New York  time, declining a second straight
week. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell 1.5 percent, completing a
four-week slump, as Spain’s IBEX 35 sank 3.6 percent to a three-
year low. The cost of insuring against a Spanish default rose to
a record. The  S&P GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 raw materials slid 0.7
percent as copper fell 2.5 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasuries
decreased six basis points to 1.99 percent.  China said gross domestic product increased 8.1 percent in
the first quarter, the smallest gain since 2009 and less than
the 8.4 percent median growth projection in a Bloomberg survey.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  fell
even after they beat profit estimates. Equities also retreated
after a gauge of U.S. consumer confidence fell.  “It’s a very fragile market,”  Mark Bronzo , who helps
manage about $125 billion at Guggenheim Investments in
Irvington, New York, said in a telephone interview. “You’re
seeing China slowing down. There’s concern that the worst is not
over in Europe. The U.S. economy has done a bit better. Yet the
question is: Is it sustainable?”  Weekly Slump  The  S&P 500  retreated 2 percent this week and has fallen
3.4 percent since reaching a four-year high on April 2. The
 Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  dropped 2.2 percent this week and posted the longest
stretch of weekly losses since August.  Benchmark stock indexes for  Spain , Italy, France, Germany,
Austria and Sweden declined at least 2 percent today, the most
among developed-market nations, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Spain’s IBEX 35 posted the biggest loss since Nov. 1.  The cost of insuring against a Spanish default reached a
record high as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy struggles to prevent
the nation from becoming the fourth euro-region member to need a
bailout. Credit-default swaps on Spain rose to 498, topping the
all-time high of 493 set Nov. 23 according to CMA.  JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, declined 3.6 percent even
after reporting first-quarter profit of $1.31 a share,  topping 
the average analyst estimate of $1.17 a share in a Bloomberg
survey. Mortgage revenue surged and trading almost doubled from
the fourth quarter.  Wells Fargo, Google  Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, retreated 3.5
percent. It beat the average analyst earnings projection by 2
cents, reporting profit of 75 cents a share.  Google lost 4.1 percent. First-quarter  profit , excluding
certain costs, was $10.08 a share. Analysts had projected $9.64
on average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Internet search
engine unveiled a plan yesterday that lets it issue new shares
without diluting the founders’ voting power.  Crude oil futures declined 0.8 percent to $102.83 a barrel
and copper futures slipped to $3.627 a pound. China is the
biggest buyer of the metal and largest energy consumer. Gold
futures retreated 1.2 percent, the most in a week, to $1,660.20
an ounce amid concern that the slowdown in China may curb demand
for the metal.  The 30-year Treasury bond yield dropped eight basis points
to 3.13 percent. The  Federal Reserve  purchased $1.8 billion of
Treasuries as part of a program to boost the  U.S. economy .  U.S. government debt is approaching the most expensive
