Bonds retreated after the Turkish
central bank reduced the minimum amount it lends for a week at
the lowest funding rate.  The bank cut the funds it will make available over the next
two weeks at 5.75 percent to 1 billion liras ($557 million) from
6 billion liras in the previous two weeks. The  yield  on two-year
benchmark debt increased for the first time in three days, up
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.40 percent,
taking the rise this week to eight basis points. The lira was
little changed at 1.7927 per dollar.  “This can be seen as a signal the central bank will
continue with additional tightening,” Tufan Comert, a
strategist at Garanti Investment in Istanbul, said in an e-
mailed note.  Turkey ’s central bank varies the rate at which it provides
liquidity on a daily basis, maintaining the borrowing cost
within a 5.75 percent to 11.5 percent interest-rate corridor it
introduced last year. It has refrained from lending at the
lowest rate since April 11, a day after the lira weakened to its
three-week low at 1.8177.  The bank today lent 7 billion liras at 10.8 percent against
bids for 13.9 billion liras.  The current-account deficit in Turkey is about 10 percent
of gross domestic product, the biggest among 60 major economies
tracked by the  International Monetary Fund  as a proportion of
GDP. The country’s inflation rate is 10.4 percent which is more
than twice the bank’s target for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
