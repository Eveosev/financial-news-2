A decision by Greece to give up the
euro would trigger a  chain reaction  that would force Spain and
Portugal out of the common currency, European Parliament
President  Martin Schulz  said in an interview with  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  in which he warned against such a step.  A failure of the euro would risk reversing European
economic integration as currency depreciations and appreciations
would prompt countries to set up trade barriers, Schulz said in
an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
