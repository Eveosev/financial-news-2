State-run  Alliance Bank (ASBN) , the first
Kazakh lender to default in 2009, had a $25 million gain on the
repurchase of $90 million of its bonds from the market last
year, according to  Renaissance Capital .  The bank’s ability to redeem its debt will become “less
comfortable” starting in 2014, Moscow-based Renaissance analyst
Mikhail Nikitin wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  told government and
central bank officials on April 10 to stabilize Alliance and  BTA
Bank (BTAS) , two of the defaulted lenders brought under state control
in 2009. Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund, Samruk-Kazyna,
holds the government’s 67 percent stake in Alliance and 80
percent in Temirbank after they were taken over in 2009. The
fund is discussing a merger of the two lenders, which issued new
bonds and offered shares and cash to creditors in 2010 after
writing off and extending payments on some debt.  “In the medium term, we think the risk of Alliance
defaulting again will remain a function of state involvement,”
Nikitin said. “However, we see no reason or incentive for
Kazakh financial authorities to make it another failure. On the
contrary, Alliance could be a counter example to the perceived
weakness of post-crisis governance in the Kazakh banking
sector.”  Calls to Alliance’s press office in Almaty after business
hours weren’t returned.  To contact the reporters on this story:
