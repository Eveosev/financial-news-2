Muse editors and writers hosted
lively lunches with three of the stars who shape the varied
worlds in which we live: Spanish conductor  Pablo Heras-Casado ,
the new chief of the Orchestra of St. Luke’s;  Terrie Sultan ,
director of Southampton,  Long Island ’s Parrish Art Museum (whose
new building by Herzog & de Meuron opens this fall in Water
Mill); and Edward O. Wilson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
biologist and contrarian author whose new book, “The Social
Conquest of Earth,” examines the mysteries of group evolution.  Attached are photos of our guests.  (Manuela Hoelterhoff is executive editor of Muse, the arts
and culture section of Bloomberg News. The opinions expressed
