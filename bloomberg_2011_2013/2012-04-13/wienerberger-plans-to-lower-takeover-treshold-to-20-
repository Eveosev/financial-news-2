Wienerberger AG (WIE) , the world’s
biggest brickmaker, is asking for shareholder approval to lower
the control barrier that requires an investor to make a
mandatory takeover to 20 percent from 30 percent, according to
the invitation for its annual general meeting on May 11.  “All of the company’s shares represent free float,” the
company said in  explanatory remarks  posted on its website today.
“If an investor holds 20 percent of  voting rights , it would be
possible to attain a relative voting majority in the annual
general meeting; this could create a situation where an investor
can exercise control over the company.”  The 30 percent threshold defined by Austrian law
“therefore appears to be too high to protect the justifiable
interests of the company’s shareholders,” the Vienna-based
company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
