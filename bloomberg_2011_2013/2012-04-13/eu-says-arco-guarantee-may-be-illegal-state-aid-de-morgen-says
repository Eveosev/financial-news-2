The European Commission said a
Belgian deposit-guarantee program for the cooperatives of  Dexia
SA (DEXB)  shareholder group Arco may be illegal state support,  De
Morgen  reported, referring to an April 4 letter from European
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia to the Belgian
government.  The guarantee program, which could cost the Belgian state
more than 1 billion euros, was “unfit, unnecessary and out of
proportion,” according to the commission, the Belgian newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
