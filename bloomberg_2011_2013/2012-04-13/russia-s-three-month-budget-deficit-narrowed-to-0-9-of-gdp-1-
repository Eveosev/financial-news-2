Russia  ran a  budget surplus  in
March, narrowing the three-month fiscal gap to 0.9 percent of
gross domestic product, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The cumulative  deficit  shrank to 121.3 billion rubles ($4.1
billion) in March, from a revised 199.7 billion rubles a month
earlier, the Moscow-based ministry  said  on its website today,
citing preliminary data.  Russia, which depends on energy exports for half of budget
revenues, may run a budget surplus this year, even after
spending pledges by President-elect Vladimir Putin’s that Fitch
Ratings estimates at $160 billion over his six-year term,
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said April 3. The economy grew
4.3 percent last year, the same pace as in 2010, as oil prices
surged. Higher energy revenue pushed the federal budget into a
surplus of 0.8 percent of economic output in 2011.  The average crude oil price needed to balance the budget
will drop from $117 a barrel this year to $113 next year and
$107 in 2014, the government estimates. The  budget deficit  is
predicted to narrow to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2014, from a
projected 1.5 percent shortfall this year. Next year’s budget
gap is forecast at 1.6 percent.  Urals crude oil, Russia’s chief export blend, has gained 13
percent to $119.63 a barrel in the three months through March
and traded at $117.28 today.  Revenue totaled 3 trillion rubles at the end of March, or
25.2 percent of the government’s target for the year, while
spending was 3.1 trillion rubles, or 24.4 percent of the goal,
according to the Finance Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
