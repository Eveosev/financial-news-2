India’s top court today accepted a
report from a panel recommending it lift a ban on some  iron ore 
mines in Karnataka, more than eight months after they were shut
for environmental breaches.  JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL)  shares gained.  The  Supreme Court  today asked the panel it had appointed to
suggest measures to restart the mines in the southern state,
according to an order by a three-judge panel headed by S.H.
Kapadia. Mining may take two months to restart after a verdict
is passed next week following the panel’s recommendations, the
court said.  Mining in the Bellary region was banned in July and the
Supreme Court extended the ban to two other iron ore-rich
regions in the state in August as it probed violations of
environmental norms. The court allowed state-run  NMDC Ltd. (NMDC)  to
mine 1 million tons of iron ore a month and ordered all sales to
be conducted through online auctions.  Restarting the iron ore mines will allow JSW, the nation’s
third-largest steelmaker, easier access to raw material to feed
its largest factory, based in the state. JSW cut production
because of poor quality iron ore and was operating the 10
million-metric-ton a year plant at less than 70 percent of
capacity, three people familiar with the development said on
March 30.  JSW  shares  rose 4.6 percent, the most in three weeks, to
739.85 rupees at the close in Mumbai. The benchmark Sensitive
Index fell 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
