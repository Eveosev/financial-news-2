A year ago, U.S. auto-safety
regulators closed a probe into unintended acceleration by  Toyota
Motor Corp. (TM)  vehicles, saying floor mats and sticky accelerator
pedals were to blame. Yesterday, regulators said all cars should
have safety features that address acceleration from electronic
malfunctions and other causes.  The  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ’s
proposed rule, requiring cars and light trucks sold in the U.S.
to have so-called brake override features, reflects continuing
concerns over the Toyota recalls of more than 10 million
vehicles worldwide.  Toyota blamed floor mats that could jam pedals and
accelerators that could stick in the down position and NHTSA
agreed. Still, some auto-safety advocates suspect electronics
faults in the Toyota incidents and the  National Academy of
Sciences  has said it couldn’t rule that out.  “When you eliminate human error, when you get rid of
mechanical flaws, you only have electronics left,” Center for
Auto Safety President Clarence Ditlow said in an interview. “At
that point, you only have to focus on that.”  Toyota’s 2009 and 2010 recalls followed the death of a
driver and his family members in a Lexus that he was unable to
stop. NHTSA investigated with  NASA , the U.S. space agency, and
said they found no electronics causes for the Toyota incidents.
A  National Academy of Sciences  panel said the auto safety agency
was justified in closing its probe, while saying electronic or
software glitches couldn’t be excluded.  Acceleration Problems  Several hundred lawsuits are pending against Toyota
alleging injuries or deaths were caused when vehicles
accelerated out of control. Most of the lawsuits are
consolidated for pretrial treatment in federal court in  Santa
Ana ,  California . Toyota also faces lawsuits by consumers who
claim that unintended acceleration problems lowered the value of
their cars.  More than 20 years after Audi sedan recalls for unintended
acceleration, safety advocates and investigators say it’s
impossible to rule out what the scientific panel has called
“untraceable faults” as more vehicle components - including
throttles - are electronically controlled.  “At the end of the day with all the money’s been spent
trying to identify electrical issues, you’d think they’d have
found something,”  Jeremy Anwyl , vice chairman of auto-
researcher  Edmunds.com , said in an interview. “But you can’t
say there isn’t something.”  ‘Best Practice’  U.S. regulators say the cost of the new rule would be
negligible because most automakers have added brake override
systems to vehicles produced since the Toyota recalls.  “This just codifies what seems to be the best practice in
automotive design,”  Brian Johnson , an analyst at  Barclays
Capital  based in  Chicago , said in an interview. “Having written
software back in college, it seems to be a pretty
straightforward fix. There wasn’t much pushback from the  auto
industry .”  Toyota, based in Toyota City,  Japan , pledged by February
2010, before U.S. congressional hearings into the recalls, that
the company would put brake override systems on all new models
beginning in 2011 and retrofit seven existing models with
software fixes.  “We are currently reviewing the NHTSA notice of proposed
rulemaking in detail but are proud that with the 2011 model
year, Toyota was the first full-line automaker to make brake
override systems standard across all model lines,”  Brian Lyons ,
a U.S.-based Toyota spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail.  Changes Questioned  Automakers have questioned other safety-related changes
that Congress and regulators have considered in the wake of
Toyota’s record recalls.  “Brake override continues to make sense because we agree
that in those rare situations where a throttle is open and the
driver doesn’t want it that way, they should be able to control
their cars with their brakes,” said Wade Newton, a spokesman
for the  Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , whose members
include Toyota. “Senate provisions requiring the agency to
initiate rulemakings on pedal placement and electronic systems
are highly unlikely to provide any legitimate safety benefits.”  A standard dictating where brake and accelerator pedals may
be placed relative to each other and standards addressing
vehicle electronics systems should be enacted to help address
potential unintended-acceleration causes, including driver
error, Ditlow said.  Data Recorders  The brake override rule follows a proposed rule issued in
December requiring keyless ignition designs that allow drivers
to shut off vehicles in motion.  NHTSA has said it plans this year to issue a rule that
passenger vehicles be equipped with event data recorders that
could tell investigators whether a driver reporting unintended
acceleration pressed the brake or opened the throttle before a
crash.  Ditlow’s  Washington-based group  helped enact a regulation
after unintended acceleration reports in the 1980s that requires
drivers to press the brake before shifting cars with automatic
transmissions into gear.  “If you eliminate the startup one, if you eliminate jammed
floor mats, if you eliminate pedal misapplication, then and then
only will you really know how many are electronic,” he said.
“After we have eliminated those, then the world at large will
have to concede that it really was electronics for x percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
