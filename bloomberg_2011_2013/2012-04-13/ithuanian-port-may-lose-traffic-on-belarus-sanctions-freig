Lithuania ’s port of Klaipeda may
 lose  14 percent of its traffic as a result of European Union
sanctions against Belarus, according to Eligijus Masiulis,
Lithuania’s transportation minister, Lietuvos Rytas reported.  Belarus transported 5 million metric tons of fertilizer
through Klaipeda last year, one seventh of the port’s total
cargo volume, and EU sanctions may force Belarus to divert
exports from Lithuania to  Russia  or the Black Sea, the newspaper
cited the minister as saying.  The EU widened its sanctions against Belarus in March,
banning more than 240 people from entering member-countries and
freezing the assets of 32 Belarus-based companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
