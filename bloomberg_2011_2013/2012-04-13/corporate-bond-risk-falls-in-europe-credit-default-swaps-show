The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate and bank debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 0.5
basis point to 639.5 as of 8:25 a.m. in London, according to BNP
Paribas SA prices. A decline signals improvement in perceptions
of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell one basis point to 235 and the
subordinated index declined two basis points to 383. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings was little changed at 134.25 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter and
