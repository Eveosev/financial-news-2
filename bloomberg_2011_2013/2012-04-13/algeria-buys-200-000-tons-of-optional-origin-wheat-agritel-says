Algeria bought 200,000 metric tons
of soft wheat for between $303 and $304 a ton on a cost-and-
freight basis, Agritel wrote on its website, without saying
where it got the information.  The wheat is of optional origin, according to the Paris-
based farm adviser. While French grain may be preferred,
Argentine wheat is competitive in price, Agritel wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
