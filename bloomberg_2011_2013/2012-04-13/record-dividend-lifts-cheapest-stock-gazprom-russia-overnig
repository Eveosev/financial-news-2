The prospect of a record dividend
payout is bolstering  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s biggest natural
gas producer and the cheapest Russian stock traded in the U.S.  State-controlled Gazprom climbed the most this month in New
York yesterday, as futures expiring in June on Moscow’s RTS
Index rose 0.6 percent to 158,020.  Russia ’s gas export monopoly
 traded  for 3.6 times estimated earnings on April 11, the least
since Feb. 1 and three times cheaper than the valuation for
American depositary receipts of  PetroChina Co. (PTR) ,  China ’s second-
largest oil refiner.  Gazprom’s ADRs sank 6.3 percent last month as the
government floated the prospect of boosting taxes on the gas
industry to pay for election promises made during President-
elect  Vladimir Putin ’s campaign. Management of the Moscow-based
company yesterday recommended doubling its 2011 dividend from
the previous year. The 8.97 ruble (30 cents) payout, the  most
ever  according to six years of data compiled by Bloomberg,
compares with an average 2.22 rubles between 2006 and 2011.  “This is a good sign that it has increased because Gazprom
has been paying nothing in dividends,” Hawk Sunshine, who
manages $300 million in assets, including Gazprom stock, at
brokerage IFC Metropol in Moscow, said by phone yesterday.
“Maybe this is a sign of things to come. It’s a small sign but
a noticeable signal of potential improvement.”  Gazprom’s ADRs gained 1.6 percent to $11.98 yesterday, the
most since March 30. The stock traded at a 0.2 percent premium
to the Moscow shares. Gazprom lost 0.1 percent to 175.91 rubles,
or $5.98, on the Micex index yesterday.  Gazprom Valuation  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of Russian companies
traded in the U.S. rose 1.4 percent to 105.51 yesterday, the
highest level since April 5. Gazprom, Russia’s biggest company,
is the cheapest stock on the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity measure,
with OAO Lukoil trading at 4.4 times estimated earnings and OAO
 Mechel (MTLR)  at 5.3 times.  Putin, who will take up his third term as president in May,
has pledged to increase  government spending  by as much as 4.8
trillion rubles, or 5 percent of economic output, through 2018,
according to estimates by London-based Capital Economics Ltd.  The new government should consider “drawing additional
revenue from the gas industry through the increase, and by
evening out, domestic prices and foreign prices,” Finance
Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters on Feb. 18. The Russian
government gets about 50 percent of revenue from the energy
sector and oil and gas make up around 17 percent of gross
domestic product.  Gazprom’s tax burden may increase by as much as $22 billion
a year over the next five years, analysts from  Alfa Bank ,
Russia’s biggest private lender, said in a report on March 19.  No Rally Ahead  While the prospect of a record dividend is “good news”
for Gazprom investors, it won’t translate into a rally for the
stock, according to Ronald Paul Smith, an oil and gas analyst at
Citigroup Inc. in Moscow.  “The stock will remain under pressure until we find out
what’s going on with the taxation side,” Smith said by phone
yesterday. “Until we have clarity on that, it’ll be difficult
for the stock to move up very much.”  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
climbed 3.4 percent to HK$5.77 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:19
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.8 percent
today as concerns eased over a rocket launch by  North Korea 
after the projectile broke up and fell into the sea.  Russia ETF Gains  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, rose for the second
day yesterday on speculation central banks will stimulate
economic growth with supportive monetary policies. Crude for May
delivery gained 0.9 percent to $103.64 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Brent oil for May settlement added 1.3
percent to $121.71 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, while Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend,
climbed 1 percent to $118.30.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, climbed 1.8 percent to $30.34. The  RTS
Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in the index
futures, lost 0.2 percent to 32 points in U.S. trading.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  the world’s sixth-largest wireless operator
by subscribers, climbed 1.4 percent to $10.75 in New York, the
biggest advance since March 28.  VimpelCom’s subsidiary, Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, North
Africa’s biggest mobile phone company, is disputing the $1.3
billion fine imposed by an Algerian court against its local unit
for allegedly violating foreign-exchange regulations and
submitted an arbitration notice against the North African
nation, according to a statement e-mailed yesterday.  RTS Advances  Algeria is in talks to buy a stake in the Djezzy unit from
VimpelCom, which merged with Orascom last year. It is still
discussing a purchase price for the 51 percent stake, Finance
Minister  Karim Djoudi  said in an interview on March 29.  Russia’s 30-stock Micex Index lost 0.3 percent to 1,501.63
in Moscow yesterday, while the RTS gauge advanced 0.3 percent to
1,620.19.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s largest mobile operator,
gained 2.5 percent to $18.30 in New York, the most since March
13. The company said yesterday its board recommended paying 72
percent of net income as dividends for last year.  MTS, as the company is known, said its board recommended
paying a total of 30.4 billion rubles ($1 billion) in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. It may pay 14.71 rubles a share or
$1.01 per American depositary receipt, the company said.  MTS’s shares on Russia’s Micex Index fell 0.3 percent to
230.55 rubles, or $7.83. The ADRs were at a 17 percent premium
over the company’s Moscow-listed shares, the most since April 5,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. One ADR is equal to two
ordinary shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
