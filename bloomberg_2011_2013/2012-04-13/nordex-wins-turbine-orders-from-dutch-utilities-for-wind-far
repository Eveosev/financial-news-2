Nordex SE (NDX1)  won four contracts to add
about 60 megawatts of turbines to a wind farm in the
Netherlands. No terms were disclosed.  The Dutch utilities Delta NV and Eneco NV as well as
developers Winvast BV and Scheldewind BV hired Hamburg-based
Nordex to repower the 13-megawatt Kreekraksluis farm with 29 of
its 2.5-megawatt machines starting in April 2013, the turbine
maker said today in a website  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
