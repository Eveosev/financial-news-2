European Union Energy Commissioner
 Guenther Oettinger  said he’s “hesitant” about subsidies for
nuclear energy, denying a report that regulators had received a
letter calling for support for atomic power.  The U.K.,  France , Poland and the  Czech Republic  urged the
EU in a letter to consider nuclear energy a low-emission form of
power generation that would allow it to be subsidized,
Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported today.  “I have not received any letter nor request of any member
state asking whether they can fund nuclear power with public
money,” Oettinger said in an e-mailed statement. “Nuclear
safety, not financing, has top priority for us.”  The U.K.’s Department of Energy and Climate Change isn’t
aware of the letter, an official said today, declining to be
identified in line with policy. Denmark, the holder of the EU
rotating presidency, received no such letter, Jakob Alvi, its
spokesman, said by phone today.  Germany , which plans to close
its nuclear stations by 2022, also received no letter, said
Stefan Rouenhoff, a spokesman for the economy ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
