Florida Judge Jessica Recksiedler
held a previously unscheduled status conference today in the
Trayvon Martin shooting case to reveal a possible conflict of
interest involving her husband and the lawyer who recommended
defense attorney Mark O’Mara to defendant George Zimmerman.  She asked for motions to be filed next week so she can
address them at an April 20 bond hearing, at which time O’Mara’s
office has said Zimmerman will seek release on his own
recognizance while he awaits trial on murder charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
