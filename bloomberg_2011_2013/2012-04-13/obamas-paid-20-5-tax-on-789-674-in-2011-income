(Corrects story published April 14 on Buffett rate claim
in first paragraph under “Secretary’s Rate” sub-headline.)  President  Barack Obama  and his
wife, Michelle, paid 20.5 percent in federal taxes on $789,674
in adjusted gross income for 2011, injecting his personal
finances into the political fight over  tax policy .  The Obamas reported earning less than half of the $1.7
million they made in 2010 and less than 20 percent of the $5.5
million they made in 2009, according to tax  returns  released
yesterday by the White House. Their tax rate declined from 26.3
percent in 2010 and 32.6 percent in 2009.  Obama, whose salary as president is $400,000 a year,
received most of the rest of his 2011 income from sales of his
books. His gross income from book sales declined to $487,928 for
2011 from more than $1.5 million the previous year.  As the April 17 tax-filing deadline nears, Obama has been
emphasizing his tax-fairness campaign theme and promoting a
proposal to impose a minimum tax on those earning $1 million or
more a year. That measure, known as the Buffett Rule, is
scheduled for a procedural vote in the Senate on April 16.  The administration put a Buffett Rule calculator on the
White House and campaign websites. With a few keystrokes, a
taxpayer can determine “how many millionaires pay a lower
effective  tax rate  than you.”  If the Buffett Rule were in effect, the Obamas wouldn’t be
subject to its provisions because they earned less than $1
million for 2011. They would be affected by other tax policies
the president is proposing.  Paying More Taxes  “Under the president’s own tax proposals, including the
expiration of the high-income tax cuts and limitations on the
value of tax preferences for high-income households, he would
pay more in taxes while ensuring we cut taxes for the middle
class and those trying to get in it,”  Jay Carney , the White
House press secretary, said in a  blog post .  The Obamas overpaid taxes during the year and requested
that their $24,515 refund be applied to their 2012 tax payment.
They donated $172,130 to charitable organizations, or 21.8
percent of their adjusted gross income.  The charitable donation figure is a lower dollar amount and
a greater percentage of their income than for 2011, and it’s a
big reason why their tax rate is lower than that of many
households with incomes in that range.  According to the nonpartisan  Tax Policy Center  in
Washington, households with cash income of between $500,000 and
$1 million in 2011 paid an  average of 23.7 percent  of their
adjusted gross incomes in federal income taxes.  Military Charity  The largest recipient of the Obamas’ donations was the
Fisher House Foundation, which provides lodging to relatives of
hospitalized members of the military and scholarships to
children of deceased and disabled soldiers. The Obamas gave
$117,130 to the organization in 2011.  In 2011 they donated $5,000 each to the Boys & Girls Club,
Habitat for Humanity, the United Negro College Fund and Sidwell
Friends School, which their daughters attend.  Unlike last year, the Obamas were subject to the
alternative minimum tax, the parallel tax system for high
earners. The AMT added $12,491 to their tax bill for 2011.  Steven Bankler, an accountant in  San Antonio ,  Texas , said
the president’s returns don’t show smart  money management 
because his investments are in low-yield U.S. government
securities and he is most likely paying interest on the mortgage
of his Chicago home at a higher rate than he is earning.  “He manages his money pathetically,” Bankler said. “He’s
got it backwards. This is a man that’s trying to tell us how to
make decisions on managing our money.”  Book Earnings  Bankler also questioned Obama’s decision to report his book
earnings as business income subject to self-employment payroll
taxes. He wouldn’t have to pay those taxes if he reported the
income as royalties.  More than half of Obama’s book sales occurred outside the
U.S., according to his foreign tax credit form.  Anthony Nitti, a tax partner at WithumSmith & Brown in
Aspen,  Colorado , said Obama appears to have taken a relatively
conservative approach to his  tax return .  “To me, his return looks like it’s been carefully
considered for public release,” he said.  Use of the White House doesn’t count as income under a
section of the  tax code  that allows the exclusion for people who
are provided meals and lodging for their employer’s convenience.
Presidents haven’t reported the personal use of government
resources tied to their security, such as Air Force One, as
income.  Secretary’s Rate  Obama pays a slightly higher tax rate than his secretary,
said  Amy Brundage , a White House spokeswoman. Anita J.
Breckenridge is paid $95,000 a year, according to a 2011 White
House report to Congress on staff salaries. Brundage declined to
provide details about Breckenridge’s tax rate or return. The
Buffett Rule is named for billionaire investor  Warren Buffett ,
who says he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary does.  Vice President Joseph Biden and his wife, Jill, reported
paying $87,900 in federal taxes for 2011 on $379,035 in adjusted
gross income for a 23.2 percent rate. The White House released
the Bidens’ tax  returns  yesterday.  Citizens “ought to be able to know that everyone one else
is paying their fair share as well,” Biden said April 12 at a
campaign event in Exeter,  New Hampshire .  “But the truth is you know they’re not,” he said. “The
truth is, when you pay those taxes, you know not everyone is
paying their fair share.”  The Bidens donated $5,540, or 1.5 percent of their adjusted
gross income, to charity in 2011.  Romney Estimate  Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney , a former
Massachusetts governor, released an estimated 2011 tax return
earlier this year. Yesterday, Romney requested an extension to
delay filing his final 2011 return for six months, spokeswoman
Andrea Saul said in an e-mail. She said he will file the return
before the Nov. 6 election.  Romney’s 2010 return was signed by his accountant on Oct.
15, 2011, indicating that he had received an extension of the
time to file. That’s common for taxpayers who receive income
from partnerships that can take months to provide information to
the partners.  The Obama campaign has called on Romney, a former private-
equity executive, to release more tax returns from prior years.  For 2010, Romney paid a 13.9 percent effective tax rate on
more than $21 million in income, largely because he receives
most of his income from  capital gains  and dividends taxed at
preferential rates capped at 15 percent.  Obama, by contrast, is subject to ordinary income tax rates
of as much as 35 percent on almost all of his income.  “You have two wealthy individuals, both in the top 1
percent, that have as disparate tax returns as humanly
possible,” Nitti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
