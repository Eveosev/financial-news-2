Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  awarded
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
$12.4 million in compensation for 2011, down 35 percent from a
year earlier, as the firm’s profit and stock fell.  Blankfein’s pay included a $3 million cash bonus, $7
million in restricted stock, $2 million in salary and $449,600
in other benefits, according to a  proxy statement  today from the
New York-based firm. Last year it granted him $19.1 million,
including $5.4 million in cash, $12.6 million in restricted
stock, a $600,000 salary and $464,100 in benefits for 2010.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, set
Blankfein’s compensation after  earnings  dropped 47 percent, the
 stock  tumbled 46 percent and the firm eliminated 2,400 jobs. His
pay compared with a $10.5 million package awarded to  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  Chairman and CEO  James Gorman , $15 million granted to
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  CEO Vikram Pandit and $23 million for  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chairman and CEO  Jamie Dimon .  “That decrease from the prior year is pretty consistent
with what we’ve seen in the industry,” said Joseph Sorrentino,
a managing director at Steven Hall & Partners, a compensation-
consulting firm in New York. “The tracking of the stock price
to the payout may not always line up, but it should over the
long term.”  ‘Engaged’ Shareholders  Goldman Sachs’s compensation committee, which decides how
much to pay top executives, has been led by James A. Johnson, a
former CEO of  Fannie Mae (FNMA) , as long as Goldman Sachs has been a
public company. At last year’s annual meeting, about 73 percent
of shareholders voted in support of the board’s executive
compensation decisions, down from 96 percent a year earlier.  “We engaged with many of our shareholders in advance of
and following our 2011 annual meeting of shareholders in order
to gain further insight and understanding into their views on
our executive-compensation program, particularly as expressed
through the advisory vote,” according to the proxy.  As a result, the board decided to cut each named executive
officer’s annual variable compensation by about 44 percent
“because of our decline in performance in 2011,” according to
the proxy.  While pay is up from 2008, when Blankfein, 57, and six
other senior officers were awarded no bonuses, it remains below
his record-setting $67.9 million compensation package for 2007.  Viniar, Cohn  The firm spent $258,700 on security for Blankfein last
year, or almost double the amount paid a year earlier. Goldman
Sachs, which said costs are justified by the “elevated threat
profile of the current environment,” was among Wall Street
firms targeted by Occupy Wall Street protests.  Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 56, President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 51, Vice Chairmen J.  Michael Evans , 54, and John S. Weinberg, 55, were each awarded
$11.85 million, plus benefits. The value of their benefits
ranged from $185,500 for Evans to $242,700 for Cohn, according
to the filing.  Like Blankfein, their awards included $3 million cash
bonuses and $7 million in restricted stock.  The firm disclosed in January 2011 that Blankfein’s salary
would increase to $2 million in 2011 from $600,000 previously
and that Cohn, Viniar, Evans and Weinberg get salaries of $1.85
million apiece. Each of them had received $600,000 salaries
since 1999, the year the firm became a public company.  SEC’s Method  Blankfein and 10 deputies reaped a total of $107.8 million
during 2011 from their investments in private equity and hedge
funds managed by the firm, according to the proxy. That compared
with $129.1 million paid out to Blankfein and eight deputies in
2010.  Blankfein’s payments, which included profits, any return of
capital and a share in the so-called overrides the firm receives
for managing the funds, totaled $22.2 million, down from $27.2
million in 2010, according to the proxy.  As of March 26, Blankfein owned 3.15 million shares in
Goldman Sachs, according to the proxy. That stock was worth $380
million based on yesterday’s closing price of $120.39. Cohn
owned 1.83 million shares, the proxy disclosed, worth $221
million at yesterday’s closing price.  Goldman Sachs slid $4.37, or 3.6 percent, to $116.02 at
1:15 p.m. in  New York .  Board Recommendations  The board has recommended investors vote against all three
shareholder proposals that are up for consideration at this
year’s annual meeting, according to the proxy. One calls on the
board to require each of the executives named in the proxy to
retain the shares they receive as compensation for at least
three years after they leave the firm.  The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that the
company’s proxy disclose how much compensation executives
received during the fiscal year. Under that methodology, which
includes awards received during 2011 for performance in prior
years, Blankfein received a total of $16.2 million in
compensation, up from $14.1 million in 2010.  The firm is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting at
9:30 a.m. on May 24 at its office in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey ,
according to the proxy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
