Chileâ€™s government will propose
legislation to cut income taxes for anyone who earns more than
500,000 pesos ($1,034) a month as part of a tax overhaul that
would benefit the middle class and raise corporate rates,
Santiago-based magazine Que Pasa  reported , citing an interview
with Finance Minister Felipe Larrain.  The  tax cut  would benefit more than 1.5 million people, the
magazine reported April 12 on its  website , adding that the
