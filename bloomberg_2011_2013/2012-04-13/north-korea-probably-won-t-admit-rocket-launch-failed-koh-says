Koh Yu Hwan, a professor of North
Korean Studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, comments on  North
Korea  after South Korea’s defense ministry said the North’s
rocket launch may have failed:  On rocket launch failure:  “Even though the launch has failed, it’s most likely the
North will tell its people it was a success. They’ve done it
before. The North will be under pressure because they did go
ahead with the launch even though they’ve been warned of the
consequences.”  On sanctions against North Korea:  “The big question now will be how strong sanctions against
the North will be. The North could use the nuclear development
as a card to find a way to bargain with the U.S. It’s most
likely China and  Russia  may try to minimize the scope of the
sanctions because they don’t want this situation escalating
further and would want to give Kim Jong Un another chance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
