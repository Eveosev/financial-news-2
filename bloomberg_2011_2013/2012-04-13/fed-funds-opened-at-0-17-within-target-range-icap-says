Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.10 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.10 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.
ICAP’s monthly average is 0.138 percent.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
February 2036 to February 2042 as part of the Fed’s program to
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs further and
counter rising risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to buy $1.5 billion to $2 billion of
securities today, according to the New York Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
