South Korea ’s  stocks  rose for the
first time in four days after the nation and  Japan  said  North
Korea ’s rocket launch this morning may have failed.  South Korea’s benchmark  Kospi index  gained 0.7 percent to
2,000.10 as of 9:30 a.m. Seoul time. North Korea fired the
rocket from its Sohae Satellite Launching Station at about 7:39
a.m. today, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok
said at a televised press briefing in Seoul. The launch appears
to have failed, South Korea and Japan said.  “Investors are just shrugging off this launch,” Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  fund manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion. “The news
came out before the market opened that the rocket launch failed,
so investors didn’t have to worry about it.”  The North has said the projectile was to carry a satellite
into orbit as part of celebrations marking the centennial of
state founder  Kim Il Sung , and was not a long-range missile test
in violation of United Nations sanctions.  South Korea’s central bank will closely monitor stocks,
bonds and currency markets following North Korea’s rocket
launch, Deputy Governor Park Won Shik said at an emergency
meeting in Seoul today. The Bank of Korea will organize a 24-
hour emergency team to monitor markets and will act to stabilize
markets if needed, Park said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
