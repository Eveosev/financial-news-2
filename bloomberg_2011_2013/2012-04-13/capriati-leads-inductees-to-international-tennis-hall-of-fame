Jennifer Capriati  leads a roster of
four players and one administrator who will be inducted into the
International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport,  Rhode Island , in
July.  Capriati, 36, held the No. 1 ranking on the WTA tour for 18
weeks; won a gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona and
three Grand Slam singles titles; and helped the U.S. team to the
Fed Cup championship in 2000.  Other members of the 2012 Hall of Fame class are Gustavo Kuerten of  Brazil , who held the No. 1 ranking on the men’s ATP
Tour and won the French Open three times; Manuel Orantes of
 Spain , the 1975 U.S. Open champion; administrator and promoter
Mike Davies; and wheelchair player Randy Snow, who will be
honored posthumously.  “This is a dream come true and an extraordinary tribute,”
Capriati said in a  statement.  “I truly feel humbled to be a
part of history and am honored to be considered among the
greatest of all time.”  Capriati, a New York City native who turned pro in 1990,
won 14 single titles including the Australian Open in 2001 and
2002 and the  French Open  in 2001.  She reached the French Open semifinals at the age of 14 in
her first year of professional tennis. Three years later, she
was arrested for shoplifting at a Florida mall, and for
marijuana possession a year after that. She spent more than a
week in drug rehabilitation in 1994.  Capriati, the 2001 Associated Press Female Athlete of the
Year, retired in 2004 with a career record of 430-176.  To contact the reporter on this story:
