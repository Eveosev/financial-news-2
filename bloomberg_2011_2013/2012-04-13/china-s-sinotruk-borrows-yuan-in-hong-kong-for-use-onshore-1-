Sinotruk (Hong Kong) Ltd. (3808)  signed a
1.8 billion yuan ($286 million) offshore loan in Hong Kong as
China expands its use of cross-border lending, spokesman Chi Lei
said.  The heavy truck manufacturer based in China’s northeast
Shandong Province will repatriate proceeds from the so-called
Dim Sum loan, Chi, the head of  investor relations  at the
company, said in a telephone interview today.  China is boosting use of its currency overseas and allowing
more companies to access yuan in Hong Kong. Financial
institutions in the city, restricted from buying mainland
assets, are prepared to lend the currency more cheaply than
their onshore counterparts, Chi said.  The southern city of Shenzhen passed measures yesterday to
allow cross-border yuan lending with Hong Kong, the official
Xinhua News Agency  reported today .  The Sinotruck loan is the largest amount of yuan to be
brought back to China as foreign direct investment this year in
the province of Shandong, according to a statement on the
company’s website.  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  (Hong Kong) arranged the loan, Chi said.
The facility will mature in two years and the“cost is lower
than the domestic bank lending rate,” according to the
statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
