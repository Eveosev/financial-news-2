Swiss banks will probably pay more
than the 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.2 billion) they have already
committed to paying  Germany  as part of a tax accord,  24 Heures 
reported, citing Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf.  Switzerland is trying to restart tax talks with Italy,
Widmer-Schlumpf said in an interview with the newspaper. While
there was contact with French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin 
over the winter, tax negotiations with France will have to wait
until after the presidential election, 24 Heures reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
