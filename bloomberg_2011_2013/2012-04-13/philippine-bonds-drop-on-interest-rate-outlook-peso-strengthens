Philippine bonds declined on
speculation the central bank will refrain from further interest-
rate cuts as a recovery in overseas sales improves the nation’s
growth outlook. The peso strengthened.  Exports (PHEXYOY)  increased at the fastest pace in 10 months in
February, with shipments abroad rising 14.6 percent from a year
earlier, a report showed yesterday. The  Philippines  will
consider keeping borrowing costs steady as high  oil prices 
threaten to spur cost pressures, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco signaled last month.  Consumer prices  rose 2.6 percent
in March from a year earlier, the least since 2009, official
data show.  “The market feels the rate cutting-cycle has stopped,”
said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president of financial
markets at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “There’s been some
selling, especially of the longer-dated debt.”  The yield on the 8 percent bonds due July 2031 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.08 percent as of
4:55 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.
The yield increased 11 basis points from April 4, with data
unavailable for April 5 and 6.  The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 42.655 per dollar,
taking its weekly advance to 0.3 percent, prices from Tullett
Prebon Plc showed. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged for a
seventh day at 5.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
