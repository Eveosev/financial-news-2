The Spanish government risks
breaching the legal limit for the deficit in electricity-system
revenues should demand fall short of its forecasts, the
country’s energy regulator said.  “There are elements of uncertainty during 2012 that could
lead to higher costs or lower revenues,” the Comision Nacional
de Energia said in an e-mailed statement today. Those include
“a declining trend in demand.”  Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria raised power prices by
7 percent and cut 1.7 billion euros ($2.2 billion) from revenue
this month for utilities including  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s
 Endesa SA (ELE)  unit and  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  after the  Supreme Court 
forced him to honor a law limiting the so-called tariff deficit
to 1.5 billion euros this year.  The government will adhere to the limits so long as
unpublished forecasts it supplied to the regulator prove
accurate, the CNE said.  The government forecasts the economy will contract by 1.7
percent this year, compared with a median forecast of 1.2
percent in a Bloomberg survey of 16 economists. Citigroup Inc.
predicted the biggest contraction at 2.7 percent.  Higher financing costs for tariff debt, or the government’s
failure to cover the cost of compensation payments, may also
jeopardize the limit, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
