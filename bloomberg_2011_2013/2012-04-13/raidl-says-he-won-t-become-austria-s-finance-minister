Claus Raidl, president of  Austria ’s
central bank and former chief executive officer of specialty
steelmaker Boehler-Uddeholm AG, said he won’t become the Alpine
republic’s finance minister, rejecting reports in two Austrian
newspapers.  “I said 10 years ago that I wasn’t the future hope of the
 People’s Party ,” Raidl, 69, told reporters in Vienna yesterday.  Kurier and Die Presse newspapers reported on April 11 that
the conservative People’s Party may replace Finance Minister
Maria Fekter with Raidl, citing unidentified people close to the
group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
