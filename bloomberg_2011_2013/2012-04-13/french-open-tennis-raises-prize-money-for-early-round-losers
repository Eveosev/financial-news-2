The  French Open  will pay its 2012
singles champions 1.25 million euros ($1.65 million) each in
prize money and targeted more cash at early round losers.  Total prize money for the clay-court tennis tournament
beginning May 27 in Paris will be 18.7 million euros, a 1.2
million-euro increase from the 2011 edition, organizer
Federation Francaise de Tennis said in a statement.  Players making an early exit at the second Grand Slam event
of the season will get more money this year, with losers in the
second qualifying round up to the third round of the main draw
getting a pay increase of between 10 and 20 percent. The singles
champions will receive a 4 percent rise in prize money.  Players on the men’s tour have been fighting for a greater
share of the revenue generated by the sport’s four biggest
tournaments.  John Isner  of the U.S., ranked 10th on the ATP 
World Tour, said at January’s Australian Open that players 
had a “legitimate beef” about the amount of prize money on 
offer at the majors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
