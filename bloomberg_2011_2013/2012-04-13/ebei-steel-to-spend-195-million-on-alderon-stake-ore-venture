Hebei Iron & Steel Group,  China ’s
biggest producer, will spend C$194 million ($195 million) to buy
a stake in  Alderon Iron Ore Corp. (ADV)  and invest in a venture with
the Canadian company as it seeks raw-material resources.  Hebei will buy 25.8 million shares of Vancouver-based
Alderon, or about 19.9 percent, for C$3.42 apiece in a private
sale, the Chinese company said today in a statement. Another
C$105.7 million will be invested in a venture to win the right
to acquire 25 percent of Alderon’s Kami project, Hebei said.  Chinese steelmakers, which import more than half of the
nation’s iron ore requirement, are scouring the globe for ore
and coal assets after a surge in raw material prices squeezed
profit margins to the smallest among all industries in the
country.  Hebei Steel (000709)  expects to obtain as much as 8 billion
metric tons of iron ore resources by 2015, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported in August.  The accord with Alderon was signed this morning, Hebei
Deputy General Manager Tian Zhiping said today by phone. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch is Hebei’s main adviser on the deal,
according to the statement.  Hebei Iron & Steel Co., the listed unit, gained 1 percent
to close at 3.02 yuan, beating a 0.4 percent gain in the
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. Alderon fell 1.7 percent to
close at C$3.44 yesterday in Toronto.  Hebei agreed to buy 60 percent of the annual output, or as
much as 4.8 million tons, of ore concentrate from the Kami
project after the mine starts operation, according to the
statement. The Kami project is located next to the mining towns
of Wabush, Labrador City and Fermont, according to the Alderon
website.  China in March pared the nation’s growth target to 7.5
percent this year from 8 percent in place since 2005, a signal
that the government is determined to cut reliance on exports and
 capital spending  in favor of consumption. The nation added about
10 new blast furnaces in the last six months, market researcher
Custeel.com said today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
