Matthew Hutcheson, an  Idaho 
independent fiduciary who advises companies on retirement plans
and has testified before Congress, pleaded not guilty to charges
he took more than $2 million from a fund of which he was
trustee, according to court records.  Hutcheson was indicted on 31 counts of wire fraud and
theft, according to the documents in federal court in Boise,
Idaho.  Testifying before Congress in October 2009, Hutcheson said
managers of U.S. 401(k) plans should adhere to “the highest
ideals of society.”  Hutcheson’s lawyer, Dennis Charney, didn’t immediately
return a telephone call seeking a comment on today’s plea.  The case is U.S. v. Hutcheson, 12-00093, U.S. District
Court, District of Idaho (Boise).  To contact the reporter on this story:
