Hunter Harrison, who is William Ackman’s pick to lead  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) , wants the
company to step up collaboration with  Canadian National Railway
Co. (CNR) , the Globe and Mail  reported .  Harrison, Canadian National’s former chief executive
officer, would like the companies to work together in some rail
corridors to cut bottlenecks and move goods more efficiently,
the Globe said. About 25 percent of Canadian Pacific’s network
overlaps with that of Canadian National, the newspaper said.  Canada’s two largest railways have discussed cooperation in
the past, but “there were a lot of things left on the table,”
the Globe cited Harrison as saying in an interview this week.  Ackman, the founder of New York-based Pershing Square
Capital Management LP, has put naming Harrison as CEO at the
center of his turnaround plan for the railroad.  To contact the reporter for this story:
