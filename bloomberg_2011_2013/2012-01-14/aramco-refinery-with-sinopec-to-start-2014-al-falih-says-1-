Khalid al-Falih, head of Saudi
Arabia’s state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., said a joint-venture
refinery with  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  will begin
production in 2014.  The Yasref plant will cost $8.5 billion to $10 billion, and
financing hasn’t been finalized yet, al-Falih said. The project
is the fourth venture between Saudi Aramco and Sinopec, as the
companies are called, al-Falih said. Saudi Aramco’s refining
capacity will reach 8 million barrels a day over the next
decade, with most additional capacity planned in  China , al-Falih
said.  The refinery, which will process 400,000 barrels of heavy
crude a day, will create 1,200 direct jobs and more than 5,000
indirect jobs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
