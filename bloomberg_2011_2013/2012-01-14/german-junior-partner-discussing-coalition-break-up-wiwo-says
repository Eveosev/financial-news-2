Germany ’s Free Democratic Party is
discussing whether to leave the federal government coalition,
 WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing a member of the party’s
executive committee.  The party is seeking to make a stand on a policy issue
which will bring voters to its side, and may do so the next time
Germany provides financial aid to  Greece , WiWo said.  Some FDP members of the Bundestag want to debate at the
party meeting on Tuesday whether the party would be better able
to win more than 5 percent of votes if it stayed in or left the
coalition, according to WiWo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
