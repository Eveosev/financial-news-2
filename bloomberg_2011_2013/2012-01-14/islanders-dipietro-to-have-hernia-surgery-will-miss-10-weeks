New York Islanders goaltender Rick
DiPietro will undergo hernia surgery that will sideline him 10
weeks, the National Hockey League team said in a statement.  DiPietro, 30, has been out since Dec. 3, first with a groin
strain and then with the hernia and knee swelling. The Islanders
didn’t say when the surgery would be performed.  DiPietro, the top pick in the 2000 NHL Draft, has a 3-2-3
record with a 3.73 goals-against average in 8 games this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
