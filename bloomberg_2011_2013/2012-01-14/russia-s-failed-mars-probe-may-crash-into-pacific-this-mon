Russia’s failed Mars probe may crash
into the  Pacific Ocean  off the coast of  Chile  on Jan. 15, the
space agency Roscosmos said.  Most of the fragments from the $163 million spacecraft will
drop to Earth on Jan. 15 at 9:51 p.m. Moscow time (5:51 p.m.
GMT), Roscosmos said in a  statement  on its website today. The
agency published a  new trajectory map  today showing the arc of
the probe as it re-entered the atmosphere. The $163 million
Phobos-Grunt, designed to return soil samples from Phobos, one
of two Martian moons, became stuck in low-earth orbit after its
Nov. 9 launch.  Some 20 to 30 fragments weighing no more than 200 kilograms
(441 pounds) will reach the earth’s surface, the space agency
said in December.  -- Editors: Andrew J. Barden, Inal Ersan  To contact the reporters on this story:
