Germany’s governing Christian
Democrats want solar energy parks and wind generators to be
built only where the  power grid  can support them,  Boersen-
Zeitung  reported, citing a paper written by party officials.  The party’s experts are pressing for the restriction to be
included in renewable energy legislation as Environment Minister
Norbert Roettgen prepares to enter talks with the solar
industry, Boersen-Zeitung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
