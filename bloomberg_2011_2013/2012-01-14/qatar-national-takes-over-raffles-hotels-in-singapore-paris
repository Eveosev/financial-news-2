Qatar National Hotels Co. said it
has taken over the  Raffles Hotel Singapore  and Le Royal Monceau
Raffles hotel in Paris, without disclosing how much it paid.  “Adding these iconic properties to our portfolio
represents consistent steps of QNH’s strategic expansion at the
international level,” Chief Executive Officer Hamad Abdulla Al
Mulla said in a  statement  posted on the company’s website.  Opened in 1887, the 103-suite Raffles Hotel Singapore was
designated a National Monument when it turned 100 years old, QNH
said in the statement. Le Royal Monceau opened in 1928. Toronto-
based Fairmont Raffles Hotels International is the previous
owner of both properties.  Qatar National owns hotels in Doha and Egypt and has
partnerships with companies including Ritz Carlton Hotel Co. and
Marriott International Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
