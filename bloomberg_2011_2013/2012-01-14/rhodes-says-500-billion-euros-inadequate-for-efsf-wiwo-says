Former  Citigroup Inc. (C)  Senior Vice
Chairman  William Rhodes  said that the 500 billion euros ($634
billion) made available via the European Financial Stability
Facility is inadequate,  Wirtschaftswoche  reported in a preview
of an article to be published on Monday, citing an interview.  Italy alone needs to refinance 307 billion euros this year,
and therefore more access to liquidity is needed, WiWo cited him
as saying.  Rhodes is confident that a solution will be found to ensure
the survival of the euro, according to WiWo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
