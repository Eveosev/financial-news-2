The Boston  Red Sox  signed outfielder
Ryan Sweeney to a one-year non-guaranteed contract to avoid
salary arbitration, General Manager  Ben Cherington  said.  Terms of the agreement werenâ€™t disclosed last night by the
Major League Baseball team.  Sweeney, 26, hit .265 with one home run and 25 runs batted
in during 108 games with the Oakland Athletics last season. He
owns a career .283 batting average with 14 home runs and 169
RBIs in 472 games over parts of six seasons with the Chicago
White Sox and Athletics.  Sweeney, a second-round selection of the White Sox in the
2003 First-Year Player Draft, was acquired by the Red Sox along
with pitcher Andrew Bailey in a December trade that sent
outfielder Josh Reddick and two minor league players to the
Athletics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
