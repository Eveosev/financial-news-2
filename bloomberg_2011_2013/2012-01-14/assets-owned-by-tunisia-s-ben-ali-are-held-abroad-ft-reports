Cash and investments controlled by
 Tunisia ’s former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, his family
and allies are still locked in 12 nations including the U.K.,
the U.S. and  France , the Financial Times reported.  Assets abroad are being pursued by a lawyer, while money in
Tunisia is in the hands of the judiciary, the state properties
ministry or the  finance ministry , with the government unsure yet
what to do with it, the newspaper said. Identifying and
recovering assets “takes a lot of time,” the FT cited Mustapha Kamel Nabli, the central bank’s governor, as saying.  Cash, equities and real estate owned by Ben Ali and people
close to him are estimated to be worth as much as billions of
dollars, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
