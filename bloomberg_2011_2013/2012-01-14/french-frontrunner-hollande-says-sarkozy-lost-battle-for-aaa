Francois Hollande , the frontrunner
in the this year’s French presidential election, said that
incumbent President  Nicolas Sarkozy  lost the “battle” to keep
France’s top AAA credit rating.  The downgrade by  Standard & Poor’s  reflects France’s gap
with  Germany , which kept its rating, and “also risks increasing
our borrowing costs for the coming year,” Hollande said today
at his Paris campaign office, according to remarks posted on his
website. “This battle -- I regret it -- has been lost.”  France and Austria yesterday lost their top credit ratings
in a string of downgrades that left Germany with the euro area’s
only stable AAA grade as S&P warned that crisis-fighting efforts
are still falling short.  Sarkozy has narrowed Hollande’s lead in polls leading up to
the April and May elections. According to a BVA institute poll
published this week in Le Parisien newspaper, Hollande would win
the second round of the ballot with 57 percent of votes. A
similar poll in December showed Hollande leading by 59 percent
to Sarkozy’s 41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
