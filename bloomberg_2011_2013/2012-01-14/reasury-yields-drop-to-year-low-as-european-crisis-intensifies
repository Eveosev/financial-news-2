Treasuries rose, pushing yields to
the lowest levels this year, as  France  was stripped of its top
credit rating and talks to restructure Greek’s debt stalled,
boosting demand for the safety of  U.S. government debt .  The yield on the benchmark  10-year  note touched the lowest
level since Dec. 20 yesterday and the Treasury drew record
demand at three- and 10-year note auctions this week. A model
created by economists at the Federal Reserve that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation indicates
10-year notes are the most overvalued on record.  “The story is still about mostly what’s going on in
Europe,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading
at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for
institutional investors. “You still have nervousness and that’s
bringing a good flight to quality trade here in the states.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield dropped nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point for the week, to 1.87 percent yesterday
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2
percent note due in November 2021 rose 27/32, or $8.44 per
$1,000 face amount, to 101 16/32. The yield dropped six basis
points yesterday.  The so-called term premium model reached a record negative
0.7 percent yesterday, compared with the average of positive
0.60 percent the past decade. The previous record was negative
0.67 percent reached Sept. 22. A negative reading indicates
investors are willing to accept yields below what’s considered
fair value.  Credit Ratings  Germany ,  Belgium ,  Estonia ,  Finland , Ireland, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands had their ratings affirmed by S&P as France lost
its AAA rating. France was cut to AA+ and the rating has a
negative outlook, S&P said in a statement.  Cyprus,  Italy ,  Portugal , and  Spain  were cut by two notches
S&P said. The long-term ratings on  Austria , Malta, Slovakia, and
Slovenia were cut one notch.  Volatility in the Treasury market is near its lowest level
in almost seven months. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE
index (MOVE) , which measure price swings in Treasuries based on prices
of over-the-counter options maturing in two to 30 years, dropped
to 77.1 basis points on Jan. 12, the lowest point since June 13.
The 2011 average was 94.14, with a high of 117.8 on Aug. 8 and a
low of 71.5 on May 31.  Treasury market  volumes  remain below average. About $268
billion of Treasuries changed hands yesterday through ICAP Plc,
the world’s largest interdealer broker, below the one-year
average of $282 billion.  Record-Setting Auctions  The U.S. sold $66 billion in Treasuries this week,
including $13 billion of 30-year bonds at lower-than-average
demand on Jan. 12 after record-setting auctions the prior two
days.  The $21 billion sale of 10-year notes Jan. 11 was sold at a
record low yield of 1.90 percent amid early speculation that
France may lose its top credit rating. The bid-to-cover ratio
was 3.29, versus an average of 3.11 for the past 10 auctions.  The government attracted record demand at its $32 billion
sale of three-year notes on Jan. 10. That auction’s bid-to-cover
ratio was 3.73, the highest since at least 1993, when the
government began releasing the data.  “It’s one of the only things left for people to buy if you
are afraid of Europe falling apart, so it’s putting tremendous
amount of bids into our market,” said  Thomas Roth , senior
Treasury trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA
Inc. “We’ve definitely benefited from that.”  Retail Sales  The week’s offerings of note and bond auctions raised $30.5
billion of new cash as $35.5 billion of maturing securities are
held by the public, according to Treasury Department data.  Yields dropped earlier this week after reports showing a
slowdown in retail sales and a rise in jobless claims renewed
concerns economic growth is stalling.  Sales at U.S. retailers in December rose 0.1 percent. The
gain followed a 0.4 percent advance in November that was more
than initially reported, Commerce Department figures showed Jan.
12. Economists forecast a 0.3 percent December rise, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Purchases
excluding automobiles fell 0.2 percent.  Jobless claims climbed by 24,000 to 399,000 in the week
ended Jan. 7, Labor Department figures showed the same day. The
median forecast of 46 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
projected 375,000.  “The numbers disappoint,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief
economist in New York at Mizuho Securities USA. “We’re not out
of the woods here yet. There’s no reason to be selling
Treasuries.”  Growth Forecasts  A report on Jan. 19 is forecast to show prices rose by 0.1
percent in December, after being unchanged the previous month.  Federal Reserve  Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker
yesterday said the  U.S. economy  will grow between 2 percent and
2.5 percent this year. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
this month predict the economy will expand 2.3 percent,
according to the median estimate. Fed officials estimated in
November that growth of 2.4 percent to 2.7 percent is needed to
absorb unused productive capacity.  The central bank  purchased  $6.9 billion in Treasuries due
from 2020 to 2041 this week and sold $17.48 billion of
securities maturing in 2012 and 2013. It also  purchased  $1.39
billion of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing from
2018 to 2041.  It will buy about $45 billion of Treasuries in January and
sell about $44 billion as part of a program, known by traders as
Operation Twist, to replace $400 billion of shorter maturities
in its holdings with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs.  German Yields  Treasury 10-year notes yielded 10 basis points more than
bunds yesterday after German yields dropped ahead of the
downgrades. U.S. 10-year securities yielded 53 basis points more
than bunds in January 2011. The yield on the 10-year bund
yesterday dropped to 1.74 percent, the lowest since Nov. 15.  Greece ’s creditor banks yesterday broke off talks after
failing to agree with the government about how much money
investors will lose by swapping their bonds, increasing the risk
of the euro-area’s first sovereign default.  “ Europe  is a structural situation, which will not be
resolving itself easily or in a short time frame,” said  Chris Ahrens , the Stamford, Connecticut-based head interest-rate
strategist at UBS AG, one of 21 primary dealers required to bid
in U.S. Treasury auctions. “We’ll be wrestling with this for
many months to come.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
