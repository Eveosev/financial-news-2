Israeli technology companies  will
benefit from the shekel’s worst performance in a decade when
reporting 2011 earnings this week, as the currency’s slide
reduced their local expenses.  Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP) ’s profit probably
rose last year as most of the Tel Aviv-based network-security
company’s sales are denominated in dollars and 35 percent of
operational expenses are in shekels, according to Wunderlich
Securities Inc. The shekel dropped 7.5 percent versus the dollar
last year, the worst performer among 11 Middle East currencies,
on concern uprisings in nearby Arab nations and the European
debt crisis will slow Israel’s economy.  “This is a situation that is unique to companies that have
a meaningful operation in Israel and pay wages, rent and other
expenses in shekels, while most of their sales are in dollars,”
 Daniel Meron , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets , said in an
interview from Tel Aviv on Jan. 12.  Israel’s benchmark TA-25 Index dropped 1.9 percent to
1,107.26 at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv today. It gained 1.4
percent last week. The  Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index  of the
largest Israeli companies traded in  New York  rose 1.1 percent to
89.25 last week, led by a 12 percent gain for  Tower
Semiconductor Ltd. (TSEM)  and a similar advance for  Magic Software
Enterprises Ltd. (MGIC)  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is
similar in size to Switzerland’s, has about 60 companies traded
on the  Nasdaq , the most of any country outside the U.S. after
 China .  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) ,  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  and
 ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (CKSW)  may also have seen a boost to
2011 earnings from the shekel as most of their operations are
based in Israel, Meron said.  ‘Expenses Tailwind’  Check Point, the world’s second-largest network-security
developer, dropped 0.9 percent to $50.90 last week. The company
will probably say that  profit  rose 23 percent to $2.85 cents a
share in 2011 when reporting earnings on Jan. 17, according to
the mean estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The security company’s profit surged almost 50 percent in
2001 when the shekel lost 8.1 percent versus the dollar, the
worst year since 1998.  The shekel’s weakness provides Check Point with an
“operational expenses tailwind,” Brian Freed, an analyst at
Wunderlich in Denver,  Colorado , wrote in an e-mailed report on
Jan. 13.  Allot, which develops Internet traffic monitoring
equipment,  climbed  1.5 percent last week to $16.01. The
company’s  Tel Aviv  shares dropped 4.4 percent to 60.23 shekels,
or the equivalent of $15.65, today.  The company is based in Hod Hasharon, Israel, where the
research and development for its products is managed. Allot will
probably  report  2011 earnings of 44 cents a share, more than
five times the 8 cents of profit in 2010.  Exports Climb  “Allot is our preferred play,” Meron said. “The company
benefits from strong demand for network traffic management.”  Israeli exports, which account for 40 percent of the
county’s gross domestic product, rose 0.8 percent to $3.8
billion in December, the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of
Statistics said on Jan. 12. Israel’s high-technology industry
accounts for 47 percent of manufactured exports, according to
the CBS.  ClickSoftware, a maker of order-tracking programs, advanced
6 percent last week to $10.30, the highest level since July 8.  EZchip, the Israeli maker of network processors, gained 3.7
percent to $30.38 after the company’s Tel Aviv shares added 2.9
percent to 114.30 shekels, or the equivalent of $29.69. The 67-
cent  premium  was the biggest among the dually-traded companies.
EZchip increased 0.7 percent to 115.10 shekels, or $29.92,
today.  The shekel weakened 0.4 percent to 3.8474 per dollar on
Jan. 13. The currency dropped to a 17-month low of 3.8355 on
Jan. 6.  Cheaper Hiring  The currency’s decline “lowers their local costs and makes
it cheaper for them in dollar terms to hire people,” said
Terence Klingman, the head of research at Meitav Brokerage in
Tel Aviv. “It also makes their exports more competitive,
meaning the companies can sell more worldwide.”  In a blow to European policy makers efforts to stymie the
effects of the euro zone’s debt crisis, France’s was downgraded
one level from the top credit rating at  Standard & Poor’s  on
Jan. 13, while Italy, Portugal, and Spain were reduced by two
levels. Austria also lost its AAA mantle.  “The policy initiatives taken by European policy makers in
recent weeks may be insufficient to fully address ongoing
systemic stresses in the euro zone,” according to the S&P
statement.  The Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index has climbed 6.3 percent
this year, beating TA-25 Index, which has gained 2 percent and
the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 4.1 percent advance over the same
period.  Teva, Mellanox  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  has led gains in 2012,
rising 10 percent to $44.55 after the world’s largest maker of
generic drugs said on Jan. 1 that Jeremy Levin, a former
executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., will replace the retiring
Shlomo Yanai as chief executive officer in May.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) , the Israeli adapter maker
partly owned by Redwood City, California-based Oracle Corp.,
dropped 1.2 percent to $33.28 on Jan. 13. Mellanox lost 4.2
percent to 126 shekels, or $32.75, in Tel Aviv today.  SAP AG (SAP) , the largest maker of business-management software,
reported fourth-quarter sales and profit on Jan. 13 that beat
analysts’ estimates, stepping up its rivalry with Oracle, which
reported earnings that missed estimates last week.  SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , the Airport City, Israel-
based maker of homemade soda machines, climbed 7.1 percent to
$39.96 on Jan. 13, the highest level since Sept. 21.  “Current business trends remain healthy, including the
company’s efforts to expand in the U.S., while Soda’s innovation
pipeline appears robust,”  Joseph Altobello , an analyst at
Oppenheimer & Co., wrote in an e-mailed report on Jan. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
