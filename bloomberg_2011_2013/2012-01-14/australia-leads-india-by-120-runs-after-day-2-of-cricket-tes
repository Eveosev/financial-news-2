Australia  leads India by 120 runs
after day two of the third cricket Test in Perth.  Opener David Warnerâ€™s 180 helped Australia take a 208-run
first-innings lead yesterday. The visitors then stumbled to 88-4
before stumps, leaving Australia needing six wickets to win the
series.  Mitchell Starc took 2-14 for Australia and dismissed  Sachin
Tendulkar , seeking his 100th international century, leg-before-
wicket for 8. Rahul Dravid is an unbeaten 32 for India, with
Virat Kohli 21 not out.  Australia won the first two Tests and would regain the
Border-Gavaskar Trophy contested by the teams by avoiding defeat
in either of the last two games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
