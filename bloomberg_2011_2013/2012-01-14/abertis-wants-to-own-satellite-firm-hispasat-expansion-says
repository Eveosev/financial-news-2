Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE)  wants to
take control of Hispasat after it sold its 16 percent stake in
 Eutelsat Communications (ETL)  SA, another satellite operator,
 Expansion  reported.  Abertis, which owns 33 percent of Hispasat, wants to start
talks with other shareholders with a view to taking control of
it, Expansion said, citing people close to the company that it
didn’t identify by name. Any change in Hispasat’s shareholding
structure would need the blessing of the government, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
