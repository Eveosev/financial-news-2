Ten  Kosovo  police officers were
injured and 18 protesters arrested on the border with Serbia
after an ethnic-Albanian group sought to block trucks from
Serbia entering the Balkan country.  The police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse
hundreds of members of the Self-Determination movement, which
blocked the road near a crossing point between Kosovo and
Serbia, police in the capital Pristina said in an e-mailed
statement today. The group led by Albin Kurti has called on
citizens to prevent all Serbian products entering the territory
of Kosovo at two border crossings.  Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, is attempting
to mend ties with its former ruler Serbia in talks under the
auspices of the European Union as the two nations both seek
closer relations with the 27-member block.  Serbia , the largest
of the former Yugoslav nations, failed to win EU candidate
status in December because of continued tensions with Kosovo.  The U.S. Embassy in Pristina advised its citizens to avoid
traveling through the affected border crossings because protests
“can become violent and unpredictable,” it said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
