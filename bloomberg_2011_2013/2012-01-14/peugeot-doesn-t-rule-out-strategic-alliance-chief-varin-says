PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Europe’s
second-largest carmaker, wouldn’t rule out a “strategic
alliance” as long as it keeps its independence, Chief Executive
Officer Philippe Varin wrote in a letter to the editor published
today by French weekly Investir.  Peugeot still considers partnerships “more interesting and
more effective” than alliances, Varin wrote. Peugeot had
studied a possible alliance with  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  with
“contacts” that weren’t pursued, Varin wrote, without
providing further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
