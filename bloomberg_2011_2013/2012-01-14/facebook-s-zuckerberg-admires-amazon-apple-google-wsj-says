Facebook Inc.’s co-founder and Chief
Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told the  Wall Street Journal 
that he admires  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  for focusing on its long-term
plan and accepting narrower margins in the near term.  Zuckerberg also likes  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  for the
quality of their products, he told the newspaper in an October
interview published today.  “Because we focused so much over the past five or six
years on building things that are going to have lasting value
for people, I think we have a good shot” at being placed in the
same category as those companies, he said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
