Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the U.K.’s largest
supermarket chain, said Chief Operating Officer Bob Robbins was
not in possession of price-sensitive information when he sold
50,000 shares before the company lowered its profit outlook.  Tesco, based in Cheshunt,  England , reported on Jan. 12
Christmas sales that missed analyst estimates and reined back
profit expectations after competitors’ promotions proved more
popular than its Big Price Drop campaign. The company announced
on Jan. 5 that Robbins sold the shares for 404.51 pence each,
valuing the sale at about 202,000 pounds ($309,000).  “Robbins sold less than 5 percent of his substantial
shareholding in Tesco for necessary family expenditure,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. “The sale, which
was not made within a close period, was approved in the usual
way. We are confident that Bob was not in possession of any
price-sensitive information at the time that the sale was
approved.”  Tesco  shares  closed at 316.8 pence in  London  yesterday
after the biggest weekly drop since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
