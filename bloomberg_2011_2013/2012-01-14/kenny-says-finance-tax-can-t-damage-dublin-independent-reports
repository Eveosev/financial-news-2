Ireland’s Prime Minister  Enda Kenny 
said he can’t accept a tax on financial transactions that would
give London an advantage over Dublin, the Irish Independent
reported.  “You could not have a situation where a financial
transaction tax resulted in a difference between what happens in
London and what happens here,” he said yesterday after a
meeting with U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  at Dublin Castle,
the newspaper reported today. “We’ve made it very clear that
would not be acceptable to us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
