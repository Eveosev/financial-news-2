German bonds gained this week, with
five-year and 30-year  yields  falling to records, as government
officials said  Standard & Poor’s  may lower the credit ratings of
some euro-area nations, spurring demand for the safest assets.  Italian  10-year bonds  rose for the first week in a month as
the nation’s borrowing costs fell at debt sales. S&P cut the
ratings of  France  and Austria in a string of downgrades after
the close of trading yesterday that left  Germany  with the euro
area’s only stable AAA grade. France’s 10-year  debt  rose this
week even after a European government official said the nation
was set to lose its top AAA rating in the S&P review. Finnish
and Dutch 10-year yields also fell to records.  “The downgrade rumors led to a clearer leg down in bund
yields and allowed new record lows,” said  John Davies , a fixed-
income strategist at WestLB AG in London. “There was general
relief earlier in the week after the Italian auctions went OK
because the market was a bit worried before them.”  Germany’s 30-year yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, this week to 2.35 percent, after dropping to a
euro-era record 2.332 percent yesterday. The 3.25 percent bond
maturing in July 2042 rose 2.24, or 22.40 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,267) face amount, to 119.375.  The 10-year yields fell nine basis points to 1.77 percent,
and five-year yields declined three basis points to 0.75 percent
after reaching a record low 0.733 percent yesterday.  France, Austria Downgrades  France and  Austria  were cut one level to AA+ from AAA and
face the risk of further reductions, S&P said late yesterday.
While Finland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg kept their AAA
ratings, they were put on negative watch.  Spain  and  Italy  were
also among the nine nations downgraded.  The French rating reduction threatens the potency of the
region’s main bailout fund, which owes its AAA label to
guarantees from the euro-region’s top-rated nations.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said on Jan.
12 his strategy of injecting cash into the financial system is
beginning to facilitate trading in seized-up credit markets.
While “substantial downside risks” remain, there were signs
conditions were stabilizing, he said after the central bank kept
its benchmark  interest rate  at 1 percent.  Spain’s  10-year yields  dropped 48 basis points this week to
5.22 percent. Similar-maturity Italian rates slid 49 basis
points to 6.64 percent after touching 6.46 percent, the lowest
since Dec. 21.  Italy Auction  Italy sold 3 billion euros of three-year notes yesterday at
an average yield of 4.83 percent, down from 5.62 percent at the
sale Dec. 29. Spain raised 9.98 billion euros from a note
auction on Jan. 12, twice the maximum target. The average yield
was 3.384 percent, down from 5.187 percent at the previous
offering on Dec. 1.  France and Spain plan to sell bonds and bills next week,
while Belgium and Portugal will auction bills.  Any rating downgrades would mean next week’s auctions are
“not going to be pretty,” Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed income
strategist at Rabobank International in  London , said before the
S&P announcement.  German  government bonds  are little changed this year, after
gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italian bonds have returned 1.7 percent in 2012, and
French bonds have gained 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
