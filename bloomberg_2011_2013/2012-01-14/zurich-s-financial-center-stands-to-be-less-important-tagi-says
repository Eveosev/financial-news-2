Zurich’s financial center stands to
become less important globally and is poised to shrink in 2012,
 Tages-Anzeiger  reported, citing a study by the BAK Basel
economic research institute.  The local industry is set to contract by 2.1 percent this
year, the newspaper said, citing Urs Mueller, head of BAK Basel.
Adverse conditions are weighing on asset management and
investment banking, which are particularly important for
financial companies in Zurich, it said.  The study predicted that the city’s financial industry will
employ 3,000 fewer people by 2020 and will barely expand,
according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
