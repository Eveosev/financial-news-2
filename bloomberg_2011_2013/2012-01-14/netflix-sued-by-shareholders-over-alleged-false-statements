Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the film-streaming and
mail-order DVD service, was sued by shareholders who accuse the
company of concealing increased costs it faced, which inflated
its share price as insiders sold their shares for
$90 million.  Netflix officers knew the company faced higher license fees
from its content providers before announcing on Sept. 15 that it
had lost 1 million subscribers after price increases, according
to the complaint filed today in federal court in  San Francisco .  “While Netflix stock was inflated partially by Netflix
buying back its own stock, company insiders were selling 388,661
shares of their own Netflix stock for proceeds of
$90.2 million,” according to the complaint.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos,  California , fell $39.46, or 19
percent, to $169.25 on Sept. 15 after cutting its U.S.
subscriber forecast following a price increase. The shares
plunged 35 percent, to $77.37, on Oct. 25 after the video-rental
service said it lost 800,000 U.S. subscribers in the third
quarter, more than expected, and predicted more cancellations
over a price increase.  Steve Swasey , a Netflix spokesman, said the company
declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is City of Royal Oak Retirement, 12-00225, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
