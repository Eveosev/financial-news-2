The founders of Camden Lock Market
and retail developer Milligan bought the 1-acre north London
market site for 30 million pounds ($46 million) to 40 million
pounds, the Financial Times reported.  The Urban Market Company vehicle is being financed by
Brockton Capital and plans to buy and develop other street
markets around the U.K., the newspaper said. Camden Lock,
founded 40 years ago, has a backlog of tenants waiting to take
up space, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
