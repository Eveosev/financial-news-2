Saudi Hollandi Bank (AAAL) , partly owned by
ABN Amro Holding NV, posted a 2.7 percent increase in fourth-
quarter profit, missing analysts’ estimates.  Net income  rose to 231 million riyals ($62 million) from
225 million riyals, the Riyadh-based lender said in a statement
to the  Saudi bourse  today. The  mean  estimate of five analysts
was for 265 million riyals while the median estimate was for 247
million riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Saudi Hollandi’s profit gained “because of a decrease in
operating expenses,” the bank said in the statement. Fourth-
quarter operating profit rose 4.1 percent to 504 million riyals.  The bank’s total loans rose 7.7 percent to 37.7 billion
riyals as of Dec. 31, while its customer deposits increased 8.2
percent to 45 billion riyals at the end of the year, it said.
Assets rose 6.8 percent to 57.5 billion riyals.  Full-year earnings per share were 3.12 riyals, compared
with 2.39 riyals a share a year earlier, according to the bank’s
statement.  Saudi Hollandi’s  shares  weakened 0.7 percent to 29.30
riyals before the earnings were announced, giving the bank a
market value of 9.7 billion riyals. The  stock  gained 1.4 percent
last year, its first yearly gain since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
