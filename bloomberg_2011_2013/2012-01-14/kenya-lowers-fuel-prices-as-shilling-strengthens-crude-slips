Kenya , the largest East African
economy, cut maximum prices of gasoline,  diesel fuel  and
kerosene for a second time on gains by the shilling and weaker
crude prices.  So-called super petrol, the most commonly used gasoline,
fell 6.7 percent to 111.95 shillings ($1.28) a liter (0.3
gallon) in the capital city of Nairobi after the shilling
strengthened against the dollar and crude prices declined in
December, the industry regulator said in an e-mailed statement.  The reduction is effective from tomorrow to Feb. 14, the
Energy Regulatory Commission said in its monthly review of fuel
costs. It also announced a cut on Dec. 14.  The price of diesel dropped 3.08 shillings a liter to a
maximum of 107.90 shillings, according to the commission.
Kerosene, used for cooking, declined 3.63 shillings a liter to
87.11 shillings, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
