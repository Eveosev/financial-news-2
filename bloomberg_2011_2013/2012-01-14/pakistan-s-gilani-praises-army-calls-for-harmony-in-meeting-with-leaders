Pakistan ’s Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  called on lawmakers to pass a resolution today
supporting his government, amid the worst tensions with the
military since the end of army rule in 2008.  Gilani’s resolution in the  National Assembly  asks lawmakers
to pledge “full confidence and trust” in the political
leadership and calls on all state institutions to “strictly
function within the limits imposed on them by the
constitution.”  The prime minister praised the military as a “pillar” of
the nation when he hosted a meeting of the Defence Committee of
the Cabinet, which includes army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and other military leaders, two days ago in the capital,
Islamabad, the government said in a statement.  Tensions between Gilani and the military have risen over a
Supreme Court investigation into a purported government memo
seeking help to prevent a possible military coup. While Gilani’s
government opposes the investigation, saying it already had
announced a parliamentary inquiry, the army supports the probe.  “Together, in complete harmony with each other and other
vital institutions, we can change this country’s destiny,”
Gilani told the committee on Jan. 14. “National unity is the
need of the hour.”  Gilani and President Asif Ali Zardari dismiss claims by a
Pakistani-American businessman that their ex-ambassador in
 Washington  sought intervention against a possible power grab by
an army angered at a raid deep into the country by the U.S.
forces who killed  Osama bin Laden  in May last year.  Violating Constitution  Gilani last week accused the army of violating the
constitution by sending statements on the purported memo to the
Supreme Court directly, rather than through civilian officials.  Kayani Jan. 11 warned of “grievous consequences” after
Gilani’s comments. Shortly after, Gilani fired the defense
secretary, a retired army lieutenant general.  Kayani met with Zardari late yesterday in Islamabad. They
discussed the current security situation, the president’s office
said in a statement, without giving any details.  Gilani’s ruling coalition asked for the emergency sitting
of parliament after the  Supreme Court  warned Jan. 10 that it may
charge the prime minister with contempt for his failure to
pursue corruption cases against Zardari.  ‘Democracy or Dictatorship’  “You have to decide whether this country should have
democracy or dictatorship,” Gilani said in the  National
Assembly  during a specially convened session on Jan. 13. “I
want to warn the opposition that if there is any stage being set
up, it’s not for us. We both will go.”  The challenges from both the army, which has ruled Pakistan
for more than 32 of the years since independence in 1947, and
the judiciary come amid the country’s worst-ever energy crisis.
Power shortages have shut factories and sparked violent street
protests in the biggest cities. The government cut its growth
forecast for the economy in the fiscal year ending June to 3.6
percent from 4.2 percent.  Gilani on Dec. 22 warned against a conspiracy to oust his
administration by a “state within a state,” a reference to the
army, and later denied rumors that he was aiming to remove top
generals. Former prime minister and now opposition leader  Nawaz Sharif  has said early elections are the only way to end the
current impasse.  Kayani has said repeatedly there will be no coup. “The
army will continue to support the democratic process in the
country,” he said in a Dec. 23 speech to troops reported on the
military press office’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
