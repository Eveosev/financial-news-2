Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  is
recalling 88,911 Mini Cooper cars because of a defect that has
caused fires, the U.S. auto-safety regulator said.  The  circuit board  on the electric auxiliary water pumps
that cool the cars’ turbochargers can malfunction, overheat and
cause fires, BMW said today in a posting on the  U.S. National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration ’s website.  In October, the agency opened an investigation into Minis
after reports of 12 engine fires, including five that destroyed
the vehicles. In eight cases, the fires happened when the cars
were parked and turned off.  The recall includes various Minis from the model years 2007
to 2011. BMW is based in Munich.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
