Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  may resign to spend more time with his sick wife, Epoca
said, citing unidentified people close to President Dilma Rousseff.  Mantega will step aside if the health of Eliane Berger
Mantega, who was recently diagnosed with cancer, worsens, the
magazine said. He could be replaced by deputy Finance Minister
Nelson Barbosa, Epoca said.  Mantega isn’t considering resigning, a media official at
the  Finance Ministry , who asked not to be identified in
