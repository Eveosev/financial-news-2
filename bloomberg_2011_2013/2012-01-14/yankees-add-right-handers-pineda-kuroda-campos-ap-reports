The  New York Yankees  will add right-
handers Michael Pineda and Hiroki Kuroda to their five-player
starting rotation, the Associated Press said, citing a person
familiar with the Major League Baseball deals.  The Yankees got Pineda and pitcher Jose Campos in a trade
with the  Seattle Mariners  in exchange for 22-year-old catcher
Jesus Montero and pitcher Hector Noesi, 24, AP said. The trades
will be completed after the playersâ€™ physicals.  Kuroda, 36, a free agent who pitched in Japan, agreed to a
$10 million one-year contract, the wire service reported. He was
13-16 with a 3.07 earned run average for the Los Angeles Dodgers
last season.  Pineda, 22, was 9-10 with a 3.74 ERA in 28 starts during
his rookie season with the Mariners. He and Kuroda join starters
CC Sabathia, Ivan Nova,  Phil Hughes , Freddy Garcia and A.J. Burnett. Campos, 19, is a minor-league pitcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
