European leaders are divided and
behind the curve in their response to the sovereign debt crisis
while the  European Central Bank  is playing a “constructive
role,”  Standard & Poor’s  said.  The policy response to the crisis “has not kept up” with
the risks, Frankfurt-based Moritz Kraemer, S&P’s managing
director of European sovereign ratings, said today in a
conference call. A Dec. 9 summit that agreed to pursue stricter
budget limits via a fiscal pact, the main thrust of policy
makers led by  Chancellor Angela Merkel , was no “breakthrough.”  S&P analysts, outlining the decision announced late
yesterday to downgrade the sovereign credit ratings of nine of
the euro area’s 17 members, said that the challenges posed by
the crisis are rising. “The risks in the euro zone remain firmly
tilted to the downside” in S&P’s forecast horizon of one-to-two
years, meaning more downgrades are possible, Kraemer said.  Europe ’s leaders are struggling to keep the euro region
intact as the debt crisis that emerged in Greece in late 2009
buffets Spain, Italy and  France . Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy are due to travel to Rome on Jan. 20 for debt-
crisis talks with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, even as
the threat of the euro area’s first sovereign default rises with
talks on a Greek debt swap stalled.  While policy makers have engaged in an “open and prolonged
dispute” over the appropriate course of action, the ECB has
been “using its flexibility” through its decisions to lower
 interest rates , aid banks and step up sovereign bond purchases,
he said.  “The ECB has in our view taken strong measures to avoid a
significant downturn of the crisis, has greatly alleviated the
funding crisis of the banks,” he said. “For the time being
they have had a constructive role that they played.”  Kraemer warned of a rising risk of “reform fatigue” among
the populations of those countries such as  Greece  and Italy that
are undergoing the “huge sacrifices that many of those austerity
programs demand.”  “There’s a lot of refinancing needs while all these
stresses are playing out,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
