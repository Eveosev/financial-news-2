A strike by business owners in
 Uganda ’s capital, Kampala, to protest an increase in commercial-
bank interest rates entered a fourth day after inconclusive
talks with President  Yoweri Museveni  on Jan. 12.  The strike, initially planned for three days, was
maintained for an additional day ahead of more talks with the
president today, Mubarak Ntale, the association’s deputy
spokesman said by telephone from Kampala.  “We found it fitting to first hear from the president
before we reopen our businesses,” Ntale said.  Business owners are protesting the increase in interest
rates on commercial-bank loans to as high as 35 percent from a
range of 17 percent to 23 percent in November, after the
increase following the increase in the central bank’s key
interest rate, according to the traders association.  Uganda’s central bank in November raised interest rates by
3 percentage points to a record 23 percent to curb inflation
that accelerated to an 18-year high in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
