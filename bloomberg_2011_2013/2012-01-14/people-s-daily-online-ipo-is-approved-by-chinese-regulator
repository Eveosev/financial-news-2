People.cn Co. was approved for an
initial public offering of stock in  Shanghai , the Chinese
regulator said.  The company, a unit of the People’s Daily, aims to sell 69
million shares, according to a previous filing. The approval
notice was posted yesterday on the website of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission.  People’s Daily, founded in 1948, is the official newspaper
of the ruling Communist Party and owns websites including
People.com.cn. The company plans to use proceeds from the
offering to fund a 527 million yuan ($83.5 million) program to
upgrade networks and content.  The offering comes more than a decade after online
companies  Sina Corp. (SINA)  and  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  went public in the U.S.  The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 21.68
percent in 2011. An IPO in Shenzhen by Longmaster Information &
Technology Co. failed after the number of bidders fell short of
the required 20 institutions, Shanghai Securities News reported
on Thursday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
