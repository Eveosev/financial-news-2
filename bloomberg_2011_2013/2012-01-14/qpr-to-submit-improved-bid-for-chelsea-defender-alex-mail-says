Queens Park Rangers will submit an
improved 3.5 million-pound ($5.4 million) bid for Chelsea
defender Alex, the  Daily Mail  said.  QPR had a 2 million-pound offer rejected two days ago and
the club hopes the Blues will accept the new bid, the Mail said.
Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas has said Alex can leave during
this month’s transfer period.  Alex has sought a return to his native Brazil and the fact
he lives close to QPR’s training ground and shares the same
agent as Rangers’ new manager  Mark Hughes  may tempt him to stay
in the Premier League, the Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
