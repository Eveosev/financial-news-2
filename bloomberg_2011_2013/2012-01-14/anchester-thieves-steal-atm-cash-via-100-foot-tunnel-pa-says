Thieves in Manchester dug a 100-foot
(30-meter) tunnel to raid a cash machine, stealing 6,000 pounds
($9,177), the Press Association reported.  The ‘mole gang,’ who attempted a similar theft in 2007,
spent six months digging the tunnel under a car park and fitted
it with lighting and roof supports, according to the report. The
theft happened between Jan. 2 and Jan. 3 at the Fallowfield
shopping precinct in Levenshulme, Manchester, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
