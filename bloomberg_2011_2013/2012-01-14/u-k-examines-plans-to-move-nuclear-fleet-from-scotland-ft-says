The U.K’s Ministry of Defense is
examining plans to move Britain’s nuclear fleet to  England  if
 Scotland  declares independence, the Financial Times reported.  A London government would demand billions of pounds in
compensation from Scotland to move missiles carried by four
Vanguard-class submarines that operate from Faslane, the
newspaper cited unidentified officials as saying. Plans to base
a fleet of seven Astute-class submarines at the location from
2017 would also be scrapped if Scotland, which is preparing for
an independence referendum, breaks from the U.K., the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
