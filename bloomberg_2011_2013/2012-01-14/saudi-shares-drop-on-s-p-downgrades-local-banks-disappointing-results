Saudi Arabian shares rose for a
third day, sending the benchmark index to its highest level in
almost six months, as investors weighed prospects for earnings.  Almarai Co. (ALMARAI) , the desert kingdom’s largest food producer,
climbed to a three-week high after saying it will increase its
capital.  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , the country’s second-largest phone
company by market value, also known as Mobily, reached its
highest price since October.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  strengthened 0.1 percent to
6,494.77, the highest level since July 24, by the 3:30 p.m.
close in  Riyadh . The 150-member  gauge  erased a drop of as much
as 0.3 percent.  “The market is slightly swinging between gains and losses
as investors form a full picture of the earnings season,” said
Turki Fadaak, head of research at Riyadh-based Albilad
Investment Co. That will continue until the earnings season ends
Jan. 20, he said.  Almarai gained 1.3 percent to 100.25 riyals, the highest
price since Dec. 24. The Riyadh-based company plans to issue one
bonus share for every 1.353 held to raise its capital to 4
billion riyals ($1.1 billion) from 2.3 billion riyals. Mobily
rose 0.9 percent to 54 riyals.  Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair & Co. , a clothing retailer, gained
2.7 percent, the most since Dec. 28, to 66 riyals after saying
profit in the quarter through December surged 126 percent to
76.5 million riyals on higher sales. The company also
recommended a nine-month dividend of 2 riyals a share.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
