The U.K. government is considering
changes that would scrap inflation protection for private-sector
workers’ pensions, the Financial Times reported, citing Pensions
Minister Steve Webb.  About 2 million members of defined benefit plans are
entitled to so-called limited prices increases that raise
pension income by at least 2.5 percent a year to protect against
inflation, the newspaper said. Cutting that protection may
reduce employers’ costs and help prevent generous defined
benefit plans from closing, the FT cited Webb as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
