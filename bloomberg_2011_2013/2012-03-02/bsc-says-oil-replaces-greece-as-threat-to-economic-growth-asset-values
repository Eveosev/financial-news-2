Soaring  oil prices  have displaced
Greece’s sovereign debt as a threat to global economic growth
and financial markets, HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank
by market value, said.  “With Greece disappearing, at least temporarily, from the
headlines, investors have quickly found a new source of anxiety
thanks to the recent surge in oil prices,” HSBC Chief Economist
Stephen King said in a note today. “If the trend persists, a
fragile economic recovery in the developed world could quickly
be derailed and inflation could return to emerging markets.”  Brent crude  surged to as much as $128.40 a barrel
yesterday, the highest since July 2008. Brent for April
settlement slipped 1.2 percent to $124.67 on the London-based
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at 12:48 p.m. today.  Equity investors should “take insurance” by becoming
overweight in energy stocks while foreign exchange investors
should favor the currencies of oil-producing nations such as
Norway, Malaysia, Brazil and Russia, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
