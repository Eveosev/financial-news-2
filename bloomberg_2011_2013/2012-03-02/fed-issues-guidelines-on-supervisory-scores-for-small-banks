The  Federal Reserve  issued guidance
aimed at ensuring the use of consistent standards by supervisors
and smaller banks to assess the banks’ regulatory ratings.  Bank examiners, as part of routine examinations, score
banks on criteria including capital adequacy, asset quality and
liquidity.  “Examiners should consider an upgrade of a banking
organization’s supervisory rating when there is a demonstrated
improvement in the organization’s financial condition and risk
management practices, and where improvement is likely to
continue,” the Fed said in a letter to officers in charge of
supervision at regional Fed banks.  “The Federal Reserve will evaluate the strength of core
financial components, overall risk management, and board of
directors’ oversight in assessing whether an upgrade is
warranted.”  The U.S. central bank said the guidance applies to all
institutions supervised by the Fed with total assets of $10
billion or less.  The Fed said the guidance was being issued to assure that
regulatory scores are upgraded “in a timely manner” when the
banks have made “requisite progress.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
