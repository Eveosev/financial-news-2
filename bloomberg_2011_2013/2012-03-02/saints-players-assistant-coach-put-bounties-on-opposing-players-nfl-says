New Orleans Saints players and an
assistant coach set up a bounty program to pay for injuring
opposing players, the  National Football League  said.  Between 22 and 27 Saints players were involved in the
program over the past three seasons, with up to $1,500 paid for
a specific hit on an opponent, the league said in a news
release. It said the findings resulted from an investigation by
the league’s security department.  The Saints’ players and coach weren’t identified.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
