Gold holdings in exchange-traded
products backed by the metal have topped reserves held by Italy
and  France , according to the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Assets rose 32 metric tons to a record 2,469 metric tons
last month,  Nick Moore  the head of commodity research at RBS in
London, said in a report dated today. The U.S. has the biggest
reserves, followed by Germany and the  International Monetary
Fund . As of Sept. 30, Italy’s holdings were 2,451.84 tons, and
France had 2,435.41 tons, World Gold Council data showed.  The RBS total for ETPs includes holdings in UBS Index
Solutions ETF and the Royal Canadian Mint’s gold-backed
securities. Assets excluding those funds were a record 2,404.17
tons as of yesterday, still trailing Italy and France, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold investments rose as surging energy costs spurred
concern that inflation will accelerate. Futures in  New York  have
advanced 9.1 percent in 2012. Last year, the price climbed 10
percent, the 11th straight annual gain, on demand for a haven
amid escalating U.S. and European debt.  On the Comex, gold futures for April delivery fell 0.7
percent to close at $1,709.80 an ounce. The metal jumped to a
record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
