Workers at  Argentina ’s grain ports
continued a strike over working hours for a second day, delaying
barges transporting corn and soybeans.  At least 10 more ships have joined the 57 that were
detained by the strike at ports near the city of Rosario on the
Parana River, which handle more than 80 percent of Argentina’s
grain exports, Guillermo Wade, a representative of the port
operators chamber, said in an e-mailed response today.  Talks between the workers union and the chamber failed
earlier today, prolonging the conflict that is disrupting
shipments from Argentina, the world’s third-largest soybean
exporter behind the U.S. and  Brazil . Argentina is also the
world’s second-largest corn exporter behind the U.S.  The strike has spread to smaller ports in the country,
including  Bahia Blanca  and Necochea, Wade said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
