JPMorgan Chase & Co. was sued by a
 Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG)  unit, which accused the bank of
making false statements in connection with the sale of $114.9
million in residential mortgage-backed securities.  Principal Life Insurance Co., a unit of the Des Moines,
Iowa-based  seller  of insurance and retirement products, accused
New York-based JPMorgan Chase of making “misrepresentations and
omissions” about the mortgage loans that were pooled together
into the securities, according to documents filed in New York
state  Supreme Court  yesterday.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
didn’t immediately respond to a telephone message left at her
office seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Principal Life Insurance Co. v.  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM) , 650615/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
