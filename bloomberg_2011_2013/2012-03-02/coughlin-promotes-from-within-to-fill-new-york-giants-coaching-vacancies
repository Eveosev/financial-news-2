Tom Coughlin  shuffled his staff to
fill vacancies at the Super Bowl champion  New York Giants .  Sean Ryan will switch to coaching quarterbacks from wide
receivers after Mike Sullivan left to become offensive
coordinator of the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Kevin Gilbride, who was
quality control coach, takes Ryan’s old position.  “Continuity is important,” Coughlin said in a statement
on the team’s website. “You would like to take people that are
in the system, that understand the system, understand how we
work, are very comfortable with the organizational scheme that
we use in preparation.”  Ryan and Gilbride were coaches for an offense that ranked
eighth in the  National Football League  last season. The Giants
scored 394 points, the ninth-highest total in the NFL.  “Our coaches do a great job of communicating among
themselves,” Coughlin said. “That was very critical to me.”  Coughlin is interviewing candidates for the position
vacated by Gilbride. He’s also seeking an assistant offensive
line coach to succeed Jack Bicknell Jr., who left to be the
Kansas City Chiefs line coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
