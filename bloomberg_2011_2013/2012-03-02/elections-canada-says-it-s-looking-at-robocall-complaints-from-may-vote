Elections Canada , which oversees
federal votes, said it is investigating complaints about
automated phone calls during the last election.  The agency, in a statement released today in Ottawa, said
it has received 31,000 “contacts” from voters and said it will
provide a report to Parliament in “due course.”  “Elections  Canada  is reviewing these and will take action
as appropriate,” it said in the statement, adding it has the
authority to call on law enforcement agencies for help.  The “robocall” issue has dominated the daily question
period this week in the country’s Parliament. Opposition
lawmakers have said that the governing Conservative Party was
behind automated calls that misled voters about the location of
polling stations in the May 2 election.  The opposition says the tactic prevented some of their
supporters from voting in the election that gave the
Conservatives a  majority  of seats in the nation’s House of
Commons after five years of minority rule.  Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said Feb. 29 that the
 Conservative Party  “absolutely, definitively” had no role in
the calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
