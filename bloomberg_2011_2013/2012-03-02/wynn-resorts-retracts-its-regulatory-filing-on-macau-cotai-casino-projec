Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  retracted a filing
suggesting the company completed a land concession contract on
its proposed resort and casino in the Cotai area of Macau,
 China . The shares advanced.  Wynn Resorts rose 4.3 percent to $127.27 at the close in
 New York , and is up 15 percent this year. Trading was halted at
10:18 a.m. New York time and resumed at 11:55 a.m.  The 8-K  filing  by Wynn, the Las Vegas-based operator of its
namesake and Encore casinos, incorrectly said a land concession
contract first reported in September was published in the
official Gazette of Macau last month, which would mark the
official start of the agreement.  “The filing was not authorized by the company,” Wynn said
in an amended statement. “The purpose of this filing is to
retract the Land Concession 8-K in its entirety.”  A clerk at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP
inadvertently made the filing, according to a statement from the
New York-based law firm, which apologized for the mistake.  Macau is the world’s largest gambling market, and the only
place in China where casinos are permitted. The Cotai area has
become the focus of recent expansion.  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  will
open its third casino-hotel on Cotai in April. Hong Kong tycoon
Francis Lui’s Galaxy Resorts opened there in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
