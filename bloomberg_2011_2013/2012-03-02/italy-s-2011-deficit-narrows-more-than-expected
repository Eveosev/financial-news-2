Italy’s  budget deficit  narrowed more
than economists forecast last year as spending cuts and tax
increases helped shore up public finances even with the economy
slipping into a recession.  The shortfall fell to 3.9 percent of  gross  domestic product
from 4.6 percent in 2010, Rome-based national statistics office
 Istat  said today. The 2011 reading was less than the 4 percent
median  forecast  of 6 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Economic growth last year slowed to 0.4 percent, topping a 0.3
percent forecast, from a revised 1.8 percent the previous year.  Italy entered its fourth recession since 2001 in the final
three months of last year under the weight of austerity measures
to fight the sovereign debt crisis. Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
is implementing a 20 billion-euro ($26.6 billion) package of
spending cuts and tax increases to eliminate the budget deficit
next year and reduce the nation’s 1.9 trillion-euro debt. Those
measures are weighing on growth, with the European Commission
forecasting on Feb. 23 that the Italian economy will contract
1.3 percent this year.  Even with the recession deepening, the government has
pledged to stick to the pledge to balance the budget in 2013.
The government’s debt last year rose to 120.1 percent, the
highest since 1996, from 118.7 percent in 2010, Istat said.  The governments led by Monti and his predecessor  Silvio
Berlusconi  last year approved more than 81 billion euros in
austerity measures to be implemented through 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
