Russiaâ€™s Foreign Ministry offered to
restore diplomatic relations with  Georgia  after the two
countries fought a five-day war in 2008,  Interfax  reported,
citing ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich.  Moscow may consider introducing a visa-free regime for
Georgian citizens in response to a decision by Tbilisi to
eliminate visas for Russians, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
