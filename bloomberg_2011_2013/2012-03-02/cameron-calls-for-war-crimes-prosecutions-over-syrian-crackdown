U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said Syrian government and military officials responsible for
violence against opposition protesters should be prosecuted for
 war crimes .  With little prospect of international military intervention
to stop the bloodshed in Syria, as happened in Libya last year,
and  Russia  and China blocking United Nations action, Cameron
urged Syrian officials loyal to President Bashar al-Assad to
switch sides.  “Make your choice: turn your back on this criminal regime
or face justice for the blood that’s on your hands,” Cameron
said at a news conference today in Brussels, where he attended a
summit of European Union leaders. “However long it might take,
the day of reckoning will come.”  The prime minister said that “the history of Homs,” the
city where much of the opposition to President Bashar Al-Assad’s
regime is focused, and which is currently under assault from
government forces, “is being written in the blood of its
citizens.” Homs is now a scene of “medieval barbarity,” he
said.  Cameron urged  China  and Russia to “think again about
supporting this criminal regime.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
