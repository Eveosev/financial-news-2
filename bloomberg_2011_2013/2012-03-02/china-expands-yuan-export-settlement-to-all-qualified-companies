China  expanded a trial of yuan
settlement for exports to all companies qualified for foreign
trade from a list of designated participants, the nation’s
central bank said on its website yesterday.  The change is aimed at promoting trade and the Chinese
currency’s cross-border use, the People’s Bank of China said,
citing a combined directive with the ministries of finance and
commerce, the customs and taxation bureaus and the China Banking
Regulatory Commission. A circular on the new policy attached to
the announcement is dated Feb. 3.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  is encouraging the wider use of the yuan
in international trade and investment to curb reliance on the
 U.S. dollar  while maintaining some controls on funds flowing in
and out of China. Officials have said they want to gradually
achieve the yuan’s full convertibility under the capital account
by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
