South African vehicle sales
increased at the slowest pace in nine months in February as
households curbed spending, the National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa  said.  Sales (NAAMTSYY)  rose 6.4 percent to 52,356 last month, the Pretoria-
based group said in an e-mailed statement today. Vehicle sales
expanded 7 percent in January.  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  cut his forecast for
economic growth in Africa’s biggest economy this year to 2.7
percent from 3.4 percent as a possible recession in Europe
reduces demand from a region that buys a third of South African
manufactured goods. The  Reserve Bank  has kept the benchmark
 repurchase rate  at 5.5 percent since November 2010, the lowest
level in more than 30 years, to help support spending.  “The outlook for 2012 in terms of total industry sales
remains one of modest growth,” the association said.  Passenger-car sales increased 6.8 percent to 36,357 in
February from a year earlier, according to the statement.  Vehicle exports fell 10 percent to 22,630 last month.
Exports will probably increase 10 percent to about 300,000 this
year, the association said.  “Vehicle exports into  Europe  are likely to soften as a
result of the recession and debt crisis in the euro zone,” the
association said. “This could be offset by higher export
volumes to African countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
