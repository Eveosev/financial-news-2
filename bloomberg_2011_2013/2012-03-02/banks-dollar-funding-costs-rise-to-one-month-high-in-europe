The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose for the second day to the highest in a
month, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 76 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:29 a.m. in
London, from minus 72 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That’s the highest cost since Jan. 31.  The one-year basis swap was 59 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 57 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, was 62 basis
points from 62.5 basis points yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday to a record 777 billion euros
($1 trillion), up from 475 billion euros on Feb. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
