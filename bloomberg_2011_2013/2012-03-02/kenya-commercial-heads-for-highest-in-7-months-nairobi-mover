Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the East
African nation’s third-biggest lender by market value, rose to a
seven-month high after full-year earnings surged, beating
analyst estimates.  The stock jumped as much as 6.1 percent and closed 3.7
percent higher at 21.25 shillings in Nairobi, the capital, the
most since Aug. 8. The volume was more than five times the
stock’s three-month trading average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Net income increased to 11 billion shillings ($132 million)
in the 12 months through December from 7.18 billion shillings a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based lender said in a statement e-
mailed by the city’s stock exchange yesterday. Net interest
income climbed 19 percent to 23.3 billion shillings.  “The bank showed an improvement in asset quality, good
growth in fees and commissions as transaction volumes came
through, reasonably contained costs and improved returns,”
 Renaissance Capital , a group whose interests include asset
management and  investment banking , said in an e-mailed note to
clients today.  KCB, as the lender is known, beat Renaissance’s earnings
estimate by 18 percent on reduced provisions for bad debt and a
lower-than-forecast  tax rate , according to the note. The target
price for the stock is 24.6 shillings, Renaissance said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
