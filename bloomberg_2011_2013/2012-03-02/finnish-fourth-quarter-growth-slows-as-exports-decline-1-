Finland’s economic growth slowed to
0.1 percent in the fourth quarter as  Europe ’s debt crisis hurt
exports.  Gross domestic product grew 1.4 percent on an annual basis,
Helsinki-based Statistics Finland said today. Third-quarter
growth was revised to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent.  Europe’s sovereign debt crisis has sapped demand for
exports from Finland, home to companies such as  Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) 
Shipments abroad make up about 40 percent of the northernmost
euro member’s economy and a third are sold in the single-
currency area, which the European Commission estimates may
shrink 0.3 percent this year.  Exports fell 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, while
imports rose 3.8 percent, the statistics agency said. Private
consumption grew 0.1 percent and investments rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
