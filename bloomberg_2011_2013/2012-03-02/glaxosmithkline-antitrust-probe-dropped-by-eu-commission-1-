The European Commission  said  it
ended an antitrust probe into  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  over possible
collusion to keep cheaper copies of medicines off the market
after a complaint against the company was withdrawn.  “The Commission examined whether there may have
been violation of EU competition law by GlaxoSmithKline,”
Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the regulator, said in an e-
mail. The case involving generic-drug producer Synthon BV
concerned “possible anticompetitive agreements or concerted
practices in order to delay or exclude generic competition,” he
said. Colombani declined to elaborate on Synthon’s role in the
probe.  The announcement comes a day after European Union
regulators  dropped  a similar probe into  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the
U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s
Nycomed unit over possible collusion to keep cheaper copies of
medicines off the market. That case was brought to a halt
because of a lack of evidence.  Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on how settlements between companies that make branded
medicines and generic-drug producers might harm consumers. The
EU opened a probe into  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and  Novartis AG (NOVN)  in
October and is also investigating Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. and its Cephalon Inc. unit over possible efforts to hinder
generic drugs.  Glaxo didn’t respond to a voicemail message and Synthon,
based in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, didn’t respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
