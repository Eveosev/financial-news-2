Hammerson Plc (HMSO)  agreed to sell a
building in Paris’s fashion district to Ramsbury AB for 165
million euros ($219 million).  The property at 54-60 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore has
8,000 square meters (86,000 square feet) of space, Hammerson
said in a statement today. Brands including Burberry, Moschino,
and Bally became tenants after a refurbishment, the London-based
company said. About half the building comprises luxury homes.  “This disposal crystallizes a substantial profit on cost,
further enhancing our financial flexibility to undertake
refurbishment, development and acquisition opportunities within
our retail portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer David Atkins
said in the statement.  Hammerson said the purchase price was slightly higher than
the appraised value in December. Ramsbury is a privately held
Swedish property company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
