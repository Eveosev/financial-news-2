Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the largest Czech oil
refiner, fell from its highest in more than three weeks after a
report showed January retail sales in Germany, the biggest buyer
of Czech exports, unexpectedly declined.  The stock slid 1.1 percent to 171.02 koruna by 1:37 p.m. in
Prague, making it the third-worst performer in the 14-member  PX (PX) 
equity index today. Unipetrol rose 2.4 percent yesterday to 173
koruna, the highest price since Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
