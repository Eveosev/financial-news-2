Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the third-largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, paid Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Miller  $11.9 million last year, a 23 percent increase from 2010,
according to a regulatory filing.  Miller’s pay consisted of $1 million in salary, $9.2
million in stock awards, $1.55 million cash bonus and $100,000
in dividends, the Miami-based company said today in the  filing .  Lennar reported net income of $92.2 million, or 49 cents a
share, for the 12 months ended Nov. 30, a second consecutive
year of profits at a time U.S. builders struggled to make money
while new-home sales fell to record lows. The company was co-
founded by Miller’s father, Leonard, in 1956.  A revised compensation plan for Miller and other Lennar
executives, to take effect this year and replace one in place
since 2007, is subject to shareholder approval at an April 11
annual meeting.  The statement was released after the close of regular U.S.
trading. Lennar fell 1.8 percent to $22.95 today in New York.
The shares have climbed 17 percent this year, compared with a 16
percent gain for the 11-member Standard & Poor’s 1500
Homebuilding  Index. (S15HOME)  The only larger U.S. homebuilders by revenue
are PulteGroup Inc. and D.R. Horton Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
