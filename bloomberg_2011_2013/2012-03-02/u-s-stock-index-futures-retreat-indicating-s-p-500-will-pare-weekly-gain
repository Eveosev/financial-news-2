U.S. stocks retreated, almost
erasing a weekly gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, amid
concern that a rally that drove the benchmark gauge to the
highest level since 2008 has outpaced global growth prospects.  Commodity and industrial shares had the biggest declines
among 10 groups in the S&P 500.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and
Caterpillar Inc. dropped at least 1.1 percent to pace losses
among the largest companies.  Big Lots Inc. (BIG)  slumped 4.1 percent
as sales missed analysts’ estimates. Yelp Inc., the site that
lets users review everything from diners to dentists, advanced
as much as 73 percent in its first day of trading.  The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent to 1,368.86 at 2 p.m. New York
time, trimming its weekly gain to 0.2 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  slid 27.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to
12,952.97. The Russell 2000 Index lost 1.3 percent to 804.40.
More than 3.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges.  “Some people may think that the market is a bit ahead of
itself after the rally in stocks,”  John Carey , a Boston-based
 money manager  at Pioneer Investments, said in a telephone
interview. His firm oversees about $220 billion. “There’s
concern about a potential slowdown as a result of  Europe ’s debt
crisis. People seem to have been more relaxed about the
situation in Europe, but when you look closely you see that the
underlying issues remain unresolved.”  The euro weakened as  Spain  raised its budget-deficit target
for 2012 and German retail sales unexpectedly declined. Spanish
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  announced a new deficit estimate of
5.8 percent of gross domestic product compared with the 4.4
percent target previously agreed with the European Union.  Best Start  The S&P 500 has risen 25 percent since its October low for
the best start to a year since  1991 (SPX)  amid better-than-estimated
earnings and economic data. Yet the index trades at about 14.1
times reported earnings, compared with the average since 1954 of
 16.4 times , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s a whole too far, too fast thing,” Rick Fier,
director of equity trading at Conifer Securities LLC in New
York, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees more than
$12 billion. “We don’t think that means it’s going to have a
huge pullback, but a consolidation would be a relief.”  Nine out of  10 groups  in the S&P 500 declined, led by
companies most-tied to the economy. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average, a proxy for economic growth, dropped 1 percent.
 Anadarko Petroleum  lost 4.1 percent to $82.29, pacing losses in
energy shares as oil fell the most since December.  Caterpillar (CAT) 
decreased 1.1 percent to $112.18.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  lost 1.1
percent to $18.98.  Big Lots  Big Lots slid 4.1 percent to $42.67 after reporting fourth-
quarter sales of $1.63 billion. On  average , analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg estimated $1.66 billion.  Travelers Cos. (TRV)  lost 1.1 percent to $57.79. The only insurer
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was downgraded to “equal
weight” at Morgan Stanley. That means the stock’s total return
is expected to be in line with the average for its industry
peers over the next 12 to 18 months. The previous rating was
“overweight.”  Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK)  slumped 13 percent to $6.01. The online
discount retailer reported fourth-quarter  sales  of $314.1
million, trailing the average estimate of $377.5 million from
two analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Yelp climbed 63 percent to $24.42. The San Francisco-based
company raised $107.3 million in the IPO, pricing the shares at
$15 each, according to a statement yesterday. The company
earlier offered them for $12 to $14.  Spinoff, Dividend  Sara Lee Corp. (SLE)  added 7.7 percent to $21.96. Its
international coffee company, which includes the Douwe Egberts,
Senseo and Moccona brands, filed for a  spinoff  under the name DE
International Holdings NV. After the separation, the coffee
company will declare a special $3 dividend.  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  jumped 6.3 percent to $129.69, as the
stock resumed trading following an hour-and-a-half halt. The Las
Vegas-based operator of its namesake and Encore casinos
retracted a regulatory filing that suggested the company had
completed a land concession contract on its proposed resort and
casino in the Cotai area of Macau.  Facebook Inc. hired Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group
AG and Citigroup Inc. to work on its $5 billion initial public
offering, bringing the total of banks on the deal to nine, said
a person with direct knowledge of the situation.  Facebook’s new and existing banks will grant the company an
additional credit line of more than $2.5 billion, said the same
person, who declined to be identified as the decision isn’t
public. The moves will be disclosed in a new  regulatory filing 
in a couple of weeks, said the person.  More Muted  Price swings in the  S&P 500  have become more muted this
year, making investors complacent about the outlook for stocks,
according to Canadian brokerage firm Brockhouse & Cooper Inc.  There have been no daily swings of 2 percent or more in
either direction this year, compared with more than 25
occurrences in the second half of 2011, when Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis triggered a drop in equities. The lower chart panel
tracks the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, known as the market’s “ fear gauge .”  “Volatility tends to come with negative surprises, and
it’s been quiet since December,” said  Pierre Lapointe , a
strategist at the Montreal-based brokerage. “But quiet periods
usually don’t last. There is a risk of complacency. This is a
low volatility environment and investors shouldn’t think this is
the new norm.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
