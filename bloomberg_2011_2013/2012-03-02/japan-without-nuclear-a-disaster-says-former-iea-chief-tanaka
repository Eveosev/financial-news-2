Japan ’s failure to resume its atomic
plants would be a “disaster” for the country because of its
limited alternatives, said  Nobuo Tanaka , the International
Energy Agency’s former executive director.  Japan’s diminished nuclear capacity makes it especially
vulnerable to the potential loss of crude supplies if Iran
disrupts shipments through the Strait of Hormuz, Tanaka said at
a conference in Tokyo today.  Every one of Japan’s 54 nuclear reactors may be shut by
late April for scheduled maintenance and safety tests following
the radioactive leak at  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant that followed the March 11 earthquake.  “The key issue is nuclear in the short term,” said Tanaka,
who is now an associate at the government-affiliated Institute
of Energy Economics. “This is a huge security risk.”  Tanaka said he has advised government officials to
integrate Japan’s electricity grid with  Russia ’s and South
Korea’s to increase the island nation’s diversity of power
sources.  Blackouts following the loss of the Fukushima nuclear plant
were a result of utilities’ over-reliance on a single power
source and their resistance to allowing competing generation
companies to access their grids, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
