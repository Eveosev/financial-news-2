     March 2 (Bloomberg) -- TransAlta Corp. (TA) ,  Canada ’s largest
publicly traded electricity producer, fell the most in more than
a month after reporting a 74 percent decline in fourth-quarter
profit.  TransAlta fell 1.5 percent to C$20.49 at the close in
Toronto, the lowest since Jan. 19.  Net income fell to C$24 million ($24.3 million), or 11
cents a share, from C$92 million, or 42 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period, Calgary-based TransAlta said in a statement
today.  Excluding a loss related to MF Global Holdings Ltd.’s
bankruptcy and other one-time items, profit was 11 cents below
the average of 9 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  TransAlta, Canada’s largest wind-power operator, is
preparing to phase out coal-burning plants in the coming
decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
