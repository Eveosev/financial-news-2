Edward Lampert , the hedge fund
manager who controls  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) , agreed to buy a
mansion on an island off  Florida ’s Biscayne Bay for almost $40
million, brokerage  One Sotheby’s International Realty Inc.  said.  The purchase of the 17,000-square-foot (1,600-square-meter)
estate, which sits on 2.7 acres (1.1 hectares) and wasn’t
publicly listed, probably will be completed in less than 30
days, Kevin Tomlinson, a Miami Beach, Florida-based vice
president at One Sotheby’s, said in a telephone interview. The
brokerage represented both buyer and seller.  Lampert, 49, is acquiring the seven-bedroom home from Paul L. Cejas, chairman and chief executive officer of PLC
Investments Inc., and his wife Trudy, Tomlinson said. The Indian
Creek Island mansion, which was rebuilt in the “last couple of
years,” has a reflection pool and a so-called arrival court, he
said.  Steve Lipin, a spokesman for Lampert, didn’t immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment.  Lampert is  ranked 117th  on the Forbes 400 Richest Americans
list, with a net worth of $3 billion as of September.  The Wall Street Journal reported the planned purchase
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
