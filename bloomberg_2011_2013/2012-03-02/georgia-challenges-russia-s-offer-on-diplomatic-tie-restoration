Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister
Sergi Kapanadze said  Russia  must remove its “illegal
embassies” from two occupied regions before Georgia will agree
to restoring diplomatic relations severed after a 2008 war.  Russia’s Foreign Ministry offered to restore diplomatic
relations with Georgia and may consider introducing a visa-free
regime for Georgian citizens in response to a decision by
Tbilisi to eliminate visas for Russians, according to Kapanadze.  “We welcome the visa-free travel, the Russian businesses
and tourists here,” Kapanadze said by phone from Tbilisi today.
“The diplomatic relations are still directly connected to our
territorial integrity.”  Russia routed Georgia’s army in a five-day war in August
2008 over the Georgian breakaway region of  South Ossetia , later
recognizing its independence as well as that of Abkhazia,
another separatist region.  Georgia  broke off diplomatic
relations with Russia on Sept. 2, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
