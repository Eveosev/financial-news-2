Solvay SA (SOLB) , which bought specialty
chemical maker Rhodia for $6.4 billion in 2011, will probably
look at its vinyls unit as Chief Executive Officer Jean-Pierre Clamadieu studies disposals,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  analysts said.  Special chemicals, energy services and parts of Solvay’s
polyamide business will also be under the spotlight in the
company’s review of its businesses, Peter Mackey, a London-based
analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research report.  Clamadieu, who is scheduled to outline his growth strategy
at an investors’ meeting on April 24, will probably need until
the end of 2012 to complete his assessment of all divisions of
Brussels-based Solvay and produce a blueprint for the company’s
future makeup, said Mackey, who has an “overweight”
 recommendation  on the company’s shares.  Erik de Leye, a spokesman for the company, declined to
comment.  The manufacturer’s founding family, which owns about 31
percent of the company, is “actively encouraging” Clamadieu to
reorganize, in contrast to the common perception that members
are acting as a barrier to change, Mackey said.  Clamadieu, the former CEO of Rhodia who took on the top job
at Solvay as the two companies merged, “was recruited
specifically to drive a refocusing of the Solvay group,” Mackey
said. The CEO has made it clear that there are “no sacred cows
in the portfolio” and that the added size of the enlarged
company makes it easier to consider making changes, according to
the analyst.  To contact the reporter on this story:
