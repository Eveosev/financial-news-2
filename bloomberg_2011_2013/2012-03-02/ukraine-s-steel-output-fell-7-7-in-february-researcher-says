Ukraine’s steel output declined by
7.7 percent in February to 2.46 million metric tons compared
with a year earlier, according to metal and mining researcher
PromZovnishEkspertyza.  Average daily steel output in the first two months of the
year declined by 6.1 percent from the same period last year,
Pavlo Perkonos, an analyst at the Kiev-based researcher, said in
e-mailed statement today.  “Ukrainian plants continue to adjust production of steel
to declining global demand,” Perkonos said in the statement.  ZAO Donetsky Electrometallurgical Plant cut output by 70
percent in February due to disrupted scrap metal supply, the
researcher said.  Azovstal (AZST) , part of Metinvest, Ukraine’s biggest
steelmaker, cut output by 29 percent in February, while
Metinvest’s Enakievsky Metalurgiyny Zavod increased production
by more than 80 percent, the researcher said without giving a
reason.  Steel exports from Ukraine declined in January by 11
percent to 1.14 million tons compared with the same month a year
ago, according to PromZovnishEkspertyza.  To contact the reporter on this story:
