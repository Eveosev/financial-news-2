Switzerland’s Beat Feuz took the
men’s  World Cup  skiing overall lead by tying for first in
today’s Super-G race, while Germany’s Viktoria Rebensburg moved
atop the women’s giant slalom standings.  Feuz and Austria’s Klaus Kroell both timed 1 minute, 32.35
seconds to share top honors in Kvitfjell, Norway. Kjetil Jansrud
of Norway was 0.03 seconds back in third as the top five were
separated by just 0.20 seconds.  The victory moves Feuz five points ahead of Austrian Marcel
Hirscher, who is not racing this weekend, in the overall
standings. Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal finished fifth to take a
two-point lead in the Super-G standings over Switzerland’s
Didier Cuche, who was fourth.  Rebensburg had a combined time of 2:33.30 in Ofterschwang,
Germany, to beat  Tina Maze  of Slovenia by 0.06 seconds. Irene
Curtoni of Italy finished third, 0.43 seconds behind.  “I didn’t have a good feeling in the second run, it was so
tough,” Rebensburg said in a televised post-race interview.
“I’m so, so happy now.”  Rebensburg’s second victory of the season moved her 44
points in the standings ahead of France’s Tessa Worley, who was
seventh.  Maze pulled within 474 points of American Lindsey Vonn in
the overall women’s standings. Vonn, who has already secured the
downhill and super-combined titles, was 10th today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
