Snow and rain in Novorossiysk on
 Russia ’s  Black Sea  prevented grain loadings to ships, prompting
a temporary halt in railway shipments to the area until March 5,
the port said.  Administrators of a grain terminal that belongs to the  OAO
Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (NMTP)  appealed to the North Caucasian
railway branch of  OAO Russian Railways (RZHD)  to restrict grain car
movement toward the port silos for the next two days, Mikhail Sidorov, the port’s deputy director general, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Russian Railways halted grain transportation to the
Novorossiysk port’s grain terminals through March 4, Interfax
reported earlier today, citing the rail monopoly’s telegram to
its branches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
