Guinness Asset Management Ltd., a
London-based investor, started a 10 million pound ($15.9
million) fund to invest in clean energy and energy efficiency
companies in the U.K.  The fund, which will close on April 5, will invest in about
five companies, Shane Galwey,  fund manager , said today by e-
mail. It will operate as an enterprise investment fund, which is
a U.K. government-backed system offering tax breaks to investors
in “higher-risk” companies.  “We expect many new investors to make EIS investments in
2012 as a means of diversifying their portfolios, generating
returns with low correlations to the equity markets and making
investments that have attractive tax benefits,” Galwey said in
an e-mailed statement.  Britain is aiming for 15 percent of its energy to come from
renewable sources by 2020. The U.K. currently generates about
1.3 percent of its electricity from hydropower,  according  to the
Department of Energy and Climate Change.  The fund has identified opportunities in the biomass and
hydropower sectors, according to the statement. “We are fond of
hydro projects, although we will only invest once all planning
and environmental consents are in place,” the fund manager
said. It will consider investments in other sectors that are
eligible for government subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
