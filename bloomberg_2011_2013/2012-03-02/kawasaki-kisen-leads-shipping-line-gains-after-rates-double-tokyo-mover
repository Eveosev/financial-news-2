Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  led gains
among shipping lines in  Tokyo trading  as container freight rates
on  Asia  to  Europe  routes more than doubled.  Kawasaki Kisen  jumped  as much as 6.4 percent, the biggest
intraday gain in two weeks, to 182 yen, before trading at 177
yen as of 10 a.m. local time. Rates for cargo between Asia and
Europe jumped 114 percent this week, according to estimates by
Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd.  Japanese shipping lines including Kawasaki, the nation’s
third-biggest carrier, are benefiting from higher rates after
trimming services and forming alliances to cut costs. A.P.
Moeller-Maersk A/S, owner of the world’s largest container line,
said Feb. 17 it will reduce Asia-Europe capacity by 9 percent
after a glut of vessels and slowing demand caused rates to
tumble.  “Sustained rate hikes through May should support share
prices in the near term,” Masaharu Hirokane, an analyst at
Nomura Securities Co., wrote in a note to clients dated today.
He rates Kawasaki Kisen shares “neutral,” and has “buy”
recommendations larger rivals Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and
 Nippon Yusen KK. (9101)   The World Container Index’s subcomponent for freight rates
on  Shanghai  to Rotterdam trade rose to $2,732 per 40-foot
container yesterday from $1,276 a week earlier, Drewry said by
e-mail. The index is developed by London-based Drewry and the
Cleartrade Exchange.  Nippon Yusen  rose as much as 3.8 percent and was trading
2.5 percent higher as of 10 a.m. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines gained as
much as 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
