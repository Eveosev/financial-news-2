Asian stocks rose, with  the regional
benchmark index  extending its longest weekly winning streak on
record, after better-than-expected global economic data overcame
concern the U.S. and China may not introduce further stimulus.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 27 percent of its
sales in the Americas, rose 3.2 percent in Tokyo.  China Overseas
Land & Investment Ltd. (688)  led mainland developers lower after home
prices declined.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong Kong-based
clothier that counts Europe as its biggest market, added 8.3
percent as concern eased over the debt crisis.  Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. (000660)  advanced 5.6 percent in Seoul after the
bankruptcy filing of rival  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , which tumbled 98
percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.2 percent to 128.22,
capping an 11-week advance, the longest such streak since its
inception in 1988. The measure entered a bull market on Feb. 29,
gaining more than 20 percent from an Oct. 5 low, after U.S.
economic optimism and monetary easing in Europe, Japan and  China 
fueled the fastest rally in more than two years.  “The bull-market signs are broadening amid resilience in
the  U.S. economy ,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based senior
strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages almost
$100 billion. “Investor sentiment has gone from extreme
pessimism to one of optimism. Europe didn’t turn out as bad as
the market was fearing because of the actions taken by the
European Central Bank.”  ECB Loans  Stocks have rallied all over the world after the ECB
offered unlimited three-year loans to euro-area financial
institutions at the end of last year and on Feb. 29. The two
operations have driven down borrowing costs and eased debt-
crisis concerns.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 12.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.9 percent advance by the
S&P 500 and a 9.3 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  The 14-day relative  strength index  for the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index rose to 68 on Feb. 29, nearing the 70 threshold
that may indicate the market has been overbought.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  added 1.3 percent this
week as the yen touched a nine-month low against the dollar. A
measure of the nation’s smaller stocks on Feb. 28 ended its
record streak of gains after advancing for 30 days. The nation’s
industrial production rose more than expected in January.  Factory Output  South Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index rose 0.7 percent after the
country’s factory output increased in January. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index
gained 0.7 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks
the larger of China’s stock exchanges, advanced 0.9 percent this
week.  Stocks climbed after reports showed the U.S. economy
expanded more than forecast, business activity accelerated and
consumer confidence rose. Initial filings for jobless benefits
fell to a four-year low.  Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) , which makes shoes for
Nike Inc., added 5.3 percent to HK$27. Canon rose 3.2 percent to
3,730 yen.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s biggest
exporter of consumer electronics, added 0.2 percent to 1.18
million won.  No Stimulus Signals  Gains were limited after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke on Feb. 29 gave no indication of more stimulus measures.
Shares in Hong Kong and Shanghai slipped after China’s
manufacturing improved for a third month in February, damping
expectations for relaxing policy.  “As the U.S. economy continues to recover and with China’s
manufacturing still expanding, there’s less likelihood of
further monetary easing,” said Castor Pang, head of research at
Core-Pacific Yamaichi International Ltd.  China Overseas Land & Investment slid 3.3 percent to
HK$15.86 as mainland home prices fell in February the most in 19
months, according to SouFun Holdings Ltd., operator of the
nation’s largest real estate website.  Country Garden Holdings Company Ltd. (2007)  fell after saying it
would sell shares at a discount. The developer slumped 7.2
percent to HK$3.33.  Exporters to Europe rose after Greece’s parliament ratified
a 3.2 billion-euro ($4.3 billion) package of spending cuts,
bringing the nation a step closer to securing a debt bailout.  Esprit rallied 8.3 percent to HK$19.26, and  Cosco Pacific
Ltd. (1199) , which operates container facilities at Greece’s Piraeus
port, added 2.4 percent to HK$11.86 in Hong Kong.  The chip industry was shaken this week after Elpida,
Japan’s only maker of computer memory, filed for Japan’s biggest
bankruptcy in two years. Hynix Semiconductor increased 5.6
percent to 30,450 won in Seoul. Powertech Technology Inc.
dropped 19 percent to NT$58.7. The circuit tester has NT$4.5
billion ($153 million) in accounts receivable with Elpida, which
plunged 98 percent to 5 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
