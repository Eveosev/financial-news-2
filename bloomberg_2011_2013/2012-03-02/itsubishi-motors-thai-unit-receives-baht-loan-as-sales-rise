Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) ’s Thailand
unit signed a 25 billion baht ($819.7 million) commitment line
to finance operations, the carmaker said in a statement today.  Bangkok Bank Pcl (BBL) , Siam Commercial Bank Pcl,  Krung Thai Bank
Pcl (KTB) , and  Kasikornbank Pcl (KBANK)  are providing the three-year facility,
Yuki Murata, a Tokyo-based spokesman at Mitsubishi Motors, said
by telephone today.  The funds will help the automaker more than double annual
output in the country to 460,000 vehicles in the fiscal year
ending March 2014, Murata said.  Thailand’s worst floods in almost 70 years disrupted
Southeast Asian production for several Japanese carmakers. Sales
of all automakers in Thailand dropped 0.8 percent to
794,081 units in 2011 as the weather hurt output, Toyota Motor
Corp.’s local unit said last month.  Mitsubishi Motors’ sales in January rose 34 percent from
December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
