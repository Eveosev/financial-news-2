Russian state-run bank VTB-24 said
it’s closing the accounts of Iranian diplomats in Moscow in a
move denounced by the Gulf state’s ambassador as a surrender to
U.S. sanctions.  VTB-24, the retail arm of  VTB Group (VTBR) ,  Russia ’s second-
largest lender, decided to terminate the approximately 30
accounts because half of them were idle, spokesman Artyom
Bochkaryov said by phone. “This is a purely economic decision,
there’s no politics here,” he said.  Iranian Ambassador Mahmoud-Reza Sajjadi said on his blog
today that the bank gave a few hours’ notice to the embassy
requiring all its diplomats to withdraw their money. He accused
VTB-24 of becoming “an instrument in the hands of others” and
warned that the U.S. wouldn’t show any gratitude. “The Iranian
Shah and (ousted Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak for 30 years
served American interests and in the end they threw them out
like unwanted rubbish,” he said.  The U.S. and the European Union have tightened financial
and energy sanctions against  Iran  in a bid to force the Islamic
Republic to curb its disputed nuclear program, which Western
countries say is a cover for an atomic weapons drive. Iran says
it is developing atomic technology for peaceful purposes. VTB is
expanding in  Europe , Asia, the  Middle East  and the Americas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
