(Corrects regional and central government deficit target in
first paragraph).  Spain  is targeting a deficit for its
regions of 1.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2012, Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro said in  Madrid  today. That compares
with a previous forecast of 1.3 percent.  The country set a spending limit at 118.6 billion euros
($157 billion), down 4.7 percent from last year, Montoro said.
The target for the 2012 central government budget deficit was
set at 4 percent, he said. The government also forecast that the
social security administration will have a balanced budget this
year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
