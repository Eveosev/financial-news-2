Soybeans headed for a third week of
gains as demand for U.S. supplies rose and drought threatened to
curb South American crops.  The May-delivery contract fell 0.4 percent to $13.1775 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:15 p.m. London time,
still set for a 2.4 percent advance this week. The most active-
contract rose 0.2 percent yesterday, the ninth straight gain and
the longest string of increases since July 15. The oilseed
reached $13.2425 on Feb. 29, the highest price since Sept. 21.  “Soybeans prices continue to be supported by crop concerns
in  South America  and strong U.S. export demand,” Kate Tang, an
analyst at London-based  Barclays Capital , said today in an e-
mailed report.  Exporters in the U.S., the world’s largest grower, sold
976,380 metric tons in the week ended Feb. 23, with  China , the
biggest consumer, buying 69 percent of the total, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said yesterday. Reduced South American
production will boost U.S. exports 22 percent to a record 42.2
million tons in the year that begins Sept. 1, the USDA said last
month.  U.S. exporters have already sold 28.9 million tons of
soybeans for delivery in the year ending Aug. 31, including the
5.5 million tons that had yet to be shipped as of Feb. 23, USDA
data showed. Fourteen of 22 traders and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expect soybean prices to rise next week. The oilseed
has gained 9.1 percent this year.  Corn traders and analysts are the most bullish in seven
weeks, with 14 of 22 surveyed also anticipating higher prices
next week. Corn rose 0.7 percent this year.  Corn for May delivery declined 0.5 percent to $6.5075 a
bushel, paring the weekly gain to 1.1 percent. Wheat for
delivery in the same month was down 0.4 percent at $6.615 a
bushel, still set for a 3.2 percent advance this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
