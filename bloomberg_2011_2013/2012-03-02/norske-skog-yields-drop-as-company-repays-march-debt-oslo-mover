Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG) ’s
benchmark five-year euro note rose as the second-largest maker
of newsprint repaid a maturing bond, giving it more than two
years reprieve until the next debt maturity.  The yield on the 7 percent 2017 senior unsecured note 
dropped 47 basis points to 17.79 percent as of 3:04 p.m. in
Oslo, the lowest since Feb. 16. The spread against the benchmark
euro curve narrowed 63 basis points to 16.9 percentage points,
the lowest level in almost two weeks.  Norske Skog is grappling with 7.9 billion kroner ($1.41
billion) in debt after three straight quarters of losses amid
too much supply in the newsprint market, competition from online
media and rising raw-material prices. Yields on the five-year
note reached 32.5 percent on Oct. 24 on concern the company
wouldn’t be able to repay the maturing debt.  The 1 billion-krone floating rate unsecured note was repaid
on maturity yesterday, Carsten Dybevig, spokesman for the
Lysaker, Norway-based company, said today by phone.  The company on Feb. 8 reported that  cash flow  rose almost
fourfold to 409 million kroner in the fourth quarter, helped by
rising newsprint prices and falling costs. Debt fell 3 percent
in the quarter to 7.86 billion kroner. The company has market
value of 1.1 billion kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
