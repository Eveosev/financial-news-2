Farmers in  Vietnam , the world’s
largest robusta coffee producer, have sold 50 percent to 55
percent of the 2011-12 crop, according to Volcafe, the coffee
unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Vietnam will produce a record 22.1 million bags in the
season started in October, up from 20 million bags in 2010-11,
the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader estimates. Robusta
prices jumped 11 percent this year as farmers in Vietnam
withheld beans, awaiting higher prices. They fell 14 percent
last year as traders anticipated a sizable crop in Vietnam. A
bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  The “Liffe uptrend makes farmers and local agents believe
in their coffee holding,” Volcafe said in a weekly report e-
mailed to clients today. “Physical coffee flow is not so
sizable as it was a month ago.”  Vietnamese beans for March and April shipment were trading
at a premium of $10 a metric ton to robusta prices on NSYE Liffe
in  London , data from the trader show. Last week the prices were
identical.  The harvest in  Indonesia , the world’s third-largest robusta
grower, will start “picking up” from the end of April or
beginning of May, Volcafe said, citing unidentified local
exporters. That represents a slight delay to initial estimates
of early April, the trader said.  Indonesian beans for March and April shipment were at a
premium of $90 a ton to the NYSE Liffe price, according to
Volcafe data. That compares to $100 last week.  Robusta coffee for May delivery slipped 0.3 percent to
$2,011 a ton by 3:13 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
