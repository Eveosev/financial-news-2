Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Hong Kong-
listed casino operator controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates as
Chinese tourists drove higher sales at Macau casinos.  Net income  rose 70 percent to $1.13 billion in the 12
months ended Dec. 31 from $666.5 million a year earlier, based
on international accounting standards, the casino operator said
in a statement today. That exceeded the $1.08 billion  average  of
13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company
announced the same earnings figure on Feb. 2 based on U.S.
accounting standards.  Chinese visitors have fueled growth in Macau, the only
place in the world’s most populous nation where gambling is
legal. Gambling in the former Portuguese colony climbed 42
percent last year to 268 billion patacas ($33.5 billion)
according to the city’s Gaming Inspection & Coordination Bureau.  Shares of Sands China rose 1 percent to HK$29.25 at close
in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.8 percent.  Sands China affirmed it will open the first phase of its
new resort on Macau’s increasingly popular Cotai Strip next
month, Chief Executive Officer Edward Tracy said today. It plans
to add 40 VIP gaming rooms or about 140 VIP gaming tables, as
well as 200 mass market gaming tables.  The second phase of Sands Cotai Central is expected to open
in October and the company plans to add 200 mass market gaming
tables by the third quarter this year, Tracy said. It will add
5,800 hotels rooms by the first quarter of 2013, he said. The
new casino will join its existing venues of the Venetian, Four
Seasons, Sands and Plaza Casino.  Earnings per share increased to 14.07 cents from 8.28 cents
in 2010. Sales for the year  rose  18 percent to $4.88 billion,
while casino revenue gained 16 percent to $4.2 billion.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
