The Georgian government’s proposal
of visa-free travel for Russians will boost energy investments
and tourism, Economy Minister Vera Kobalia said.  President Mikheil Saakashvili called for closer economic
ties between the two nations with an eye on increasing
investment from  Russia , which totaled $150 million last year,
mainly in energy projects, Kobalia said in an interview today in
Tbilisi, the capital.  “It’s a great idea and not only will it encourage more
Russian investments, but also allow businesses in Russia to
consider  Georgia ,” Kobalia said. “We are open to any
investments, regardless of politics.”  Georgia, which fought a five-day war with Russia in 2008,
has signed 42 agreements to develop hydropower projects as part
of a plan to attract $5 billion to reduce the Black Sea
country’s dependence on fossil fuels. As many as 12 hydropower
projects are already planned this year, First Deputy Energy
Minister Mariam Valishvili said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
