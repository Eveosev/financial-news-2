Hungary ’s earliest possible date to
adopt the euro is 2018, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said, as he
pledged to narrow the budget deficit and avoid the loss of
European Union subsidies.  Hungary, which has been struggling since the end of 2011 to
start talks on a bailout from the EU and the  International
Monetary Fund , faces the suspension of 495 million euros ($657
million) in EU development grants for exceeding the bloc’s
deficit limit, which also applies to euro candidates.  The European Commission expects Hungary’s shortfall to
reach 3.25 percent of gross domestic product next year, above
the bloc’s 3 percent limit. The government targets 2.2 percent,
down from 2.5 percent this year. Orban pledged to ensure that a
suspension of Hungary’s subsidies this month by EU finance
ministers “won’t make a difference.”  “Hungary won’t lose one penny,” Orban said in an
interview with state-run MR1  radio  today from Brussels. “The
whole matter is a technicality. Cutting Hungary’s  budget deficit 
by 0.25 percentage points is a simple exercise.”  A fiscal pact which most European leaders will sign in
Brussels today won’t fully apply to Hungary before 2018, the
earliest possible date for the country to adopt the euro, said
Orban, who last year said it was “unimaginable” for the
country to switch currencies before 2020.  “This can hardly be expected in the next few years,” he
said. “Even the most optimistic estimates don’t reckon Hungary
can be in a state suited for accession before 2018.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
