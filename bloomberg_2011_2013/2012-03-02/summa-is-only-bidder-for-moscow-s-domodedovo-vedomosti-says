  Summa Group, a Russian asset
management company and port operator owned by Ziyavudin
Magomedov, is the only bidder for Domodedovo Airport, the
largest in the country,  Vedomosti  reported today, citing people
it didn’t identify.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , which was hired by airport owner
for the tender, stopped accepting bids yesterday, the Moscow-
based newspaper said.  Investors who had expressed interest in Domodedovo,
including billionaires Victor Vekselberg,  Mikhail Fridman  and
Alisher Usmanov, didn’t submit bids, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
