Portugal is determined to meet the
terms of its bailout and return to bond markets next year, Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said after a European Union summit.  “I see no reason for us to drop the idea of being
successful in the execution of our program and return to markets
in September of 2013,” he said in Brussels today.  The EU (BKIR)  and
International Monetary Fund will step in to help if “external
factors” block the return to markets, he said.  The premier’s government is cutting spending and raising
taxes to meet the terms of the 78 billion-euro ($105 billion)
aid plan. Portugal should achieve its 2012 deficit target based
on current forecasts, the IMF said in a joint statement with the
European Commission and  European Central Bank  on Feb 28.  Asked if  Portugal  would seek a more flexible aid program
due to a bigger-than-expected recession in the southern European
country this year, Passos Coelho replied: “If we did that, all
our current sacrifices would be in vain.”  “The only way for us to get out of the current situation
is to correct the deficit,” said Passos Coelho.  Portugal narrowed the shortfall to about 4 percent of gross
domestic product in 2011 from 9.8 percent in 2010 after the
transfer of banks’ pension funds to the state. The government
has forecast a gap of 4.5 percent in 2012 and that it will reach
the EU ceiling of 3 percent in 2013.  The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to “stabilize” at 112
percent in 2013 after reaching 111 percent in 2012, the
commission forecast in November. Debt was 93.3 percent in 2010.  “We know that 2012 will be a very difficult year of
adjustment,” said Passos Coelho. “The government is committed
to carrying out all the reforms that will enable Portugal to
return to a growth trajectory in 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
