The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 12:42 p.m. in Buenos
Aires.  The  Merval (MERVAL)  Index rose 0.2 percent to 2,754.79.  Soc.  Comercial del Plata  SA (COME AF), an Argentine holding
company, advanced 2.1 percent to 0.79 pesos and earlier rose 6.5
percent, its fourth day of gains. The company said in a filing
yesterday to the Buenos Aires exchange that a prosecutor didn’t
file an appeal to a debt restructuring ruling before a deadline.
This will allow Comercial del Plata to move forward on its talks
with bondholders, Guillermo Maresco, a trader at Buenos Aires-
based brokerage Nacion Bursatil, said in a telephone interview.  YPF SA (YPFD)  , a unit of Spain’s  Repsol-YPF SA (REP) , fell 2.7
percent to 142 pesos. A nationalization of  Argentina ’s largest
energy company is unlikely and the company will probably
increase investments and decrease dividends, Banco Itau BBA SA
analysts Ricardo Cavanagh and Paula Kovarsky wrote in a note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
