In the later years of the 19th
century, Paris was a hive of spies. A network of German agents
was directed by Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, the military
attache; venal French citizens were caught selling sensitive
information to the enemy.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  To gather intelligence, the French used the “Statistical
Section,” where Martin-Joseph Brucker recruited menial workers
to spy on their employers.  Marie-Caudron Bastian cleaned the German Embassy every
day, and instead of burning all the papers in the waste baskets
as instructed, she sold them to the French.  At one point, an irate mistress discarded by Brucker
denounced him and Bastian as spies, but the Germans decided the
cleaning lady was too stupid for that role.  In August 1894, Bastian got 100 francs for her latest
delivery, a letter offering military secrets to Schwartzkoppen,
which could only have come from a French officer.  It was the note that brought about the false conviction for
treason of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a rich young Alsatian Jew,
creating a scandal that tore  France  apart.  I spoke with Piers Paul Read, author of “The Dreyfus
Affair,” on the following topics:  1. French Anti-Semitism  2. Catholic Army  3. Dreyfus on Devil’s Island  4. New Evidence Ignored  5. 1906 Exoneration  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
