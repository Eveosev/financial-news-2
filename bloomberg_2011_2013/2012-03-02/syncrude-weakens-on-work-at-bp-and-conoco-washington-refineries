The discount for Syncrude widened on
maintenance at refineries in Washington state owned by  BP Plc (BP/) 
and  ConocoPhillips. (COP)   BP said Feb. 29 it’s moving up maintenance at the 234,000-
barrel-a-day Cherry Point plant initially planned for later this
year because the crude unit is already shut for repairs after a
fire Feb. 17.  ConocoPhillips will shut process units a the Ferndale
refinery for work scheduled to begin March 15, two people
familiar with the maintenance said.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount to West Texas Intermediate futures
