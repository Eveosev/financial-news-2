South Korea ’s won rose to a 16-week
high and government bonds declined after exports increased in
February at the fastest pace in six months.  Overseas sales  climbed 22.7 percent from a year earlier,
after declining in January, and the  trade balance  swung to a
$2.2 billion surplus from a deficit, a report showed yesterday.
Inflation slowed to a 14-month low of 3.1 percent, according to
a separate report today. Overseas investors bought $3.9 billion
more Korean shares than they sold last month.  “South Korea’s trade surplus and cooling inflation,
despite oil-price spikes, are supporting investor sentiment,”
said Kim Doo Hyun, a Seoul-based senior currency dealer at  Korea
Exchange Bank. (004940)  “The figures also signal that previous factors
which contributed to a weakening of the won have eased.”  The won gained 0.3 percent from its Feb. 29 close to
1,115.61 per dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Local financial markets were closed yesterday for a
holiday. The currency strengthened 0.9 percent this week and
touched 1,112.05 today, the strongest since Nov. 9.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent debt due December
2014 climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, 3.49
percent today, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. It rose four
basis points this week. Three-year bond futures declined 0.08
percent this week to 104.14 and the one-year interest-rate swap
advanced three basis points to 3.53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
