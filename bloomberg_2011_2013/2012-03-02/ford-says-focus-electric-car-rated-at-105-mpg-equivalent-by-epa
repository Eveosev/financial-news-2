Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Focus electric car,
going on sale in the first half of 2012, was certified by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to offer the equivalent of
105 miles (169 kilometers) per gallon of gasoline, the automaker
said today.  The battery-powered compact car has an EPA rating of 99 mpg
equivalent in highway driving and 110 mpg equivalent in city
driving, Ford said in a statement. The EPA established the mpg
equivalent as a measure of the average distance traveled per
unit of energy consumed so car buyers can compare electric
vehicles and plug-in hybrids to conventional gasoline-powered
autos.  The Focus Electric tops Nissan Motor Co.’s battery-powered
Leaf, which is rated 99 mpg equivalent, and  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s
Chevrolet Volt plug-in, which is rated 94 mpg equivalent,
according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The EPA rated the
Focus Electric as having a driving range of 76 miles on a single
charge, while the Leaf has a 73-mile range, according to Ford.  The starting price for the Focus Electric is $39,995 and it
is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit, said  Wes Sherwood ,
a company spokesman. The Leaf starts at $35,200.  To contact the reporter on this story:
