A large proportion of Ukraine’s
spring grains will probably be seeded later than normal because
cold weather may continue longer than usual this year,
agricultural researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  The delay may mean that the grain harvest will decline this
year, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-mailed statement
today without elaborating.  Ukrainian farmers plant all of the spring corn and
sunflower, most of the barley and some of the wheat from the
second half of March into May. Between 3 million hectares and
3.5 million hectares (7.4 acres and 8.6 acres) of winter grains
will need to be reseeded after plants were weakened by the worst
drought in at least 50 years between September and December of
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
