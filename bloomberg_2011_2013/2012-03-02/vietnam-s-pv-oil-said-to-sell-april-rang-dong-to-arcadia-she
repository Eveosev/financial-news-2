 PV Oil Co.,  Vietnam ’s state-owned
oil-marketing company, sold as much as 450,000 barrels of Rang
Dong crude to Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
at premiums from $3.30 to $4 a barrel above benchmark prices,
said three traders who participate in the market, declining to
be identified because the information is confidential.  The cargoes sold for lower premiums than  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , known as Petrobras, agreed to earlier this month
for a long-term supply contract for Rang Dong. The Brazilian
company will pay from $5.30 to $5.50 a barrel for 10 cargoes,
200,000 barrels each, to be loaded during the six months from
April to September, according to two traders familiar with the
deal, which was signed Feb. 14.  Rang Dong is priced as a premium to the average assessments
of Indonesian benchmark Minas grade published by Platts and
APPI.  Details of the recent deal are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
