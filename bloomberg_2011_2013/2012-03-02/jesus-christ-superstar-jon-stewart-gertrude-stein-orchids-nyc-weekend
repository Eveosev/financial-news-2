It’s the show people love to hate:
the Whitney Museum has gathered 51 artists for its 76th
Biennial. Some are just ghastly, but that’s expected of course.
(See our review by Lance Esplund).  Others entertain. Look for the bright cartoonish paintings
of Nicole Eisenman, Sam Lewitt’s spinning spheres and  Werner Herzog ’s installation “Hearsay of the Soul.”  The second floor is devoted to film and video, while the
fourth floor has been transformed into a performance space for
dance, theater and experimental music.  Sarah Michelson and Michael Clark are in residence at
various times.  At Danny Meyer’s Untitled restaurant downstairs, have a
Bloody Mary and a pimento cheeseburger on pumpernickel.  “Whitney Biennial 2012” runs through May 27 at 945
Madison Ave. Information: +1-212-570-3600;  http://whitney.org .  Saturday Matinee  “Jesus Christ Superstar” dramatizes the arrival in
 Jerusalem , the dark night of the soul, the betrayal and
crucifixion -- all in a rock opera.  Written 40 years ago by  Andrew Lloyd Webber , with lyrics by
Tim Rice, the revival was directed by Des McAnuff (“Jersey
Boys”) for the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, where it was a
great hit.  In previews at the Neil Simon Theatre, 250 W. 52nd St. for
a March 22 opening. Information: +1-757-8646;

Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, affectionately known as Smoky
Mary, to hear Bach’s “Mass in B Minor” sung by the Dessoff
Choirs.  Conducted by Christopher Shepard, the group is accompanied
by period instrument specialists the Arcadia Players. Soloists

Orchid Show at the New York Botanical Garden.  Growing all over the world, orchids are an adaptable plant

patrons and collectors in Paris, buying up work by the Spanish
artist as well as Matisse, Cezanne, Degas, Gauguin, Manet and
others.  For “The Steins Collect,” the Met has put together 200
