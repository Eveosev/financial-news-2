Chile  needs to implement well-
designed and coherent macro-prudential policies as part of
“adjustments” to its financial oversight and regulatory
framework, central banker Enrique Marshall said.  The 2008 and 2009 global financial crisis made clear the
importance of establishing macro-prudential policies to preserve
financial stability, Marshall, who is one of the central bank’s
five board members, said in a presentation posted on the
institution’s website today.  Chilean regulations helped the Andean nation weather past
crises, even though it’s widely recognized that improvements
must be made, Marshall said.  Some “apprehensions” exist that Chilean regulatory tools
haven’t been tested to withstand extreme stress, he said. The
central bank has started to run stress tests on the banking
system that may extend to other industries such as  life
insurance , Marshall said.  “Chile’s central bank must play a leading role in the
implementation of macro-prudential policies,” he said. The bank
also “must gain a greater role in defining prudential
regulations, particularly in areas related to  capital
requirements  and provisions,” he said.  Marshall today is participating in a meeting of economists,
policy makers and officials from the  International Monetary Fund 
to analyze ways to protect Latin American financial systems. The
meeting is in Punta del Este, Uruguay.  Marshall’s comments don’t necessarily reflect those of the
bank, according to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
