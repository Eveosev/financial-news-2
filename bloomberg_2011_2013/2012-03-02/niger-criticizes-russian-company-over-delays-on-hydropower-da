Nigerien President  Mahamadou Issoufou  criticized  Russia ’s  Zarubezhvodstroy OJSC (ZVST)  for delaying
construction of a hydropower dam in the West African country.
The company said the project is on schedule.  Zarubezhvodstroy, based in Moscow, won an 84.7 billion-CFA-
franc ($170 million) contract last year to build the Kandadji
Dam on the Niger River, Issoufou said on Niamey-based Tele Sahel,
the state-owned broadcaster, today. While work on the dam began
in May, the project has been delayed by as long as four months,
he said.  “This delay is intolerable,” Issoufou said. “That’s why I
give a warning to the Russian company in charge of performing
the work. I wish that by the end of September 2015, the
construction of the dam be completed.”  Kandadji Dam, Niger’s first hydropower facility, will
generate 130 megawatts once completed, according to
Zarubezhvodstroy’s website. Niger received a $257 million loan
in July from an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries fund and the country’s partners to help finance
construction of the dam.  “There is no delay,” Evgeny Goudzentchuk, chief executive
officer and the main shareholder of Zarubezhvodstroy, said by
phone from Moscow. “In fact, we started closing the Niger River
for dam construction one month ahead of schedule.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
