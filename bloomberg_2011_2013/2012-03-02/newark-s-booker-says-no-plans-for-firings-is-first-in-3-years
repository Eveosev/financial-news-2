Newark (9982MF)  Mayor  Cory Booker  said his
budget for the coming year won’t call for significant employee
firings or unpaid time off for the first time in three years.  Booker, whose city coped with rising crime last year after
a 2010 cut in state aid led to dismissals in the police
department, said he plans to rehire some officers, though he
didn’t say how many or where the money would come from.  “Today we are stronger than we were two years ago,”
Booker said yesterday in his sixth State of the City speech.
“Times are still tough, but we as a city are getting better.”  The mayor of the largest municipality in  New Jersey  by
population saw 2011 dominated by a  budget crisis  that prompted
him in September to take a $32 million loan from the state and
give it more oversight to plug a $57 million deficit. Booker, a
42-year-old Rhodes Scholar and Yale-educated lawyer, said  Newark 
is undergoing its biggest economic rebound since World War II.  Since he took office in 2006, Booker said, $700 million in
development projects have begun, including two new hotels and
the first downtown office tower in 20 years.  The mayor said he wants the City Council to cut $4 million
from its expense accounts and end longevity pay for members.  A quarter of Newark’s almost 280,000 residents live in
poverty and the median household income of about $35,700 is
slightly more than half that for the state, according to U.S.
 Census Bureau data . Booker said in January that the city is
“about halfway” to matching a $100 million donation from
Facebook Inc. founder  Mark Zuckerberg  to improve city schools.  The district of about 40,000 students has 38 of the state’s
164 chronically failing schools, or almost a quarter of the
total. It has been under state control since 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
