Greece  is reneging on programs to
spur its economic competitiveness that it signed with Germany
since July, calling into question its willingness and capacity
to revitalize its economy, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said.  Economy Minister Philipp Roesler and other German officials
started bilateral projects with Greece from creating a
development bank to advising on the construction of the  Trans
Adriatic Pipeline  and on improving tax collection, the ministry
said in a report, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. Greece has failed to fulfill its pledges in most cases, it
said.  Greece’s implementation of project targets “remains
insufficient,” the ministry said in the report. Revamping
Greece’s economy at the same time as cutting its debt “is
decisive -- that’s why  Germany  agreed to its support for the
programs.”  For the Greek government, the programs “obviously have no
priority,” the ministry said. “This is unacceptable from the
German standpoint.”  Greece’s economy may shrink by 4.4 percent this year, the
European Commission forecast on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
