A former partner at  Fulbright &
Jaworski LLP (1126L)  and his wife, who falsely claimed vacations,
dinners and cosmetic treatments as business expenses, were
sentenced to 16 months in prison by a U.K. court.  Graham Simkin  and Zakia Sharif, who also worked in the law
firm’s London office as director of administration, pleaded
guilty to false accounting and fraud in January.  Sharif lied about her qualifications to get a job at the
firm and went on to claim more than 100,000 pounds ($158,600) in
expenses, according to U.K. prosecutors. She bought a range of
luxury items including a souvenir photograph of boxer  Muhammad Ali .  Simkin charged clients about 100,000 pounds for
hospitality, some of which he never provided, prosecutors said
in an e-mailed statement. The pair also claimed reimbursement
for holidays they took together while the firm was unaware they
were married. Sharif and Simkin worked for Fulbright between
2004 and 2008.  “Abusing a position of trust in this way makes it
particularly serious,” said Sue Patten, head of the  Crown
Prosecution Service ’s central fraud group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
