Sixty-eight ships were waiting to
pass through the  Houston Ship Channel , which serves the largest
U.S. petroleum port, after heavy fog halted traffic overnight,
the U.S. Coast Guard said.  As of 6 a.m. local time, 38 vessels bound for Houston were
waiting to enter the channel at the mouth of Galveston Bay and
30 were waiting to depart, Albert Hernandez, a Coast Guard watch
supervisor, said in a telephone interview.  Houston ship pilots halted operations about 11:15 p.m.
overnight, he said.  Pilots for the ports of Galveston and  Texas City  halted
transits at 10:15 p.m., he said. They have three ships waiting
to arrive and two ship waiting to leave, Hernandez said.  A  dense fog advisory  is in effect across southeast  Texas  to
10 a.m. local time today, according to the National Weather
Service website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
