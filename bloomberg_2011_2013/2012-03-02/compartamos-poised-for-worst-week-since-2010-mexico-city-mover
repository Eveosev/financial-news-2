Compartamos SAB (COMPARC*) , the holding company
that controls low-income lender Banco Compartamos SA, posted its
biggest weekly decline on record after reporting earnings and
profit forecasts below estimates.  The shares fell 2.7 percent to 13.79 pesos in Mexico City,
extending the weekly decline to 12 percent, the most since the
shares were listed in December 2010. The benchmark  IPC index  of
35 Mexican stocks gained 1 percent this week.  Fourth-quarter net income fell 8.9 percent to 469 million
pesos ($36 million), the Mexico City-based company said in a
Feb. 27 statement. Compartamos said Feb. 29 that net income
would rise between 2 percent and 5 percent this year, implying
earnings of as much as 2.1 billion pesos, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts estimated profit of 2.41 billion
pesos in 2012, according to the average of four forecasts.  “More than earnings, the market was disappointed by the
guidance,” said Rafael Escobar, an analyst with Mexico City-
based Vector Casa de Bolsa SA. Vector cut its rating on the
stock to “sell” from “hold.”  Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer SA reduced its
recommendation to “underperform” from “outperform”
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
