The growth in global exchange-traded
derivatives slowed to 11 percent last year as Chinese commodity
trading dropped by almost a third.  While almost 25 billion futures and options traded on
regulated exchanges in 2011, up from 22 billion contracts the
previous year, the expansion lagged a 25 percent growth rate in
2010, the World Federation of Exchanges said in a  statement 
yesterday. The slowdown stemmed from a decrease in commodity
trading, said Peter Clifford, deputy secretary general at the
Paris-based  association  that represents 54 stock, options and
futures exchanges worldwide.  “That’s why the overall rate is a slower pace,” he said
in a telephone interview today. Chinese commodity trading
dropped by 32 percent last year, compared with 2010, he said.
The WFE will release more details on the trading in April, it
said in the statement.  Commodity futures were the only asset class to decrease in
overall volume last year, to 2.8 billion from 2.9 billion.
Futures and options on currencies,  interest rates  and equities
all rose, according to the WFE. Equity derivatives are the
largest group, with 15.7 billion changing hands last year.  “This increase in volumes seems logical given the high
volatility of markets in 2011, which may have driven the need
for hedging upwards,” Jorge Alegria, chief executive officer of
the Mexican Derivatives Exchange and chairman of the
International Options Market Association, said in the statement.  CME, ICE Volumes  The two largest U.S.-based futures exchange owners reported
record average daily volume in 2011.  CME Group Inc. (CME) , based in
 Chicago , said an average 13.4 million contracts per day changed
hands last year, up 10 percent from 2010, according to a January
statement. Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange Inc. said an
average 1.5 million contracts traded daily on its three futures
exchanges, up 16 percent from the year before.  Worldwide, 11.9 billion futures traded last year and 12.9
billion options were bought and sold, according to WFE.  The  World Bank  reduced its global growth forecast for this
year to 2.5 percent from a June estimate of 3.6 percent, the
Washington-based institution said on Jan. 18. It warned that the
crisis in  Europe  and slower growth in developing economies may
crimp the world economy further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
