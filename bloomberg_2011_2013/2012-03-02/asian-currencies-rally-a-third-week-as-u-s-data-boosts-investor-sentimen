Asian currencies advanced for a
third week after reports signaled a pickup in U.S. economic
growth, spurring inflows into emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, added to
this year’s rally after claims for jobless benefits among
Americans held at a four-year low. The  Federal Reserve  said on
Feb. 29 the economy expanded at a “modest to moderate pace” in
January and early February as factories increased production.  “The  U.S. economy  is picking up momentum and we’re seeing
strong stock performances,” said Stanford Chen, a Taipei-based
fixed-income manager at KGI Securities Co. “Risk-taking
sentiment is going to dominate in the short term.”  The Asia Dollar index rose 0.1 percent this week to 117.56,
after reaching a five-month high on Feb. 29. South Korea’s won
gained 0.9 percent to 1,115.61 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Taiwan’s  dollar  gained 0.4 percent to
NT$29.461 and Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened 0.3 percent to
3.0038.  Overseas funds purchased $1.2 billion more stocks than they
sold in  South Korea  and Taiwan this week, with the two countries
attracting the biggest inflows in Asia outside  Japan . The MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index of shares rallied for an 11th week, gaining
almost 20 percent from its Oct. 5 low.  Korean Exports Improve  Reports from the U.S. this week showed consumer confidence
reached a one-year high in February and gross domestic product
increased last quarter by more than economists predicted. The
 European Central Bank  gave 529.5 billion euros ($705 billion) in
three-year loans to 800 banks this week.  Korea’s won touched the strongest level since November
yesterday after exports rose 22.7 percent from a year earlier
last month following a decline in January, the government
reported on March 1. The nation had a trade surplus of $2.2
billion. Consumer prices increased 3.1 percent last month, the
least since December 2010, the government said yesterday.  “South Korea’s surplus and cooling inflation, despite oil-
price spikes, are supporting investor sentiment,” said Kim Doo Hyun, a Seoul-based senior currency dealer at  Korea Exchange
Bank. (004940)   Elsewhere, the Philippine peso added 0.3 percent to 42.693
per dollar this week, Indonesia’s rupiah advanced 0.4 percent to
9,080, and  China ’s yuan was little changed at 6.2982. Thailand’s
baht fell 0.5 percent to 30.54 and India’s rupee slumped 1.1
percent to 49.5025.  To contact the reporters on this story:
