WestSide Corp. (WCL) , an Australian coal-
seam gas explorer, said it received a A$165 million ($178
million) takeover offer from Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd., which
plans to export the fuel from Queensland state.  The cash offer of 65 Australian cents a share “involved
financial backing from reputable international parties,”
Brisbane-based WestSide said in a statement today. That’s 91
percent higher than the 34 cents the stock traded at before the
proposal was announced Feb. 13, without identifying the bidder.
WestSide rose 2.3 percent to close at  45 cents  in Sydney today.  “The board of WestSide continues to assess the indicative
proposal alongside other strategic options available to the
company,” the explorer said. “The board has not formed a view
at this stage as to the merits of the indicative proposal.”  WestSide operates fields in Queensland about 160 kilometers
(100 miles) west of Gladstone, where  BG Group Plc (BG/) ,
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Santos Ltd. (STO)  are building more than $50
billion of liquefied natural gas projects. Perth-based  LNG Ltd. (LNG) 
plans a smaller LNG plant at the port of Gladstone.  A unit of China National Petroleum Corp. in January 2011
agreed to buy an almost 20 percent stake in LNG Ltd. to gain
access to the company’s technology. LNG Ltd. rose 10 percent to
43 cents a share today, valuing the company at A$115.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
