India ’s benchmark  bonds  gained on
speculation the central bank will reduce the  cash reserve ratio 
again to ease a cash shortage in the banking system.  Lenders  borrowed  a record 1.92 trillion rupees ($39
billion) at the  Reserve Bank  of India’s repurchase auction
yesterday, according to RBI data, three times the maximum of 600
billion rupees favored by the monetary authority. The amount
lent by the monetary authority today was 1.71 trillion rupees.
The central bank cut the amount of deposits lenders must set
aside as  reserves  to 5.5 percent from 6 percent on Jan. 24, the
first reduction since 2009.  “Given the tight cash conditions, a reserve ratio cut is
inevitable,” said M. Natarajan, the Mumbai-based head of
treasury at  Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)   The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due in November 2021
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.23 percent
in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
rate was little changed this week.  The central bank, which has bought 1 trillion rupees of
fixed-income securities since November, purchased 107.76 billion
rupees of government notes today, according to a statement.  The RBI will lower the reserve ratio by a further 100 basis
points in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, the Goldman
Sachs’ economists Tushar Poddar and Prakriti Shukla wrote in a
research note today, compared with an earlier estimate of 50
basis points.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 8.16 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
