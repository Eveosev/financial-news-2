European banks are asking too much
for the assets they have to sell to boost capital levels,
according to Chris Pucillo, founder of Solus Alternative Asset
Management LP.  “Right now, the prices of the assets on the banks’ balance
sheets that they’re looking to unload are just not offered at
the right levels,” Pucillo, who’s also chief investment officer
of the $2.6 billion hedge-fund firm in  New York , said today in
an interview with Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg Television’s
“InsideTrack.”  The banks, which need to increase reserves to comply with
new regulations, aren’t willing to mark down their assets low
enough, Pucillo said.  Other investors have been seeking to take advantage of
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis to snap up securities at deep
discounts.  David Rubenstein , co-founder of Carlyle Group Inc.,
said the European sovereign-debt crisis has made the region
“the world’s greatest single opportunity” in a Feb. 28 speech
at a conference in Berlin.  “We see funds that have been raised for this opportunity
and they’re going to be in a highly competitive environment
because there’s so many of them,” Pucillo said.  Solus, founded in 2007, is focused on investing in
bankruptcy claims and firms emerging from reorganization, where
performance isn’t dependent on the overall market, Pucillo said.
Last month, the firm hired  Scott Martin  and C.J. Lanktree, the
former co-heads of Deutsche Bank AG’s distressed products group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
