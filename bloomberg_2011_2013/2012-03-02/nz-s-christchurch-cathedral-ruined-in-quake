(Corrects to show deadliest earthquake in 80 years in
first paragraph.)  Christchurch Cathedral, closed since
 New Zealand ’s deadliest earthquake in eight decades struck the
city more than a year ago, is to be demolished because the 130-
year-old building was damaged beyond repair.  The church will be brought down to a “safe level” of
between two and three meters high with no walls left intact,
according to the Anglican Church  website . No bulldozers or
wrecking balls will be used in the demolition.  “I am sad to have to relay this decision but I believe it
is the way forward,” Bishop Victoria Matthews said, according
to the website.  The condemned church is located in Cathedral Square, at the
center of New Zealand’s second-largest city. It was one of the
city’s biggest tourist attractions as well as the center of
worship for many Christchurch residents. Visitors were able to
climb into the cathedral’s spire, which fell off in last year’s
Feb. 22 earthquake that killed 185 people.  The process of bringing down the cathedral to a safe level
is expected to take most of this year, according to the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
