National Bank of Canada , the
country’s sixth-largest lender, would consider domestic personal
and commercial bank acquisitions, Chief Financial Officer
Ghislain Parent said.  “On the P&C side, we could look at something if it came
up,” Parent told investors today on a conference call. “We
don’t have any interest outside of  Canada  at the moment.”  National Bank, based in Montreal, said yesterday it had
record profit of C$334 million ($337.8 million), or C$2 a share,
for the quarter ended Jan. 31, as domestic banking improved. The
lender would look at acquisitions after the current fiscal
quarter is complete, Parent said today in a telephone interview.  The bank is in the “execution and consolidation phase” of
its wealth-management acquisitions, he said. Among the deals is
the investment-advisory business it purchased in January from
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  for C$206 million.  National Bank has  purchased  at least three loan portfolios
to bolster its personal and commercial business in the last
decade.  Separately, the bank announced today that Diane Giard will
become executive vice president of personal and commercial
banking after Rejean Levesque retires in October.  National Bank rose 1.1 percent to C$78.32 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto and has gained 8.6 percent this year, the second-best
performer on the 10-company  S&P/TSX Banks Index (STBANKX) .  To contact the reporter on this story:
