The pound fell the most in a week
against the dollar after a German report showed retail sales
unexpectedly declined in January, damping demand for assets with
the strongest links to the euro-region.  Ten-year gilts advanced as the German data added to signs
the sovereign debt crisis is slowing growth in the euro-area.
The pound strengthened for a sixth day against the euro after a
U.K. report showed construction accelerated in February. The
government sold 4.5 billion pounds ($7.14 billion) of bills.  “There is definitely a risk-off feel as we wind down the
week,” said Peter Rosenstreich, chief currency strategist at
Swissquote Bank SA in Geneva. “The steady stream of news has
had an eroding effect on the market confidence and what happens
in  Germany  is critical. Today is the first day of heavy cable
selling,” he said, referring to the pound against the dollar.  Sterling dropped 0.6 percent to $1.5857 at 4:01 p.m.  London 
time after falling as much as 0.8 percent, the most since Feb.
22. The pound climbed 0.2 percent to 83.27 pence per euro
extending this week’s gain to 1.7 percent.  German retail sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal
swings, declined 1.6 percent from December, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 0.5 percent gain.  Gilts Gain  The yield on the 10-year gilt dropped seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.15 percent. The 4 percent bond
due March 2022 rose 0.63, or 6.30 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 116.59.  Sterling headed for its biggest weekly gain versus the euro
this year as the improvement in building activity followed data
this week showing  house prices  increased last month and retail
sales improved.  The construction gauge, based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  rose to 54.3 from 51.4 in January, Markit Economics
Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said.
That’s the highest since March 2011. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast a reading of 51.3.  “This morning’s data will probably add to the
outperforming tone we have seen on sterling against the euro
throughout the week,” said Audrey Childe-Freeman, global head
of currency strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank in London.  The U.K. government sold 1.5 billion pounds of 182-day
bills at a yield of 0.4248 percent. It also auctioned 28-day and
93-day securities.  The pound has weakened 3.3 percent over the past year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro dropped 4.5 percent,
and the dollar gained 0.4 percent.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.5 percent in 2012,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds,
 Europe ’s benchmark securities, dropped 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
