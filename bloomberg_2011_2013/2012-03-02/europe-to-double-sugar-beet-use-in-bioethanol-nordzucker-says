The European Union will double
annual production of bioethanol made from domestic sugar beets
to about 4 billion liters in six to eight years, according to
Nordzucker AG.  The EU’s production of bioethanol from sugar-beets is about
2 billion liters a year currently, said Klaus Schumacher, vice
president of economics and communications at sugar producer
Nordzucker, today at the  CIS Sugar Market 2012  conference in
Moscow.  Nations in the region use about 20 billion liters of
biofuels made from various renewable sources, with a target to
increase that amount to as much as 37 billion liters by 2020,
Schumacher said, citing forecasts by the European Commission.  “We see that a growing share of sugar-beets will be used
in future for the production of ethanol,” Schumacher said. The
EU targets to have 10 percent of its fuel used in the
 transportation industry  to come from renewable energy sources by
2020, he said at the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
