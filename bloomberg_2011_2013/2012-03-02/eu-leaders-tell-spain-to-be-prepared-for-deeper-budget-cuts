European Union leaders signaled
Spain must stick to its target for narrowing the  budget deficit 
this year amid a weaker economy, highlighting Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy ’s limited room to escape tougher EU rules.  At a Brussels meeting where they signed a German-inspired
deficit-control treaty, EU government heads said “fiscal
consolidation is an essential condition to return to higher
growth” and urged euro-area nations such as  Spain (EUGNEMUQ)  to be
prepared to make deeper budget cuts.  “Member states facing close market scrutiny should meet
agreed budgetary targets and stand ready to pursue further
consolidation measures if needed,” according to the draft of a
statement that the 27 leaders are due to approve later today.  The EU is reinforcing rules on budget discipline in the 17-
nation euro area to counter the Greece-triggered debt crisis
that threatens the single currency. In addition to establishing
a new fiscal treaty, European governments have bolstered the
threat of sanctions against euro countries that breach the EU
deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product and debt
ceiling of 60 percent of GDP.  The government of Rajoy, whose People’s Party government
took over from the Socialists in December, is seeking to win
more fiscal flexibility from the EU after  Spain  missed its
deficit goal last year of 6 percent of GDP. The Spanish budget
program approved by the EU sets a deficit target of 4.4 percent
of GDP this year compared with an 8.5 percent shortfall in 2011
when the economy cooled.  “The circumstances that led us to the 4.4 percent are no
longer in place at the moment,” Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told reporters in Brussels yesterday.  With Spain facing its second recession since 2009, Rajoy
has already adopted a 15-billion euro ($19.9 billion) package of
measures to narrow the deficit and would need to find another 25
billion euros, Moody’s Investors Service estimated, if the
deficit goal remains unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
