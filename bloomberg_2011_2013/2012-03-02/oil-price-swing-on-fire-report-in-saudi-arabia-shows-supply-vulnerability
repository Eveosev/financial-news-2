Oil’s 4.8-percent price swing
yesterday on reports of a fire in  Saudi Arabia , the world’s
biggest crude exporter, show the market’s vulnerability to
supply disruptions as sanctions hamper sales from  Iran .  Brent crude rallied to as much as $128.40 a barrel late
yesterday, the highest since July 2008, after Twitter messages,
internet blogs and an Iranian state-run news channel reported
that an explosion destroyed a pipeline in eastern Saudi Arabia,
near the  Ras Tanura  refinery. The kingdom’s Interior Ministry
later denied any sabotage to its oil facilities, and prices
declined, sinking further today to as low as $123.90 on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London.  The reaction highlighted “the reduced ability of the
market to absorb supply shocks or mere headlines of supply
shocks, given the limited spare capacity and inventory
buffers,” Amrita Sen, an analyst at Barclays Plc in  London  said
in a note to investors today.  Crude prices have risen 16 percent this year as the
European Union imposes an oil embargo on Iran, which the
 International Energy Agency  said may affect daily supply of
600,000 to 1 million barrels. OPEC has an “effective” spare
oil production capacity of 2.82 million barrels a day, of which
72 percent is in Saudi Arabia, the IEA said in a Feb. 10 report.
The figure excludes Iraq, Nigeria, Venezuela and  Libya .  Brent traded between $122.49 and $128.40 yesterday, a 4.8
percent swing, and was at $124.10 at 3:02 p.m. in London today.  “Brent is back under $125 at the time of writing, but
we’ve had a good demonstration of how nervous the market is at
the moment, and how quick shorts will be to cover,” Philip
Wiper, an analyst at London broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd., said
in an e-mailed report.  Abqaiq Memory  Concern about Saudi supply has previously caused jitters in
the market. On Feb. 24, 2006,  Brent crude  rose as much as $2.33
a barrel or 3.9 percent to $62.87 a barrel after Saudi Arabian
forces repelled a suicide attack on the Abqaiq processing
center, which handled about 6 million barrels a day. Abqaiq
sends oil by pipeline to Ras Tanura on the Persian Gulf coast.  The oil-export terminal in Ras Tanura was operating
normally today, according to Gulf Agency Co., a port agent.  “There is absolutely no disruption whatsoever to oil
supply, ports, refineries, anything,” Dan Hjalmarsson, a vice
president responsible for the Middle East region at GAC. He
spoke from Dubai after checking with the general manager in
Saudi Arabia. “It’s business as usual.”  Phonecalls to the Saudi Ports Authority office in  Riyadh 
and to the Ras Tanura Port today, a weekend, were unanswered.  No Sabotage  Saudi Arabia experienced no sabotage at its oil facilities
in the Qatif area, Major General Mansour Al-Turki, a spokesman
for the Interior Ministry, said late yesterday by phone.  A fire occurred in an industrial area in the town of Safwa
in the Shiite-dominated Qatif area near Ras Tanura, a person
with knowledge of the situation said late yesterday. The blaze
didn’t damage the refinery or any pipeline in the area, said two
people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be
identified.  Prices rallied yesterday on the basis of internet reports
and after Iran’s Press TV reported that an  explosion  destroyed
oil pipelines in eastern Saudi Arabia. Today, the same  news
agency  reported mass participation in Iranian parliamentary
elections. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two biggest producers
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
regional political rivals.  Sri Lanka , dependent on Iran for more than 90 percent of
its oil requirements, was today the latest country to say it
will turn to other suppliers amid escalating sanctions.  “After the imposition of sanctions by the U.S. and EU on
Iran, we are exploring the possibility of increasing imports
from Aramco,” Oil Minister Susil Premajayantha said in a
telephone interview from  Colombo , referring to Saudi Arabia’s
state-run oil company. “We have already written to them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
