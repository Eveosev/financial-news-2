Oil options volatility rose for the
second day as crude fell the most since December as President
 Barack Obama  said a pre-emptive strike on  Iran  might generate
“sympathy” for the Persian Gulf country, easing concern that
an attack would take place.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.2 as of 2:30 p.m. in New York, up from
27.9 yesterday. Puts were 60 percent of the volume. Implied
volatility for 25-delta calls, which gain 25 cents for each $1
rise in futures, was 28.6, up from 27.8 yesterday.  Oil for April delivery fell $2.14, or 2 percent, to settle
at $106.70 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
reached $110.55 late yesterday after Press TV, an Iranian state-
run news channel, reported an explosion in an oil pipeline in
 Saudi Arabia . Major General Mansour Al-Turki, a spokesman for
the Saudi Interior Ministry, said no oil facility in the region
has been sabotaged.  “The news didn’t break until after the market closed, so
it was a knee-jerk reaction where” people who were short
volatility thought it wasn’t such a good idea, Matt Millar,
director and portfolio manager at hedge fund Armored Wolf LLC,
said by phone. “The story is not true but human beings tend to
respond to these events irrationally.”  Most-Active  The most active options in electronic trading today were
