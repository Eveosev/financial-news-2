U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said European leaders have made advances in addressing the
region’s debt crisis while they have more work ahead.  “They have made important strides and we’re encouraged by
the progress that they have made,” Wolin said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television today. “They have additional work to
do.”  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said at a meeting of
Group of 20 finance ministers last weekend that  Europe  needs a
“substantial financial firewall” to support the region’s
recovery efforts. In a two-day summit that began yesterday in
Brussels, euro-area leaders agreed to provide capital faster for
a planned permanent bailout fund in a concession to
international pressure to strengthen the region’s defenses
against the debt crisis.  On U.S. efforts to revamp financial regulations, Wolin said
the Volcker rule ban on proprietary trading needs to be clear
while allowing market-making and “appropriate hedging
activity.”  The “basic idea” of the rule is that banks “should not
be doing these riskier activities,” Wolin said. “They
shouldn’t be engaged in proprietary trading on their own balance
sheet, they shouldn’t be investing in riskier funds.”  In an interview earlier today on CNBC, Wolin said there’s
no evidence that the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law has had
any “negative effect” on the financial system. He also said
the costs of implementing Dodd-Frank are a “pittance” compared
with those associated with the financial crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
