Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co.’s
 Sunovion Pharmaceuticals (SEPR)  unit won a court ruling invalidating
five of seven  Mylan Inc. (MYL)  patents related to a compound used in
the bronchitis and emphysema drug Brovana.  U.S. District Judge  John Koeltl  in Manhattan also limited
any damages that might be assessed on the two remaining patents,
according to a filing. He granted Marlborough, Massachusetts-
based Sunovion’s motion for partial summary judgment.  Koeltl said in yesterday’s ruling that the two patents had
“substantially changed” during a review by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, and so Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan is
barred from collecting damages related to sales before October
2011.  Mylan’s Dey unit sued Sunovion’s predecessor company,
Sepracor, in 2007 in an attempt to block the introduction of
Brovana, which Dey said infringed its patent for a spray to open
bronchial passages. Dey was owned by  Merck KGaA (MRK)  at the time the
suit was filed.  The patents are related to the compound formoterol.
Brovana’s active ingredient is a variation of formoterol.  The case is Dey v. Sepracor, 07-cv-02353, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
