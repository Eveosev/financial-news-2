German  retail sales  unexpectedly
declined in January as rising oil prices fueled inflation.  Sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, fell 1.6
percent from December, when they increased 0.1 percent, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists
forecast a gain of 0.5 percent, the median of 22 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey  showed.  Sales (GRFRINYY)  rose 1.6 percent from a year
ago.  Europe ’s debt crisis is curbing growth across the euro
area,  Germany ’s largest export market, and higher energy costs
pushed inflation to 2.5 percent last month. Still, unemployment
is running at a two-decade low and recent data suggest the
country may avoid a recession.  Consumer confidence  will increase
to a 12-month high in March,  GfK SE (GFK)  predicted this week.  “There are still worries with regard to the rising oil
price and that may keep consumption in check,” said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in  London .
“But there has been some good news with regard to the European
debt crisis and that may support sentiment.”  German companies may create as many as 250,000 new jobs
this year, the DIHK national industry and trade chambers said on
Feb. 17, citing a survey.  Beiersdorf AG (BEI) , the German maker of
Nivea skin creams, yesterday forecast a resumption of
profitability growth this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
