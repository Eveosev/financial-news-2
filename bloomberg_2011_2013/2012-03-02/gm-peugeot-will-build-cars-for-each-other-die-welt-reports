General Motors Co. and PSA Peugeot
Citroen will use their existing facilities to build each other’s
small and medium-sized cars under their agreed alliance, Die
Welt reported.  One option may be to use a GM facility now producing Opel
Insignias for shared production, the report said. Capacity at
that plant can be expanded as it was earmarked for a larger Saab
model that won’t be put into production, the report said, citing
an unidentified Opel manager.  Globally, as many as 2 million Opel Corsa models, primarily
for South American markets, will be produced on one of the joint
platforms, the newspaper said, adding that further projects,
including for  sport utility vehicles , are also being envisaged.
The European alliance will be steered initially by a committee
made up of four managers from each company, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
