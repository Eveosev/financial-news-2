The  New York Rangers  defeated the
Carolina Hurricanes 3-2 to log their third straight win in the
 National Hockey League .  The Rangers (41-15-6) lead the 15-team Eastern Conference
with 88 points, nine more than the  Boston Bruins , who beat the
New Jersey Devils 4-3 in overtime last night on David Krejci’s
third goal of the game. The Hurricanes (24-27-13) have 61 points.  Jeff Skinner opened the scoring for the Hurricanes at RBC
Center in Raleigh,  North Carolina , last night with a power-play
goal one minute into the second period. Artem Anisimov tied it
seven minutes, 23 seconds later and Marian Gaborik gave the
visitors the lead after 14:53 with his 30th goal of the season.  “It feels nice, but we still have a lot of games left,”
said Gaborik, who has scored 30 goals in seven of his 11 NHL
seasons. “I want to put up some more goals.”  Brandon Prust scored two minutes into the third period for
the Rangers and Jay Harrison got the final goal for Carolina
with 40 seconds left in the game.  New York goaltender Martin Biron stopped 21 of 23 shots and
had “key saves at real important times,” Rangers head coach
John Tortorella said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
