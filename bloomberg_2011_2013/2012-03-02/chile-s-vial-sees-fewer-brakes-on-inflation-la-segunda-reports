Chile ’s central bank needs to watch
inflation more carefully after restraints on price rises
diminished, Joaquin Vial, the newest member of its monetary-
policy board told La Segunda in an interview published today.  Faster-than-forecast economic growth, higher-than-expected
copper prices and the improved international economy mean that
some of the factors that would have otherwise constrained price
rises are no longer there, Vial told the Santiago-based paper.  The current  interest rate  is roughly neutral, he was quoted
as saying. The bank could either lower rates because of a
weakening international economy or raise them because of strong
domestic demand, La Segunda quoted him as saying. Either option
is equally viable, he told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
