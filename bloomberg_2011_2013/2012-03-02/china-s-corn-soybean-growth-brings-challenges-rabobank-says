China ’s growth in corn and soybean
crush production and meat consumption is making commodities
distribution more difficult, Rabobank International said.  China produced its biggest corn crop last year, mainly in
the country’s northeast, and faced bottlenecks in trying to
distribute it, Daron Hoffman, Rabobank’s Shanghai-based director
of research, said in a report e-mailed today.  “After several years’ worth of increased corn production
in the northeast, increases have far outpaced regional
consumption growth, and on an annual basis, there are over 40
million tons of corn that need to be stored or exported from
this region southwards,” Hoffman said.  “The profitability of corn relative to soybeans has driven
down local soybean production and, coupled with the
competitiveness of year-round soybean products trucked in from
coastal ports, this has struck a severe blow to the local
soybean crush,” he said.  Geographical mismatches between supply and demand mean
grain traders and crushers will need to focus on distribution
and storage investment, while feed millers and animal producers
need to deal with the supply chain and risk of bottlenecks,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
