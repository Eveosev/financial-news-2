Seat Pagine Gialle SpA (PG)  surged the
most in a month after  Italy ’s largest phone-book publisher said
its debt restructuring plan was endorsed by investors including
CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and some creditors’ committees.  The stock jumped as much as 23 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Jan. 30. Seat traded up 17 percent to 4.85
euro cents as of 10:11 a.m. in Milan before being temporarily
suspended. The shares of the Turin, Italy-based company have
almost doubled this year and are heading for a six-month high.  Seat Pagine said today it received “full support” for the
debt proposal by controlling investors CVC, Permira Advisers
Ltd. and Investitori Associati SpA, the senior noteholders
committee and Lighthouse bondholder committee, according to a
stock-exchange statement. CVC, which said Nov. 29 that it wasn’t
backing the plan, has now given its formal support.  Seat Pagine is “close to safety,” according to Marco Greco, an analyst at Mediobanca SpA. He said in a note today
that “there are only a few technical points to be solved and
then a positive conclusion to this never ending saga will be
achieved. It’s too early to assume that the bankruptcy risk is
totally over.”  Seat Pagine is seeking backing from at least 75 percent of
its creditors on a final proposal for the company’s debt
reorganization. The board is giving creditors until March 7 to
accept the restructuring plan. The proposal has to be backed by
senior bondholders as well as senior lenders and junior note
holders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
