Peruvian dollar bonds rose, pushing
down yields to a four-month low, after the  European Central
Bank ’s record loans to the region’s financial institutions
spurred demand for emerging-market, higher-yielding assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point to 4.68 percent at 1:37 p.m. in Lima. That’s
the lowest yield since Nov. 8. The bond’s price rose 0.23 cent
to 127.38 cents per dollar.  The ECB said Feb. 29 it will lend 800 financial
institutions 529.5 billion euros ($705.7 billion) for three
years, the biggest single refinancing operation in its history.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress
“exceptionally low” interest rates are likely to be warranted
at least through late 2014.  “There’s a lot of liquidity in a context of calm financial
markets and low  risk aversion , and it’s flowing toward emerging
assets, including Peruvian bonds” said Estefany Castillo, an
economist at Scotiabank Peru in Lima. “Peru is among the
countries in the region with better fundamentals.”  The sol was unchanged at 2.6750 per  U.S. dollar , according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
