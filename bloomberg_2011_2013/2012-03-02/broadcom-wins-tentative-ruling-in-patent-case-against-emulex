Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  won a tentative
ruling prohibiting rival chipmaker  Emulex Corp. (ELX)  from selling so-
called controller chips for communications networks that were
found to infringe two Broadcom patents.  U.S. District Judge James Selna in Santa Ana, California,
issued a tentative decision before a hearing today on Broadcom’s
request for a permanent injunction. The judge  said  he would
allow Emulex to sell the infringing products for another 18
months to existing customers who have ordered them, while paying
Broadcom a 3 percent royalty.  At the hearing, Selna said he would issue a final ruling on
Broadcom’s request next week.  The judge had found last year that Emulex infringed two of
Irvine, California-based Broadcom’s patents. Emulex, based in
 Costa Mesa ,  California , objected to a court-ordered ban of sales
of infringing products and asked for a mandatory royalty
instead.  Juanita Brooks, a lawyer for Emulex, said at today’s
hearing that “incredible market disruptions” would occur if
the judge would enter an injunction. She asked Selna to “not
carve it out in such a way so the public should suffer because
of a war between Broadcom and Emulex.”  Bill Lee, a lawyer for Broadcom, asked the judge to triple
the royalty rate Emulex will have to pay Broadcom during the 18-
month “sunset” period.  The case is Emulex v. Broadcom, 09-01310, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana).  To contact the reporter on this story:
