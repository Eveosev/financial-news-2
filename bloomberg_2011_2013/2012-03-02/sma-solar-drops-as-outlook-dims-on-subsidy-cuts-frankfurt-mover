SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) , Germany’s
biggest solar-energy company by market value, slumped to its
lowest value since April 2009 after it predicted declining sales
and earnings because of subsidy cuts.  The stock slid as much as 9.1 percent to 34.18 euros after
the Niestetal-based company said sales will drop to 1.2 billion
euros ($1.6 billion) to 1.5 billion euros this year, with an
earnings margin of 5 percent to 10 percent.  Suppliers of solar-power equipment, including SMA Solar and
the U.S.’s Power-One Inc., saw profit squeezed last year as
subsidy cuts and lower prices weighed on sales. SMA, the biggest
maker of inverters that turn power from solar panels into a
current for the grid, on Jan. 13 posted preliminary 2011 revenue
of about 1.7 billion euros and earnings before interest and tax
of 240 million euros, missing the 259 million-euro average
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  SMA’s board “believes that the radical reduction in
subsidies, particularly in  Germany , will lead to lower demand
for medium to large-scale photovoltaic plants,” SMA Solar said
in a statement. “At the moment, it cannot be predicted whether
Asian and American markets can fully compensate for the
decline.”  Germany, the biggest market for solar energy when it comes
to installed capacity, plans to curb aid for the industry by as
much as 29 percent this month and make additional monthly
reductions starting in May to limit installations that reached a
record 7.5 gigawatts last year. Plants larger than 10 megawatts
won’t get support after July 1.  SMA was down 1.85 euros, or 4.9 percent, at 35.765 euros as
of 3:02 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
