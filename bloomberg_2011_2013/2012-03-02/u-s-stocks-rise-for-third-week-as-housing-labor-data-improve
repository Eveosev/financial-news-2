U.S. stocks  rose this week, with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index completing its best February since
1998, as data on housing and the jobs market improved and
monthly sales from Gap Inc. to  Ford Motor Co. (F)  beat estimates.  Equities trimmed their advance March 2 after the  S&P 500 
climbed to the highest since 2008 and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed above 13,000 for the first time in nearly four
years during the week. Consumer and financial stocks rose the
most among 10 S&P 500 industries this week, each rising 1.4
percent as a group.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  added 6.1 percent as an
analyst said it would be worth more if broken up.  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR)  fell 15 percent, leading a drop in energy shares.  The S&P 500 added 0.3 percent to 1,369.63, a third straight
weekly gain. The benchmark measure rallied 4.1 percent last
month, and has risen for eight out of nine weeks in 2012. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  fell 5.38 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,977.57, its first retreat in three weeks. The
gauge closed at 13,005.12 on Feb. 28.  “We didn’t think the market would jump as much as it did
the first six weeks, but given the positive economic numbers, it
raced on up,”  Thomas Nyheim , a Greenville, Delaware-based fund
manager for Christiana Trust, which oversees $9.6 billion, said
in a telephone interview. “The market raced up to our target on
the S&P. So you might sort of flat line for months and months.”  Global Growth  Stocks advanced as more Americans than forecast signed
contracts to buy previously owned home, jobless claims declined
to a four-year low and the Conference Board’s index of  consumer
confidence  rose to the highest level in a year. The  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  fell
0.3 percent on the final day of the week amid concern that the
rally that drove the benchmark gauge to the highest level since
2008 has outpaced global growth prospects.  “We suspect that any pullback or pause here should be one
that refreshes,”  Louise Yamada , managing director of Louise
Yamada Technical Research Advisors LLC in  New York , said in a
Bloomberg TV interview.  The S&P 500 has risen 25 percent from its 2011 low in
October amid better-than-estimated earnings and economic data.
The measure trades at about 14.1 times reported earnings,
compared with the average since 1954 of 16.4 times, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The index has the potential to reach a record high of 1,700
this year should economic growth surprise investors the same way
falling bond rates did in 1995, Birinyi Associates Inc. said.  Potential for Surprise  An expansion that exceeded forecasts in the world’s largest
economy would help stocks rally after economists tempered their
estimate for growth in 2012 to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent
earlier in the year, according to Laszlo Birinyi, who was among
the first to suggest buying stocks in March 2009. The potential
for surprise is similar to 1995, when the yield on the 30-year
U.S. Treasuries fell 1.93 percentage points, even as  Wall Street 
predicted it would gain, according to a report from the
Westport, Connecticut-based firm.  “In 1995, the consensus trade was higher yields, today it
is tepid economic growth and the market is suggesting -- perhaps
insisting -- an alternative to that consensus,” Birinyi wrote
in the note dated March 1. “We continue to be bullish and would
encourage a more aggressive posture.”  The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index climbed 1.4
percent this week, closing near its highest level in Bloomberg
data going back to 1989.  Gap (GPS)  jumped 8.2 percent to $24.41 as the
largest U.S. apparel chain said same-store sales increased 4
percent in February, beating the average projection for a 1.4
percent drop from analysts surveyed by Retail Metrics Inc.  Autos Rally  Car companies as an S&P group advanced 2.4 percent, after
U.S. auto sales accelerated at the fastest pace in four years.
Ford’s deliveries jumped 14 percent to 178,644 last month,
exceeding the average 9.4 increase estimated by analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Ford climbed 4 percent to $12.72. GM, which
reported a surprise sales gain, added 1.5 percent to $26.45.  JPMorgan Chase rallied 6.1 percent to $40.63. The largest
U.S. bank by assets should consider breaking up and selling
businesses because its parts are worth one-third more than its
market value, according to Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd.
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
gained 3.2 percent to $8.13.  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , the largest U.S. maker of memory
semiconductors, surged 8.7 percent to $8.65 after its Japan-
based rival Elpida Memory Inc. filed for bankruptcy.  $500 Billion  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  climbed 4.4 percent to a record $545.18 as its
market capitalization topped  $500 billion  for the first time,
cementing its lead as the world’s most valuable business and
reaching heights not seen by any company since the last
recession. The stock rallied for seven straight days.  Energy companies  had the biggest retreat among the 10 S&P
500 industries, falling 1.7 percent.  Alpha Natural , the second-
largest U.S. coal producer, tumbled 15 percent to $17.40 after
Moody’s Investors Service changed the outlook for the company’s
credit rating to negative from stable, citing rising costs and
weakening demand in the coal industry. Bigger rival  Peabody
Energy Corp. (BTU)  declined 9.5 percent to $32.89.  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL)  plunged 20 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $41.86, after the owner of the University of Phoenix cut
its forecasts for earnings and student enrollment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
