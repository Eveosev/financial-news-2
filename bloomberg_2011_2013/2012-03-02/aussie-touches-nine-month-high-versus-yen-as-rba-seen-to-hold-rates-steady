Australia’s dollar reached a nine-
month high versus the yen as an improving global growth outlook
spurred prospects the  Reserve Bank  will keep its key  interest
rate  unchanged next week.  The so-called Aussie strengthened against 12 of its 16
major counterparts this week after U.S. reports showed
manufacturing expanded in February and jobless claims matched a
four-year low last week.  New Zealand ’s dollar erased an earlier
increase against the yen as global stocks fell. Both South
Pacific currencies declined versus the dollar as weaker retail
sales in  Europe  curbed demand for higher-yielding assets.  “I do think we’ll see a holding pattern” from the RBA,
said Kara Ordway, a currency strategist at City Index Asia
Pacific in Sydney. “The Aussie is certainly looking good.”  Australia’s dollar was little changed at 87.65 yen at 1:01
p.m. in  New York  after earlier touching 88.01 yen, the highest
since May 11. It lost 0.6 percent to $1.0743. New Zealand’s
currency lost 0.6 percent to 67.68 yen. It slid 1.2 percent to
82.97 U.S. cents.  The Aussie is set to complete a 0.9 percent gain against
the yen since Feb. 24 for a ninth consecutive weekly advance,
its longest rising streak since July 2003. The so-called kiwi is
poised to fall 0.3 percent in the same period.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stock fell 0.5 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 0.3 percent.  RBA Meeting  RBA policy makers will probably keep the overnight  cash
rate target  at 4.25 percent at a meeting on March 6, according
to all 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Traders expect  Australia ’s central bank to reduce borrowing
costs by 40 basis points within a year, according a Credit
Suisse AG  index  based on swaps. That compares with 104 basis
points in cuts predicted on Feb. 1.  The Institute for Supply Management’s  factory index , a
measure of manufacturing in the U.S., was at 52.4 last month
from 54.1 in January, the group said in a report yesterday.
Readings above 50 signal growth. First-time applications for
 jobless benefits  fell 2,000 last week to 351,000, matching the
lowest level since March 2008, the Labor Department said.  The Aussie and kiwi weakened against the greenback before
European reports that may show a decline in retail sales and a
contraction in services.  Euro-area  retail sales  dropped for a third month in
January, the European Union’s statistics office will say on
March 5, another Bloomberg survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
