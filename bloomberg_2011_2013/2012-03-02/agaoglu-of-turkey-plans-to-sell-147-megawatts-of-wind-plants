Turkey ’s Agaoglu Group, which has
interests in construction, tourism and energy, is in final
stages of talks with eight energy and private equity investors
to sell 147 megawatts of wind plants this month, chairman Ali Agaoglu said.  The  Istanbul-based group  is negotiating with four energy
companies and four private equity funds, Agaoglu, the 10th
richest man in Turkey according to Forbes, told reporters
yesterday in Istanbul in embargoed comments. Potential investors
include international companies, he said.  Agaoglu agreed yesterday to buy seven turbines from  Vestas
Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s biggest wind-turbine maker, to add
21 megawatts to the 126 megawatts at its two plants in
northwestern and southern Turkey. Turkey has a total wind power
capacity of 1,700 megawatts, Agaoglu said.  “I think we will complete the sale in March,” Agaoglu
said. “We want to use the cash to invest in other energy
projects.”  The group targets a power capacity of at least 1,000
megawatts by 2015 by investing 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion),
Agaoglu said. The group holds licenses for as much as 700
megawatts of wind power and more than 300 megawatts of
hydroelectric power, including 200 megawatts in  Georgia , he
said. The group will raise total capacity to 5,000 megawatts
later 2015, according to Agaoglu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
