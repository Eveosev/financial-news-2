Viacom Inc. (VIAB)  Chairman  Sumner Redstone 
will attend the annual meeting March 8 in  New York , a reversal
after the company said yesterday he wouldn’t attend due to an
“unavoidable conflict.”  Redstone, 88, plans to address investors, Carl Folta, a
spokesman, said today in a telephone interview.  “He very much wanted to attend the meeting, and he was
able to change his commitment,” Folta said.  Viacom fell 0.7 percent to $48.48 at the close in New York.
The Class A shares have risen 6.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
