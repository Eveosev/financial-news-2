Puma Energy LLC, a unit of the
world’s third-largest independent oil trader Trafigura Beheer
BV, signed a $260 million credit facility.  The deal, consisting of a 364-day revolving line of credit
and a three-year  term loan , is the Geneva-based company’s first
syndicated facility and will be used for general corporate
purposes and working capital, lenders said today in an e-mailed

oversubscribed, the lenders said.  BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse group AG, Natixis, Societe
Generale SA, Standard Bank Group Ltd. and Standard Chartered Plc
were among lenders providing the loan, according to the
