Latin America  faces a threat of a
resurgence in destabilizing capital inflows that as recently as
2010 caused a rally in the in region’s currencies and other
assets if risk aversion dissipates, the International Monetary
Fund’s top official for the region said.  Capital flows into the region have maintained a “certain
prudence” because of aversion to risk, Nicolas Eyzaguirre,
director of the International Monetary Fund´s Western Hemisphere
department, told reporters in Punta del Este, Uruguay following
an IMF meeting with policy makers and economists.  A combination of high commodity prices, “very strong”
growth in  Asia  and low levels of indebtedness in Latin America,
coupled with reduced global risks, may create the conditions for
capital to flow toward Latin America over the next two years, he
said. The meetings in Uruguay sought to ensure that policies
exist to protect financial stability.  “These financial flows, when they´re persistent at
important magnitudes, end up generating strong risk taking in
the financial sector,” he said. “That´s why we´re being
proactive and have been talking today.”  In the year to date, the Mexican, Brazilian, Colombian and
Chilean currencies are among the eight best performers among the
most-traded 25 emerging market currencies tracked worldwide by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
