Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , a Nigerian lender,
retreated the most in three weeks after falling by the daily
limit.  The stock slid 5 percent, the most since Feb. 10, to 2.47
naira at 1:50 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  “The pressure is likely downward on the stock this month
as investors expect it to come up with a loss after a profit
warning,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth
Trust & Investment Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone
today.  “There is no incentive for the stock to move up until
the management comes up with a first-quarter profit forecast.”  Diamond expects a net loss of about 454.4 million naira
($2.9 million) for the fourth quarter, it said on Sept. 8.
 Nigeria ’s central bank implemented reforms following a debt
crisis in 2008 and 2009. The banking regulator introduced
December as a common year-end for the country’s lenders. Full-
year 2011 results are expected to be released from this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
