Thailand ’s baht headed for its first
weekly drop in more than a month on speculation businesses
importing equipment to rebuild factories after last year’s
floods will step up dollar purchases. Bonds fell.  The trade account will show a deficit for a fourth month in
January, with the gap at $1.98 billion, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due
next week. The shortfall was $2.13 billion in December,
according to the Customs Department. The baht has advanced 3.6
percent this year after exchange data showed foreign funds
bought $1.7 billion more Thai stocks than they sold through
yesterday.  “The baht is now running on a trade deficit,” said Goh
Puay Yeong, a Singapore-based foreign-exchange strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG. “That’s mainly due to the flood
reconstruction. In order for the baht to appreciate a lot more,
it will probably need more portfolio inflows.”  The baht declined 0.3 percent this week to 30.46 per dollar
as of 9 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency advanced 0.2 percent today. The baht may
weaken to 31 in the next three months, Goh said.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent notes due June
2017 increased 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to
3.41 percent this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate was unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
