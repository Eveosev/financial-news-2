BRE Bank SA (BRE) , a unit of  Commerzbank
AG (CBK)  and  Poland ’s third-largest lender by assets, may increase
corporate lending by a “little” more than 10 percent this year
as it benefits from an expanding economy.  That will be more than twice the pace of the growth in the
Polish market and higher than the 9 percent increase last year,
Przemyslaw Gdanski, BRE’s management board member in charge of
corporate banking, said in an interview in Warsaw today.  “This will be a year of increases for the Polish
corporate-banking business, driven by the economic growth” that
may be about 3 percent in 2012, Gdanski said.  The Polish economy will probably grow 2.5 percent this
year, the fastest pace in the European Union, boosted by
spending on roads and railways before the Euro 2012 soccer
championships, the European Commission said Feb. 23.  BRE’s corporate-loan provisions may fall further in 2012,
Gdanski said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
