A judge in  India ’s top court said
he’s pulled out from hearing a suit that seeks to declare
 Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) ’s $8.67 billion acquisition of oil
explorer  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  as illegal.  There’s a conflict of interest, Justice H.L. Dattu said in
the Supreme Court in New Delhi today while withdrawing from a
two-judge panel that was to decide whether to admit the suit. He
didn’t elaborate. Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia will assign the
case to another panel at a later date, Rakesh Sharma, the
court’s public relations officer, said by telephone.  The petition, submitted on behalf of Bangalore resident
Arun Kumar Agrawal on Feb. 27, wants the court to order state-
run  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  to buy a controlling stake in Cairn
India. It sought an investigation into why ONGC didn’t buy the
shares.  State-run ONGC, India’s biggest energy explorer, said in
September its decision not to bid for Cairn India was based on
legal and commercial considerations.  Vedanta, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, is a
metals and mining company with no previous experience in oil and
gas projects. It completed the purchase of Cairn India, operator
of the nation’s biggest onshore oil deposit, in December after
the government approved the deal in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
