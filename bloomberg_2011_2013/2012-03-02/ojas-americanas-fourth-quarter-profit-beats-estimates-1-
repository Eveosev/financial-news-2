Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4) , Brazil’s
second-largest retailer by market value, posted fourth-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as sales growth outpaced
an increase in costs. Online unit B2W Cia. Global de Varejo had
its fifth consecutive loss.  Lojas Americanas’s quarterly net income rose 14 percent to
180.2 million reais ($105 million),  above  the average estimate
of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a profit of 170
million reais after extraordinary items. B2W’s loss widened to
28.8 million reais from a year earlier, according to a statement
on the company’s website today.  The results “confirm Lojas Americanas’ impressive ability
to work its mix into very high gross margins and good expense
control,” Juliana Rozenbaum, an analyst at Banco Itau BBA SA,
wrote in a report note to clients today. B2W showed “sustained
weakness” that overshadows the “strength” of Lojas Americanas,
said Rozenbaum, who has a “market perform” recommendation for
both Lojas Americanas and B2W.  Lojas Americanas preferred shares fell 1 percent to 18.12
reais in  Sao Paulo  at 11:22 a.m. as B2W dropped for a sixth day
in seven, losing 4.8 percent to 10.02 reais. Lojas Americanas
 jumped  28 percent this year before today, compared with B2W’s 17
percent gain and an 18 percent rise in the Bovespa benchmark
index.  B2W Questioned  Net sales rose 7 percent to 3.14 billion reais, while B2W
sales rose 2 percent to 1.18 billion reais. The Rio de Janeiro-
based company opened 90 stores in 2011, below the target of 101
new stores. The company plans to open 400 stores in Brazil
through 2013.  B2W earnings raises questions about its ability to turn
around without further help from the controlling company,
Rozenbaum said.  B2W had logistics problems in 2011 that led to delays in
deliveries. Local regulators temporarily banned the company from
selling goods in the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo states, after
receiving about 20,000 consumers’ complaints, and  Brazil ’s
Justice Ministry is also investigating the delays.  The online retailer result was  slightly better  than the
mean estimate for a net loss of 29 million reais in Bloomberg
survey with ten analysts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
