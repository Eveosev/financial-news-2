China’s economic growth will
probably be slower than the  World Bank  estimates, Dow Jones
reported, citing Bert Hofman, the Washington-based lender’s
chief economist for  East Asia  and Pacific.  The slowdown in China is happening more rapidly than the
World Bank expected and expansion may be less than the 8.4
percent the development lender has projected, according to the
report published on the website of the Wall Street Journal,
citing Hofman in Singapore today.  Developing East Asia could expand 7.5 percent to 7.8
percent this year, from 8.2 percent in 2011, Hofman was cited as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
