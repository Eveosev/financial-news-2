Japan , the world’s biggest buyer of
liquefied natural gas, may double spot imports this month,
according to ship-tracking data.  South Korea ’s imports may fall
by half.  Japan, which boosted spot LNG purchases after last year’s
earthquake and tsunami damaged nuclear  power plants , may receive
six cargoes in  March , compared with three a year ago and seven
last month, according to initial estimates from calculations
based on transmissions from ships captured by AISLive on
Bloomberg and data from the Ministry of Finance.  Japan, which got about 30 percent of its power from atomic
stations before the quake, may have no reactors running by the
end of next months after the worst radiation leaks since
Chernobyl in the 1980s triggered safety checks.  Japan paid about $864 a metric ton for spot purchases in
January, buying a record number of about 18 cargoes, according
to calculations based on Japan’s customs data.  South Korea, the world’s second-biggest LNG buyer, may
receive at least five spot cargoes in  March , down from 10 a year
earlier and six in February, shipping figures and data from the
Korean International Trade Association website show.  The nation’s short-term and spot purchases rose by 20
percent to 6 million tons in 2011, according to the data from
the Korean International website. Korea paid $752 a ton for
immediate supplies, according TO customs data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
