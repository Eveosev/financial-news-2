Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , Poland’s second-
biggest oil refiner, dropped the most in three weeks after a
report that the Treasury Ministry isn’t planning to sell its 53
percent stake this year or next.  The shares lost as much as 2.7 percent, the most since Feb.
10, to 27.15 zloty and traded 1.9 percent lower at 12:10 p.m. in
Warsaw.  Poland doesn’t plan to sell its holding in the Gdansk-based
company by 2013, the Polish Press Agency reported, citing
Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski.  “Bad news, because it could discourage speculation on a
possible attractive tender offered by for example Polskie
Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo,” Kamil Kliszcz, a Warsaw-based
analyst at DI BRE Bank SA wrote in a morning note to clients
today.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN) , Poland’s biggest refiner, and  Polskie
Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA , the country’s dominant gas
company, can’t be ruled out as potential buyers, Budzanowski was
cited as saying in Puls Biznesu newspaper on Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
