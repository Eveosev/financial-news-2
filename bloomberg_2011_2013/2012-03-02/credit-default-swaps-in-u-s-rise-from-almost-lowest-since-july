A benchmark gauge of U.S. credit
risk rose from almost the lowest level in more than seven months
amid concern weakness in the euro-area economy will damp the
global recovery.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
increased 1.1 basis points to a mid-price of 93.9 basis points
at 3:51 p.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd.  The gauge advanced as a report showed  Germany ’s retail
sales unexpectedly decreased in January.  Spain  raised its budget
deficit target for 2012, breaching its commitment with its
European partners, as a deepening economic slump hampered
efforts to rein in the euro area’s fourth-biggest shortfall.  The swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, touched 92.2
basis points yesterday, the lowest level on an intraday basis
since July 22. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a
borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
stress in credit markets, fell 1.12 basis points to 25 basis
points. The spread narrows when investors favor assets such as
corporate bonds and rises when they seek the perceived safety of
 government securities .  To contact the reporter on this story:
