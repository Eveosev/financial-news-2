Ukraine’s grain exports fell by 11
percent to 1.7 million metric tons last month from 1.9 million
tons in January as wheat shipments declined, the country’s
Agrarian Confederation said.  Shipments included 1.3 million tons of corn, 340,000 tons
of wheat, and 40,000 tons of barley, Sergey Stoianov, director
of the producers’ group, said in e-mailed statement yesterday.
Wheat exports were 540,000 tons in January.  Grain exports from Ukraine since the marketing year started
on July 1 were 13.5 million tons, of which 7.7 million tons were
corn, 3.6 million tons wheat and 2 million tons barley,
according to the statement.  Rapeseed exports reached 1 million tons in the eight months
of the marketing year from July through February, Stoianov said,
without giving a comparison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
