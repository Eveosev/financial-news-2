What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that rain next
week from  Texas  to  Nebraska  will boost soil moisture for winter
crops,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open down 2 cents to 3 cents a
bushel in Chicago on signs that U.S. farmers have stepped up
sales after spot prices jumped to the highest in almost three
months, Schultz said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT as the rally to a five-month high this week encouraged
more sales by U.S. farmers, Schultz said. Rains stabilized
yields in dry areas of  South America .  Soybean-oil  futures are
expected to open 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a pound lower, and
soybean-meal futures may open steady to $1 lower per 2,000
pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
