IG Metall ,  Europe ’s biggest trade
union, asked the German government to soften planned cuts to
solar subsidies to avoid an increase risk of bankruptcies.  A plan to curb subsidies by as much as 29 percent this
month may spread insecurity with investors and fail to reduce
costs substantially, IG Metall, which represents about 3.6
million workers, said today in a letter to Environment Minister
Norbert Roettgen and Economy Minister Philipp Roesler.  German companies are already facing “liquidity issues up
to looming insolvencies,” IG Metall said. “We expect further
cuts to make this situation worse.”  Germany , home to manufacturers including  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  and
Conergy AG, should instead provide state loans for domestic
companies to help them survive the threat posed by Chinese
competition, the union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
