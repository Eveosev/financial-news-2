The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  fell 1.2 percent to settle at 704.37

percent to 1,647.35.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell the most this year as President  Barack Obama 
said a pre-emptive strike on  Iran  might generate “sympathy”
for the Persian Gulf country, easing concern that an attack
would take place.  Obama said in an interview with the Atlantic magazine that
a strike without warning might allow Iran to portray itself as a
victim. Oil also declined as the dollar rose before reports next
week that may show U.S. economic growth.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil futures for April
