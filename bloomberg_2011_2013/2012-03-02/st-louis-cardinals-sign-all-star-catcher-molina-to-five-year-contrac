All-Star catcher Yadier Molina
signed a five-year contract with the  St. Louis Cardinals , the
team said on its website.  The team declined to disclose terms. The accord is worth
$75 million with a mutual option for 2018 worth $15 million,
ranking the 29-year-old second among catchers behind  Joe Mauer 
of the  Minnesota Twins , who signed an eight-year deal worth $184
million, ESPN reported.  Drafted by the Cardinals in 2000, four-time Gold Glove
winner Molina is also a three-time National League All-Star. He
had career highs with a .305 batting average, 14 home runs and
65 runs batted in last season.  “Yadier possesses game-changing ability both in the field
and at the plate,” said Cardinals’ General Manager John Mozeliak. “Yadier has proven to be a special talent when it
comes to the all-important challenges of the catcher position.”  Molina, drafted by the Cardinals in 2000, leads Major
League Baseball catchers in stolen-base percentage (39 percent)
and pick-offs (38) since 2005. In 944 career games, he has a.274
batting average, 55 home runs and 390 RBIs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
