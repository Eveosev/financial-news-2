The “troika” of the European
Commission,  International Monetary Fund  and European Central
Bank will have a permanent presence in Greece, Eurogroup Working
Group head  Thomas Wieser  told Austria’s Format magazine.  “A permanent presence of the troika on site to monitor the
reforms will definitely be the case for several years,” Wieser
was cited as saying.  Wieser also told the Vienna-based magazine that he is
“optimistic” that the Greek economy will grow again in 2013,
“be it at a slow pace.” From the middle of the century, growth
will “speed up,” he said according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
