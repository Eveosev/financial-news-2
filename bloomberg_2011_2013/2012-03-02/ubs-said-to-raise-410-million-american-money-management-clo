UBS AG (UBSN)  raised a $410 million
collateralized loan obligation for American Money Management
Corp., according to two people with knowledge of the deal.  The CLO includes a $267.6 million slice rated AAA by
Standard & Poor’s that pays a coupon of 149 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Torie von Alt, a UBS spokeswoman, didn’t return a telephone
call seeking comment.  The sale of the fund was reported earlier by Reuters and
S&P Leveraged Commentary & Data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
