Marriott International Inc. (MAR)  was sued
in New York state court for breach of contract over the
$200 million renovation of the Eden Roc Renaissance Hotel in
 Miami Beach ,  Florida .  Eden Roc LLLP is seeking more than $16 million in
compensatory damages and a declaration that it can terminate an
agreement with Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott governing the
operation of the  hotel , according to documents filed in New York
State Supreme Court today.  Eden Roc accuses Marriott of inducing it to spend more than
$200 million to renovate the hotel, including adding a new guest
tower, a spa, meeting and banquet rooms, and a restaurant.
Marriott then developed two new “boutique” hotel brands in
direct competition with Eden Roc, according to the court filing.  Marriott also “grossly mismanaged” the hotel and
implemented a “fatally flawed strategy” in which about
80 percent of transient room nights were sold at a discount
during the past three years, Eden Roc said. Transient rooms are
booked by individual guests, rather than groups.  Marriott didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message
seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Eden Roc LLLP v. Marriot International,
650624/2012, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
