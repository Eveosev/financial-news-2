American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer majority owned by the U.S. government, sold a $500
million stake in  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , according to a person
familiar with the matter.  AIG, based in  New York , exited the stake in a block trade
before U.S. markets opened, said the person, who declined to be
identified because he isn’t permitted to speak about the
transaction. AIG notified Blackstone in 2010 that it would
convert 35.7 million Blackstone partnership units into common
shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  AIG has sold non-U.S. life insurers, a consumer lender, an
asset manager and other businesses to help repay a 2008 U.S.
government rescue that swelled to $182.3 billion. Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , 67, is seeking to convince
investors of the potential of remaining units, including global
property-casualty insurer Chartis Inc. and domestic life
insurance operations, as the U.S. Treasury Department works to
exit its majority stake.  The sale removes a “major overhang” on Blackstone’s
shares and makes way for “clearer sailing,”  William Katz , a
Citigroup Inc. analyst, said in a note to clients today. “We
continue to see Blackstone as best positioned among publicly
traded Alternatives Managers,” Katz wrote.  Previous Sale  Christine Anderson , a spokeswoman for Blackstone, declined
to comment on the transaction, citing legal restrictions. Mark
Herr, a spokesman for AIG, also declined to comment. The CNBC
cable network reported the sale earlier today.  The insurer previously sold 10 million Blackstone shares
for $134.1 million, hours after they were converted from
partnership units on Dec. 15, 2010, according to a Form 4 filed
at the time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  AIG’s investment in Blackstone dates to July 1998, when the
insurer announced it would pay $150 million to acquire a 7
percent stake in the New York-based buyout firm, which was
formed by  Peter Peterson  and  Stephen Schwarzman  in 1985 to
provide merger advice. At the time, AIG also committed $1.2
billion to Blackstone buyout funds, the first of which was
formed in 1987.  Blackstone fell 2.8 percent to close at $15.29 in New York
trading. The stock has gained 9.1 percent this year, compared
with an 8.9 percent increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
