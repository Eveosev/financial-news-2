Cyprus will have talks with a
potential investor who has shown interest in buying government
securities worth about 500 million euros ($660 million), Finance
Minister Kikis Kazamias said.  Other foreign investors and contacts have also expressed
“interest to invest in Cypriot government securities of defined
maturity,” Kazamias told reporters in Nicosia today, adding
that he has a meeting with a potential investor scheduled for
today.  Politis, a Nicosia-based newspaper, reported today that
Kazamias will meet a Thai businessman interested in investing as
much as 500 million euros.  Kazamias said other countries and financial institutions
have also shown interest.  Cyprus, which was shut out of international markets in May,
resorted to a 2.5 billion-euro bilateral loan from  Russia  to
finance its fiscal deficit and to refinance maturing debt this
year. The  finance ministry  is targeting a fiscal gap of 2.5
percent of gross domestic product this year, compared with about
6 percent in 2011.  Kazamias said that if there is another bilateral inter-
state loan, he will inform the European Union  “thoroughly and
in good time.”  The minister added that he will consider it a success if
Cyprus regains access to international markets “before the end
of 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
