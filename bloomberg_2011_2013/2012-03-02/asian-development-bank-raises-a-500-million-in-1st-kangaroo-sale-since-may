Asian Development Bank  sold A$500
million ($540 million) of 10-year kangaroo bonds in its first
offering of the securities in nine months.  The 5 percent notes were priced to yield 99.5 basis points
more than similar-maturity government debt, according to an e-
mailed statement from  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , which helped manage
the sale. The Manila-based lender last sold bonds in  Australia 
in May, when it issued A$650 million of 2014 notes, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  ADB joins the World Bank and European Investment Bank in
returning to the kangaroo bond market after the extra yield
investors demand to hold Australian dollar-denominated quasi-
government debt rather than federal government securities shrank
28 basis points in February to 102 basis points, the biggest
monthly drop in Bank of America Merrill Lynch data started in
1996. Spreads for similar securities worldwide narrowed nine
basis points to 81 in the same period.  Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank also sold bonds in Australia
today, with Germanyâ€™s agency for agribusiness pricing A$250
million of 5.5 percent March 2020 notes, according to an e-
mailed statement from Deutsche Bank AG, which helped manage the
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
