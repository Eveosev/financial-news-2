 Hungarian state-owned electricity
wholesaler MVM Zrt. may represent the country in talks on
imports of Russian gas if it takes over the local gas unit of
 Germany ’s  E.ON AG (EOAN) ,  Napi Gazdasag  reported.  The contract between E.ON and  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  is set to expire
in 2015, the newspaper said, citing an interview with Pal Kovacs, state secretary at the Development Ministry.  “In relation to talks aimed at buying the gas business of
E.ON, it seems there may be a radically different situation from
2015,” Kovacs said. “We are now looking at the possibilities
of state involvement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
