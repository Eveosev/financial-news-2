Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped for a
second day and bonds fell on concern the government’s plan to
reduce fuel subsidies will re-ignite inflation in  Southeast
Asia ’s biggest economy.  Policy makers will discuss raising energy prices when the
2012 state budget is revised this month, Hatta Rajasa,
coordinating minister for the economy, said last week. Bank
Indonesia forecasts that raising fuel prices by 1,500 rupiah
($0.17) a liter will add 2.4 percent to inflation, Deputy
Governor Halim Alamsyah said today. The central bank, which has
cut  interest rates  three times in a year, is prepared to respond
to a surge in prices if needed, Alamsyah said yesterday.  “We’ve probably seen the end of Bank Indonesia’s rate
cuts,” said Charlie Lay, an economist and currency strategist
at Commerzbank Securities in  Singapore . “The focus now is very
much on the effect of the fuel-price adjustment.”  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 9,088 per dollar as of 4:08
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency gained 0.3 percent this week.  Inflation slowed to 3.56 percent last month from 3.65
percent in January, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said
yesterday.  The government will propose a revised inflation target of 6
percent to 7 percent this year, from 5.3 percent earlier, and a
price assumption for crude oil to $105 a barrel from $90 a
barrel in the amended budget, Rajasa said yesterday.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.56
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association. The yield rose 10 basis points this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
