The  Polish economy  probably grew
more than the 4.3 percent already estimated for 2011 as a weaker
zloty helped absorb the “shock” of the European debt crisis,
central bank Governor Marek Belka said.  “Last year’s growth of 4.3 percent -- that’s probably
going to be revised upward somewhat,” Belka said today at the
French International Relations Institute in Paris. “Within the
year, we saw no signs of a slowdown whatsoever.”  The European Union’s largest eastern nation was the only
member of the 27-member bloc to dodge a recession in 2009. It
has benefited from EU funds to improve infrastructure and
modernize production, while a weaker zloty has boosted exports
even as its main trading partners grapple with a debt crisis.  The zloty climbed 0.55 percent to $3.0991 at 11:12 a.m. in
Paris. Against the euro, the currency added 0.13 percent, to
4.1091, its first gain in more than a week.  Growth will probably slow moderately in 2012, Belka said.
“This year the economy will perform pretty well, too,” he
said. “We expect a slowdown, but everyone expects a slowdown.”  Belka also said the main medium-term concern for Polish
policy makers is the euro area’s ability to evolve and address
its internal imbalances.  “We are confident we can continue to grow well in the
years ahead,” he said. “We’re very happy with  Germany . Our
only worry is the future of the  euro zone . I’m optimistic about
the existential aspect of the euro zone. The euro zone will not
collapse. But it’s a source of instability for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
