The European Union recognized the
Syrian National Council as a “legitimate representative of
Syrians,” the 27-nation bloc said in draft conclusions from a
summit in Brussels today.  “The European Union supports the Syrian opposition in its
struggle for freedom, dignity and democracy, recognizes the
Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of
Syrians and calls upon all members of the Syrian opposition to
unite in its peaceful struggle,” a sentence added to the draft
conclusions overnight said.  Individual members of the EU, including the U.K., have
already recognized the SNC. British Prime Minister  David Cameron 
has said that the lack of a united opposition movement is one of
the reasons why the Syrian uprising is more complicated than the
situation in  Libya , where Muammar Qaddafi was ousted last year
with the support of an international coalition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
