Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)  sold senior
unsecured bonds for the first time since 2011 as three-year
loans from the  European Central Bank  buoy the region’s lenders.  The Spanish bank issued 750 million euros ($990 million) of
18-month senior unsecured bonds that were priced to yield 275
basis points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Madrid-based bank joined Italy’s UniCredit SpA and
Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA in selling unsecured debt
after the market was virtually shut to lenders from  Europe ’s
peripheral nations before the ECB’s first so-called longer-term
refinancing operation in December. The central bank has now
pumped 1 trillion euros into the region’s financial system,
helping drive down bank and government borrowing costs.  “There’s been a flurry of issuance from peripheral banks
that had previously been closed out,” said Roger Doig, an
analyst at London-based Schroders Plc.  Banco Popular  last issued unsecured debt in April 2011 when
it sold 500 million euros of two-year bonds to yield 240 basis
points more than mid-swaps.  A spokesman for Banco Popular in Madrid, who declined to be
identified citing company policy, wouldn’t comment. Bankia SA,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Natixis and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc managed the deal with Banco Popular.  To contact the reporter on this story:
