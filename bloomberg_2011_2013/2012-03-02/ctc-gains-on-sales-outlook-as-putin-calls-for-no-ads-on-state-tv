CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , the owner of
 Russia ’s fourth-largest television channel, rose on speculation
revenue will increase after Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
state television should stop running advertisements.  “State television should give up advertising and it should
be replaced by some other content,” Putin said at a March 1
meeting with supporters in Moscow,  Komsomolskaya Pravda  reported
on its website.  CTC led advances on the  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 index  this
week, climbing 7.2 percent to $10.94 in New York after rising
0.8 percent today. An end to ads on state television may boost
revenue at CTC as companies look for other outlets to showcase
their products, Vladimir Kuznetsov, an analyst at UniCredit SpA
in Moscow, said today in an e-mailed note.  “If Putin’s wish is implemented, this potentially would
seriously boost CTC Media’s pricing power, as currently state-
owned and controlled channels have over 40 percent of the $4.4
billion-a-year TV ad market,” wrote Kuznetsov, who rates the
stock “buy” with a price target of $17.10 a share.  Putin’s office didn’t answer a telephone call seeking
comment after the close of normal business hours in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
