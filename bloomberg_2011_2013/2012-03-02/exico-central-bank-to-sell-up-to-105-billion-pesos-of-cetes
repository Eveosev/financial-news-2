Mexico â€™s central bank plans to sell
as much as 105 billion pesos ($8.2 billion) of Treasury bills
next week as part of its efforts to manage the amount of cash in
the financial system.  The auction of the government bills, known as Cetes, is
scheduled for March 7, the central bank said today on its
 website . Policy makers plan to sell as much as 50 billion pesos
of 98-day notes and 54.8 billion pesos of 336-day securities.  The bank has been auctioning Cetes once per quarter to help
control the  money supply  since December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
