Europe ´s move to support a second
rescue for  Greece  and introduce refinancing options probably
will calm tensions in the short term, Min Zhu, deputy managing
director of the  International Monetary Fund , said in speech.  “A strategy for Greece has now been articulated, which
should gradually restore growth and secure improvements in debt
sustainability,” he said in prepared remarks distributed by his
press office today. “We need to recognize that the challenges
remain massive given Greece’s huge debts, large financing needs,
and weak competitiveness and growth.”  Europe still needs to modify policies to boost growth, he
said in the March 1 speech, adding lower consumer price
pressures provide room to ease monetary policy further. The
 European Central Bank  must be open to implementing
“unconventional” policies, he said.  The global economy will expand 3.25 percent this year, he
said. The Euro area will enter a “mild” recession and other
advanced economies face “weak and bumpy growth” prospects, he
said. The U.S. probably will go through a “tepid” recovery as
downside risks predominate, while growth in emerging countries
will moderate, he said.  The deputy managing director is participating March 1 and 2
in a meeting with IMF officials and policy makers on ways to
improve financial stability in Latin America. The meeting is in
Punta del Este, Uruguay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
