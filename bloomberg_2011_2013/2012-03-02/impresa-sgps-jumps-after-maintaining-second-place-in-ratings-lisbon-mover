Impresa SGPS SA (IPR)  rose the most in
more than seven weeks in Lisbon trading after saying that it
maintained second place in  Portugal ’s television-audience
ratings last month.  Impresa  jumped  14 percent to 56 euro cents, its biggest
gain since January 9.  The company’s SIC channel maintained its ranking among
Portugal’s free-to-air broadcasters, behind Media Capital SGPS
SA’s TVI, as its audience share declined to 22.7 percent in
February from 22.9 percent a year earlier, the Lisbon-based
company said on its website.  “The fact that they kept the second place could be helping
the stock,” Pedro Oliveira, a trader at Go Bulling in Oporto,
Portugal, said today in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
