The  Federal Reserve  extended the
comment period on a proposed rule to implement “enhanced
prudential standards and early remediation requirements” under
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  The Fed extended the comment period to April 30 from March
31, according to a Fed statement today in  Washington .  The proposed rule, published in January, focuses on
capital, liquidity, single counterparty credit limits, stress
testing, risk management and early remediation requirements.  The Fed said it extended the comment period to “allow
interested persons more time to analyze the issues and prepare
their comments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
