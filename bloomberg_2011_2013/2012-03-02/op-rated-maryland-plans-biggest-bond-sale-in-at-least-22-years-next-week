Maryland (STOMD1) , one of nine states with a
AAA general-obligation debt grade from  Standard & Poor’s , plans
to sell as much as $922 million of tax-exempt bonds next week in
its biggest offering since at least 1990.  The sale includes $600 million in bonds for capital
projects and grants to local governments for schools, community
colleges and jails, according to  offering documents .  “We’re doing more new money because we’re using the money
more quickly than we have been in the past, with good interest
rates and trying to boost jobs and employment,” Treasurer Nancy Kopp said in a telephone interview.  The state had a  6.7 percent  December jobless rate that was
less than the 8.5 percent national average.  The issue’s longest maturity is a 15-year portion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on top-rated 15-
year municipal bonds fell to  2.98 percent  last month, the lowest
since at least 1991, Bloomberg Fair Value data show.  About $322 million is intended to refund debt, a smaller
amount than originally planned, Kopp said. A Moody’s Investors
Service report from Feb. 22 said  Maryland  would be issuing $500
million for refunding.  The decision on selling refunding debt “depends on the
market conditions on that particular day,” Kopp said. The state
won’t issue the bonds unless it can achieve at least 3 percent
in present-value savings, she said.  Maryland sold about $656 million in March 2005, its largest
issue to date, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
