The U.S., the worldâ€™s biggest
economy, is fourth in global infrastructure due to its low
scores in three out of 10 criteria, according to Bloomberg
Rankings data.  The U.S. lags behind the leaders in ratios for roads paved
as a percentage of total roads, density of roads as a percentage
of land area and the number of railway passengers transported
times kilometers traveled.  The ranking examines the current state of basic air, road
and rail infrastructure in terms of quantity and distance of
goods transported and passengers carried.  Germany tops the ranking, followed by France and the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
