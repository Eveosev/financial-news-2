TNK-BP,  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russian oil venture
with a group of billionaires, halted oil supplies to its Linik
refinery in Ukraine during maintenance, a week after threatening
to shut the plant for losing money.  Deliveries to the refinery in the city of Lisichansk were
suspended yesterday, the company’s Kiev press office said in an
e-mailed response to questions today.  Linik can process 140,575 barrels of crude a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  TNK-BP will consider whether the refinery, which lost $23
million last year, can be run profitably after closing the plant
for three months for repairs, TNK-BP Chief Financial Officer
 Jonathan Muir  told reporters on Feb. 29. Linik has continued to
be unprofitable in the first quarter of this year, and lost $68
million in 2010, the Moscow-based venture said in an e-mailed
statement on Feb. 24.  TNK-BP planned to close its plant in March for maintenance
after repeated calls for the Ukrainian government to aid
refiners, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
