Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ,  Europe ’s
biggest discount airline, bought back 39 million euros ($52
million) worth of stock yesterday as part of a program to use
extra cash.  The company bought 9.5 million shares at an average 4.11
euros apiece, Dublin-based Ryanair said today in a statement.
That compares with the closing price of 4.20 euros yesterday,
when Ryanair stock rose 2.2 percent in the biggest increase
since Feb. 15.  The carrier will probably spend 100 million euros to 200
million euros on share buybacks and pay a second special
dividend, Chief Executive Officer  Michael O’Leary  said on a call
with analysts Jan. 30.  The highest price Ryanair paid in yesterday’s buyback was
4.13 euros a share, and the lowest price was 4.10 euros, the
airline said. After canceling the shares, Ryanair will have 1.46
billion shares in issue.  The carrier raised its full-year profit forecast Jan. 30
after winter capacity cuts helped reduce costs and boost fares.
The airline aims to post net income of 480 million euros in the
year ending March 31, 40 million euros higher than the previous
target.  Ryanair declined as much as 1.2 percent to 4.15 euros and
was trading down 0.2 percent at 9:12 a.m. in Dublin. The stock
has gained 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
