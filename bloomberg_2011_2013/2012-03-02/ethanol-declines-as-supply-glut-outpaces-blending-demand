Ethanol futures declined in  Chicago 
as supply outpaced demand for the biofuel.  Futures slipped following an Energy Department report that
 supply  rose for an 11th consecutive week to a record 22 million
barrels in the week ended Feb. 24.  Production of conventional
gasoline blended with ethanol , a proxy for blending beyond
government requirements, climbed to 5.2 million barrels a day,
the highest since Dec. 23.  “We’re blending as much as we can, but we’re still
building stocks,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant with INTL
FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 0.4 cent to $2.26
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have gained 2.6
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago added 2.5 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.245 a gallon and in  New York  the additive
decreased 1 cent to $2.30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 1 cent to $2.285 a
gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel declined 0.5 cent to
$2.345.  The U.S. is required to use 13.2 billion gallons of
renewable fuels such as ethanol this year.  Production (DOETFETH)  at 896,000
barrels a day as of last week is equal to 13.7 billion gallons
of the fuel on an annualized basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
