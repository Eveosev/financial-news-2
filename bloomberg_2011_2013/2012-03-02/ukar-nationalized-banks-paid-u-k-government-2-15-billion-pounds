UK Asset Resolution Ltd. , which owns
the U.K.’s fully nationalized banks, said it repaid 2.15 billion
pounds ($3.4 billion) of the debt it owes the British government
in 2011.  Profit before tax, excluding gains on the repurchase of the
lender’s own debt, rose to 1.09 billion pounds from 444 million
pounds on lower impairment charges for bad loans,  UKAR said  in a
statement today. Bradford & Bingley Plc’s pretax profit climbed
18 percent to 299.2 million pounds, while Northern Rock (Asset
Management) Plc had pretax profit of 789.9 million pounds, up
from 191.3 million pounds.  “The low interest-rate environment does help tremendously,
but also we have put a huge amount of effort into arrears
management,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Banks said in a
telephone interview today. “We have spent a lot of time working
with non-fee-charging debt advisors and pointing customers in
their direction.”  UKAR is seeking to repay 46.6 billion pounds to the British
taxpayer and plans to run off or sell the majority of its
customer loans. It was formed in 2010, holding mortgages from
Bradford & Bingley and  Northern Rock  after they were taken over
by the state and providing a single management structure.  Impairment charges declined to 390.4 million pounds from
1.09 billion pounds.  The lender bought back at a discount some of the debt its
two banks issued before being nationalized. The lender has made
a number of tenders since then at an average of 46 percent of
face value, Finance Director Phillip McLelland said by phone.
Gains on these purchases fell 60 percent to 338.1 million
pounds.  UKAR said in December it will close one of its three sites
as it reduces the number of mortgages it manages. Some of the
700 jobs at the site in Gosforth, north-eastern  England , will be
lost, though “the majority” of the workers will be asked to
work at other sites, UKAR said.  Northern Rock Plc separated from Northern Rock (Asset
Management) in 2010 and was bought by  Richard Branson ’s Virgin
Money Holdings U.K. Ltd. in November for 747 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
