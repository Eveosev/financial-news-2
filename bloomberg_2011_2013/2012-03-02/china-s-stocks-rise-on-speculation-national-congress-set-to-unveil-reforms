China’s stocks  rose, capping the
benchmark index’s longest weekly winning streak since 2009, amid
speculation the government may introduce policies to support
economic growth at a national congress next week.  Hisense Electric Co. (600060)  and  Qingdao Haier Co. (600690)  led an advance
among home appliance makers, bolstered by optimism government
stimulus will raise consumer demand.  China Shenhua Energy Co. (601088) ,
the country’s biggest coal producer, advanced the most in a week
after saying it will buy stakes in companies from its parent.
 Air China Ltd. (601111) , the largest international carrier, gained 1.4
percent after HSBC Holdings Plc recommended buying shares of
airlines on the earnings outlook and valuations.  “Investors are hoping there’ll be more reforms that may
boost the market,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager 
at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “For
instance, home appliances may benefit if they have policies to
increase consumption. Better liquidity these days is also
helping the market reach highs.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 34.6 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,460.69 at the close, the highest since Nov. 17.
The gauge added 0.9 percent this week, a seventh week of gains
and the longest winning streak since July 2009. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 1.8 percent to 2,679.93. The  value  of stock
traded in  Shanghai  exceeded its 30-day average each day in
February except for one, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Shanghai index  advanced 5.9 percent last month, capping
its biggest monthly gain since October 2010, on the prospect the
central bank will add to a Feb. 18 cut in  reserve requirements 
to halt a decline in economic growth. For the year, the measure
has rebounded 12 percent and trades at 10.2 times estimated
profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on Jan. 6,
 weekly data  compiled by Bloomberg showed.  ‘Cautious, Prudent’  The National People’s Congress, whose annual meeting will
run for a week and a half, is legally the highest governmental
body in  China . Its members are some of China’s most powerful
politicians and executives, wielding power in their home
provinces and weighing in on proposals such as whether to impose
a nationwide property tax.  “It is expected that the committee will continue to adopt
cautious and prudent macroeconomic policy in order to ensure a
soft landing and economic stability,” Alan Lam, an analyst at
Bank Julius Baer & Co., which helps oversee about $304 billion
worldwide, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Barclays Plc said investors should buy Chinese consumer
directionary stocks over consumer staples before the NPC as real
wage inflation may help consumers spend more on discretionary
products.  Hisense, China’s biggest maker of flat-panel televisions,
surged 5.2 percent to a record 21.07 yuan. Qingdao Haier,
China’s biggest refrigerator maker, jumped 5.4 percent to 11.57
yuan, the highest close since Aug. 25.  Property Controls  China Vanke Co. (000002) , the nation’s largest listed property
developer, advanced 4 percent to 8.63 yuan after the Economic
Observer reported the company has set an “internal target” for
2012 home sales of more than 148 billion yuan ($23.5 billion).
The company’s 2011 actual home sales were 121.5 billion yuan.
Poly Real Estate Group Co., China’s second-largest developer,
rose 4.4 percent to 11.63 yuan.  “Developers are having promotions and the bigger companies
with price advantages will benefit from a rebound in sales,” Li Shaoming, an analyst at China Investment Securities Co., who
described Vanke’s target as “optimistic,” said in a telephone
interview from Shenzhen. “Investors are more keen on blue chips
these days.”  Airlines Outlook  Shenhua Energy gained 1.1 percent to 27.81 yuan, after
saying it will buy stakes in three companies and rail cars from
parent Shenhua Group Corp. for 3.45 billion yuan. A gauge of
energy shares in the CSI 300 climbed 1.9 percent, the third most
of 10 industries. Brent oil for April settlement surged as much
as 4.7 percent to $128.40 yesterday, the highest price since
July 2008.  Air China increased 1.4 percent to 7.10 yuan. Investors
should buy shares of China’s airlines as the companies have a
“robust” earnings outlook for this year and are trading at or
below book value, according to HSBC. The bank kept an
“overweight” rating for Air China.  Hainan Airlines Co. (600221) , backed by the government of China’s
Hainan province, gained 2.2 percent to 5.21 yuan. The carrier
may swap Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner orders for larger 747-8s
following delivery delays, said Chen Feng, the chairman of its
parent.  Manufacturing Data  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. rose, led by  Seaspan
Corp. (SSW) , after government data showed China’s manufacturing
expanded for a third month. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of
the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. added 0.4 percent
yesterday. Seaspan, a Hong Kong-based container ship operator,
soared to a 10-month high as plans to boost a quarterly dividend
and buy back shares spurred two analysts to reiterate “buy”
recommendations.  China’s  purchasing managers’ index  rose to 51.0 last month,
from 50.5 in January, government data released yesterday showed.
Above the 50 level that is the threshold for expansion, the
February reading was the highest since September and beat a 50.9
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Bloomberg China-US 55 measure sunk 8.3 percent last year as
 Europe ’s debt crisis and sluggish U.S. growth damped prospects
for the world’s largest exporter, where the economy expanded at
the slowest pace for 10 quarters at the end of 2011.  “The PMI was obviously encouraging and China is going to
have a soft landing in decent growth,” Greg Lesko, who manages
$700 million at Deltec Asset Management in  New York  including
investments in Chinese stocks, said in a phone interview
yesterday.  Monetary Policies  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., was little changed at $40.32
yesterday, after advancing 3.8 percent last month. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.6 percent to 1,374.09, extending a
three-month rally, after government data showed that U.S.
jobless claims declined to a four-year low.  Chinese economic growth is expected to slow to about 8.5
percent this year, from 9.2 percent in 2011, China’s Ministry of
Industry and  Information Technology  said on Feb. 29. Policy
makers are already loosening monetary policy to ease access to
credit for smaller businesses, cutting the amount of cash large
banks need to keep in reserve for the second time since December
on Feb. 24. Benchmark rates have been on hold since July.  “They are going to loosen more on the fiscal side than the
monetary side because they still want to see housing prices
stay,” Deltec Asset’s Lesko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
