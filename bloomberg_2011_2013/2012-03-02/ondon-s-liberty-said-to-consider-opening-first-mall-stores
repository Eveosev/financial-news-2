Liberty (LBE) , the 137-year-old  London 
department-store company known for its Tudor-style building and
luxury fabrics, is considering opening smaller-format stores in
London shopping malls to capitalize on Olympics-related demand,
according to three people familiar with the matter.  Liberty, owned by London-based private-equity firm  BlueGem
Capital Partners LLP , is looking at two premium locations,
according to one person, who couldn’t be identified because the
deals haven’t been completed. Liberty declined to comment.  The  retailer ’s 70,000 square-foot (6,500 square-meter)
Regent Street store sells products from international and
British designers such as Vivienne Westwood alongside its own
Liberty London range. A previous satellite store was closed in
2009 after one year when the retailer received an offer on the
lease of the outlet on London’s Sloane Street.  Visa  Europe  predicts that U.K. consumer spending will
increase by an additional 750 million pounds ($1.2 billion)
during the seven weeks spanning the Olympic and Paralympic
Games. The games start in London on July 27.  The Liberty department store, established by Arthur Liberty
in 1875, sells luxury items such as 955-pound Peter Pilotto silk
dresses on six floors. BlueGem acquired the retailer in 2010,
including the company’s wholesale fabrics business. BlueGem was
established in 2006 by former Merrill Lynch bankers including
Marco Capello and Emilio Di Spiezio Sardo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
