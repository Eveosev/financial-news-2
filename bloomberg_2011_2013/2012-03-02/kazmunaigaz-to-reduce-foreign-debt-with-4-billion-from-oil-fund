KazMunaiGaz National Co. (KMGZ)  will be
able to cut its foreign debt by raising $4 billion from
 Kazakhstan ’s National Oil Fund, according to its parent,
sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna.  The state energy producer will sell two tranches of bonds
to the National Oil Fund in 2013 and 2015. The notes will comply
with an “international format, allowing for increased yields
and exceptional liquidity for National Oil Fund investments,”
Samruk-Kazyna, which holds the government’s 100 percent in
KazMunaiGaz, said in an e-mailed statement today. The National
Oil Fund is managed by the central bank.  KazMunaiGaz will use the funds for the Kashagan oil field
development, President  Nursultan Nazarbayev ’s press office said
this week. The Astana-based oil producer has $3.2 billion in
bonds and loans coming due next year and has a total of $13.4
billion of  debt , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  KazMunaiGaz plans to increase investment spending 7 percent
to $3.8 billion this year, followed by $2.3 billion in 2013,
according to Raiffeisen Research. The company may consider
buying back its Eurobonds due in 2015 “given the rather high
coupon rate,” Raiffeisen analyst Alexander Sklemin said in a
Dec. 14 report.  Samruk-Kazyna didn’t elaborate on how KazMunaiGaz’s debt
may be lowered in the statement. Sayora Iskakova, an Astana-
based spokeswoman for the fund, declined to comment when
Bloomberg News called.  To contact the reporter on this story:
