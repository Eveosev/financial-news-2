  AB Klaipedos Nafta (KNF1L) , which operates
Lithuania’s oil terminal on the  Baltic Sea , signed an agreement
with Norway’s Hoegh LNG to lease a vessel for the country’s
planned floating liquefied-natural-gas terminal.  Hoegh will provide a floating storage regasification unit,
maintenance and a vessel crew, the Klaipeda-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. Operations are  planned to start
at the end of 2014, it said.  The Baltic nation is working to diversify its imports from
Russia’s OAO Gazprom, its sole supplier. The country imports all
of its gas from Russia. It will lease the vessel from Hoegh for
10 years and then will have the right to buy the regasification
unit, according to the statement. Klaipedos Nafta is 70.63
percent owned by the state.  “The floating storage regasification unit will help
 Lithuania  reduce its dependency on a single gas supplier and
will grant access to international gas markets,” said Klaipeda
Chief Executive Office Rokas Masiulis in the statement.  The facility will store as much as 170,000 cubic meters of
liquified natural gas, the company said. The 10-year lease of
the vessel will cost $689 million, the  Baltic News Service 
reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
