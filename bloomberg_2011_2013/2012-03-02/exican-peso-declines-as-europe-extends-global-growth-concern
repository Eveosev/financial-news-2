Mexico ’s peso fell the most in a
week after  Spain  raised its budget deficit target for 2012,
fueling concern a slowdown in the euro-region will damp global
expansion.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 12.7672 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:06 p.m. in Mexico City, from 12.7241 yesterday. A close at
that level would be the currency’s biggest drop since Feb. 24.
Today’s decline pared gains for the week to 1.1 percent and to
9.1 percent for the year.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  announced a new
deficit goal of 5.8 percent of gross domestic product, compared
with the 4.4 percent target previously agreed with the European
Union. Euro-area finance ministers authorized yesterday the
region’s bailout fund to issue bonds for the Greek debt
restructuring, the first step in releasing funds from the rescue
package. Concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis helped make the peso
Latin America’s worst-performing major currency in 2011.  The peso is falling as “the market is a bit negative”
today because of European concerns,  Ramon Cordova , a currency
trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, said
in a telephone interview. “There’s fear that Europe will go
into recession, some countries on the periphery of Europe
already are.”  Retail sales in  Germany  declined 1.6 percent from December,
compared with a 0.5 percent gain predicted by economists, the
Federal Statistics Office said today.  Aid Package  With a second Greek aid package wrapped up and the euro
region slipping into recession, the leaders committed to a pro-
growth agenda that sits uneasily with a deficit-control treaty
that was signed today at the 17th summit since the outbreak of
the crisis.  “If all of Europe went into recession and it touched the
U.S. then there’d be a risk of contagion” for Mexico, Cordova
said.  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  The yield on the peso-denominated debt due in 2024 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.54 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.36
centavo to 129.86 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
