Intereuropa Group d.d. , Slovenia’s
main freight distribution company, called on its shareholders to
contribute to a capital increase or back its debt restructuring
talks with banks.  The Koper, Slovenia-based company expects the response from
its owners “as soon as possible,” it said in a regulatory
filing today. It did not specify the amount sought for the
capital boost.  Luka Koper d.d.  is the single largest investor in
 Intereuropa (IEKG)  with a 25 percent holding, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Intereuropa agreed with its creditor
banks to freeze debt repayments until the end of September, the
company said on Feb. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
