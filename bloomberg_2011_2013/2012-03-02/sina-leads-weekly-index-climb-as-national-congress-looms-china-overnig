Chinese U.S.-listed stocks advanced
last week, led by  Sina Corp. (SINA) , on prospects the government will
roll out measures to boost growth in the world’s second-largest
economy at an annual meeting starting today.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 index  of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. was unchanged at 108.61 on March 2 in New
York, gaining 1 percent in the week.  Sina surged 21 percent last week after saying its Twitter-
like Weibo service may start contributing to sales in the second
half and as search engine Baidu Inc. started linking to Sina’s
microblogs. Video sharing website Youku Inc. and ship operator
 Seaspan Corp. (SSW)  jumped more than 16 percent.  Focus Media Holding
Ltd. (FMCN) , a digital advertising company targeted by short seller
Carson Block, rallied 10 percent as analysts predicted fourth-
quarter sales will beat the company’s forecast.  China’s government will release its 2012 budget and Premier
 Wen Jiabao  will deliver an address at a meeting of the National
People’s Congress commencing today. While still the world’s
fastest-growing major economy, China’s gross domestic product
expanded at the slowest pace for 10 quarters in the three months
to the end of 2011 as the European debt crisis and the sluggish
 U.S. economy  cut demand for exports.  “They may talk about high-investment project approval and
roll out measures to help the consumer as growth was a little
bit slower than what they want,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst in
Lisle,  Illinois , at Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which
manages $700 million including Chinese stocks, said by phone on
March 2.  China ETF Weekly Gain  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., was little changed at $40.27
on March 2, gaining 0.3 percent last week, after a similar slump
the week before.  Shanghai-based Sina jumped 6.9 percent on March 2 to a one-
month high of $74.60 in  New York . It was the biggest weekly
advance since the week ended Jan. 13.  Baidu, which handles more than 80 percent of search-engine
queries in China, started displaying links to tweets on Sina’s
microblog platform and other major social-networking websites in
China, Kaiser Kuo, a spokesman at Baidu, said in an e-mail on
March 2.  The “meaningful monetization” of Sina’s Weibo will start
in the second half of this year, Chief Executive Officer Charles Chao said on Feb. 27 on a conference call. Weibo’s registered
users rose by about 50 million to more than 300 million in the
past three months, he said.  ‘Soft Landing’  The company will start a Weibo-based display advertising
system in the second quarter and several fee-based services
beginning in the second half, Chao said. Weibo may contribute
$20 million to $30 million to Sina’s revenue in 2012, Andy Yeung, a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer & Co Inc. wrote
on Feb. 28 in a research note.  China’s economy  may grow 7 percent to 7.5 percent in 2012,
after expanding 9.2 percent last year and 10.4 percent in 2010,
said  Donald Straszheim , head of China research in  Los Angeles  at
International Strategy & Investment Group.  “There’s a soft landing this year in China,” he said by
phone on March 2. “Equities will be higher at the end of year
from where they are now.”  Baidu added 1.8 percent to a two-week high of $141.43 on
March 2. The stock rose 4.9 percent last week, after sliding 1.5
percent the week before.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slipped 0.3 percent to
1,369.63, cutting its weekly advance to 0.3 percent.  Melco Premium  Macau casino operator  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  rose
for a second day in New York, widening the premium over its  Hong
Kong  stock to 3.7 percent, the highest since Feb. 2.
Melco’s American depositary receipts climbed 2.9 percent to
$13.39, while the stock in Hong Kong added 1.8 percent to
HK$33.40 on March 2, the equivalent of $4.31 per share. The
ADRs, each representing three common shares, were up 7.6 percent
last week, the most since the second week of January.  ADRs of  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (1171) , China’s fourth-biggest
producer of the fuel, slipped 0.7 percent to $24.48 on March 2,
after Deutsche Bank AG downgraded the stock to “hold” from
“buy.”  The ADRs, which represent 10 ordinary shares, fell 1.1
percent last week and traded 0.8 percent  below  Yanzhou’s Hong
Kong stock, which rose 0.7 percent on March 2 to HK$19.14, the
equivalent of $2.47. Deutsche Bank analysts cut the 12-month
price target for Yanzhou’s Hong Kong-traded shares to $19.60
from $21.  Yanzhou, based in  China ’s Shandong province, advanced 1.8
percent to 26 yuan on March 2 in Shanghai trading, or $4.13 per
share.  Coal Prices  Benchmark thermal coal prices at Qinhuangdao, China’s
biggest delivery port for the fuel, fell for the third week as
of Feb. 26 as inventories continued to climb on slowing demand.
Prices may fall 5 percent this year and another 10 percent in
2013 as domestic coal production outpaces demand and transport
constraints ease, according to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein
& Co. published in a report on Feb. 21.  Shanghai-based Focus Media’s ADRs have rebounded 70 percent
since Block’s Muddy Waters LLC research group issued its first
report on Nov. 21 accusing the company of overstating the size
of its advertising network and overpaying for acquisitions.
Muddy Waters fifth Focus Media report on Feb. 9 carried similar
allegations. The stock added 21 percent last month, the most
since October.  Youku, Seaspan  The company may report next week that fourth-quarter sales
rose to $224 million, according to the  average forecast  of six
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. That would compare with the
company’s estimate of $212 million to $214 million provided on
Nov. 17. Focus Media ADRs jumped 7 percent to $26.23 on March 2
in New York, capping the best week for gains since the five days
to Feb. 3.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1.4 percent to 2,460.69
on March 2, the highest close since Nov. 17. The gauge added 0.9
percent last week, a seventh week of gains and the longest
winning streak since July 2009.  ADRs of Youku, China’s biggest video-sharing website,
climbed 5.3 percent on March 2 and 16 percent last week to
$26.02, the highest level since Aug. 17. Seaspan, based in Hong
Kong, surged 16 percent in U.S. trading last week to a 11-month
high of $19.48 after plans to boost a quarterly dividend and buy
back shares spurred three analysts to reiterate “buy”
recommendations.  CNinsure Inc. (CISG) , a Chinese insurance agency and brokerage,
tumbled to a three-month low in New York after reporting a net
loss in the fourth quarter, the first since the company’s
initial public offering in 2007.  CNinsure’s ADRs slid 15 percent on March 2 to $6, the
biggest decline since Nov. 22. The stock lost 26 percent in the
week, the biggest decline on the Bloomberg China-US 55 index.  Guangzhou, China-based CNinsure incurred a net loss of
718.6 million yuan ($114 million) in the last quarter of 2011,
compared with net income of 126.5 million yuan a year earlier
and profit of 78.2 million yuan in the three months to Sept. 30,
2011, the company said in a statement after U.S. markets closed
March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
