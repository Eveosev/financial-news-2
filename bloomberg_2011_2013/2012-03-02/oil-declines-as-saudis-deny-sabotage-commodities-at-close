The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 1.5 percent to 702.49 by 5:19 p.m. in
London. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
declined 0.8 percent to 1,643.42.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for the first time in three days after  Saudi
Arabia  denied a report of a pipeline explosion in its Eastern
province and as the dollar headed for its biggest weekly gain in
almost two months.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped $2.26, or 2.1 percent,
to $106.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices
are down 2.9 percent this week.  Brent oil for April settlement slipped $2.48, or 2 percent,
to $123.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. It surged to $128.40 yesterday, the highest intraday
price since July 2008.  Crude oil futures: NI CRMKTS  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold headed for the biggest weekly decline since mid-
December as a stronger dollar lowered appeal of the precious
metal as an alternative investment. Silver also fell.  Gold futures for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,715.70 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Prices fell 1.7
percent last month after the biggest one-day drop in 11 weeks on

economic stimulus.  Silver futures for May delivery on the Comex fell 1.8
percent to $35 an ounce.  Precious metal markets: NI PCMKTS  BASE METALS  Copper futures fell on signs of ample supplies as
inventories rose to the highest in at least nine years in  China ,
the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals.  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$3.918 a pound on the Comex in New York. The price still headed

weeks, on speculation that rain will improve crop prospects in
West Africa, the world’s biggest producing region. Coffee also
declined, while sugar rose.  Cocoa for May delivery fell 1.2 percent to $2,338 a metric
ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. A settlement at that price
would leave prices down 0.8 percent for the week, halting a two-
week rally.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$2.025 a pound in New York, down for the second day in three.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
25.08 cents a pound on ICE, heading for the first gain in four
days.  In London futures trading, cocoa declined, while robusta
coffee and refined sugar advanced on NYSE Liffe.  Soft  commodities markets : NI SOMKTS  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures advanced in New York for a third day

percent, to $2.47 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract climbed to $2.505

will rise in the U.S. and  South America  and as a stronger dollar

session.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 0.5 percent to $6.51 a

yesterday. On Feb. 29, the grain touched $6.615, the highest
