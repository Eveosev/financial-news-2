Ohio  Attorney General Mike DeWine
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political
Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that pro-Mitt
Romney television advertisements airing in his state are
“distorted” yet won’t stop Rick Santorum from winning the
Republican presidential primary there on March 6.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Ohio’s attorney general,
Republican Mike DeWine, who joins us now from Columbus, Ohio.
General, thank you for being with us.  You are supporting Rick Santorum. You said your candidate’s
going to pull it out in Ohio next Tuesday. He’s 4 points ahead
in the polls. Some polls show him 7 points ahead. But same thing
we showed in Michigan, and then the Romney forces came in with
heavy TV ads, and they pulled it out. Why isn’t it going to be
the same in Ohio?  MIKE DEWINE: Well, you’re right. The Romney forces, they’ll
do anything. I mean, yesterday, you know, they stole a delegate
in Michigan. You know, how desperate do you have to be to change
the rules after the fact? They’ve got robo-calls out here. It’s
all attack, attack, attack.  But  Rick Santorum  is going to win Ohio. He’s going to win
because there’s a great excitement on the ground for him.
Frankly, there’s no excitement for Governor Romney. He’s going
to get a lot of votes, but there’s no excitement, there’s no
energy. Rick is connecting.  And what I think people are starting to understand is that
the conventional wisdom that we all started out with that
Governor Romney would be the strongest candidate in the fall is
simply not true.  HUNT: Well, General, let me - let me come back -  HUNT: Let me come back to that in a minute. But I watched
those ads that you alluded to last night. What they say is
Santorum voted with  Hillary Clinton  to increase the debt, for
phony earmarks, pork-barrels, and even for convicted felons. And
Romney says he’s - and they say Romney’s the real conservative.
This is the Romney super PAC. What’s your take on those ads?  DEWINE: Well, it’s pretty easy to take someone who actually
has a record like Rick Santorum and who has done things and pick
out one or two votes and try to distort them a little bit. But
the fact is that Rick Santorum is the conservative in this race
who’s actually got things done.  HUNT: Are those ads honest?  DEWINE: Oh, I think they’re a little distorted. I think
they’re out of place. I mean, look, if you talk about the
deficit, Al, we all know it’s entitlements, and Rick Santorum
was the guy on the Senate floor day after day that was fighting
to deal with the entitlements. Rick Santorum is the person on
the Senate floor who led the charge for us in regard to welfare
reform, a very, very solid conservative record. I mean, it’s
ludicrous and so funny to think of  Governor Romney , who has
flip-flopped on so many issues, that he is trying to get to the
right of Rick Santorum. You know, it’s absurd. And the problem
is, who best can beat  Barack Obama ? And I don’t know how the man
who created Romneycare, which, you know, very, very similar to
Obamacare, is going to attack Obamacare and going to attack the
president on that in the fall. I think you give up a huge, huge
issue if - if Romney is the nominee.  The other thing, Al, that I’m seeing around Ohio, Rick was
in Jefferson County over in Steubenville area, very Democrat
area. My prediction - I’ve looked at Ohio for a long time - is
that Rick will run exceedingly well in the fall if he is the
nominee, with blue-collar workers in Ohio and people that we
traditionally have called, you know, the Reagan Democrats -  HUNT: Let me ask you about the Santorum campaign. In the
days leading up to  Michigan , Senator Santorum spent a lot of
time on social issues, including contraception, separation of
church and state. Is that a winning formula in Ohio? Or would
you like to see him predominantly focus on the economy?  DEWINE: Well, I think - I think Rick - everyone knows where
Rick is on the basic core values. But I think that the last time
Rick was in Ohio was in Perrysburg, near Toledo, on Tuesday. He
led off, Al, with the first half-an-hour of nothing but energy
and jobs and manufacturing. And I think that, you know, that
sells very, very well -  HUNT: Is that what he should do these final - these closing
days? Should that be the focus?  DEWINE: I think he’s going to do both. Well, you know, I
think - you know, in all fairness, I’ve watched his speeches now
for the last several weeks in Ohio, and he’s covered all the
ground. He’s talked about the Obama administration’s Obamacare
and what they have done in - in regard to religious freedom, but
he’s also talked a lot about manufacturing.  HUNT: Do you agree with your governor,  John Kasich , that
the automobile rescue plan was good for Ohio workers?  DEWINE: Look, I think we’re moving - we’re moving forward.
And Ohio is an auto state. We’re an auto parts state and auto
state. And I think we’re - I think we’re coming back.  HUNT: So it was helpful, that auto rescue plan?  DEWINE: I think it was help - I think it was helpful.  HUNT: Well, why have - why aren’t your candidates - and you
told Rick Santorum that he’s making a mistake, then, in saying
it was the wrong thing to do? He and Governor Romney both say
that.  DEWINE: No, look, I think reasonable people can disagree
about how you - how you would have approached that and what you
could have done.  HUNT: But you do disagree with your candidate on that.  DEWINE: I think the real question - I don’t know. I don’t
know whether I do or not. I think the real issue for Ohio voters
is the future. And when Rick talks about manufacturing, he’s got
a plan that I think is a dynamite plan in regard to
manufacturing. He talks about jobs. That connects with Ohio
voters.  But, Al, there’s another thing that I think that sometimes
all of us miss when we talk about these issues, and that is what
I call the likeability factor. People just like Rick Santorum. I
mean, they just like him. They connect with him. They think he’s
real. They think he is human. They think he is sincere, and they
believe him.  HUNT: Well, let me talk about likeability. You were one of
- you were one of 78 living Republican senators who served with
Rick Santorum in the Senate. The last time I checked, you were
the only one that has endorsed him. Why does he have such
trouble getting support from his peers, who knew him best?  DEWINE: Well, I think - I think a lot of senators aren’t
doing anything. They’re sitting the race out.  HUNT: No, but some - but more have endorsed Romney.  DEWINE: Well, let me tell you - let me tell you about
myself. You know, I originally endorsed Romney. I was a Romney
delegate. And it wasn’t that I didn’t respect Rick or like Rick,
but I didn’t think he had any chance at all. He was at 2 percent
in the polls, had no money. I bought into the conventional
wisdom that Governor Romney, you know, was the best candidate in
the fall.  But I changed my mind as this campaign has played out. It’s
clear to me that Romney is not the best candidate -  HUNT: And you don’t think it sends any message that no
other -  DEWINE: - Santorum is.  HUNT: You don’t think it sends a message that no other
senator has endorsed Senator Santorum?  DEWINE: No. No, I do not. Look, Rick - Rick is - Rick never
even reached out to me. I mean, he said, look, I think I have to
go earn this before I reach out to my former colleagues. I
called him and said, “Rick, I’ve changed my mind. I want to be
on your team.”  HUNT: OK.  DEWINE: “I want to endorse you.”  I felt that that was
something that I had to do, because I think he’s the best
candidate.  HUNT: General, only a few seconds left. What should we look
for on Tuesday? What area, what demographic group will be the
key to who wins Ohio?  DEWINE: Oh, I think it’s going to be a close, close race.
You know, I think, all things being equal, Santorum would have a
big margin. Romney’s got a ton of money. I think in the end Rick
will eke this thing out and he will win, and it’ll be a stunning
victory -  HUNT: Where - what - are there are a type of voter or an
area that you are particularly going to be attuned to Tuesday
night?  DEWINE: Well, you know, the majority - big bulk of
Republican votes historically have been in the western side, I
mean, basically starting south of Toledo and going all the way
to Cincinnati. That is a huge, huge block of votes. The suburbs
are important.  But it’s also interesting that the rural areas many times
are kind of the indicator. Santorum is going to run very, very
well along the river, not a lot of votes there, but many times
it’s that area that ultimately decides who wins primaries and
who wins general elections.  HUNT: OK. Attorney General Mike DeWine of Ohio, thank you
so much for joining us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
