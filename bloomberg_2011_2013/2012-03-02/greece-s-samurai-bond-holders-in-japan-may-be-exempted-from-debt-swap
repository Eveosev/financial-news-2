Holders of 108.7 billion yen ($1.33
billion) of  Greece ’s yen-denominated bonds who live in Japan may
not be affected by an agreed debt swap as part of the biggest
restructuring in history.  The swap agreed to on Feb. 24, known as private sector
involvement, or PSI, doesn’t apply to the holders because of the
time limits and Japanese legal requirements,  Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303) ,
 Mizuho Corporate Bank  Ltd. and  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304) , fiscal agents
for the securities in Japan, said in statements today. Greece
last week formally offered to exchange some bonds for new notes,
with investors taking a 53.5 percent haircut.  “The announcement gives near-term comfort to Japanese
investors, however it doesn’t promise a massive improvement on
the situation,” said Akane Enatsu, a senior credit analyst at
Barclays Capital  Japan  Ltd. in Tokyo. “Greece’s situation is
still on a knife-edge, and it’s unsure whether it will be OK
until the Samurai bonds reach redemption in 2015 and 2016.”  Greece is seeking to reduce national debt to 120 percent of
gross domestic product by 2020, from 160 percent last year, to
meet the terms of a 130 billion-euro ($173 billion)
international bailout. Euro-area finance ministers authorized
the rescue fund to issue bonds, while the International Swaps &
Derivatives Association said $3.25 billion in Greek credit-
default swaps won’t be triggered.  Bond Treatment  “The Greek government isn’t in a position to promise
anything at this moment regarding the treatment of the
aforementioned bonds owned by residents in Japan,” Shinsei Bank
said in the statement. Greece will notify the result of the
current PSI offer to the fiscal agents “without any delay.”  Toshiharu Mashita, a spokesman for Japan’s Financial
Services Agency in  Tokyo , said the agency is aware of the
statements, while declining to comment further.  Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said at a
briefing in Tokyo today that he hadn’t heard about the Greek
Samurai bond report.  The five bonds affected were all sold in 1995 and 1996.
They include the Greek government’s 40 billion yen of 5 percent
notes maturing in August 2016, and its 30 billion yen of 5.25
percent February 2016 securities, which are both represented by
Shinsei Bank.  Mizuho Corporate Bank is the agent for Greece’s 20 billion
of 5.8 percent notes due in July 2015.  Aozora Bank managed the sale of 18.7 billion yen of
securities for the Hellenic Railways Organization, Greece’s
state-run rail company, including 7.35 percent notes due March
2015 and 4.5 percent notes due December 2016.  To contact the reporters on this story:
