Folli Follie SA (FOLLI)  and Setur Servis
Turistik AS won a concession to operate a marina on the Greek
island of Mytilini for 40 years,  Kathimerini  said.  The group will pay 250,000 euros ($331,100) a year and will
invest about 630,000 euros in upgrading the marina, which will
have restaurants, shops and offices for customs and the coast
guard, the Athens-based newspaper reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Setur Servis is a unit of  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , which is  Turkey â€™s
