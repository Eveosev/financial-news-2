Overseas  funds  bought a net  2.76
billion rupees  ($56 million) of Indian stocks yesterday, taking
total investments into equities this year to 365 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 24.4 billion rupees of shares and sold
21.6 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. They poured 252.1 billion rupees in
February, helping the BSE India Sensitive Index to its second
straight monthly gain for the first time since September 2010.  Overseas investors sold a net 5.04 billion rupees of debt,
paring their flows into debt this year to 265.2 billion rupees,
the data  show . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in 2011.  Foreigners have invested 4.809 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.473 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.3 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows surged to a record
in 2010, making the  Sensex (SENSEX)  the best performer among the world’s
top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led to the
biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent decline in the Sensex, the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
