PKN Orlen SA (PKN) , Polandâ€™s largest oil
company, said two people were killed in an accident at its
Lithuanian refinery during maintenance work on a fluid catalytic
cracker.  Output at Orlen Lietuva AB, the only oil refinery in the
Baltic states, is unaffected by the accident, Audrius
Stasiulaitis, a spokesman at the Juodeikiai, Lithuania-based
company, said by phone.  The Lithuanian refinery resumed full capacity yesterday
after operating at 80 percent in the previous week as the
company performed maintenance, Stasiulaitis said.  The refinery has a capacity of 200,800 barrels of oil per
day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
