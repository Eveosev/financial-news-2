Ed Rogers , chief executive officer
of Tokyo-based Rogers Investment Advisors, speaks on Bloomberg
Television from  New York  about  AIJ Investment Advisors Co. (0202964) , the
Japanese fund management firm that was suspended for possible
losses.  “We were introduced to AIJ over a year ago, and when we
expressed interest in doing due diligence on them, they came
back and said ‘We don’t want you to do due diligence. We’re not
interested in anyone who has any foreign investors.’
The reality is people like AIJ won’t let us come in the door.”  On the impact of the AIJ issue:  “This is a very serious incident, no doubt about it. But I
think it needs to be taken within context.”  “A $2 billion fund that has a problem in the context of a
multitrillion-dollar asset management industry is not exactly
like the whole house is burning down.”  The incident highlights “the importance of investors doing
appropriate due diligence.”  “There are under-funded pension funds throughout the
world.”  “You have to make risky investments, and  hedge funds  are
one of the best ways to do that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
