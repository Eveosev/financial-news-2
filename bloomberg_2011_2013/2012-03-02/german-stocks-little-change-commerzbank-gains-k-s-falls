German stocks  retreated as  Spain 
raised its budget deficit target and a report showed German
retail sales dropped in January.  Metro AG, Germany’s biggest retailer, lost 2.9 percent.
Bayer AG fell 1.7 percent.  K+S AG (SDF)  retreated 1.6 percent, after
Societe Generale SA cut its recommendation on the company.
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  rose 1.2 percent as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
advised buying European bank stocks. Merck KGaA gained 2.6
percent as Exane Finance SE raised its price target.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  declined 0.3 percent to 6,921.37 at the close
of trading in  Frankfurt . The benchmark gauge gained 0.8 percent
this week. The measure advanced  6.2 percent in February  and 17.4
percent so far this year. The broader HDAX Index dropped 0.3
percent today.  Spain raised its budget deficit target for 2012, breaching
its commitment with its European partners, as a deepening
economic slump hampers efforts to rein in the euro area’s
fourth-biggest shortfall. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  announced
a new deficit goal of 5.8 percent of gross domestic product
compared with the 4.4 percent target previously agreed with the
European Union.  German  retail sales  unexpectedly declined in January as
rising oil prices fueled inflation. Sales, adjusted for
inflation and seasonal swings, fell 1.6 percent from December,
when they increased 0.1 percent, the Federal Statistics Office
said today. Economists had forecast a gain of 0.5 percent, the
median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Metro Falls  Metro declined 2.9 percent to 28.40 euros after the retail
sales data were published and Commerzbank said the company’s
earnings may drop this year.  “We believe 2012 will be a year of flat earnings at
best,” Commerzbank’s Juergen Elfers wrote in a report dated
March 1. Lower profit “could be a more feasible scenario, while
consensus still expects earnings to increase by 5 percent.”  Bayer,  Germany ’s largest drugmaker, fell 1.7 percent to
55.65 euros.  K+S dropped 1.6 percent to 37.08 euros, as Patrick Lambert,
an analyst at Societe Generale SA, cut the company’s shares to
“hold” from “buy” with a 12-month target price of 40.00
euros per share. Morgan Stanley said the company may cut its
2012 guidance when it reports full-year earnings on March 15.  Commerzbank rose 1.2 percent to 1.96 euros after Goldman
raised its recommendations on banks to “overweight” from
“neutral.” The  European Central Bank ’s long-term refinancing
operation has improved cash supply for banks, analysts,
including Matthieu Walterspiler, wrote in a report.  Merck gained 2.6 percent to 80.74 euros, as Exane Finance
SE raised its price target to 82 from 73 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
