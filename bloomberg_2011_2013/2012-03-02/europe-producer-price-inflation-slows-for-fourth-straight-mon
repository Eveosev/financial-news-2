Euro-area  producer-price inflation 
slowed for a fourth month in January on weakening cost increases
for energy and capital goods such as machines.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation euro region rose 3.7
percent from a year earlier after increasing 4.3 percent in
December, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast a gain of 3.5 percent, the
median of 17 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey  showed.  European companies are under pressure to eliminate jobs and
lower costs to weather the region’s economic slump and tougher
austerity measures from  Spain  to  Greece . Euro-area unemployment
jumped to 10.7 percent in January, the highest in more than a
decade, and manufacturing output dropped last month.  “Companies are under serious pressure to keep their labor
forces as tight as possible to contain their costs in the face
of current weakened demand,” said  Howard Archer , chief European
economist at IHS Global Insight in  London . The euro-area economy
“is in serious danger of enduring a further gross-domestic-
product decline in the first quarter.”  Energy costs in the euro area rose 9.2 percent from a year
earlier after increasing 9.4 percent in December, today’s report
showed. Capital goods were 1.3 percent more expensive, compared
with a 1.6 percent gain in the prior month.  Producer prices rose 0.7 percent in January from December,
the report showed. In the 27-nation EU, prices increased 0.7 in
the month and 4.4 percent in the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
