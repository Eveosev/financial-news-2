Zynga Inc. game designer Michael
McCormick is departing to become director of game design at Idle
Games Inc.  McCormick, who has more than 20 years of experience in the
industry, had been the lead designer on Zynga’s popular
“CityVille,” San Francisco-based Idle Games said today in a
statement.  “To say that Idle Games is doing new things in the social
space is an understatement, and I couldn’t be more excited to
join the team,” McCormick said in the statement.  Zynga, the online-game company that sold shares to the
public in December, is the biggest developer of games on
Facebook Inc., the world’s largest social-networking service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
