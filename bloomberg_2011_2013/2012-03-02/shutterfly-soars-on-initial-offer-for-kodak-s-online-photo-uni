Shutterfly Inc. (SFLY)  rose the most in
more than a year after announcing an initial offer to buy
 Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) ’s online-picture business for $23.8 million.  Shutterfly, based in Redwood City, California, advanced 17
percent to $31.36 at the close in New York, for the biggest one-
day jump since Feb. 3, 2011. The stock has dropped 25  percent  in
the past 12 months.  Kodak, the Rochester, New York-based photography pioneer
that filed for bankruptcy protection in January, agreed to the
so-called stalking horse bid in a court-supervised auction
process, according to a statement yesterday.  With this deal, Shutterfly would “eliminate a sizable
competitor and solidify its position as the largest player in
online consumer print,”  Youssef Squali , an analyst at Jefferies
& Co., wrote in a note today. Squali recommends buying the
stock. Snapfish,  American Greetings Corp. (AM) , and  Vistaprint NV (VPRT) 
could make competing offers for Kodak Gallery after the auction
receives court approval, Squali said.  The deal would transfer the accounts of 75 million Kodak
Gallery users to Shutterfly, Kodak said. The service allows
users to upload photos, organize galleries, order prints or
photobooks, and share pictures. Shutterfly’s bid is the first in
an auction process that Kodak is seeking to have approved in
U.S. bankruptcy court by late March.  The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202, U.S.
