Mexico ’s lower house of Congress
passed a bill to block mobile-phone service in Mexican prisons
to prevent criminals from using them in extortion and kidnapping
schemes.  With 315 votes in favor, 6 against and 7 abstentions,
deputies approved a bill that also impedes the use of devices
for data and image transmission inside penitentiaries and as far
as 20 meters around them.  The legislation would also cancel a planned registry of
wireless carriers’ users that was intended to help authorities
trace calls. Criminals used mobile phones in about 95 percent of
extortions in 2008, according to the proposal Congress approved
that year to create the database. A judge blocked the government
in 2010 from forcing mobile-phone carriers to cut off users who
didn’t register for the database.  To become law, the bill must be signed by President Felipe Calderon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
