The eastern U.S. and  Canada  are
expected to be warmer-than-normal for this time of year by mid-
March, with high temperatures near 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5
Celsius) in Chicago and Philadelphia, forecasters said.  Temperatures may reach 15 degrees above normal from the
northern Great Plains and Great Lakes to Hudson Bay in Canada,
according to an 11- to 15-day outlook from  MDA EarthSat Weather 
in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  “This setup will diminish typical heating demand across
the North, where highs may consistently reach into the 60s in
places like Chicago and Philadelphia,” MDA said in the forecast
for March 12 to March 16.  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy use
and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas
for heating, according to the Energy Department.  The U.S. will begin to get warmer next week, as
temperatures from  Texas  to Massachusetts may reach 6 degrees
above normal, according to  David Salmon , a meteorologist with
Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  The Ohio Valley region may be as much as 10 degrees above
normal, Salmon said in his 6- to 10-day outlook for March 8 to
March 12.  The normal average temperature in  New York  for March 7 is
about 40 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 36 in Boston, 41 in
Philadelphia, 35 in Chicago, 43 in  St. Louis , 56 in Dallas, 61
in Houston, 52 in Atlanta, 45 in Seattle and 58 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
