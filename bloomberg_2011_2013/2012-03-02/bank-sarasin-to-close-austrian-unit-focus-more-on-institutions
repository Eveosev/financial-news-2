Bank Sarasin & Cie. AG (BSAN) , the Swiss
wealth manager being acquired by Safra Group, said it’s closing
a unit in  Austria  and will focus on institutional business in
the country.  The company decided to “change its orientation” in Vienna
and Sarasin Austria AG will be “wound up,” Franziska Gumpfer-
Keller, a spokeswoman for Basel, Switzerland-based Sarasin, said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The Vienna office was run by Christian Daimer and was
opened in July 2009, according to Austria’s Format magazine,
which reported the business was closing earlier today.  Gumpfer-Keller declined to comment on the size of the unit
or give further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
