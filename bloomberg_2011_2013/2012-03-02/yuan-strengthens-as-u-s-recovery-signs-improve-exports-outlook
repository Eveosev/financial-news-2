The yuan rose after U.S. employment
data added to evidence of improvement in the world’s largest
economy, brightening the outlook for  China ’s exports and fueling
demand for emerging-market assets.  U.S.  initial jobless claims  fell 2,000 to 351,000 in the
week through Feb. 25, matching a four-year low reached in early
February. China’s  manufacturing  growth picked up for a third
month in February, official data showed yesterday.  “The U.S. jobs data is encouraging and implies stronger
demand for Chinese exports,” said  Daniel Chan , chief economist
at BWC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “The yuan will continue
its gradual appreciation pace when global growth looks more
resilient.”  The yuan rose 0.03 percent to 6.2982 per dollar as of 4:30
p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency was little changed this week. The People’s
Bank of China raised the  reference rate  0.06 percent to 6.2980
today. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent either side
of the daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.01
percent today to 6.2960. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
advanced 0.07 percent to 6.2818, a 0.3 percent premium to the
onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Measures to increase the amount of yuan offshore will
probably be discussed by Chinese lawmakers next week during
annual legislative meetings in Beijing, said Fang Fang, JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s chief executive officer of China investment
banking. He will be attending as a member of the Chinese
People’s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory group to
the government that meets in parallel to the lawmakers that are
delegates to the National People’s Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
