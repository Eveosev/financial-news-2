CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
utility, has “strong ammunition” in negotiating new contracts
for the supply of lignite thanks to a 10-year contract between
the Pilsen district heating plant and Sokolovska Uhelna miner,
Wood & Co. said.  The recently signed contract fixes the price of the
commodity at 40 koruna ($2.14) a gigajoule, which will be viewed
by the industry as a benchmark for other suppliers, Wood analyst
Bram Buring said in a note to clients.  CEZ is locked in a court dispute with supplier Czech Coal
Group, a mining company controlled by billionaires Pavel Tykac
and Jan Dienstl who plan to double the price of lignite after
the contracts with CEZ run out at the end of this year. The
state-controlled utility depends on Czech Coal for about 8.5
tons of coal a year, or about a quarter of the supply it buys
from outside sources and a half of Czech Coal’s production.  “We believe that the PT contract is, on the margin, good
news for CEZ,” Buring said in the note. “It is fairly strong
ammunition for CEZ and other energy producers to argue that
Czech Coal’s expectations are unrealistic.”  A new 70 koruna price would reduce CEZ’s earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization 4 percent, analysts
have estimated. CEZ, which gets 60 percent of the brown coal it
burns from its own mines, is less exposed to price increases
than smaller rival EP Holding and other Czech heating utilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
