The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index (NGSEINDX)  advanced for a second day, rising 2 percent to
20,592.02 at the close in Lagos, according to an e-mailed
statement from the bourse.  Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  climbed for the ninth straight day,
adding 0.6 percent to 59.80 at the end of trading in Nairobi,
the longest rally since September 2010. Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX) 
edged up for a second day, increasing by less than 0.1 percent
at 1,779.89 at the close. The  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index (FTN098)  fell

excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB)  , a Nigerian lender, slid 1.2
percent to 2.57 naira, the lowest since Feb. 27.  “The pressure is likely downward on the stock this month
as investors expect it to come up with a loss after a profit
warning,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth
Trust & Investment Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone
today. “There is no incentive for the stock to move up until
the management comes up with a first-quarter profit forecast.”  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB)  , the East African
nation’s third-biggest lender by market value, jumped 3.7
percent to 21.25 shillings, the highest since Aug. 8, after
full-year earnings surged, beating analyst estimates.  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  , a Kenyan fuel retailer with
operations in nine African countries, retreated for a second
day, retreating 1.8 percent to 10.9 shillings. Oil declined in
New York and headed for the first weekly drop in four after
Saudi Arabia denied a reported pipeline explosion in its Eastern
province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
