Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s
government may today announce a spending limit for its 2012
budget based on a recession forecast of 1.5 percent,  ABC 
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  The government may not specify the nation’s budget deficit
targets for the next three years as is usually the case when
spending limits are presented, ABC said. The budget deficit may
be disclosed next week after a meeting between the central
government and Spanish regions, ABC said.  The government is considering a planned shortfall around
5.5 percent for 2012, ABC said.  For Related News and Information:
