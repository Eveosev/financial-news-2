Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , Hungary’s largest refiner
and operator of  Croatia ’s  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , plans to
boost its spending to $191 million this year on exploration and
field development in Croatia, up from $34 million in 2011.  Mol’s program in Croatia includes drilling seven
exploration wells and five production wells, as well as
enhancing oil recovery at existing facilities, the Budapest-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Both Mol and its largest subsidiary,  INA , posted a loss in
the fourth quarter, after violence in Syria hurt the output at
INA’s crude oil and gas facilities in the Middle Eastern
country. INA on Feb. 27 announced it is pulling out of  Syria ,
following the Croatian government’s decision to abide by a
European embargo on Syria.  Mol’s investment plan for Croatia also includes an
estimated $37 million for research and production in Syria, the
company said, adding the implementation “will depend on whether
and when INA will be able to resume works.”  The Hungarian refiner, which secured controlling rights of
INA in the 2009 shareholding agreement, owns 47.47 percent of
the company, with an option to buy another 1.6 percent. The
Croatian government holds 44.84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
