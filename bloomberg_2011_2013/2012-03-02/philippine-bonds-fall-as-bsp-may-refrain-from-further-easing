Philippine bonds fell on speculation
the central bank will refrain from cutting  interest rates  amid
concern costlier oil will stoke inflation. The peso gained.  The yield on the 8 percent debt due July 2031 climbed to a
one-month high after Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Governor
Diwa Guinigundo said yesterday monetary policy will have to deal
with inflation should increasing oil costs lead to a
“disanchoring of expectations.” The central bank lowered its
benchmark rate yesterday for a second straight meeting to 4
percent. Crude prices jumped 25 percent in  New York  in the past
six months.  “It looks like we’re seeing the end of rate cuts and bonds
may lose support from the BSP’s accommodative policy,” said Jan Briace Santos, a fixed-income trader who helps manage the
equivalent of $16 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in  Manila .  The yield rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point,
to 5.765 percent as of 4 p.m. in Manila, its highest level since
Feb. 2, according to Tradition Financial Services. The rate
climbed 14 basis points this week.  The peso rose 0.3 percent this week to 42.693 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It gained 0.3 percent today.  Inflation data due March 6 may show consumer prices rose
3.2 percent from a year earlier in February, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. January’s
increase of 3.9 percent was the smallest in 13 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
