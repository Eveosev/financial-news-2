Azeri authorities said the situation
was brought under control in the country’s northern region of
Quba after a rare outbreak of civil unrest in the energy-rich
former Soviet republic  “Police and Interior Troops took action within the law to
restore order,” the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor’s
office said in a joint statement broadcast on state television
channel AzTV. “The situation is under control.”  Hundreds of people in Quba burnt and looted the local
governor’s house and damaged his office yesterday. Three
security officers sustained life-threatening injuries in clashes
with about 1,000 protesters. Criminal proceedings were initiated
into the “violent disruption of public order,” AzTV cited the
statement as saying.  The riots broke out after the district governor said Quba
residents were ready “to sell their land, families and
motherland” for about $40, according to a video recording of
the speech posted on Google Inc.’s YouTube.  Quba, which has a population of about 160,000, is 164
kilometers (102 miles) north of the capital, Baku, near the
Azeri border with  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
