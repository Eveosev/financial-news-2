Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
sixth day, heading for its longest losing streak in more than
seven months, on increased dollar demand.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy weakened 0.3
percent to 83.35 to the dollar, poised for the longest run of
declines since August.  “The shilling has weakened on increased dollar demand with
businesses buying for their new monthly requirement,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa
Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  The Ugandan shilling headed for the biggest drop in more
than four months, depreciating 2.8 percent to 2,460 per dollar
while Tanzania’s shilling remained unchanged at 1,600 to the
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
