Romania started talks with  OMV
Petrom SA (SNP)  and  OMV AG (OMV) , its parent company, on increasing oil and
natural gas royalties, as the government seeks to raise the
payments before 2014, Ziarul Financiar reported, citing Economy
Minister Lucian Bode.  Petrom paid royalties last year totaling 7.5 percent of the
total value of production, according to Bode, who told the
Bucharest-based newspaper he would like to increase the
percentage to “double digits.” Bode met with Petrom Chief
Executive Officer Mariana Gheorghe and OMV CEO Gerhard Roiss in
Bucharest yesterday to discuss the royalties, which are
currently set in an agreement that expires in 2014.  The government may also revive the sale of a 9.8 percent
stake in Petrom, either by June or in September or October,
Ziarul Financiar cited Bode as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
