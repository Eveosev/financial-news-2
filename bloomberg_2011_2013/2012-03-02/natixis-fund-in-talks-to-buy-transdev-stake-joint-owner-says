Natixis SA, a French bank, is in
talks to buy  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ’s 50 percent stake in
Veolia Transdev, according to the joint owner of the mass-
transit business.  Veolia has “entered exclusive talks” with a fund
belonging to Natixis, Augustin de Romanet, the head of the
Caisse de Depots et Consignations, a state-owned investment
bank, said today in an interview on BFM radio. “We need to
fight to preserve the capital of Transdev and I hope we have a
new partner soon.”  Veolia Transdev was created after Veolia and CDC agreed to
merge their transport units in 2010. Natixis’s Cube
Infrastructure Fund has stakes in European transport, water and
energy companies, according to its  website .  CDS would have “preferred to continue” its partnership
with Veolia, de Romanet said.  Veolia Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot said
yesterday a deal to sell its stake in Transdev could be reached
“quickly” as part of a plan to sell 5 billion euros ($6.6
billion) of assets this year and next to trim debt.  Victoria Eideliman, a spokeswoman for Natixis, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
