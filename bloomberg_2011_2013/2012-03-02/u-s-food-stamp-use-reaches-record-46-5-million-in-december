U.S. food-stamp use, which
Republicans have cited as evidence of a failing economy, rose
0.5 percent to a record in December, the government said.  About 46.514 million Americans received aid, up from 46.286
million in November, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
today in an e-mail. Participation was 5.5 percent higher than a
year earlier.  Food stamps  have become a theme in the presidential
campaign, as enrollment has increased 47 percent since December
2008, the month before President Barack Obama took office.
Annual spending has more than doubled in four years to a record
 $75.3 billion , a level called unsustainable by Republicans
including  Newt Gingrich , who has labeled Obama “the best food-
stamp president in American history.”  The number of Americans receiving assistance under the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the initiative
better-known as food stamps, set records every month from
December 2008 until June 2011.  The government spent $6.22 billion on the program in
December, the last month for which food-stamp figures are
available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
