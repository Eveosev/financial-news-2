Metso Oyj’s (MEO1V)  $31.6 million patent-infringement victory over  Terex Corp. (TEX)  was thrown out by a U.S.
appeals court that said its patent on a machine that sorts rocks
and gravel was invalid.  Metso had won a $15.8 million verdict that was doubled by a
trial judge based on the jury’s finding that the infringement
was willful. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
in  Washington  today reversed the verdict, saying the patent
covers an obvious variation of earlier know-how. The  opinion  was
posted on the court’s website.  The dispute is over Terex’s Powerscreen machines with a way
that screens a large amount of sand and gravel into different
hoppers for distribution. Metso’s invention relates to conveyors
that can be folded into the side so the machine can travel on
roadways.  Terex, the Westport, Connecticut-based maker of cranes and
lifts, argued that the invention was little different from the
older Masterskreen Dominator developed by the same inventor. The
Federal Circuit agreed. It was “ordinary skill and common sense
rather than innovation” that led to the patented invention, the
three-judge panel said.  Metso, based in Helsinki, makes paper machines in addition
to rock crushers.  The case is Metso Minerals Inc. v. Powerscreen
International, 11cv1572,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal
Circuit (Washington). The lower court case is Metso Minerals
Inc. v. Powerscreen International Distribution Ltd., 06cv1446,
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York
( Central Islip ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
