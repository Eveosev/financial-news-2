Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  sold
spot cargoes of liquefied natural gas to Argentina’s YPF SA for
delivery at Bahia Blanca in July, said two people with direct
knowledge of the matter.  The two shipments were sold last week as part of YPF’s
latest LNG spot buy tender, according to the people who asked
not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to
the media. Nobody answered two calls to YPF’s main switchboard
in Buenos Aires outside normal business hours.  YPF last week closed Argentina’s seventh tender for this
year to buy seven LNG cargoes delivered to the port of Bahia
Blanca southwest of Buenos Aires. Argentina has no long-term
LNG-purchase contracts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
