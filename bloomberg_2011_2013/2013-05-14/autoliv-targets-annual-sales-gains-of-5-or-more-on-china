Autoliv Inc. (ALIV) , the world’s largest
maker of automotive air bags and seat belts, is targeting annual
revenue growth of 5 percent or more in the next five years
because of gains in Chinese and U.S. car sales.  The supplier plans to at least match global market gains
that it forecasts at about 5 percent annually, the Stockholm-based company said in a statement today. Autoliv aims to achieve
an operating margin in the period of 8 percent to 9 percent of
sales, it said. The stock climbed to the highest in more than
two years.  “The long-term targets we are communicating today should
allow us to further strengthen our No. 1 position in the
automotive-safety industry, while providing competitive returns
to our shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Jan Carlson said
in the statement.  The manufacturer is targeting growth in  China , where it
plans to increase its market share for air bags and seat belts
in 2015 to 37 percent from 35 percent last year, and in the U.S.
to offset a severe slump in European automotive demand. China
and the U.S. are the world’s two largest car markets.  Autoliv  gained  as much as 15.50 kronor, or 3 percent, to
534.50 kronor, the highest intraday price since Jan. 28, 2011,
and was trading up 1.1 percent at 9:43 a.m. in  Stockholm . The
stock has climbed 21 percent this year, valuing the supplier at
50.1 billion kronor ($7.55 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
