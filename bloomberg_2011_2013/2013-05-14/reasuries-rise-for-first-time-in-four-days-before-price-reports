Treasury 10-year note yields reached
two-month highs as speculation the  Federal Reserve  may consider
tapering its record bond-purchase program crimped demand for the
securities as equities indexes traded at record levels.  U.S. debt  erased earlier gains as Fed Bank of Philadelphia
President  Charles Plosser  reiterated his view that the central
bank should begin to curtail bond purchases in its quantitative
easing program as early as its next meeting. Treasuries had
rallied earlier today as yield levels attracted buyers betting
subdued inflation will bolster the value of the debt’s fixed
payments. Fed policy makers meet on June 18-19.  “What’s been driving the market for the past seven trading
days is chatter about the potential for the Fed to taper QE,”
said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of
government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “Until we see
something concrete with respect to Fed action, we’ll continue to
trade in this range. The economic numbers will be the key
determinant.”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.97 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2023 declined 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000 face amount,
to 97 31/32. The yield fell as much as three basis points before
climbing to 1.98 percent, the highest level since March 15. It
rose 16 basis points last week.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks gained 1 percent
and reached its eighth record in the past nine sessions.  Market Shift  “Stocks are hitting new highs because they believe the
economy is getting better,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice
president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in
New York. “It’s diverting money out of the Treasury market.”  The 14-day relative strength  index  for the 10-year note
rose to 71.6, a level that indicates the yield may be poised to
change direction. It was at 53 a week earlier.  Yields remained higher even as a report showed the  U.S.
budget deficit  will shrink this fiscal year to $642 billion, the
smallest shortfall in five years, according to the nonpartisan
 Congressional Budget Office . The deficit will shrink to 4
percent of gross domestic product, from 10.1 percent in fiscal
2009.  The CBO reduced its estimate of the likely shortfall,
citing stronger-than-expected tax receipts. In February, it had
projected a $845 billion deficit for the 2013 fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30. Last year’s deficit was $1.1 trillion.  Monetary Stimulus  Central banks around the world have been buying bonds and
cutting  interest rates  in a bid to boost growth and stave off
the risk of deflation.  “Should inflation expectations begin to fall, we might
need to take action to defend our inflation goal, but at this
point, I do not see inflation or deflation as a serious threat
in the near term,” Plosser said today in a speech in  Stockholm .  The central bank’s measure of traders’ outlook for
inflation from 2018 to 2023, known as the five-year  five-year
forward  break-even rate, was at 2.67 percent as of the most
recent figures on May 9. The figure is at almost its 2013 low of
2.64 percent reached April 18. It touched a 2013 high of 2.89
percent on Jan. 29.  Central-bank officials including St. Louis Fed President
 James Bullard  said last month persistent disinflation may
require the Fed to provide stimulus beyond $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases. The Fed bought $3.3 billion of
securities maturing between May 2020 and February 2023 today,
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  Price Swings  Fed stimulus has also suppressed price swings in government
debt. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index  measuring price
swings in Treasuries rose to 57.74 basis points after falling
May 9 to an all-time low of 48.87 basis points. The measure
averaged 62.6 basis points during the past 12 months.  Trading volume was $364 billion after reaching $451 billion
on May 10, the highest level since Feb. 1, according to ICAP
Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt .
The average daily volume for this year is $282 billion.  A gauge of U.S. import prices declined 0.5 percent in
April, following a revised 0.2 percent drop from a month
earlier, according to Labor Department figures released today in
 Washington . The decrease matched the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. The  consumer price index , to be
released on May 16 and the broadest measure of inflation, fell
0.3 percent last month, the second consecutive drop, according
to the survey median.  Treasuries have dropped 1 percent this month as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
