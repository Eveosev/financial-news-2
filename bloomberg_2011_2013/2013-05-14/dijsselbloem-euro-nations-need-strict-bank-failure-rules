Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said countries in the euro area should receive
“very restricted” exemptions to proposed European Union rules
on how to assign losses when banks fail.  Countries outside the 17-nation currency bloc may require
more flexibility because they won’t have access to the euro
system’s public backstops, Dijsselbloem said in public debate in
Brussels today. Finance ministers were discussing bank-failure
rules with an eye toward reaching agreement in June on how to
negotiate legislation with the European Parliament.  “I’m very reluctant to allow for a lot of flexibility for
the euro-zone countries,” said Dijsselbloem, who leads the
group of euro-area finance ministers. “The pressure will be
enormous from financial markets, from your parliaments, not to
go too hard on the bail-in, to take more risks on the public
account once again.”  Dijsselbloem said he’d support revisiting the topic if the
EU succeeds in creating an independent single resolution
authority. The European Commission is due to bring forward a
proposal on such a central agency in June. In the meantime
resolution will be handled through national authorities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
