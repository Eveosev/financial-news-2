Japanese government bonds fell,
pushing five-year rates to an almost two-year high, as an
advance in shares and U.S. bond yields sapped demand for debt
with yields still among the lowest in the world.  Ten-year yields extended the biggest two-day surge in
nearly a decade, while futures on the securities sank to a one-year low. Volatility in JGBs has soared since the Bank of Japan
said on April 4 it would double bond purchases in an effort to
end deflation. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields reached a seven-week high yesterday while Japan’s Topix Index of shares held
near the most in 4 1/2 years. The Ministry of Finance sold 30-year debt today and will auction 5-year notes this week.  “Unless there’s a clear pause to stock gains, investors
are reluctant to buy JGBs,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , the Tokyo-based chief rates strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the
24 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt auctions.
“We’ll have a five-year note auction amid weak demand, so
there’s uncertainty around it.”  Five-year yields surged seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 0.39 percent as of 2:51 p.m. in  Tokyo  after
earlier touching 0.4 percent, the most since July 2011.  The benchmark 10-year note rose as much as 6 1/2 basis
points to 0.855 percent, the highest since August. The yield
jumped 20 basis points in the previous two sessions, the
sharpest two-day gain since October 2003.  Japanese debt has lost 2.7 percent since the BOJ announced
an expansion of monetary stimulus last month, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. In dollar terms, JGBs have
slumped 7.8 percent, reflecting the yen depreciation.  JGB Auctions  The Topix slipped 0.1 percent today after yesterday surging
1.8 percent to 1,232.20, a level not seen since August 2008.
U.S. yields reached 1.94 percent yesterday, the highest since
March 26.  The Ministry of Finance offered to sell 500 billion yen
($4.9 billion) in 30-year, 1.8 percent bonds today. The sale saw
bids for 3.57 times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.64 at the previous sale. The
Ministry will offer five-year debt on May 16.  Japan  has the largest debt load in the world, making its
fiscal health vulnerable to rising interest rates. The nation’s
liabilities will probably balloon to 245 percent of economic
output this year, according to the International Monetary Fund’s
estimate. The debt totaled 991.6 trillion yen at the end of
March, a 0.6 percent decrease from the end of December,
according to a Ministry of Finance statement on May 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
