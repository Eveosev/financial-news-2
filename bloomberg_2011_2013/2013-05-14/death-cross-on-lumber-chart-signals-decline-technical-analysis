Lumber prices, down 13 percent this
year, may extend the slump to the lowest since October after
moving averages formed a “death cross,” according to  technical
analysis  by Paul Kavanaugh at FuturePath Trading LLC.  The attached chart shows that on May 9, lumber’s 50-day
moving average fell below the 100-day measure, often considered
a bearish indicator to traders who follow price patterns.
Yesterday, lumber futures for July delivery on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange tumbled 2.9 percent, the most in eight
months. The price settled at $327.70 per 1,000 board feet, below
the $329.10 close on Nov. 27, a key support, Kavanaugh said.  “Lumber may be below $300 by the end of the month,”
Kavanaugh, the director of business development at FuturePath in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The cross of the 50-and 100-day moving averages is validating the trend lower.”  The commodity hasn’t traded below $300 since mid-October.
Futures have dropped this year as signs of slowing economic
growth in  China  fueled concern that demand for materials ranging
from aluminum to zinc will ebb. Last month, the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials  touched the lowest
since July.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
