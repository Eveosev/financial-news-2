A billboard is extracting enough
drinking water out of humid air to help supply a Peruvian
village near Lima with about 96 liters (25 gallons) a day,  Clear
Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. (CCO)  said.  The San Antonio-based company that operates 750,000 outdoor
advertising displays on five continents said today in a
statement that the experimental $32,600 billboard in Bujama,
south of the capital, dispenses enough clean water that 15 to 18
family villagers access the filtered liquid daily.  The water is used by villagers for cooking and drinking as
it doesn’t need to be boiled, according to a  Clear Channel 
video. One resident called it water “from heaven because it
comes from air.” Schoolchildren stop to drink from a tap at the
billboard, including those from running classes.  The billboard uses a panel to trap humidity in the air. The
panel comprises five devices that extract water vapor that’s
stored in tanks at the top. The water is filtered before flowing
down a pipe to a tap available to anyone who passes.  About 15,000 liters of water have been produced in the six
months since the billboard was installed, according to the
statement. Clear Channel said it developed the project with
researchers at the University of Engineering and Technology in
 Lima  as well as a media and advertising agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
