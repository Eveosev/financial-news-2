By Robert Steven Kaplan How do you create your own definition of success — and reach your unique potential? Building a fulfilling life and career can be a daunting challenge.

Each of us is unique and brings distinctive skills and qualities to any situation. So why is it that most of us fail to spend sufficient time learning to understand ourselves and creating our own definition of success? Are you doing what you're really meant to do? If you're ready to face this question, this book can help you change your life. The First 90 Days, Updated and Expanded: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter
