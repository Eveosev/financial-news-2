Azerbaijan  started military exercises
near its breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh as efforts led by
the U.S., Russia and France are failing to broker a resolution
to the long-running conflict with Armenia.  The “large-scale” maneuvers involving ground and air
forces are overseen by Defense Minister Safar Abiyev and will
continue throughout the week, the Azeri Defense Ministry in the
capital, Baku, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The predominantly ethnic Armenian region broke free of
Baku’s control with military and political backing of
neighboring Armenia after the breakup of the former  Soviet Union 
in 1991. More than 30,000 people were killed and 1 million
displaced during the conflict, which left Nagorno-Karabakh and
seven adjacent Azeri districts under Armenian control.  Azerbaijan, where  BP Plc (BP/)  and partners have invested more
than $40 billion in energy projects since 1994, has repeatedly
threatened to use military force to regain control of the
territory should peace talks fail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
