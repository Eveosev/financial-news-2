Crude from the Bakken shale formation
strengthened against domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate
after  Northern Tier Energy LP (NTI)  finished starting up its refinery
in  Minnesota  after a turnaround.  Bakken strengthened 25 cents to a discount of $3.25 a
barrel against WTI at 11:13 a.m.  New York  time, according to
Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.  Northern Tier restarted the St. Paul Park refinery’s sweet
crude tower, with 8,000 barrels a day of expanded capacity, on
May 10, Hank Kuchta, the Ridgefield, Connecticut-based company’s
chief executive officer, said today during the company’s first
quarter earnings call.  The refinery ran 42,000 barrels a day of Bakken crude in
the first quarter before shutting down in April for the first
full-plant turnaround since 2007, Kuchta said.  Oils produced in the  Gulf Coast  strengthened against WTI.
Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana Sweet both
strengthened by 10 cents a barrel to premiums of $8.90 a barrel
and $8.50 a barrel over WTI, respectively, at 11:54 a.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Southern Green Canyon gained 40 cents a barrel to a $3.20
premium over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium fell 35 cents to $4 a barrel over WTI
