Chevron Corp. (CVX)  will become the first
major oil company to partner with YPF SA to develop shale oil
and a final deal is expected in July, YPF said.  Miguel Galuccio, chief executive officer of YPF, and  Ali Moshiri , Chevron’s head of Latin America, Middle East and
 Africa , visited the Patagonia shale formation today and met with
Neuquen’s governor Jorge Sapag, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the Buenos Aires-based company.  Jim Craig, a spokesman for San Ramon, California-based
Chevron, didn’t immediately replied to a call and an e-mail
seeking comment.  Moshiri, who in December signed with Galuccio an exclusive
right to negotiate final terms for YPF to transfer a 50 percent
interest in Loma de la Lata Norte and Loma Campana, was
“surprised” with the advanced state of YPF exploration
projects, according to the statement. The fields for the $1.5
billion joint venture comprise an area of 290 square kilometers
(180 miles) in southwestern Argentina.  “Along with Chevron, we will constitute the first joint
venture to develop shale,” Galuccio said.  YPF is pumping 7,000 barrels a day, according to the e-mailed press release. Vaca Muerta, which means “dead cow” in
Spanish, holds at least 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent,
according to a report by independent auditor Ryder Scott
released in February 2012 by YPF. Argentina holds the world’s
third-largest shale gas reserves, according to US Energy
Administration data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
