Pandora A/S (PNDORA) , a Danish maker of
bracelets and charms, reported first-quarter profit that
exceeded analyst estimates as its new products sold well.  Net income advanced to 438 million Danish kroner ($76.4
million) from 338 million kroner a year earlier, the Glostrup,
Denmark-based company said in a statement today. The average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts was 346 million
kroner.  “Revenue and earnings increased across all regions,”
Chief Executive Officer Bjoern Gulden, who will leave this
summer to take the CEO role at sporting-goods maker  Puma SE (PUM) ,
said in the statement. Most of the increase was “due to better
products, improved marketing and better execution in the
stores.”  Sales rose to 2 billion kroner, from 1.42 billion kroner a
year earlier, beating the 1.68 billion kroner that analysts
estimated. The company maintained its forecast for full-year
revenue to exceed 7.2 billion kroner. Chairman Allan Leighton
will replace Gulden on July 1, the company said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
