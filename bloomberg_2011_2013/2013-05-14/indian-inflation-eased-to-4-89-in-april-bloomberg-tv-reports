Indian inflation eased to 4.89
percent in April from a year earlier, Bloomberg TV  India 
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  The inflation rate compares with a 5.96 percent pace
previously reported in March and the median of 5.45 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 29 economists.  Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao on May 3
cut interest rates for a third time this year and signaled there
is little space to ease further, citing a current-account
shortfall and the possibility of price pressures returning. It’s
a challenge to curb inflation while supporting growth, he said
last week, even as data showed industrial output in March
expanded at the fastest pace in five months.  Consumer prices rose 9.39 percent in April, compared with
10.39 percent in March, the  Central Statistics Office  said
yesterday. Industrial production climbed 2.5 percent in March
from a year earlier, data showed last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
