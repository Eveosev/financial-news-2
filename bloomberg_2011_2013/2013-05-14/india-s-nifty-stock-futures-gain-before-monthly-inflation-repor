India’s (SENSEX)  benchmark stock index swung
between gains and losses before a report on wholesale prices.
 Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (DRRD)  advanced as  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  fell.  The S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.2 percent to 19,725.1 at 10:08
a.m. in Mumbai after changing directions at least six times.
Volume on the gauge was 17 percent below the 30-day average for
this time of day. The 30-stock measure tumbled 2.1 percent
yesterday. Dr Reddy’s climbed 0.8 percent ahead of its earnings
today. Tata Steel retreated to a one-month low after  India ’s
largest producer said it expects a $1.6 billion writedown in
asset values because of a drop in demand in  Europe .  Wholesale price  inflation  probably eased to 5.45 percent in
April from a year earlier, compared with 5.96 percent the
previous month, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. That would be the slowest rate since
November 2009.  Dr Reddy’s may announce fourth-quarter net income gained 30
percent to 4.47 billion rupees ($81.7 million) from 3.43 billion
rupees a year ago, according to the median estimate of 31
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The stock rose 0.8 percent to
2,093.1 rupees.  Profits at just two of the 14 Sensex companies that have
reported March-quarter earnings have  trailed  estimates, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with about 43 percent
that missed forecasts in the three months ended Dec. 31, and 40
percent in the previous two quarters.  Foreign investors bought $108 million of local shares on
May 10, taking this year’s inflows to a net $12.7 billion, data
from the market regulator show. That’s a record for the period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
