Crude from outside the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries will increase by 990,000
barrels a day annually to 2018 as U.S. tight oil output
continues to boom, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Non-OPEC supplies are forecast to grow to 59.3 million
barrels a day in 2018 from 53.3 million last year, or 1.9
percent a year, the Paris-based energy adviser said in its
medium-term oil market report today. The U.S. will add 2.8
million in liquids production, accounting for nearly half of the
growth and 420,000 barrels a day more than in the IEA’s estimate
in October.  “North America has set off a supply shock that is sending
ripples throughout the world,” IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven said in a press release accompanying the report.
“The good news is that this is helping to ease a market that
was relatively tight for several years.”  The tight oil boom in the U.S. unleashed by hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, boosted output last year to the highest
level since 1995 and could help make the world’s largest oil
consumer energy independent by 2020. New North American supply
will hurt growth in OPEC’s production capacity and could slow
global “megaprojects” as investment tilts toward the U.S., the
IEA said.  U.S. output  will reach 11.9 million barrel a day in 2018,
while  Canada  will add 1.3 million of liquids production over the
next five years as the country taps its oil sands deposits, the
IEA said. Growth in Canada may be limited before 2016 due to a
lack of pipeline capacity.  Russian Output  The U.S. will overtake  Russia  as the largest non-OPEC
producer in 2015 as  Russian liquids output  will climb 30,000
barrels a day to 10.76 million barrels in 2018. Confusion about
the country’s tax policy and planned incentives to develop new
areas could delay greenfield production, according to the IEA.  Brazilian output will grow by about 1 million barrels a day
to reach 3.2 million by 2018, primarily because of supply from
pre-salt areas, according to the report. Production outlook was
cut from the previous forecast because of a revised project
schedule from Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the IEA said.  New projects in the  North Sea  and better recovery
techniques could add 260,000 barrels a day by 2016 or 2017 as
capital expenditure grows for production within the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.  “Increasing capex levels in the OECD could dent the pace
of growth in investment from non-OPEC  Africa  production,” the
IEA said. “Major  oil companies  may begin to focus their
activity where investment requirements are not as steep.”  Local content policies in  Brazil , Columbia,  Kazakhstan  and
east Africa may offset production gains, according to the IEA.  “Output growth from  North America  dominates the medium-term growth profile,” the agency said. “At the more
established tight oil plays, operators are getting better at
targeting the sweet spots.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
