The pound weakened for a fourth day
against the dollar on speculation investors cut their holdings
of the U.K. currency before the  Bank of England  presents its
updated inflation forecasts tomorrow.  Sterling dropped to a two-week low versus the euro even
after an industry report showed a gauge of U.K.  house prices 
climbed to the highest level since June 2010. The pound has
slumped 2.4 percent against the dollar since strengthening to a
three-month high of $1.5606 on May 1.  Government bonds  fell as
the Debt Management Office sold 4.75 billion pounds ($7.25
billion) of five-year gilts.  “Going into the inflation report tomorrow you’ve seen some
people taking off some of the long cable positions,” said Peter Kinsella, a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London ,
referring to ending bets the pound will rise against the dollar.
“People who are looking at price action would look at the
failure to breach $1.56 over the past two weeks as being a sign
that upside in cable from here is rather capped.”  The pound dropped 0.3 percent to $1.5246 at 4:53 p.m.
London time after declining to $1.5229, the lowest level since
April 24. Sterling fell 0.3 percent to 85.05 pence per euro
after depreciating to 85.17 pence, the least since April 25.  Mervyn King  will hold his last news conference as Bank of
England Governor tomorrow after the central bank publishes its
quarterly survey in London.  The pound tumbled 0.8 percent against the dollar and euro
on Feb. 13 when the BOE published its previous Inflation Report,
which said risks to the recovery were weighted to the downside
and weak productivity was boosting cost pressures.  ‘Dovish’ Report  The pound is vulnerable to a “dovish inflation report”
following recent gains versus the euro driven by reduced
expectations of further asset purchases, Credit Suisse Group AG
strategists led by Ric Deverell in  New York , wrote yesterday in
a note to clients.  The pound has strengthened 1.9 percent in the past month,
the third-best performer after the Canadian and U.S. dollars
among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The greenback rose 2.6 percent and
the euro gained 1.4 percent.  The  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors said its index
of U.K. home prices climbed to 1 last month from minus 2 in
March. A positive number means more respondents saw values
increase than decline. A measure of inquiries from new buyers
increased to 25 from 13, the highest since November 2009.  ‘Political Risk’  The pound also weakened after Prime Minister  David Cameron 
offered to support a bill authorizing a referendum on the U.K.’s
continued membership in the European Union. His Conservative
Party will “publish a draft bill to legislate for an in-out
referendum by the end of 2017,” according to a party statement
released yesterday.  Scotland  will hold a referendum on the issue of
independence from the  United Kingdom  in September next year.  “Political risk is undoubtedly rising in the U.K.,” said
 Steve Barrow , head of Group-of-10 research at Standard Bank Plc
in London. “There’s the vote on Scottish independence next
year, which will definitely go ahead, and there’s a possible
U.K. referendum on EU membership. It could mean a rocky few
years but, in our view, neither will significantly undermine the
pound.”  The U.K. sold gilts maturing in July 2018 at an average
yield of 0.967 percent, compared with 1.041 percent at the
previous auction of the securities on March 5 and a  record-low 
0.787 percent set in November.  The benchmark  10-year gilt  yield climbed two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.90 percent after rising to 1.91
percent, the highest since March 20. The 1.75 percent bond due
in September 2022 fell 0.13, or 1.30 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 98.76.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this month
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
