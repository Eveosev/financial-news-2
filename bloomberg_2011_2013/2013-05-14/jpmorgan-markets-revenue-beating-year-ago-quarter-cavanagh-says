JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s revenue from
its markets businesses, which include trading of bonds and
equities, is about 10 percent to 15 percent greater so far this
quarter than the year-earlier period, a senior executive said.  Michael Cavanagh, co-head of JPMorgan’s corporate and
investment bank, made the remark at a conference in New York
hosted by  UBS AG (UBSN) , according to a transcript.  Revenue from markets businesses are “running about 10
percent to 15 percent higher than the second quarter of 2012,”
he said. The revenue is “still down a bit from the typically
strong first quarter that we just had.”  Wall Street banks’ trading units usually generate their
greatest profits in the first quarter, in part because
corporations raise more debt at the beginning of the year,
stoking fixed-income operations. A jump in second-quarter
trading earnings from a year earlier would mark a turnaround for
JPMorgan after revenue from that business slipped 5.4 percent in
2013’s first three months.  JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, rose 1.4 percent
to $50.38 at 11:08 a.m. in New York. The stock has climbed 15
percent so far this year, compared with a 16 percent advance in
the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
