China XD Group, a state-controlled
power equipment maker, is in talks to buy  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s
joint venture with Mexico’s Xignux SA for as much as $1 billion,
said three people with knowledge of the matter.  XD Group’s discussions to acquire Prolec GE Internacional
are at an early stage, said one of the people, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private. GE owns 49.99
percent of Prolec GE, according to a May 2012 statement by XD
Group’s listed unit  China XD Electric Co. (601179)   GE last year paid $536 million for a 15 percent stake in XD
Electric, the nation’s biggest maker of power transmission and
distribution equipment. The companies also agreed to create a
China joint venture, with Xi’an-based XD Electric holding 59
percent and GE the rest.  Prolec GE, which makes power transformer products, has
annual sales of about $600 million, a person with knowledge of
the matter said last month. Citigroup Inc. is advising GE on the
sale of the venture, the people said.  XD Group, founded in 1959, has more than 70 subsidiaries
and 22,000 employees, according to  its website . It exports
products and technologies to more than 50 countries including
 Germany , the U.S. and Singapore, the website shows.  XD Electric’s shares rose as much as 1.5 percent in
Shanghai trading today and closed up 0.9 percent at 3.38  yuan 
apiece, the highest in about three weeks. The benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index fell 1.1 percent.  Seth Martin , a spokesman for Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE, declined to comment, as did XD Group spokesman Hu Gengmin.
Jose Cantu, an executive at Xignux, didn’t immediately respond
