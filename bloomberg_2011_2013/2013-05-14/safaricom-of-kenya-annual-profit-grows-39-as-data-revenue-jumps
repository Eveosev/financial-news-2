Safaricom Ltd., which rivals East
African Breweries Ltd. as  Kenya ’s largest company by market
value, said full-year profit surged 39 percent as revenue from
data services increased.  Net income jumped to 17.5 billion shillings ($209 million)
in the 12 months through March from 12.6 billion shillings a
year earlier, Chief Financial Officer John Tombleson told
reporters today in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. The median estimate
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 17.2 billion
shillings. Sales grew 16 percent to 124.3 billion shillings,
helped by a 29 percent increase in non-voice revenue.  Mobile-phone companies are looking to data services such as
mobile Internet for revenue growth as voice markets mature.
Operators including Safaricom, 40 percent owned by  Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD) , are also offering African customers banking through
their mobile phones to help many of them gain access to
financial services for the first time.  Growth in non-voice revenue is “underpinning our strategy
to diversify our revenue channels,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Collymore said at a presentation in Nairobi.  The company will pay a dividend of 0.31 shillings per
share, a 41 percent increase on last year. Safaricom shares
gained 3.6 percent at 7.15 shillings at 12:56 p.m. in Nairobi,
increasing this year’s gains to 42 percent.  Beating Expectations  “The dividend was higher than we initially expected,”
Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd., said in an interview. “The earnings are
broadly in line with estimates.”  Free  cash flow , which measures a company’s performance by
considering the cash available for distribution to security
holders and to settle its short-term debts, grew 55 percent to
14.5 billion shillings, Collymore said. It will be in the range
of 15.5 billion shillings to 17.5 billion shillings in the year
to March 2014, he said.  “Based on the dividends that we are paying and what we
forecast our free cash flow to be for the next year, it is a
fairly reasonable assumption that we will see zero debt in a
year’s time,” Tombleson said. Capital expenditure will be
little changed at 24 billion shillings, he said.  M-Pesa, the company’s mobile money-transfer service, grew
revenue by 30 percent to 21.8 billion shillings, with the number
of registered customers totaling 17.1 million. Average revenue
per user for the service grew 22 percent to 117.4 shillings.  Upgrade System  Safaricom will upgrade the M-Pesa system to handle more
than 600 transactions per second from 250 now, Collymore said.  The company will also spend more than 10 billion shillings
over the next five years to build 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles)
of fiber-optic links in Nairobi, Collymore said. The first 500
kilometers will be completed this year.  “We will use it for back hauling to the base stations but
also getting to customer premises,” Collymore said.  M-Shwari, a mobile phone-based bank started in November by
Safaricom in partnership with Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of
 Africa , has about 1.2 million active customers, Collymore said.
The service has moved 880 million shillings in deposits and 390
million shillings in outstanding loans.  “People should not look at M-Shwari being a fantastic
revenue generator in the early years” Collymore said. “It is
revenue generating but it is not a big deal.”  Safaricom increased its customer base by 1.8 percent in the
year to 19.4 million. Voice revenue climbed 5.7 percent to 336.6
shillings.  Competitors of Safaricom include units of  France Telecom SA (FTE) 
and  India ’s  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  and Essar Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
