Renewable Energy Corp ASA (REC)  plans to
buy back 160 million euros ($208 million) of convertible bonds
and sell new shares and debt to extend maturities and ease
strain on its balance sheet.  REC, based in Sandvika near Oslo, has mandated Arctic
Securities ASA to manage the repurchase and exchange offer, it
said in a statement today. The company will repurchase as much
as 160 million euros of its convertible bond maturing in 2014
and tap two bonds to raise as much as 426 million kroner ($73.3
million), it said.  On the condition that the bond buyback is successfully
completed, REC will also sell 200 million new shares, it said.
The price will be determined by an accelerated book-building,
the company said.  “Significant orders in the convertible bond repurchase
offer have been received from certain holders of convertible
bond units,” REC said, without giving names. The acceptance for
the repurchase offer expires at 5:30 p.m. local time today.  REC, like European peers Solarworld AG and Q-Cells SE, is
under pressure from Chinese rivals that expanded capacity just
as demand slowed, causing solar-wafer and cell prices to plunge.
Cuts in renewable-energy subsidies in France, Italy and  Germany 
also hit sales.  Shares in REC jumped 8.1 percent to 1.86 kroner in Oslo at
the 4:30 p.m. close in Oslo. The share is up 74 percent this
year, after slumping for five straight years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
