Naruatsu Baba, the 35-year-old founder of Japanese smartphone game maker  Colopl Inc. (3668) , has become one of the youngest billionaires in the world as Colopl stock  leaped sevenfold  since its December initial share sale.  The Tokyo-based app maker produces games such as “Catastrophic Zombies” and “Kuma’s Digging Adventure.” Baba holds a 69 percent stake in the company valued at $2.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He has never appeared on an international wealth ranking.  Game app makers with hits in  Japan  have soared, contributing to an 86 percent advance in the JASDAQ Stock Index this year and minting billionaires in the world’s third-largest economy. Baba joins the ranks of  GungHo Online Entertainment Inc. (3765)  Chairman Taizo Son, whose bestseller “Puzzle & Dragons” generated first-quarter sales of $3.4 million a day. Son, the youngest brother of  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  President Masayoshi Son, is now worth $5.1 billion, up from $3.3 billion last week, according to the daily billionaires index.  “It’s a bubble market for mobile-game makers,” said Takashi Oka, an analyst at TIW Inc. in  Tokyo , who rates Colopl stock “neutral plus.” “As a developer, president (Baba) probably developed games in the beginning, so with more developers it’s possible for the company to grow exponentially.”  Popular Android Apps  Baba wants Colopl to produce 30 new games a year, according to an interview with Social Game Report in November. The company, founded in 2008, has five titles in the world’s 32  top-grossing  game apps for Google Android smartphones, including “Professional Baseball PRIDE,” “Treasure Detective” and “Dino Dominion.”  One of its free “Kuma the Bear” games has been recently  downloaded  more times than apps from Facebook, McDonald’s or Twitter, according to the Google play website. Colopl’s games have been downloaded 10 million times in less than a year, Baba said on his company’s website. That is equal to about 8 percent of Japan’s population.  Baba was on a business trip and unavailable to comment yesterday, according to an employee at his Tokyo office.  Colopl and GungHo games can be downloaded free. Players are encouraged to buy characters or game points to keep playing.  The  Bloomberg Billionaires Index  is a daily ranking of the world’s richest people.
