Canadian home resale prices rose in
April at the slowest annual pace since 2009 as  Vancouver  posted
declines, according to the Teranet-National Bank Composite House
Price  Index. (TNBHICP)   Prices rose 2.0 percent in April from a year earlier, based
on an 11-city composite reading, according to a report today by
Montreal-based National Bank Financial, the slowest year-over-year pace since November 2009. Prices in Vancouver recorded a
2.9 percent annual decline, according to the report.  The Teranet data adds to evidence Canada’s housing market
is becoming a drag on the economy, a slowdown that’s been
encouraged by policy makers amid signs of overbuilding.  Prices rose 0.2 percent during the month, according to the
 index . That was the slowest monthly increase in April since
2009, when the country was in a recession, and the second
slowest in at least 15 years, National Bank said in the
statement.  Home prices  in Toronto rose 0.4 percent in April,
while Vancouver saw a 0.8 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
