Hamburger Hafen & Logistik AG, which
handles about 80 percent of containers at the port of Hamburg,
stuck to a forecast of possible revenue growth this year after
first-quarter volume at its rail and trucking operations rose.  Revenue in 2013 may total 1.1 billion euros ($1.43 billion)
to 1.2 billion euros, the Hamburg-based company said today in a
 statement . That compares with sales last year of 1.13 billion
euros. The intermodal division, which includes the company’s
land-transport operations, will probably handle more freight
this year, while container volume at the port unit will about
match the 2012 level, it said.  Port operators in Europe are struggling with recessions
stemming from the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. Growth at
Hamburger Hafen and smaller local competitor Eurogate is also
hampered as a dredging project to deepen the river Elbe is held
up by a lawsuit by environmental groups, and a ruling isn’t
expected before 2014.  First-quarter earnings before interest and taxes rose 13
percent to 38.5 million euros, the company said. Profit was
bolstered by the sale of the Altenwerder logistics center in
Hamburg, said Karl Olaf Petters, a spokesman. Earnings exceeded
the 33.9 million-euro average of four analyst  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales fell 2.7 percent to 279 million euros.
Revenue beat the average estimate of 267.8 million euros.  Cargo volume at the port division rose 5 percent to 1.8
million containers, helped by growth in trade with Asian and
Baltic countries and by the company’s Black Sea terminal in
Odessa, Ukraine, the company said. Excluding year-earlier
figures from the former Transfracht unit, volume at the
intermodal business jumped more than 20 percent, it said.  Hamburger Hafen  rose  as much as 1.6 percent to 17.89 euros,
the highest intraday price since March 19, at 9:54 a.m. in
 Frankfurt . That propelled the stock to a 0.4 percent gain this
year, valuing the company at 1.3 billion euros.  The port operator is forecasting Ebit this year will
decline to within a range of 155 million euros to 175 million
euros, from 186 million euros in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
