The outlook for ethanol production
growth in the U.S. is dimmed because of the growing debate on
whether the country should abandon or revise the biofuels
policy, the  International Energy Agency  said today.  Last year’s drought, which damaged corn crops and raised
costs for livestock farmers, provided fodder for those who
oppose the Renewable Fuels Standard, or RFS2, which calls for
the U.S. to use escalating amounts of biofuels in petroleum. The
mandate is also under attack from petroleum industry advocates
who say stagnant gasoline demand makes the law unworkable, the
IEA said in its Medium-Term Oil Market Report.  “Though there is no clear indication the RFS2 will be
amended, growing market perception of policy uncertainty
introduces an additional downside risk to our medium-term
forecast,” the Paris-based organization said.  The U.S. is the world’s largest biofuels producer,
accounting for 48 percent of global output, IEA data show.
 Brazil  is second-largest.  The IEA forecast that the U.S. will produce 937,000 barrels
a day of biofuels in 2013, down 35,000 from its estimate of a
year ago. The global output estimate is 1.95 million barrels a
day, down 80,000 from the previous estimate, as output in
Argentina and  Europe  is expected to weaken.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 6.5 cents, or
2.5 percent, to $2.671 a gallon yesterday on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices have gained 27 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
