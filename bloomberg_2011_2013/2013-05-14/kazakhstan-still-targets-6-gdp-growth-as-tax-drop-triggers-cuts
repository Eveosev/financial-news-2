Kazakhstan  reiterated its 6 percent
economic-growth forecast for this year even as falling
corporate-tax revenue prompted the government to cut spending.  Corporate taxes will fall 229.9 billion tenge ($1.5
billion) short of the previous plan, Economy and Budget Planning
Minister Erbolat Dosayev told a Cabinet meeting today in Astana,
according to an e-mailed copy of his speech. Budget revenue will
be 3.588 trillion tenge, 226.1 billion tenge less than envisaged
earlier, he said, confirming a 121.3 billion-tenge reduction in
spending to 6.1 trillion tenge.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development cut
Kazakhstanâ€™s 2013 growth forecast this month to 4.9 percent from
6 percent in January. The reduction reflects weaker expansion in
neighboring  Russia  and delays in new energy projects, the EBRD
 said  on its website.  -- With assistance from Agnes Lovasz in  London . Editors: Andrew
