OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, beat first-quarter revenue and earnings estimates after
profit margins in its refining division widened.  Earnings before interest and tax in the three months
through March rose 6 percent to 851 million euros ($1.1 billion)
after sales climbed 4 percent higher to 10.8 billion euros, the
company said in a statement today. Analysts estimated that the
Vienna-based company would report 802 million euros Ebit on
revenue of 10.5 billion euros.  Wider profit margins at OMV’s refining centers helped drive
earnings. The company reported 112 million euros Ebit from its
refining and marketing unit during the quarter compared with a
30 million-euro loss a year earlier.  Net income in the quarter fell 8 percent to 349 million
euros after the company paid higher taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
