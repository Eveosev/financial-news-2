Global trade in crude and condensate
will drop by 0.5 percent annually from 2012 to 2018 as North
America reduces its imports because of rising domestic
production, according to the International Energy Agency.  Trade in crude and condensate, or light crude, will decline
to 32.4 million barrels a day in 2018, down 900,000 barrels from
last year, the Paris-based energy adviser said today in its
medium-term oil market report. That is about equivalent to one
Suezmax tanker.  “The single largest development in the oil trade landscape
will be the continuing surge in U.S. and  Canada  supplies,” the
IEA said. Output from America will add 2.7 million barrels a
day, notably of light, tight crude, with Canada forecast to
contribute an extra 1.3 million barrels of mainly heavy  Alberta 
oil and syncrude, it said.  Lighter, low-sulfur crudes typically pollute less than
other grades and yield larger quantities of higher-value
products such as gasoline and diesel. Syncrude is a synthetic
oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in Alberta into refinery-ready crude.  North American  imports  of crude are projected to decline by
2.2 million barrels a day over the period to reach 3.4 million
barrels a day in 2018, according to the report.  U.S. crude purchases from West Africa will continue to drop
after peaking at 2.7 million barrels a day in 2007, according to
the report. By 2018, North American imports are estimated at
300,000 barrels a day, or 850,000 barrels less than in 2012,
which would mean that only 6 percent of regional imports would
be sourced from there, it said.  Economies outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development will increase their share of global imports and
by 2018 will surpass that of OECD nations, accounting for 51
percent, or 16.5 million barrels a day, of total overseas
purchases, the IEA said.  “This reflects diminishing imports by North America, lower
refinery demand in Europe and OECD Asia Oceania and increasing
demand in  China  and other Asia,” the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
