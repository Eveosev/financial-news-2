Gold climbed the most in nearly a
week as a three-day, 3 percent decline lured some buyers, while
the dollar retreated for the first time in four days.  Gold for immediate delivery advanced as much as 1.1 percent
to $1,445.57 an ounce, and was at $1,440.75 by 9:55 a.m. in
 Singapore . That’s the biggest intraday gain since May 8. Prices
dropped a third day yesterday the longest slump since April,
when bullion entered a bear market. The Dollar Index slid 0.3
percent today after climbing 1.7 percent in the three days
through yesterday.  The dollar has rallied 4.1 percent against a six-currency
basket including the yen and the euro this year as data showed
the U.S. economy strengthening, while the Bank of  Japan 
undertook unprecedented stimulus and the European Central Bank
cut interest rates to a record. Gold has dropped 14 percent this
year after 12 straight years of gains as some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value.  “Physical buyers backed off when prices neared $1,500 and
we expect some of them to come back to the market after the
recent price decline,” said Huang Fulong, an analyst at CITICS
Futures Co., a unit of  China ’s largest listed brokerage. “Any
rally will be capped if ETF selling continues.”  Gold for June delivery rose 0.5 percent to $1,441.10 an
ounce on the Comex in New York. Holdings in  exchange-traded
products  backed by bullion dropped to 2,225.9 metric tons
yesterday, the least since July 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Assets in gold ETPs shrunk 15 percent this year.  Silver gained 0.4 percent to $23.762 an ounce, platinum
advanced 0.6 percent to $1,489.10 an ounce and palladium added
0.2 percent to $719.05 an ounce.  The platinum market swung into the biggest shortage since
2002 last year as supply fell to a 12-year low on strikes and
stoppages in top producer South Africa, according to Johnson
Matthey Plc. The palladium deficit was the biggest since 2000,
Johnson Matthey said yesterday.  To contact the reporter for this story:
