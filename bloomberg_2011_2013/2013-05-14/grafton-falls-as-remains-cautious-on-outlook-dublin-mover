  Grafton Group Plc (GN5) , the Irish
building materials supplier, fell the most in a month in Dublin
trading after the company said it “remains cautious about the
near-term outlook.”  Grafton fell as much as 3 percent to 5.44 euros in
Dublin, the biggest drop in intraday trading since April 5, and
traded at 5.45 euros as of 10:15 a.m. Trading volume in the
stock was 1.3 times the average for the past three months at
about 588,000 shares.  Sales for the four months to the end of April were 677
million euros, little changed from 676 million euros in the same
period last year, the company said today. Like-for-like sales in
the Irish retailing operation fell 8.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
