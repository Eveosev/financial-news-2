India’s government bonds advanced,
pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to a 34-month low, on
speculation slowing inflation will give the central bank more
room to reduce borrowing costs. The rupee gained.  Wholesale price  inflation  eased to 5.45 percent in April
from a year earlier, after a 5.96 percent increase in March that
was the least since 2009, according to the median estimate of 29
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before data due around noon in
 New Delhi  today. Consumer-price gains slowed to a 13-month low
last month, official data showed yesterday, while a report last
week showed factory output rose the most since October.  “Signs of stabilization in the industrial production
numbers and pullback in the consumer-price inflation measure,
while still elevated, provide the Reserve Bank with room to keep
rates on hold in June, before undertaking another cut possibly
in July,” Radhika Rao, a Singapore-based economist at DBS Group
Holdings Ltd., wrote in a research report today.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.57 percent as of
10:01 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That would the lowest closing level for a benchmark 10-year note since July 2, 2010.  The government will auction a new benchmark note maturing
in 2023 on May 17, the central bank said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  Gold Imports  The  Reserve Bank  of India said yesterday it would
immediately restrict shipments of gold after a government report
showed the trade deficit widened to a three-month high in April
as imports of the metal surged 138 percent from a year earlier.  The central bank’s steps will rein in bullion imports from
June even as demand for gold will stay “high” this month due
to demand for weddings and yesterday’s Akshaya Tritiya festival,
a day on which it is considered auspicious to buy the metal, BNP
Paribas SA said in a research note today. Inbound shipments may
jump 47 percent to 225 metric tons in the three months through
June, Haresh Soni, chairman of the All  India  Gems & Jewellery
Trade Federation, said in a phone interview yesterday.  The rupee rose 0.1 percent to 54.7025 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 55.0250 yesterday, the
weakest level since March 4. One-month implied volatility, a
gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell seven basis points to 8.56 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.62 per
dollar, compared with 55.74 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.47 versus 55.59. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
