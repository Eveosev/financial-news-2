European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. (EAD)  posted higher first-quarter earnings as its Airbus unit more
than doubled profit on higher deliveries of commercial jets.  Earnings before interest, tax and one-time items rose 56
percent to 741 million euros ($963 million), while Airbus profit
on that basis increased to 608 million euros, EADS said in a
statement today. Profit at EADS exceeded  an estimate  for 607
million euros in a survey of analysts by Bloomberg. The company
maintained its outlook for this year.  “On the operational side, we had a rather good start into
2013 with improved revenues and profitability” Chief Executive
 Tom Enders  said. “Management continues to focus on improving
the bottom line performance in 2013 and beyond.”  The 54-year-old German, who formerly ran Airbus, took the
EADS top job a year ago, setting a target to deliver a double-digit return on sales by 2015. In his first few months he failed
to construct a merger with  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and transformed the
shareholder structure, increasing the number of freely traded
shares and reducing government control.  EADS rose as much as 84 cents, or 2 percent, to 42.04
euros, and traded at 41.94 euros as of 9:07 a.m. in Paris. The
stock has gained 42 percent this year, while Boeing Co. is up 26
percent.  Free  cash flow  before acquisitions was negative 3.2 billion
euros, compared with negative 1.2 billion in the year-earlier
quarter. EADS said the trend reflects the ramp-up in working
capital at Airbus and its Eurocopter helicopter business. Total
sales rose 9 percent to 12.4 billion euros.  The company kept its guidance from February for “moderate
growth” in sales, given planned lower deliveries of A380s, and
said it was targeting Ebit before one-time items of 3.5 billion
euros this year. It forecast earnings per share before one-time
items of about 2.50 euros, prior to a proposed share buyback.  The A350 program for a new wide-body aircraft to compete
with Boeing’s 787 and 777 jets “remains challenging,” EADS
said today. The planemaker’s first flyable A350 rolled out of
the paint shop yesterday as engineers prepare for its maiden
flight in coming weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
