Ultra-low-sulfur diesel declined on
speculation that U.S. distillate inventories climbed last week.
Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures fell as stockpiles probably rose 650,000 barrels,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg. ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate
crude narrowed 67 cents to $25.58 a barrel. The  premium over
Brent  slipped 29 cents to $18.31.  “There’s an expectation that distillate inventories will
rise,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery declined 1.69
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.8741 a gallon at 9:58 a.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  on trading volume that was 2.5
percent above the 100-day average.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington . The report
will probably say that gasoline inventories declined 1 million
barrels last week, according to the survey.  Gasoline for June delivery gained 1.02 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.8312 a gallon on trading volume that was 35
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 45 cents to
$23.76 a barrel, and the fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 85 cents
to $16.51.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to
$3.582 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
climbed for nine consecutive days to the highest level since
April 8 and are 14.5 cents below a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
