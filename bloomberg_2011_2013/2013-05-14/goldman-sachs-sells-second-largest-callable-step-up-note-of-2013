Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  sold $31
million of 15-year callable step-up notes, the second-largest
such offering in the U.S. this year.  The securities, issued May 8, yield 3.25 percent for the
first eight years, then increase five more times to 7.5 percent
for the last year, according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The  New York  bank and
Incapital LLC distributed the notes for a 3.24 percent fee.  The bank has the option to call the notes quarterly
starting Nov. 13, according to the prospectus.  Goldman Sachs sold $42 million of 15-year callable step-up
notes in two related offerings on Feb. 19 and 25, the biggest
such deal this year. The securities yield 3.5 percent annually
for the first eight years, then increase four times to 7.5
percent during the last six months, according to a  prospectus 
filed with the SEC.  Goldman Sachs has issued the most rate-tied notes in the
U.S. this year, $418.9 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank was also No. 1 for all of 2012, selling
$1.14 billion of the securities.  Tiffany Galvin, a company spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
