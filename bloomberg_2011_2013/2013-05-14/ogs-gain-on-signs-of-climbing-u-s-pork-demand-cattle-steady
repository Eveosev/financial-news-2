Hog futures advanced on signs of
increasing domestic demand for U.S. pork. Cattle prices were
little changed.  Wholesale  pork  yesterday rose 0.9 percent to 90.7 cents a
pound, the highest since Aug. 20, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. Prices are up 10 percent this year. Meatpackers
processed 400,000 hogs yesterday, an increase of 1 percent from
the same period a week earlier, government data show.  “All eyes are on the cutout,” which is the wholesale pork
price,  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West
Des Moines,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. The price
“going up is telling us our domestic demand is pretty good.
That’s what gave us the support yesterday and today.”  Hog futures for June settlement climbed 0.4 percent to
91.25 cents a pound at 10:20 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the second straight gain. Prices have added 6.1
percent this year through yesterday.  Cattle futures for August delivery added less than 0.1
percent to $1.209 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.1
percent to $1.46375 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
