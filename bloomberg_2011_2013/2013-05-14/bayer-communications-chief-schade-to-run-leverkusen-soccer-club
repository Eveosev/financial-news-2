Bayer AG (BAYN)  named its head of
communications as the managing director of the German drug and
chemical company’s  Leverkusen   soccer club .  Michael Schade, who has run global communications for five
years, will succeed Wolfgang Holzhaeuser at  Bayer 04 Leverkusen
Soccer GmbH  on Oct. 1, Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer said
today in a statement. Holzhaeuser is retiring, the company said.  “I come from sports, I was a sports journalist,” Schade,
60, said by e-mail. “Now, at the end of my career, the circle
is closing and I’ll return to it. I’m very much looking forward
to it.”  With one week left in the Bundesliga season, Leverkusen is
third in the league with 62 points, trailing Bayern Munich and
Dortmund. Bayern and Dortmund will play in the May 25th final of
the  Champions League , European soccer’s top club tournament. All
three will compete in the Champions League next season.  Bayer didn’t announce a replacement for Schade, who joined
the company in 1980. Schade has been a member of the shareholder
committee for Bayer 04, the supervisory board of the Bayer
Bundesliga team, since March 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
