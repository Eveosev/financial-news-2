Clive Capital LLP paid its top-earning partner $33.5 million in the 12 months through February
as the commodity hedge-fund firm managed by  Chris Levett  posted
losses for clients for a second straight year.  The company’s three partners Levett, 43, Richard Boland and
Elizabeth Holstein, received a total $39.2 million, Clive said
in a filing to the U.K.’s Companies House. The fund, which
awarded its highest-paid member $60.8 million in the previous
year, didn’t identify details of the compensations.  Commodity funds have struggled to make consistent returns
as economic and political concerns roiled markets. Clive
declined 8.8 percent last year and 10 percent in 2011, according
to two people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
named because the information is private.  That compares with an average loss for hedge funds tracked
by the Newedge Commodity Trading Index of 1.9 percent in 2012
and 3.8 percent in 2011. The index, which follows 56 funds, lost
0.5 percent in the four months through April.  Clive’s hedge fund posted investment gains of 1.8 percent
in the year’s first four months, one of the people said. The
firm’s assets under management have fallen by $600 million this
year to $1.35 billion at the end of March, the person said.  Clive, which managed $3.6 billion at the end of 2011,
awarded its highest-paid member $135 million in the 12 months
through February 2011, according to company filings.  ‘Paid Handsomely’  Hedge funds  typically charge clients fees for managing
money and on any investment gains, allowing managers to profit
even in years when they post losses. Most hedge fund managers
also invest in their own funds and make gains or suffer losses
along with clients.  Clive in February announced the firm would cut the charges
on its Class B shares to a 2 percent management fee and a 20
percent performance fee, down from 2.5 percent and 25 percent
respectively, as a result of “two challenging years.”  “The fact that a manager can lose money and get paid so
handsomely illustrates the ‘heads I win, tails you lose’
structure of hedge-fund fees,” Simon Lack, founder of SL
Advisors and author of ‘The Hedge Fund Mirage: The Illusion of
Big Money’, said in a telephone interview from Westfield,  New
Jersey , today. “It doesn’t cost 2 percent of $3 billion to run
an asset-management firm.”  Charity Donation  Levett started Clive in 2008 after four years at  Louis Bacon ’s Moore Capital Management LP. He stopped taking money
from investors in 2009 after assets climbed to almost $4
billion. He didn’t respond today to a phone call and an e-mail
seeking comment on remuneration and performance at the fund.
Holstein, who oversees  investor relations  at Clive, declined to
comment.  The fund paid its 11 staff $3.5 million and gave $553,000
to charity last year.  The fund’s Class A shares surged 44 percent in 2008, 17
percent in 2009 and 20 percent in 2010, according to investors.
Class B shares, which started later, rose 16 percent in 2008, 16
percent in 2009 and 18 percent in 2010.  Prior to joining New York-based Moore, Levett worked at
trading firm Commodity Corp. He started out in commodities in
1992 at American International Group Inc., where he traded oil.  Levett’s wealth is 250 million pounds ($382 million),
unchanged from a year earlier, the Sunday Times reported last
month. The U.K.’s wealthiest fund manager is  Alan Howard , co-founder of Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP, whose personal
fortune climbed to 1.5 billion pounds, according to the Sunday
Times “ Rich List .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
