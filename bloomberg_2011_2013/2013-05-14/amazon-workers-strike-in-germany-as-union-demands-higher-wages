Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  workers in  Germany 
went on strike today as the country’s largest services union
attempts to push the Internet retailer to join collective
bargaining agreements and pay higher wages.  About 1,500 Amazon employees, including staff at the main
locations in Bad Hersfeld, Hesse, and Leipzig, Saxony,
participated in the walkouts, the Ver.di union said on its
 website . The Seattle-based company hasn’t responded to the
demands and the union is prepared to take further steps, Ver.di
lead negotiator Joerg Lauenroth-Mago said by phone.  Amazon, which employs about 9,000 people in  Europe ’s
biggest economy, drew scrutiny in Germany this year after a
documentary aired on ARD television accusing it of exploiting
migrant workers. Christine Hoeger, a spokeswoman for Amazon,
didn’t immediately return a call and the company’s German press
department didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  As part of the demands, Ver.di is asking Amazon to raise
minimum pay to 10.66 euros ($13.84) an hour from 9.30 euros in
Leipzig and to 12.18 euros from 9.83 euros in Bad Hersfeld, and
to pay extra for night shifts starting before midnight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
