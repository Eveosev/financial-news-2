PNE Wind AG (PNE3)  placed about 66.3 million
euros ($86 million) of bonds, less than the 100 million euros
that the German wind developer initially intended.  The Cuxhaven-based company closed the placing of 8 percent
corporate debt with institutional and private investors on May
10, it said today in a statement. On March 12, PNE said proceeds
would fund the acquisition of shares in a wind company, later
identified as WKN AG, and on- and offshore wind farms. The bonds
mature June 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It shows a little bit of bad timing here because some
other wind project developers” have “had significant problems
in the recent past where their bond prices decreased
significantly,” said Christopher Rodler, an analyst at MM
Warburg Investment Research in Hamburg. “Maybe investors are a
little bit scared of the whole industry right now.”  PNE Wind raised what it needed to fund its purchase of 54
percent in WKN, Rainer Heinsohn, a spokesman, said by phone. He
said 100 million euros was the maximum it would have raised.  WKN is valued at about 93 million euros, according to a PNE
Wind statement on April 19. It didn’t give a purchase price. The
final amount of the bond placement will be determined on May 17
when the last subscription applications are settled, according
to the company. The corporate bonds will begin trading on
Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Regulated Market tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
