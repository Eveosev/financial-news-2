Brent crude  may drop below its April
low of $96.75 a barrel as it completes a so-called Elliot Wave
correction, according to  technical analysis  by CMC Markets.  Futures declined the past two days after facing selling
pressure at the 50-day moving average of about $105.60 a barrel,
according to Ric Spooner, a Sydney-based chief market analyst at
CMC. Brent, the benchmark for half of the world’s oil, has a
“potentially bearish setup,” he said.  “As long as it doesn’t move past the highs of last week at
about $106, that sort of scenario remains in place,” Spooner
said. “That indicates the potential for it to decline, at least
down below its recent April lows and get under $96.75.”  Brent for June settlement was at $102.90 a barrel, up 8
cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at 1:08
p.m. Sydney time today. The contract slid $1.09, or 1.1 percent,
to $102.82 yesterday, the biggest drop since May 1. The front-month contract traded at $96.75 on April 18, the lowest intraday
price since July.  The Elliott Wave theory, created in the 1930s by  Ralph Nelson Elliott , an American accountant and author, seeks to
predict moves in markets by dividing past trends into five
sections, or waves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
