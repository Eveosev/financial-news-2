World soccer governing body FIFA
suspended eight players from  Estonia  and one from Lebanon for
their parts in match manipulation and fraud.  The Estonian players were suspended from all soccer
activities for one year for taking money from a bookmaker during
domestic league and cup matches. The Estonian Football
Association on March 1 suspended the players from all activities
in the country and FIFA today extended the ban worldwide.  “The Estonian FA has specified that the bans are temporary
at this stage, as more evidence and information is currently
being gathered,” FIFA said in a  statement .  The player from Lebanon received a lifetime ban relating to
“actions of betting and corruption committed by some Lebanese
officials and players” during national team and domestic cup
matches, FIFA said.  The governing body last month extended further sanctions on
23 other players and one official involved in the same
investigation, with bans ranging from one year to a lifetime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
