Sanofi (SAN) ,  France ’s largest drugmaker,
was fined 40.6 million euros ($52.8 million) by the country’s
competition regulator for trying to limit sales of generic
versions of the company’s Plavix blood thinner.  Sanofi denigrated the copies of the drug to doctors and
pharmacists, the regulator said in a  statement  on its website
today. The Competition Authority was acting on a complaint by
 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s biggest maker
of generic medicines.  Plavix had sales of 2.07 billion euros last year. In 2008,
France’s national health system paid 625 million euros on the
drug, the most of any pharmaceutical, the competition regulator
said.  Sanofi’s sales force cast doubt on the efficacy of
competing generics in conversations with doctors and pharmacists
in 2009 and 2010, and warned that they could be liable if
patients had medical problems after using the copies, according
to the statement.  Sanofi urged doctors to write on prescriptions that the
generic version couldn’t be substituted for the branded product,
the competition regulator said. The Paris-based company also
urged pharmacists, when using a generic, to use Sanofi’s own
generic rather than one from a competitor, according to the
statement.  “Sanofi disagrees with the Competition Authority’s
decision, and is currently reviewing all the points to prepare
an appeal before the Paris appeals court,” the company said in
an e-mailed statement. “The safety of patients is Sanofi’s
first priority.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
