New Jersey (STONJ1) ’s average residential property-tax bill rose 1.6 percent to a record $7,885 last year as most towns abided by Governor  Chris Christie ’s 2 percent cap on the levies, slowing the growth rate, according to state data.  The average homeowner paid $126 more than in 2011, the smallest increase in at least five years, according to the  Community Affairs Department . New Jersey residents pay the nation’s highest average real-estate levies, according to the Washington-based  Tax Foundation .  Slideshow:  Most & Least Taxing States “By any measure, the property-tax reforms have been a resounding success,” Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable told the Assembly Budget Committee May 9. “This success is measured against a cumulative average increase of 70 percent in the 10 years before Governor Christie took office.”  The average property-tax bill in 2011 was $7,759, 2.4 percent more than in 2010, state data show. Along with the property-tax cap Christie won in 2010, he and the Democratic-led legislature passed a pension overhaul in 2011 that requires government workers to pay more toward retirement and for health-care benefits. Constable said that measure will save  New Jersey ’s 566 municipalities $543 million in fiscal 2014.  Christie, a 50-year-old Republican seeking a second term, has lobbied lawmakers to approve a state income-tax cut based on real-estate levies paid by residents. Democrats set aside $183 million in the current budget to cover the governor’s proposed credits, yet they have refused to release the money.  Payments Rose  While the rate of property-tax increases may be slowing, the net amount paid by New Jersey homeowners rose almost 19 percent during Christie’s first three years in office as he cut rebate programs, NJ Spotlight, a nonprofit research group, said May 6. Under Christie’s predecessor, Democrat  Jon Corzine , the net amount paid rose 6 percent over three years as rebates offset rising levies.  Credits reduced the average net amount paid last year to $7,410, down $109, or 1.4 percent, from $7,519 in 2011, according to state data.
