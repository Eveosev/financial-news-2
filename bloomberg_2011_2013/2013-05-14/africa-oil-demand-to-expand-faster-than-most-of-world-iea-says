Oil demand in Africa will climb at a
faster pace than most of the world in the next five years
because of rising transport and power-generation needs, a report
by the IEA showed.  Gasoline and gasoil consumption are each forecast to rise
4.5 percent a year, while the use of jet fuel or kerosene will
advance 3.9 percent, the  International Energy Agency  said in its
medium-term oil market report today. The gains will boost
Africa’s oil use by 4 percent a year from 2012 to 2018 compared
with an average of 1.2 percent growth globally for that period.  “The very low historical base of African demand and the
region’s rapid income gain mean that great leaps in demand
growth may be in the cards,” the Paris-based agency said. “The
prospect of excess global gasoline and naphtha production in the
next few years could set the stage for an abundance of light
ends looking for new market outlets.”  Consumption of liquid petroleum gas, seen as a transition
fuel between burning wood and municipal gas in emerging
economies, is growing because it’s easy to distribute and
several countries have been building plants and terminals for
the gas, according to the report.  Africa ’s crude-refining capacity reached 3.47 million
barrels a day last year, which should be enough to meet demand,
while an average plant utilization rate of 60 percent keeps the
continent a net fuel importer, the agency said.  Lack of roads, security challenges, corruption and
governance issues may block “a real takeoff in African oil
demand,” the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
