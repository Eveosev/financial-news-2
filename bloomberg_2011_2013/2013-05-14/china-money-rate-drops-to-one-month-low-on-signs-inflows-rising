China ’s money-market rate dropped to
a one-month low on speculation rising inflows of foreign capital
will help increase the supply of cash.  The People’s Bank of China sold 27 billion  yuan  ($4.4
billion) of three-month bills today at a  yield  of 2.9089
percent, unchanged from the last sale on May 9, according to a
trader required to bid at the auctions. The monetary authority
also issued 52 billion yuan of 28-day repurchase contracts to
drain capital.  “Foreign capital inflows are probably still rising,” said
Wang Huane, a senior bond trader at Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan, the
capital of the eastern Shandong province. “The bill sale is not
big enough to mop up excess liquidity.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 2.75 percent as of 10:49 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
the lowest level since April 10, according to a weighted average
rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  Yuan positions  at Chinese financial institutions stemming
from foreign-exchange transactions, a gauge of cross-border
capital flows, rose by 1.22 trillion yuan in the first three
months of 2013, more than four times as much as in the same
period last year, central bank data show. The central bank
hasn’t announced figures for April and May.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined one
basis point to 3.25 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
