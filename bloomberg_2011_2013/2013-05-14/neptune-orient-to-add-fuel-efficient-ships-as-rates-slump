Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. (NOL) ,  Southeast
Asia ’s biggest container-shipping company, said it will add more
fuel-efficient ships this year to pare costs as a vessel glut
continues to damp freight rates.  The shipping line will take delivery of 14 vessels this
year, Neptune Orient said in a statement yesterday. It added 10
ships last year and sold some of the older ones.  Neptune Orient has said cost cuts and new ships will help
improve performance in 2013 after posting three annual losses in
four years. The carrier has also sold its Singapore headquarters
as shipping lines struggle with overcapacity and a slump in
demand caused by  Europe ’s economic downturn.  “The economic recovery in Europe is still very slow,”
said Lawrence Li, an analyst at  UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. (UOBK)  in
 Shanghai . “Asia-Europe rates have fallen and you’re in a better
position if you have a bigger exposure on trans-Pacific like
Neptune Orient.”  The company yesterday reported  net income  of $75.5 million
in the three months ended April 5, compared with a net loss of
$254 million a year earlier. Sales slipped 0.4 percent to $2.37
billion.  Neptune Orient, whose businesses include container
shipping, terminals and logistics operations, said it had a gain
of $200 million from the sale of the headquarters building.  Its container-shipping unit operated 125 vessels with a
combined capacity of 605,000 20-foot boxes at the end of the
quarter. Total capacity dropped 1.6 percent from a year earlier,
said the company, which will add 10 ships in 2014.  Efficient Vessels  “The group’s cost base will continue to improve as it
takes delivery of newer and more efficient ships,” Neptune
Orient said. “However, the container shipping industry remains
saddled with overcapacity.”  Shares of Neptune Orient gained 0.9 percent to S$1.10 at
close of Singapore trading. The stock has dropped 3.9 percent
this year, compared with an 8.7 percent gain for the Straits
Times Index.  APL Ltd., Neptune Orient’s container-shipping arm, earned
an average revenue per box of $2,376, a 1.8 percent decline. It
moved 772,000 forty-foot-equivalent cargo boxes in the quarter,
2.4 percent fewer than a year earlier. The shipping unit filled
91 percent of capacity in the three-month period.  Cargo hauled on the trans-Pacific route, the world’s
second-busiest, increased 4 percent to 224,000 boxes in the
first quarter, while those on the Asia-Europe trade dropped 17
percent to 109,000.  ‘Less Exposed’  “NOL is less exposed to the Asia-Europe trade where
overcapacity risks are much higher,” Corrine Png, head of
regional transportation research at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote
in a note yesterday.  APL’s loss before interest and taxes narrowed to $101
million in the quarter, from $246 million a year earlier.  Spot rates to haul a 20-foot container to Europe from  Asia 
dropped 6.4 percent to $1,140 in the first quarter, according to
the Shanghai Shipping Exchange. The levy dropped 8.2 percent
last week to $731. Rates to the U.S. West Coast rose 1.8 percent
to $1,132. Lines need at least $1,200 to make money, according
to ship broker ICAP.  The price of 380 Centistoke marine bunker fuel, used by
ships, averaged $633.76 a metric ton in the first quarter, 14
percent lower than a year ago in Singapore trading, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It dropped 0.7 percent to $596
today.  “We have improved operational performance considerably
from one year ago, so we know we are on the right track,” Chief
Executive Officer Ng Yat Chung said in the statement. “But
there is still more work to be done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
