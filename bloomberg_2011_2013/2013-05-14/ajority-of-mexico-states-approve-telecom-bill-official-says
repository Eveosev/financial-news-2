A Mexican law to boost competition in
telecommunications and media gained approval from a majority of
state legislatures, surmounting its final hurdle for passage.  “It’s a historic day for  Mexico ,”  Jose Ignacio Peralta ,
deputy communications minister, said in a  message  posted on
Twitter announcing the milestone. President Enrique Pena Nieto
has already pledged support for the bill, which passed both
houses of Congress last month.  The proposal seeks to increase investment and reduce prices
in the phone and pay-television industries and to create more
choice in broadcast TV. It would create tougher conditions for
 America Movil SAB (AMXL) , which has 70 percent of Mexico’s mobile-phone
subscribers, and  Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , which gets 70 percent of
the nation’s broadcast-television audience.  The new law allows foreigners to take majority stakes in
landline phone and cable networks for the first time. It also
calls for the creation of new TV broadcasters through government
auctions.  The bill was approved with the support of Mexico’s three
largest parties. Legislators will still have to draft
supplemental rules, known as secondary laws, to support the new
law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
