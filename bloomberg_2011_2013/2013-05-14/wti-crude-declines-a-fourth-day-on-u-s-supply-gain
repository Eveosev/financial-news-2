West Texas Intermediate crude fell
for a fourth day, the longest stretch of declines this year, on
forecasts that U.S. supplies climbed from an 82-year high.  Futures dropped 1 percent on speculation rising inventories
will meet increasing fuel demand. Stockpiles probably gained
450,000 barrels to 396 million last week, according to a
Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration
report tomorrow. Growth in North American production will be as
significant for global markets as  China ’s economic boom, the
 International Energy Agency  said today.  “From a supply standpoint there isn’t a lot for the bulls
to put their horns into,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the
Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “The market is in
the midst of a slow steady drip downwards. It might take some
time but eventually we return to trading on the fundamentals.”  WTI oil for June delivery decreased 96 cents to $94.21 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since May 2. The volume of all contracts traded was
10 percent above the 100-day average at 4:36 p.m.  Prices were little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported that U.S. inventories rose 1.11 million
barrels to 390.2 million. The June contract fell 93 cents to
$94.24 a barrel in electronic trading at 4:36 p.m. The contract
traded at $94.32 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent oil for June settlement slipped 22 cents to end the
session at $102.60 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume for all contracts was 8 percent greater
than the 100-day average.  Wider Spread  The European benchmark grade was at a premium of $8.39 a
barrel to WTI futures. The spread was $7.65 yesterday, the
narrowest based on settlement prices since January 2011.  Gasoline stockpiles probably shrank by  1.1 million barrels 
last week, according to the median estimate of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Inventories of distillate fuel, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, climbed by
475,000 barrels, the survey shows.  U.S.  crude production  climbed 57,000 barrels a day to 7.37
million in the week ended May 3, the highest level since
February 1992, the EIA reported on May 8.  “Prices are weighed down by expectations of another build
in U.S. inventories,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of
market research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Production levels are very high and are expected to keep
climbing for the foreseeable future.”  North America  North America  will provide 40 percent of the world’s new
supplies until 2018 through the development of light, tight oil
from shale deposits and  oil sands , the IEA said in its medium-term market report.  OPEC’s spare crude oil production capacity will surge as
rising U.S. output crimps demand for the group’s supplies,
according to the IEA. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is forecast to increase its implied spare output
capacity to a peak of 7.18 million barrels a day in 2015 versus
5.76 million this year, the report showed.  “We’re going through an interesting transformation of the
oil market right now as U.S. production increases,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in  St. Louis , which oversees $1.4 billion. “We had
been experiencing a continuous drop in U.S. output since about
1970, which has come to an end. This raises problems for OPEC.”  Rising Consumption  Global oil demand will increase by 6.1 million barrels a
day, or 6.7 percent, to 96.7 million a day by 2018 as the
recovery gathers pace, the Paris-based agency said.  The IEA, which also released its monthly oil market report
today, boosted its forecast for global demand in 2013 for the
first time since January. The IEA raised the 2013 estimate by
65,000 barrels a day, predicting that world oil use will rise
this year by 800,000 barrels a day to 90.6 million.  Futures also climbed as a stronger U.S. currency reduced
the appeal of dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment.
The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the U.S. currency against those
of six major trading partners, rose 0.4 percent to 83.60, the
highest level since July. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities dropped 0.4 percent.  Oil rebounded early in the session after equities advanced
on bullish comments from  David Tepper , a hedge-fund manager. The
co-founder and owner of Appaloosa Management told CNBC the
economy is improving.  Equity Rally  The  S&P 500 Index  climbed to a record for the eighth time
in nine days. It rose 1 percent to an all-time high of 1,650.34.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 0.8 percent.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 21.1 percent, down from 21.3 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 553,893
contracts as of 4:38 p.m. It totaled 627,860 contracts
yesterday, 8.3 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.76 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
