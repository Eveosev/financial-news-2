European Union finance ministers
agreed on how to negotiate tax treaties with five nations
including Switzerland and  Liechtenstein  without finishing
updates to the bloc’s savings tax accord.  EU leaders will discuss the draft law next week after
ministers from Luxembourg and  Austria  told counterparts that
they would need to see the results of the negotiations with non-EU countries before signing up to a new pact.  “I hope, then, our heads of state will take a broader view
on this subject, and that in the summit next week they will
reach an agreement that we wanted to reach today,” Algirdas Semeta, the European commissioner for taxation, said following
today’s talks. “What is important is that we are able to
translate our words into practical action. Today, unfortunately
on this subject this is not the case.”  EU finance ministers discussed the draft savings tax
directive, along with proposals on how the 27-nation bloc
negotiates tax-data exchanges with non-EU countries like
Liechtenstein, Switzerland,  Monaco , San Marino and Andorra, in
response to signals from Austria and Luxembourg that they are
softening their opposition to the plans.  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said it was
wrong to characterize today’s talks as a failure, as the the
European Commission’s negotiations with non-EU nations could
facilitate a future deal on the EU law, he said.  “I think it’s a huge progress,” he said. “It’s a
success.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
