Defense Secretary Philip Hammond
said British troops will remain in  Afghanistan  for longer than
previously planned in order to ensure a smooth handover to
Afghan security forces.  Forces deploying to the country this October will serve
an eight-month tour of duty before coming home, rather than six
months, as they had previously been asked to do, Hammond said in
a statement to Parliament in London today.  Troops arriving in the middle of next year could deploy for
up to nine months, taking a “few individuals” beyond the
British drawdown date of December 2014, Hammond said. As many as
3,700 troops may deploy for more than six months.  “The campaign is changing and the U.K.’s military role in
Afghanistan is evolving from combat to one of training, advising
and assisting the Afghans,” Hammond said. “In light of this,
and the changing nature of the operation, we have looked at how
we can best deploy what will be declining numbers of troops and
smaller amounts of equipment between now and then to deliver the
best possible protection to our people while continuing to
provide the Afghans with the support they need during this
critical transition period.”  Serviceman conducting an eight-month tour starting October
2013 will receive an extra 750 pounds ($1,147) before tax in
addition to existing allowances, Hammond said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
