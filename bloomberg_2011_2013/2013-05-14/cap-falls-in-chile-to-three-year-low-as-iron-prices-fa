Cap SA (CAP) , Chile’s largest iron miner
and steel producer, fell to a three-year low on concern that
prices will fall for iron, the source of 90 percent of gross
profit.  Cap fell 0.6 percent to 14,040 pesos at the close in
Santiago, the lowest price on a closing basis since Dec. 10,
2009. The shares have fallen for four straight days, for a
cumulative drop of 6.8 percent.  The price of iron ore in the Chinese port of Tianjin fell 1
percent today to $128.1 per metric ton, and is down 12 percent
this year. Ore prices may trade between $110 and $120 a ton this
year as supplies expand by about 70 million tons, led by output
expansions in Australia, according to CLSA Ltd.  The shares have been dropping on “expectations that iron
prices will continue to dive,” Felipe Ruiz, an analyst at Banco
de Credito & Inversiones, said in a telephone interview today.
“There is an overreaction at the moment in the market, and this
could be a good opportunity to buy.”  Cap shares have tumbled 13 percent this year, compared with
a 0.3 percent drop in  Chile ’s benchmark Ipsa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
