Baupost Group LLC, the Boston-based
hedge-fund firm run by Seth Klarman, sold shares of News Corp.
in the first quarter while adding to positions in  BP Plc (BP/)  and
 American International Group Inc. (AIG)   Baupost sold off its entire 8 million A shares of New York-based News Corp., the media giant run by  Rupert Murdoch , valued
at $205 million at the end of last year, according to a
regulatory filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. It reduced its stake in the company’s B shares by 9
million, bringing its remaining holding to 4 million shares,
worth about $124 million at the end of the quarter.  Klarman increased his holdings of London-based BP by 6.2
million American depositary receipts to 17.1 million ADRs,
valued at $725.3 million at the end of the quarter. His firm
bought 4.9 million more shares of New York-based AIG, the
insurer that received a government bailout, bringing the total
stake to 11.9 million shares, worth $460 million as of March 31.  Klarman is a bargain hunter who wrote the preface to the
sixth edition of “Security Analysis,” a 1934 book by  Benjamin
Graham  and David Dodd that is considered the bible of value
investing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
