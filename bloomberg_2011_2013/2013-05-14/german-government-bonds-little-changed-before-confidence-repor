Spain ’s government bonds fell, with
two-year note prices slipping for a fifth day, as the nation
hired banks to sell 10-year securities and auctioned six- and
12-month bills.  Ten-year yields rose to the highest in more than two weeks
as a person familiar with the offering said Spain set the size
of the 10-year sale at 7 billion euros ($9.1 billion). German
bunds declined even after a report showed investor confidence
improved less than economists forecast this month. The
Netherlands sold 1.5 billion euros of five-year notes at a
record-low yield.  “Late yesterday we got the news that Spain is going ahead
with a new 10-year so obviously there’s supply concession being
priced in,” said  Michael Leister , an interest-rate strategist
at Commerzbank AG in  London . “This Spanish deal is quite a
surprise so clearly this will be the focus.”  Spain’s two-year yield climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.77 percent at 4:59 p.m. London time after
rising to 1.80 percent, the highest since April 29. The price of
the 2.75 percent note due in March 2015 fell 0.13, or 1.30 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.785.  The nation’s  10-year yield  gained six basis points to 4.34
percent after rising to 4.37 percent, the most since April 25.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-year
debt instead of similar-maturity German bunds increased four
basis points 297 basis points after expanding to 300 basis
points, the widest since April 29.  Mandated Banks  Spain mandated Barclays Plc,  CaixaBank (CABK)  SA, Citigroup Inc.,
Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Santander GBM for
the bond sale, according to the person, who asked not to be
identified because the terms are not set.  Spain sold one-year bills today at a yield below 1 percent
for the first time since April 2010. The nation allotted 3.03
billion euros of the securities due in May 2014 at an average
yield of 0.994 percent. It also sold 1.01 billion euros of six-month bills at a yield of 0.492 percent, down from 0.53 percent
on April 16.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose two basis points to 1.37
percent after advancing to 1.39 percent on May 10, the highest
since March 25.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research said its
index of German investor and analyst expectations improved to
36.4 in May from 36.3 in April. The median estimate of 38
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase to 40.  The Netherlands sold five-year notes at an average yield of
0.611 percent, the lowest for an auction of the maturity since
Bloomberg started compiling the data in 2003.  Italian Debt  Italian 10-year bonds declined for a fourth day as the  Bank
of Italy  said the country’s government debt rose to a record
2.035 trillion euros in March from 2.017 trillion euros in
February. Foreign ownership of  Italy ’s debt increased to 35.2
percent in February from 35.1 percent in January, the central
bank said in its public-finances supplement.  Italy’s bonds rallied earlier this month, pushing 10-year
yields to the lowest in seven years, as the appointment of
Enrico Letta as prime minister on April 27 ended a political
deadlock. Italy’s 10-year yield rose four basis points to 4.01
percent today after falling to 3.68 percent on March 3, the
least since February 2006.  The nation’s bonds “are pricing in a pretty good scenario
for the Italian political situation,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group, said in an interview in London
with Francine Lacqua and  Guy Johnson  on Bloomberg Television’s
“The Pulse” program. “We’ve seen some correction in the last
couple of sessions, probably due to markets being increasingly
worried about looser fiscal conditions in the future.”  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Ireland and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds handed investors a loss of 0.5 percent this
month through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Dutch securities dropped 0.7 percent and Germany’s
fell 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
