Clorox Co., the bleach maker, said it
will raise its dividend by 11 percent to 71 cents a share, ahead
of analyst estimates for a 69-cent payout.  The dividend will be distributed on Aug. 9, to stockholders
of record as of July 24, the Oakland, California-based company
said in a statement today.  While the company reported third-quarter sales and profit
earlier this month that missed analystsâ€™ estimates, for the full
year it reaffirmed its forecast for earnings of $4.25 to $4.35 a
share.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
