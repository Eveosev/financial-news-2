The  Philadelphia Eagles  signed former
 Dallas Cowboys  running back Felix Jones to join a crowded
backfield under new coach Chip Kelly.  Jones, a 2008 first-round draft pick of the Cowboys, will
probably compete with Chris Polk and Miguel Maysonet for playing
time behind LeSean McCoy and Bryce Brown. The Eagles didn’t
disclose financial terms of Jones’s one-year contract.  The Eagles may use multiple running backs under Kelly, who
employed a fast-paced offense over the past four seasons at the
University of Oregon. Kelly was hired in January to replace  Andy
Reid , and his team last season averaged 49.5 points a game, the
second-highest at college football’s top level.  The 5-foot-10, 215-pound Jones shared time in the Cowboys’
backfield over the past five seasons, rushing for 2,728 yards
and 11 touchdowns, with an average of 4.8 yards a carry. He also
caught 127 passes for 1,062 yards and three scores.  Jones, 26, had a career-high 800 rushing yards for Dallas
in 2010 while splitting carries with Marion Barber and Tashard Choice. Last season, Jones rushed for 402 yards and three
touchdowns on 111 carries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
