The dollar rose against the yen for a
fifth straight day, the longest winning streak since November,
amid improving confidence in prospects for the world’s largest
economy.  The euro pared an earlier gain versus the dollar as German
investor confidence rose less than forecast. The greenback rose
yesterday versus most major peers after U.S. retail sales
unexpectedly increased in April, spurring speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will slow the pace of bond purchases under its
quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.  The dollar’s rise today was “catalyzed by the U.S. growing
more quickly than abroad, which was seen yesterday through
retail sales,” Dan Dorrow, the head of research at Faros
Trading LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a phone interview.
“The market is also assuming that strong U.S. growth will lead
to QE tapering at some point. The market is in a strong-dollar
theme for now.”  The U.S. currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 102.26 yen at
11:40 a.m. New York time. It touched 102.30, the strongest since
October 2008. The Japanese currency fell 0.3 percent to 132.49
per euro. The 17-nation currency was little changed at $1.2973
after earlier climbing as much as 0.4 percent to $1.3029.  To contact the reporter on this story:
