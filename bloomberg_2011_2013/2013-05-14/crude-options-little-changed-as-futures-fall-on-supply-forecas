Crude oil options volatility were
little changed as the underlying futures slumped on forecasts
that U.S. supplies climbed from an 82-year high.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 21.09 percent at 3:40 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 21.25 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery dropped 96
cents to settle at $94.21 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest
settlement since May 2. Stockpiles of crude in the U.S. probably
gained 450,000 barrels to 396 million last week, according to a
Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration
report tomorrow.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
July $110 calls, which were unchanged at 7 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,451 contracts at 3:45 p.m. in New York. June $95.50
calls were the second-most active, dropping 48 cents to 25 cents
a barrel on 2,051 lots.  Volume was about evenly split between calls and puts in
electronic trading volume today. Calls, or bullish bets, made up
53 percent of yesterdayâ€™s volume of 118,422 contracts.  June $96 calls were the most-active options traded in the
previous session, with 5,354 contracts changing hands. They
slipped 44 cents to 53 cents a barrel. June $90 puts fell 1 cent
to 6 cents a barrel on volume of 4,902 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 37,674
contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 37,495 lots and
December $110 calls with 34,304.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
