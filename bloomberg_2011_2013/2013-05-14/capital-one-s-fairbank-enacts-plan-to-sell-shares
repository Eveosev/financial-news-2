Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  Chief
Executive Officer Richard Fairbank adopted a plan to dispose of
almost 1.5 million shares as he seeks to diversify his personal
wealth.  The plan permits Fairbank to exercise 926,000 options, then
sell the resulting shares as well as 550,000 others, according
to a filing today from McLean, Virginia-based Capital One. The
sales would represent less than 0.3 percent of the company’s
approximately 580 million shares outstanding.  “The sales under the plan are intended to help diversify
Mr. Fairbank’s personal investment holdings,” according to the
filing. Sales would take place no earlier than November, and the
plan expires two years later, Capital One said.  Fairbank, 62, has started shifting his wealth away from
Capital One after the shares hit a 5-year closing high of $62.88
in January. Fairbank was paid $2.19 million in deferred cash as
part of his 2012 compensation, the first time in at least 15
years he didn’t receive all options or stock.  The plan allows Fairbank to exercise 360,000 options
granted in December 2003 with a strike price of $56.28, and
566,000 options received in December 2004 with an exercise price
of $82.39, according to the filing. The options are set to
expire in December of this year and next.  Capital One  rose  1.3 percent today to $59.60 in  New York .
It has gained 2.9 percent this year, the worst performer in the
24-company KBW Bank Index, which has advanced 17 percent. The
shares reached a  record  $90.04 on March 10, 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
