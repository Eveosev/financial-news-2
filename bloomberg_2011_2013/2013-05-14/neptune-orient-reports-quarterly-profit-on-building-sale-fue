Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. (NOL) , Southeast
Asia’s biggest container-shipping company, posted a profit in
the first quarter, helped by gains from selling its headquarters
and lower fuel costs.  Net income  in the three months ended April 5 was $75.5
million, compared with a $254 million loss a year earlier, the
shipping line said in a statement to the Singapore stock
exchange today. Sales slipped 0.4 percent to $2.37 billion.  Neptune Orient has said cost cuts and new ships will help
improve performance in 2013 after posting three annual losses in
four years. The carrier pared costs by $504 million last year as
shipping lines struggled with overcapacity and a slump in demand
caused by Europe’s economic downturn.  “The Group’s cost base will continue to improve as it
takes delivery of newer and more efficient ships,” the company
said. “However, the container shipping industry remains saddled
with overcapacity.”  Neptune Orient had a gain of $200 million from the sale of
its headquarters building, it said. The ship operator is also
adding larger and more fuel efficient vessels amid rising
competition.  Shares of Neptune Orient, whose businesses include
container shipping, terminals and logistics operations, were
unchanged at S$1.09 at close of trading in  Singapore , before the
earnings were released. The stock has dropped 4.8 percent this
year, compared with the Straits Times Index’s 8.4 percent gain.  Cargo Boxes  APL Ltd., Neptune Orient’s container-shipping arm, earned
an average revenue per box of $2,376, a 1.8 percent decline. It
moved 772,000 forty-foot equivalent cargo boxes in the quarter,
2 percent fewer than a year earlier. The shipping unit filled 91
percent of capacity in the three-month period, compared with 93
percent a year earlier.  Loss before interest and taxes at APL narrowed to $101
million in the quarter, from $246 million a year earlier.  Spot rates to haul a 20-foot container to Europe from Asia
dropped 6.4 percent to $1,140 in the first quarter, according to
the Shanghai Shipping Exchange. Those to the U.S. West Coast
rose 1.8 percent to $1,132. Lines need at least $1,200 to make
money, according to shipbroker ICAP.  The price of 380 Centistoke marine bunker fuel, used by
ships, averaged $633.76 per metric ton in the first quarter, 14
percent lower than a year ago in Singapore trading, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It dropped 2.3 to $600 today.  APL operated 125 vessels with a combined capacity of
605,000 20-foot boxes as of April 5, Neptune Orient said in the
statement. It has received 10 ships last year, and will add 14
more in 2013 and 10 in 2014.  “We have improved operational performance considerably
from one year ago, so we know we are on the right track,” Chief
Executive Officer Ng Yat Chung said in the statement. “But
there is still more work to be done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
