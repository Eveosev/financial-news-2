The America’s Cup yachting race will
proceed as scheduled while officials await findings of a
committee reviewing last week’s death of sailor Andrew Simpson
during the Swedish team’s training on San Francisco Bay.  Tom Ehman, vice commodore of the Golden Gate Yacht Club
that backs defending champion Oracle Team USA, said today in a
news conference that all four teams are continuing their plans
and preparations for the regatta, scheduled to start off San
Francisco in July.  “We expect, yes, that all the teams will be racing,”
Ehman said.  “The America’s Cup will go ahead this summer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
