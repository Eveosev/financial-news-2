Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC, responding to
the proliferation of smartphones and tablet computers, said it
will participate in Nielsen’s trial of new technology designed
to measure the mobile-TV viewing audience.  The test of the Nielsen Online Campaign Ratings system will
run through September, the companies said today in a statement.
ABC is seeking to measure audience demographics and the reach
and frequency of online ad campaigns.  The agreement coincides with this week’s introduction of
Watch ABC, a service that will let pay TV viewers, initially in
New York and Philadelphia, have live access to their favorite
shows on the network on computers and mobile devices. TV
networks are introducing such products to attract the growing
numbers of consumers who watch videos away from their home sets.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company,  gained 
0.2 percent to $67.47 at the close in New York. The shares have
increased 36 percent this year, compared with 16 percent for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 index.  Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN) , based in New
York, fell 1 percent to $34.65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
