The U.K. was a net-importer of wheat
for a 10th consecutive month in March after wet weather reduced
domestic supplies last year, the Agriculture & Horticulture
Development Board said.  Wheat imports during the month were 251,176 metric tons,
against exports of 32,947 tons, the Kenilworth, England-based
AHDB said in an e-mailed report today, citing  customs  data.
Since the 2012-13 marketing year began July 1, imports total
2.12 million tons, compared with exports of 580,908 tons. In the
same period a year earlier, imports were 664,800 tons and
exports were 2.23 million tons.  The U.K. may be a net-importer of wheat this season for the
first time in 11 years, the AHDB has said, after the second-wettest year on record in 2012 slashed the domestic harvest by
13 percent. The U.K. is the European Union’s third-biggest wheat
grower.  “Net imports will be maintained until the end of the
season,”  Charlotte  Garbutt, a senior analyst at AHDB, said by
telephone today before the report. “Now we’re looking ahead
into the next season and waiting for the crops to mature. The
weather has been more favorable in the last week or two, but we
can’t expect the crop to be a big one because planted area was
not big for wheat.”  Germany  was the biggest supplier of wheat to the U.K. in
March, shipping 109,701 tons, followed by France and  Canada ,
according to the report. The Netherlands was the biggest buyer
of U.K. wheat at 26,402 tons in March.  U.K. barley imports were 28,710 tons in March against
exports of 5,254 tons. Imports of corn totaled 164,192 tons,
twice the amount as the same time last year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
