Chinese stocks  rallied in New York,
led by  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , after better-than-estimated earnings from companies including WuXi PharmaTech
Cayman Inc. boosted the outlook for corporate profits.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. added 0.5 percent to 95.28 yesterday,
rebounding from the lowest level in a week. E-Commerce, China’s
biggest online book seller, gained for a fifth day before
releasing first-quarter data tomorrow. WuXi PharmaTech rose
after quarterly net income exceeded the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) 
climbed to a two-month high before reporting earnings today.  Thirty-three out of 55 companies on the gauge that reported
earnings in the past three weeks  beat  analysts’ estimates by 20
percent on average, even as sales missed projections, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The China-US gauge advanced after
hedge-fund manager  David Tepper  said he remains optimistic about
global markets as the  U.S. budget deficit  eases. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose to a record for the eighth time in nine
days.  “First-quarter earnings at Chinese Internet-based
companies were overall stronger than expected,” Tian X. Hou,
the founder of T. H. Capital LLC, which compiles research on
U.S.-traded Chinese companies, said by phone from Beijing.
“Dangdang’s bottom line is likely to beat consensus due to the
effect of business model adjustments since last year.”  ETF Gains  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., advanced less than 0.1 percent
to $37.75 in New York, after losing the most in three weeks the
previous day. The  S&P 500  climbed 1 percent to 1,650.34.  E-Commerce, known as Dangdang, jumped 11 percent to $5.17,
the highest level in six months. Its five-day rally is the
longest stretch of gains since December 2010. Trading volume on
its American depositary receipts was more than four times the
daily average over the past three months, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Beijing-based company  may report  first-quarter sales of
$210 million, the mean estimate of seven analysts compiled by
Bloomberg showed. That would compare with Dangdang’s forecast of
$209 million given March 7. Analysts projected a net loss of
$15.6 million for the three months on average, from a loss of
$19.6 million in the prior quarter.  Dangdang has been focusing on core products including books
and more profitable home furnishings and baby products since
last year, which should help improve its earnings, according to
T.H. Capital’s Hou.  ‘Upside Surprise’  Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) , China’s biggest budget
hotel chain operator, jumped 5.8 percent to $28.02, the highest
level in a month.  The Shanghai-based company’s 19.4 million  yuan  ($3.2
million) first-quarter net loss was smaller than a loss of 26.1
million yuan projected by analysts. Home Inns’ Ebitda, or
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
rose to 15.4 percent of total revenue from 13.2 percent a year
earlier, the company said in a May 13 statement.  It’s an “upside surprise in margin expansion despite a
still soft market environment,” Ella Ji, an analyst at
Oppenheimer & Co. wrote in a note yesterday. She raised her
margin estimate by 1 percentage point to 20.6 percent for 2013.  WuXi Advances  WuXi PharmaTech (WX) , a biotechnology research company based in
Shanghai, rallied 2 percent to $20.40, the highest price since
July 2008.  The company said in a May 13 statement first-quarter profit
rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier to $21.7 million, more than
the $19.2 million average estimate by four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  E-House, a Shanghai-based property agent, climbed 3.4
percent to $4.86, the highest close in two months.  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) , an online fashion discounter based
in Guangzhou, surged 6.2 percent to $33.50. It reported  first-quarter sales jumped 207 percent after market close yesterday
and provided second-quarter revenue guidance that beat analysts’
average projection.  Elong Inc. (LONG) , an online travel agency based in Beijing, sank
9.9 percent to $14.64, the steepest slump since August 2011. The
company had the largest loss on the China-US gauge.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares
sank 1.1 percent to 2,217.01 yesterday, the biggest decline
since April 23, after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its growth
outlook for  China’s economy  to 7.6 percent this year from 7.8
percent previously. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  in
 Hong Kong  dropped 0.7 percent to a one-week low of 11,032.79.  To contact the reporter on this story:
