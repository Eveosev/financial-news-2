Barcelona’s Lionel Messi may miss the
rest of the season because of a hamstring injury, crimping his
chance to set a new league scoring record.  The forward will be out for as many as three weeks, the
soccer club said today on its website. The team has already
clinched the league championship, and has four games remaining.
Its season ends June 1 with a game against Malaga.  “Tests carried out this morning have revealed that Lionel
Messi has a strained hamstring in his right leg,” the team
said. “His participation in future games will depend on his
recovery process. The Argentinean limped off in the second half
at the Calderon on Sunday after noting a twinge in the area he
had previously been injured in.”  Messi, 25, has won a record four straight Ballon d’Or
awards as the sport’s top player, and set a record for goals in
a calendar year with 91 in 2012. His 46 league goals so far this
season is four short of the record of 50 he already holds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
