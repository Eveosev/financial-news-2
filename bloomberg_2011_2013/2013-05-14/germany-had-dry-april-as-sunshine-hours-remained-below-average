Germany  had a relatively dry and
overcast April, with rainfall 21 percent below normal, weather
office Deutscher Wetterdienst reported.  The country on average got 39.9 millimeters (1.6 inches) of
rain last month, 10.8 millimeters less than normal in the 30
years through 2010, the office wrote in a  report  on its website.
That’s after precipitation was 48 percent below normal in March.  Rainfall in  Lower Saxony , Germany’s second-biggest wheat
growing region, from the start of March through to April 10
totaled 57 millimeters, 48 percent less than normal for the
period, according to satellite data  published  by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s  Foreign Agricultural Service .  “April 2013 was rather dry, but also slightly below the
long-term mean in sunshine duration,” Deutscher Wetterdienst
wrote.  Average temperatures of 8.1 degrees Celsius (46.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) were 0.2 degree below normal, Deutscher Wetterdienst
said. That followed Germany’s fourth-coldest March since the
start of the 20th century.  The country had an average 141.6 hours of sunshine last
month, 26 hours or 16 percent less than usual, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
