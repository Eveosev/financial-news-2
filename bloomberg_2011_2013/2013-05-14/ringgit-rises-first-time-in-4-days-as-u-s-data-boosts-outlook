Malaysia ’s ringgit climbed for the
first time in four days as retail sales in the U.S. unexpectedly
increased last month, brightening the country’s export outlook.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks advanced for a second
day after data showed sales in Malaysia’s fourth-largest
overseas market gained 0.1 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent
decline predicted in a Bloomberg survey. The Southeast Asian
nation’s economy  grew  5.5 percent in the first quarter, compared
with 6.4 percent in the previous three months and 5.1 percent a
year earlier, according to the median forecast of 22 economists
in a Bloomberg poll before data due tomorrow.  “The unexpected rebound in retail sales in the U.S. bodes
well for Asian exports,” said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at
RAM Holdings Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The ringgit’s strength will
likely be maintained, given the country’s resilient
fundamentals.”  The ringgit gained 0.5 percent to 2.9819 per dollar as of
9:15 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur after dropping 1.2 percent in the past
three days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 2.9803 today, near a 21-month high of 2.9570
reached last week.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.39 percent.  Ten-year  government bonds  strengthened for a seventh day.
The yield on the 3.48 percent notes due March 2023 slid two
basis points to 3.11 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the  lowest  for a 10-year benchmark security
since February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
