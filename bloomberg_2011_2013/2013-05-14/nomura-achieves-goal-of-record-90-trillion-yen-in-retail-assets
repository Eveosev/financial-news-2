Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  increased retail
client assets to a record 90.3 trillion yen ($889 billion) in
April, achieving a goal of Chief Executive Officer Koji Nagai
two years ahead of schedule, thanks to  Japan ’s stock rally.  The country’s biggest brokerage added 6.5 trillion yen of
assets under management last month, the biggest jump since
Tokyo-based Nomura started compiling the data in 2002, company
spokesman Kenji Yamashita said in a telephone interview today.  The increase underscores why securities firms are the
biggest beneficiaries of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus
policies as a surge in  trading volume  boosts brokerage
commissions. Nagai, 54, pledged to increase the assets to 90
trillion yen by March 2016 in his first meeting with investors
in September, a month after becoming CEO.  “Brokerages will continue to benefit from the boom in
commissions as long as stock prices keep rising,” said Makoto Kikuchi, CEO at Myojo Asset Management Co., a Tokyo-based hedge
fund advisory firm. “Individual investors, who have shunned
stocks for a while, have come back to the market, taking risks
for a return.”  Nomura had 67.3 trillion yen of the assets on Sept. 30. The
company, which relies on domestic retail operations for about
half of its pretax securities  profit , posted its highest
quarterly net income in seven years last quarter.  The  Topix Securities and Commodity Futures Index  has more
than tripled in the past six months, the best performance among
the 33 industry groups on the benchmark Topix, which has gained
71 percent. Nomura  shares  reached a 4 1/2-year high yesterday,
before slipping 1.6 percent to 919 yen at 1:45 p.m. in Tokyo.  Banker Prizes  Nomura is seeking to boost the assets further by offering
incentives to bankers to improve services. The firm this month
selected the 20  best consultants  among 6,800 based on a survey
of 742,000 clients. It awarded trophies and cash vouchers for
family travel, according to its website and Yamashita, who
declined to comment on the amount.  Net income  more than tripled to 82.4 billion yen in the
three months ended March, the bank reported on April 26.
Brokerage commissions climbed 39 percent to 125.7 billion yen.  Income from commissions for stock broking and investment
trust sales rose 67 percent to 82.3 billion yen in the quarter,
company figures showed. Nomura earned 100.6 billion yen in
pretax profit from domestic retail operations in the year ended
March, accounting for 52 percent of total securities income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
