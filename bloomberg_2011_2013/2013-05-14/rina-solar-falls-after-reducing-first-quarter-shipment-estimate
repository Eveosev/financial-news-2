Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , the Chinese panel
maker with six consecutive quarterly losses, fell the most in
seven weeks after saying first-quarter shipments will be lower
than an earlier forecast.  Trinaâ€™s American depositary receipts, each worth 50
ordinary shares,  declined  8.8 percent to $5.41 at the close in
New York, the most since March 25.  Shipments for the quarter will be 390 megawatts to 400
megawatts compared with an earlier estimate of 420 megawatts to
430 megawatts, Changzhou, China-based Trina said today in a
statement.  Trina said it may revise its 2013 shipment forecast of 2
gigawatts to 2.1 gigawatts when it releases its earnings on May
29, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
