Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , India’s biggest
producer, said it expects a $1.6 billion writedown in asset
values because of a drop in steel demand in  Europe .  Demand in Europe has fallen by almost 8 percent in the year
ended March 31, Mumbai-based Tata said yesterday in a statement.
Weaker economic and market conditions in Europe are expected to
continue in the near and medium-term, leading to a cut in
expected cash flows and the valuation of the company’s European
business, Tata said.  Steelmakers in Europe are grappling with excess capacity,
falling prices and rising operating costs. The region has
capacity to make about 210 million metric tons of steel a year,
while demand in a “normal market” is 150 million to 160
million tons, industry lobby group Eurofer said in July last
year.  Tata is due to announce full year results on May 23. The
company is considering selling some of its U.K. assets as a
weakening economy erodes demand leaving factories underutilized,
two people with knowledge of the matter said last month. Selling
the U.K. units, acquired as part of a $12 billion takeover of
Corus Group Plc six years ago, would help Tata cut debt, the
people said.  Tata fell 4.1 percent to 305.6 rupees at the close of
trading in  India  yesterday. Its stock has declined 25 percent
over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
