Severn Trent Plc (SVT) , the U.K.’s second-largest publicly traded water company, received an approach from
a group comprising Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc., the
Kuwait Investment Office and Universities Superannuation Scheme.  The approach “may or may not lead to an offer being made
for Severn Trent,” the Coventry, England-based company said
today in a regulatory statement. “No proposal has been made and
there can be no certainty that an offer will be made.”  The Financial News reported earlier that the  Kuwait
Investment Authority  had formed a group to make a 5.3 billion-pound ($8.1 billion) bid for Severn Trent, citing people with
knowledge of the matter.  Severn Trent said the interested parties are required to
announce a firm intention to make an offer, or that they don’t
intend to make one, by 5 p.m. on June 11, in accordance with
U.K. takeover rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
