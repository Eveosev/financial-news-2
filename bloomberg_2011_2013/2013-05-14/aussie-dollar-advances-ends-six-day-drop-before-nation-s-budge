Australia’s dollar fell to an 11-month low as the government’s forecast of slower growth fanned
speculation the  Reserve Bank  will cut borrowing costs to support
the economy.  Growth in real  gross domestic product  will probably
decelerate to 2.75 percent in the 12 months starting July 1,
from 3 percent this fiscal year, the government said today when
releasing the  federal budget . Traders see a 65 percent chance
that the central bank will lower the benchmark rate from a
record-low 2.75 percent within three months, according to data
on overnight-index swaps compiled by Bloomberg.  “The growth projections are downbeat,” said Hideo Shimomura, who helps oversee the equivalent of $59 billion in
 Tokyo  as chief fund investor at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management
Co., a unit of  Japan ’s largest publicly-traded bank. “They will
struggle to get out of the deficit. It could lead to further
easing” from the Reserve Bank, he said.  The Australian dollar touched 99.08 U.S. cents, the weakest
since June 12, before trading at 99.22 as of 8:58 p.m. in
Sydney, down 0.3 percent from the close yesterday. The so-called
Aussie was falling for a seventh day, heading for the longest
losing streak since August 2011.  New Zealand’s currency lost 0.2 percent to 82.37 U.S.
cents.  Futures on Autralia’s three-year notes were at 97.44 from
97.41 yesterday.  The  unemployment rate  is estimated to rise to 5.75 percent
by June 2014 from 5.5 percent, Treasury said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
