Cotton futures rose amid declining
output in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Cocoa and
orange juice rose, while coffee fell.  Cotton production may fall 19 percent this year, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said on May 10. World stockpiles will
rise 9.4 percent to a record in the year starting Aug. 1 with
most of the gain in  China , the biggest user. The “overhang”
probably won’t affect world prices if China maintains reserves,
said John Flanagan, the president of Flanagan Trading in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina.  “I don’t really see any reason for the market to sell
off,” Flanagan said in a telephone interview. “As long as
China is willing to hold their prices high, there’s no reason
for us to have lower prices.”  Cotton for July delivery rose 0.4 percent to 86.36 cents a
pound at 11:36 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier,
the commodity climbed as much as 1.3 percent.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery increased less than
0.1 percent to $1.482 a pound. The price headed for the fifth
straight gain, the longest rally since Feb. 1.  Cocoa futures for July delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
$2,347 a metric ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery fell 0.8 percent
to $1.4455 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
