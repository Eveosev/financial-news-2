The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
increased, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 2 basis points to
103.25 basis points as of 9:07 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The measure is poised for its
highest close since May 2, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 1 basis point to 75.5 as
of 9:27 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche Bank AG prices. The
gauge is set for its first increase in three days after closing
yesterday at its lowest level since May 2008, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 1 basis point to 102.5 basis
points as of 8:33 a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking prices
show. The benchmark is headed for its highest since May 3, CMA
data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
