British Prime Minister  David Cameron 
rejected the suggestion that his proposal to support a bill
authorizing a referendum on European Union membership reflected
panic over a rebellion in his Conservative Party.  “Not at all,” Cameron told the U.K.’s Channel 5 News
while he was in  Boston  today, when asked if he was panicking by
pushing the bill out. “If this was a Conservative-only
government we would just get on and legislate. We can’t do that
because we are in coalition.”  With the ruckus over EU membership overshadowing his trip
to the U.S., the Conservatives late yesterday said Cameron would
back a lawmaker-sponsored bill to authorize a popular vote by
2017 on the U.K. staying in the 27-nation bloc.  The government can’t sponsor the bill due to opposition
from Cameron’s Liberal Democrat coalition partners. The
opposition  Labour Party  also opposes the referendum. Meantime, a
growing number of Conservatives plan a Parliamentary vote
against his legislative program to protest his failure to
deliver such a bill earlier.  Cameron rejected as “completely wrong” the idea that he
is constantly shifting his position under pressure from his
rank-and-file lawmakers. One of the premier’s political aides,
Alan Sendorek, returned to  London  early from the U.S. this
morning to help deal with the rebels at home.  The bill that was published today calls for a referendum
by Dec. 31, 2017, on the question ``Do you think that the  United
Kingdom  should remain a member of the European Union?''  ‘Second-Best’  Cameron has made a “a second-best offer,” John Baron, one
of the Tory rebels, told the BBC today. The Liberal Democrats
oppose the proposal and lawmakers should focus on reviving the
economy, a party spokesman said.  Citing the difficulty in steering a private member’s bill,
Baron, who is organizing the Tory rebuke of Cameron, said, “a
far better approach is to have the courage to support our
amendment.” That would “force Labour and the Liberals to
decide, and if we won, the prime minister would then have the
mandate to then introduce legislation through the normal
channels, which would have a far better chance of success.”  The move is Cameron’s second in four months to try to
satisfy his party, which has pressed him to take a more hostile
line to the EU. In January, he promised to renegotiate the terms
of Britain’s membership to reduce the bloc’s influence and put
the result to voters by 2017.  ‘One Party’  “When all the dust has settled I think that people will be
able to see that there is one party, the  Conservative Party ,
offering that in-out referendum and two other mainstream
parties, the Liberal Democrats and Labour, who oppose an in-out
referendum,” Cameron told  Sky News  in Boston today.  While rank-and-file Conservatives initially praised
Cameron’s strategy, they reacted to a setback in local elections
this month and gains by the anti-EU U.K. Independence Party by
saying voters didn’t believe Cameron was serious about pushing
the bill if he won the 2015 general election. They demanded he
publish legislation sooner.  The rebels “keep coming back for more,” Mark Stuart,
lecturer in politics at Nottingham University said in an
interview in London today. “The referendum promise brought
Cameron three months of silence. There were no rebellions on
 Europe . But they will always be coming back.”  About 70 members of his party have put their names to the
parliamentary amendment expressing “regret” that no provision
paving the way for a vote was included in the legislative
program outlined last week.  Academics said it may be the first time since 1946 that a
significant number of members of a governing party have done so.
If the amendment is selected for a vote by House of Commons
Speaker John Bercow, it will come before the chamber by May 15.  “This seems to be just the latest panicked response from
the prime minister who is now following, rather than leading his
backbenchers,” Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman,  Douglas Alexander , said in an e-mail. “David Cameron is a prime
minister who has both lost control of the agenda and lost
control of his party.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
