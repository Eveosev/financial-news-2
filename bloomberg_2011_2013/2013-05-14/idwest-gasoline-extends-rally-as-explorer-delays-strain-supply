Midwest gasoline extended its gain
for a second day, rallying to the  highest level  versus futures
since 2008, as a delay on Explorer Pipeline Co.’s line spurred
concern that supplies will fall further in the region.  The  Explorer  line, which transports gasoline, diesel and
jet fuel to the Midwest from the Gulf Coast, can take as few as
11 days to carry a barrel, according to the company’s website.
Shipments are delayed this month because demand has exceeded the
company’s expectations.  “We haven’t been full in five years so this caught us a
little off guard,”  Tom Jensen , vice president of operations,
said in a phone interview from Tulsa,  Oklahoma .  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Group 3 gained 21 cents
to  52.5 cents a gallon  above  New York  Mercantile Exchange
futures at 2:35 p.m., the highest level since Sept. 12, 2008.
Group 3 is the region north of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Minnesota and
 North Dakota . Conventional, 85-octane, or CBOB, in Chicago
weakened 3 cents to a premium of 27 cents versus futures.  Gasoline supplies in the Midwest, or PADD 2, dropped  1.34
million barrels  to 48.7 million in the week ended May 3, the
 lowest since  Nov. 30, according to U.S. Energy Information
Administration data. That’s a third consecutive weekly decline.  Stockpiles may be declining as refineries including  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Joliet, Illinois, site and  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting,
Indiana, plant conduct maintenance.  “You’ve got all your refinery work and low inventories
going on and demand is up so everyone is scrambling to make
their supply,” Jensen said.  The 3-2-1 crack spread for Group 3 refiners, a rough
measure of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing, Oklahoma, gained $6.93 to  $41.10 a barrel , the highest
level since October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The same spread in Chicago advanced 42 cents to $35.08 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
