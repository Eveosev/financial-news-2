Swiss stocks  were little changed
before reports on German investor confidence and euro-area
industrial production.  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  and  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  posted the biggest gains
on the Swiss Market Index.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  led falling stocks.  The benchmark  SMI (SMI)  dropped 0.1 percent to 8,135.89 at 9:38
a.m. in Zurich, erasing an advance of as much as 0.5 percent.
The broader Swiss Performance Index also lost 0.1 percent.  A measure of German investor confidence probably rose in
May, a report at 11 a.m. in Mannheim will show. The ZEW Center
for European Economic Researchâ€™s index of investor and analyst
expectations climbed to 40 from 36.3 in April,  economists
forecast  in a Bloomberg survey. The measure aims to predict
economic developments six months in advance.  A separate report at the same time will probably show that
euro-area industrial production rose 0.5 percent in March,
according to the  median estimate of economists  in a Bloomberg
survey. The measure gained 0.4 percent in February.  Finance chiefs from the 27 members of the European Union
meet for a second day in Brussels to discuss plans to create a
banking union for the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
