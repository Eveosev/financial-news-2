Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  Chief Executive
Officer  John Lechleiter  underwent a scheduled surgery yesterday
for a heart defect and the repair to the aorta is functioning as
intended, the drugmaker said.  Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice has been filling in as
CEO while Lechleiter recuperates, the Indianapolis-based company
said today in a statement.  Lilly said on May 6 that Lechleiter would undergo an
operation to correct a dilated aorta. The condition, which
wasn’t causing any symptoms, occurs when there is a bulge or
ballooning of the larger artery that carries blood from the
heart through the chest and abdomen, according to the National
Institutes of Health. Lechleiter’s condition was found during an
unrelated test, the company had said.  “Dr. Lechleiter’s surgeons have advised us that surgery
went as expected,” said Kristine A. Courtney, senior director
of Lilly’s corporate health services. “Dr. Lechleiter is
recovering and will be closely monitored by the medical staff
over the next several days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
