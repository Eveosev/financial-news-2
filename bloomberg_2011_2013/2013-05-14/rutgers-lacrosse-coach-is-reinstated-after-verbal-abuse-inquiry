Rutgers University  men’s lacrosse
coach Brian Brecht has been reinstated after an investigation
into allegations of verbal abuse found no criminal or school
policy violations.  Brecht was suspended with pay on April 19, two weeks after
Rutgers fired men’s basketball coach Mike Rice for inappropriate
conduct including the use of gay slurs.  Rutgers said while its investigation determined Brecht did
use inappropriate language and exhibited unprofessional behavior
“on occasion,” the instances were infrequent and not directed
at individual players.  “I regret my behavior and am determined to set a better
example in the future,” Brecht said in a statement released by
the school.  Carl Kirschner, who took over as acting athletic director
when Tim Pernetti stepped down amid questions of his handling of
the situation with Rice, said school officials “are satisfied
with the resolution” involving Brecht.  Brecht is in his second season as Rutgers coach and has 17
years of collegiate lacrosse coaching experience, according to
his biography on the school’s athletics website. Brecht was head
coach at Siena College before Rutgers.  The Rutgers lacrosse team finished its season on April 27,
when it lost its 12th straight game to finish 2-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
