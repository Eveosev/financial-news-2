The  cost of goods  imported into the
U.S. dropped in April, propelled by retreating fuel costs.  The 0.5 percent decline in the import-price index followed
a 0.2 percent drop the prior month, according to Labor
Department figures released today in Washington. The decrease
matched the median  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Such prices were down 2.6 percent in the past 12 months.  Tepid economic growth around the globe has reduced demand
for commodities, including oil, putting downward pressure on
costs. With inflation under control, monetary officials from the
 Federal Reserve  to the  European Central Bank  have room to do
more to stoke expansion without creating jumps in prices.  Estimates for the change in import prices ranged from a
drop of 1 percent to a 0.3 percent gain, according to the 43
economists surveyed.  The cost of imported petroleum fell 1.9 percent in April
from the prior month.  Excluding fuels, import prices declined 0.2 last month from
March, and were down 0.7 percent from April 2012. That was the
biggest 12-month decrease since the year ended November 2009.  The value of imported automobiles fell 0.3 percent from the
prior month, the most since December 2011. The price of imported
capital goods dropped 0.2 percent, the most in more than a year.  Goods from  China  were 0.1 percent less expensive. Imports
from  Japan  declined 0.6 percent, the biggest drop since
September 2008. Latin American goods fell 1.5 percent and those
from the European Union decreased 0.1 percent. The price of
Canadian imports retreated 0.6 percent, and goods from  Mexico 
were 0.9 percent less expensive.  The price of U.S. exports dropped 0.7 percent after falling
0.5 percent the previous month, todayâ€™s figures showed. Prices
of agricultural exports declined 2.2 percent, while those of
non-farm goods were down 0.5 percent.  The import-price index is the first of three monthly price
gauges from the Labor Department. A report on producer prices is
due tomorrow, and a report on consumer prices is due May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
