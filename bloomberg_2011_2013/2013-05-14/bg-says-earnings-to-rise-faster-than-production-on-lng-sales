BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-largest natural-gas producer, said earnings growth will outpace
production as it expands trading in liquefied natural gas.  The company expects to market 17 million to 20 million tons
a year of LNG from 2015 with new supplies from  Australia  and the
U.S. It plans to trade 10.5 million to 12 million tons from 2013
to 2015, the Reading, U.K.-based company said today in a
statement.  “In a period where LNG demand is expected to grow twice as
fast as overall gas demand, with underlying supply needing to
grow by nearly 9 percent to meet total demand, BG Group is well
positioned to capitalise on this growing market,” Chief
Executive Officer Chris Finlayson said in the statement.  Finlayson presented his first strategic development plan
for the company today after succeeding  Frank Chapman  in January.
He’s tasked with reviving output at the oil and gas producer
after project delays from  Egypt  to the U.S. led BG to scrap its
2015 production outlook in February.  BG now expects to pump 775,000 barrels to 825,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day in 2015, it said today. It plans to
invest $12 billion in projects next year with  capital spending 
declining to $8 billion to $10 billion in 2015 and 2016.  The development of new ventures in Australia and Brazil has
helped BG shares outpace gains in the Stoxx 600 Oil & Gas Index
this year. The company, which plunged the most on record at the
end of October after warning of slower output growth, plans to
invest about $12 billion in projects in 2013.  Business Momentum  “With 2013 the peak of its capex cycle and production
expected to start a multiyear ramp from the final quarter of
this year, we see the second and third quarters of 2013 as the
turning point for business momentum,” Lucas Herrmann, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a May 8 report,
upgrading his recommendation on the stock to  buy .  BG is a partner in  Brazil ’s Lula field, the biggest oil in
the nation’s history. The company, which has boosted output from
the country with the start of the Sapinhoa field this year, has
estimated its Brazilian deposits hold about 6 billion barrels of
oil equivalent, with potential for as much as 8 billion barrels.  In Australia, BG plans to ship its first liquefied natural
gas from the $20 billion Curtis Island LNG project in Queensland
next year. The company “achieved a critical project milestone”
when it connected the LNG plant to gas fields with the nation’s
longest large-diameter twin pipelines, Finlayson said May 2.  BG, the largest U.K.-listed gas producer after Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and BP Plc, said in February it expects to pump
630,000 barrels to 660,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day this
year.  BG will host a  webcast presentation  at 12 p.m. London time
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
