California  Governor  Jerry Brown 
increased spending on education by $2.9 billion and projected
that the state would have an $850 million surplus at the end of
next year after voters boosted sales and income taxes.  Brown cautioned that the revenue increases could be
temporary, noting that the “uncertain economic recovery” and
other factors could jeopardize  California ’s progress.  While revenue in the current year is up $2.8 billion, next
year it will be down $1.3 billion, said Ana Matosantos, Brown’s
finance director. The state Legislative Analyst’s Office had
calculated the increase at $4.5 billion at the end of April.  “This budget builds a solid foundation for California’s
future by investing in our schools, continuing to pay down our
debts and establishing a prudent reserve,” Brown said today in
 Sacramento . “But California’s fiscal stability will be short-lived unless we continue to exercise the discipline that got us
out of the mess we inherited.”  Brown, who served two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983,
returned in 2011 facing a $26.6 billion deficit and a $35
billion “wall of debt” -- his term for internal and external
borrowing and delayed payments to schools and community
colleges. The governor said spending cuts and higher taxes are
projected to reduce the wall of debt to $4.7 billion by 2017.  Standard & Poor’s  in January raised the state’s credit
rating to A, sixth highest, the first increase since 2006.  To contact the reporters on this story:
