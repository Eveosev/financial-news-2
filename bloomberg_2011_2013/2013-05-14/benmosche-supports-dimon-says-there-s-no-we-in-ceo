American International Group Inc. (AIG)  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  said shareholders of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  are wrong to challenge the authority of  Jamie Dimon , the bank’s chairman and CEO.  “Jamie’s got a tough hand to play,” Benmosche said today in an in interview with Bloomberg Television’s Betty Liu. “He’s playing that hand extremely well.”  Retirement plans including the AFSCME pension fund are seeking to separate the chairman and CEO roles at New York-based JPMorgan. Pressure on Dimon increased after losses of more than $6 billion last year on derivatives trades. The bank’s board has said having Dimon, 57, in both posts is the “most effective leadership model.”  Benmosche serves on a board led by AIG Chairman  Steve Miller , an arrangement that is right for the insurer now because of the company’s past and the cooperation between the two, he told Liu. New York-based AIG was bailed out by the U.S. in 2008 after  record losses  and repaid the aid last year under Benmosche, who took over in 2009.  Miller became chairman in 2010, replacing  Harvey Golub , who clashed with Benmosche about the divestiture of  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  Benmosche told the board their relationship was “ineffective and unsustainable” Golub wrote in his resignation letter.  “There’s no ‘we’ in ‘CEO,’” Benmosche, 68, said today. “You can’t have this divisive attitude where the chairman is trying to run some things, and the CEO was trying to run things. It became dysfunctional.”  Benmosche’s remark was a play on the sports saying, designed to encourage collaboration, that “there’s no ‘I’ in ‘team.’”  Benmosche also referred to the  National Football League  in addressing how Dimon, who posted record profit last year even after the trading loss, should be prepared for criticism.  “Welcome to the NFL, we actually hit pretty hard here,” Benmosche said of leadership posts at top financial firms. “Jamie’s a tough guy. He understands how to run that bank. He’s got a lot of different businesses that are going through very complex changes and regulations.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Zachary Tracer in New York at  ztracer1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dan Kraut at  dkraut2@bloomberg.net
