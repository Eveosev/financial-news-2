Juerg Buergin, a former UBS executive
director of operations sentenced to prison for having sex with
an underage prostitute in  Singapore , has filed an appeal of his
conviction, his lawyer said.  Buergin, 41, who is in Admiralty West Prison, hasn’t
appealed the sentence in the filing yesterday, Selva Naidu, his
lawyer said in a telephone interview today.  The Swiss national was sentenced on May 8 to four months
and three weeks in jail after being convicted of two charges of
buying sex with a minor. Singapore Subordinate Courts Judge Eddy
Tham said mistaking a minor’s age isn’t a defense.  The  Straits Times  earlier reported the appeal.  The criminal case is Public Prosecutor v Buergin Juerg.
