Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, the
Cairo-based mobile phone company in which Russia’s  VimpelCom
Ltd. (VIP)  bought a majority stake in 2011, said investors should
reject a buyout offer from billionaire  Mikhail Fridman .  Orascom shares were valued at 86 cents a share by its
adviser on the deal, HC Securities & Investments, compared with
the offer of 70 cents a share by Fridman’s Baskindale Ltd., the
Egyptian company said in a Regulatory News Service statement.
Baskindale is wholly owned by Altimo Holdings & Investments
Ltd., a unit of Fridman’s  Alfa Group . Altimo is VimpelCom’s
biggest shareholder.  Baskindale’s offer for Orascom, which expires this month,
comes as VimpelCom negotiates with the Algerian government to
end an ownership dispute over Djezzy, the local mobile phone
company that is Orascom’s biggest revenue generator. The offer
is equivalent to $4.31 for each of Orascom’s global depository
receipts that trade in  London .  Orascom shares  closed 0.4 percent lower today at 4.66
Egyptian pounds (67 cents) before the company’s recommendation.
The stock has gained 6.6 percent since the announcement of
Baskindale’s offer,  outpacing  a 5.9 percent increase for the
benchmark EGX 30 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
