U.S. Senator  Elizabeth Warren  has
questioned three more federal agencies’ enforcement practices by
asking if they’ve studied the costs of favoring settlements with
big financial firms over taking them to trial.  Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Senate Banking
Committee, had earlier questioned Comptroller of the Currency
Thomas Curry about why his agency doesn’t take wrongdoing
financial firms to trial, such as in the money-laundering case
of London-based  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)  She sent a similar query in a
letter today to Federal Reserve Board Chairman  Ben Bernanke ,
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White and
Attorney General Eric Holder.  “If large financial institutions can break the law and
accumulate millions in profits and, if they get caught, settle
by paying out of those profits, they do not have much incentive
to follow the law,” Warren said in the letter. She argued
regulators have “a lot less leverage” if they show a
continuing unwillingness to go to trial.  Curry said in a response to Warren last week that the OCC
hasn’t conducted research on the benefits of settling without
forcing admissions of guilt, according to the letter. Warren is
putting the same question to Bernanke, White and Holder about
whether they’ve conducted research on the trade-offs between
settling and litigating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
