Consolis Group, the concrete products
maker, obtained a debt restructuring deal backed by Bayside
Capital and owner LBO  France .  Bayside, the credit unit of private-equity company H.I.G.
Capital LLC, underwrote a 45 million-euro ($58 million) super-senior credit facility to Consolis together with a separate 45
million-euro investment from LBO France, according to an e-mailed statement from Bayside.  The restructuring will convert about half of the company’s
senior debt and all of its junior debt to “equity-like
instruments,” as well as deferring senior debt, Bayside said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
