Pipelines in  North America  spilled
three times as much crude oil as trains for comparative
distances over an eight-year period, the  International Energy
Agency  said today in a study it based on U.S. Department of
Transportation data.  The Paris-based energy adviser also said that the risk of
a train spill was six times greater than a pipeline incident
over the period between 2004 and 2012.  “Increasing volumes of crude oil transported by rail raise
questions of safety,” the IEA said in its medium-term oil
market report. “Our analysis reveals that compared to
pipelines, rail incident rates are higher while the opposite
holds for spill rates.”  The calculation included an estimate that the average load
of crude carried by train travels 1,000 miles, which the
organization said is conservative, since most Bakken crude is
shipped 1,700 miles from  North Dakota  to St. James, Louisiana.  The analysis of the eight-year period didn’t include a
spill of 715 barrels of crude from a derailment in Minnesota in
2013 that was more than double the amount spilled by trains in
the previous four years, according to the report.  The findings come after another analysis released last
month by the  Association of American Railroads  said trains had a
lower oil-spill rate than pipelines between 2002 and 2012.  The group said that first-quarter figures imply that the
volume of crude shipped by rail in the United States is about
680,000 barrels a day, or almost 10 percent of total production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
