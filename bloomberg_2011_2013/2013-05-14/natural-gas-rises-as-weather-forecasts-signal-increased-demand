Natural gas futures rose for a second
day in  New York  as forecasts for cool Northeastern weather and a
burst of heat in the West signaled higher demand for the fuel.  Gas gained as much as 2.2 percent as MDA Weather Services
predicted below-normal temperatures from parts of  Pennsylvania 
to  Maine  over the next five days and a warmer-than-normal
outlook for  California  through May 23. A  stockpile deficit 
versus the five-year average is hovering near record lows after
cold weather extended into the spring.  “Traders are attempting to push the front of the curve
back above $4 as the developing springtime heat across the
southwest U.S. is expected to lift electric power demand,” said
Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas
SA in New York. “It appears that investors are hopeful that the
build in air-conditioning demand will keep working gas in
storage below the five-year average.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 7.3 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $3.998 per million British thermal units at 10:50
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after rising to $4.01.
Volume was 12 percent below the 100-day average for the time of
day. The futures have climbed 19 percent this year.  The discount of June to October contracts, a measure of
summer supply expectations, narrowed 1.2 cents to 7.5 cents, the
least for this time of the year since 2003.  Options Trading  August $4.30 puts were the most-active options in
electronic trading. They fell 4.1 cents to 37.9 cents on volume
of 560 lots at 10:53 a.m. July $3.95 puts were the next-most
active, falling 2.7 cents to 12.9 cents per million Btu on
volume of 514. Puts accounted for 62 percent of options volume.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June was 31.94 percent at 10:45 a.m. in New York, up from 30.77
percent yesterday. Volatility for July options rose to 31.55
percent from 30.72 percent.  Gas futures have slumped 10 percent from a 21-month high of
$4.444 per million Btu on May 1 as the weather moderated. Gas
consumption typically declines after the heating season and
before hot weather drives demand from  power plants  to run air
conditioners.  The high temperature in  Los Angeles  on May 22 may be 82
degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), 7 higher than the usual
reading, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
Pennsylvania. The low in New York on May 24 may be 48 degrees, 8
below normal.  Stockpile Deficit  “The prime driver is going to be our forecast and we are
going to be vulnerable to some choppy trading,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “If we start talking about heating
demand pick-up, that deficit is going to jump back up to the
forefront and see gas prices push back up to $4,”  Gas stockpiles  increased by 88 billion cubic feet to 1.865
trillion in the week ended May 3, higher than the five-year
average gain of 69 billion for the period, the Energy
Information Administration said last week.  A  supply deficit  versus the historic norm narrowed for the
first time in 11 weeks to 5 percent from 6.2 percent the
previous week, which was the biggest such gap since February
2011, according to data from the Energy Department’s statistical
arm. A deficit versus year-earlier levels narrowed to 28.3
percent from 30.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
