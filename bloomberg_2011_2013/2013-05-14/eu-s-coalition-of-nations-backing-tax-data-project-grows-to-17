The European Union’s push for a
coordinated clampdown on  tax evasion  gathered pace as the number
of countries backing a pilot project for automatic sharing of
bank details across borders rose to 17.  The coalition of governments, which includes the EU’s six
largest members, said today they “strongly support the
initiative for a pilot of multilateral automatic information
exchange,” based on the U.S.  FATCA  program.  “We invite all EU member states and other countries to
commit to join this initiative with the aim of rapidly creating
a truly global system” that would “mark a step change in our
ability to tackle tax evasion,” the countries said in a
statement issued following a meeting of EU finance ministers
today in Brussels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
