Brazil ’s swap rates fell on
speculation that slowing growth in  China , the Latin American
nation’s biggest trading partner, will help cool inflation and
limit increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.33 percent at 10:02
a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0065
per dollar after gaining 0.6 percent yesterday, the biggest
advance since April 16.  Chinese stocks fell after JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced its
growth outlook for the nation’s economy and concern mounted that
the government is introducing more property restrictions to
liming housing price gains. “External uncertainties” require
that Brazil’s monetary policy “be managed with caution,”
central bank policy makers said in a statement accompanying
their decision to raise borrowing costs last month.  “Because of the weight that the central bank gives the
external environment, any sign things are getting worse in the
global economy affects the market,”  Jankiel Santos , the chief
economist at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento, said by phone
from Sao Paulo. “The latest data, whether it’s from  Europe  or
from China, has been a negative surprise.”  The central bank’s board voted 6 to 2 on April 17 to raise
the target lending rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent from
a record low 7.25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
