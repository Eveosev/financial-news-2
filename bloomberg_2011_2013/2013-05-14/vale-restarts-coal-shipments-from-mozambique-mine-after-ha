Vale SA, the world’s biggest iron-ore
producer, said it restarted coal transport from its Moatize mine
in  Mozambique ’s northwestern Tete province today.  The Sena rail line’s operations had been disrupted on May
12 for the second time this month by a group of potters who
wanted to claim further compensation after leaving their homes
for the mine’s development.  “Since 6:30 a.m. today the coal mine in Moatize Vale has
been unlocked, allowing normal movement of workers to the mine,
and restoring the coal flow through the Sena line,” the
company’s local office, based in Maputo, the capital, said in an
e-mailed statement.  People working at 60 potteries that in April last year
resettled in Cateme, 60 kilometers (37 miles) away from the
Moatize area, are striking for payments for the time they had to
halt work. Vale paid 60,000 meticais ($1,980) per oven and
doesn’t need to make further payments, it said. The potters
withdrew after Vale promised to negotiate, said their leader,
Refo Agostinho Estanislau.  Vale is spending $4.4 billion on rail and port facilities
in Mozambique to export coal from Moatize, having exhausted
existing capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
