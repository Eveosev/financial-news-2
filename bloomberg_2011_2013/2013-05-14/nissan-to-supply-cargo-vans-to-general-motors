Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  plans to supply
compact cargo vans to  General Motors Co. (GM)  for sale as a Chevrolet
brand vehicle in the U.S. and Canada, the first such project in
the region for the two automakers.  GM, the largest U.S. automaker, will source vehicles based
on Nissan’s NV200 light truck from Japan’s second-biggest
carmaker, with sales to begin next year, the companies said in a
joint statement yesterday. Pricing and details of the GM
version, to be sold as the Chevrolet City Express, will be
announced later, they said.  “Our fleet customers have asked us for an entry in the
commercial small van segment, so this addition to the Chevrolet
portfolio will strengthen our position with fleets and our
commercial customers,” Ed Peper, GM’s U.S. vice president of
fleet and commercial sales, said in the statement.  The supply arrangement is a first in  North America  for
Detroit-based GM and Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan, which builds
the NV200 in Mexico. While GM has worked with Nissan alliance
partner  Renault SA (RNO)  in Europe, and the U.S. and Japanese
companies make a van in Europe, they’ve not previously had a
similar project for the U.S. and Canada, said Travis Parman, a
Nissan spokesman.  GM is turning to Nissan to supply vans as  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s
U.S. deliveries of its Transit Connect van are rising. Transit
Connect sales rose 10 percent to 35,216 in 2012 and surged 28
percent this year through April to 13,205.  GM and Nissan didn’t provide financial details of their
arrangement.  Shares of GM rose 1.8 percent to $31.55 at the close in  New
York  trading. GM has gained 9.4 percent this year, compared with
a 16 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Nissan
gained 3.6 percent to 1,138 yen as of 9:14 a.m. in Tokyo
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
