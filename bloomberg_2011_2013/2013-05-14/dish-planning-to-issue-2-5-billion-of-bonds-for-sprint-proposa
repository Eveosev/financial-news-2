Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the satellite TV
company vying with  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  to acquire  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S) , is offering $2.5 billion of debt to help finance the
proposed deal.  The company may sell four- and 10-year bonds today or
tomorrow, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
The proceeds from the senior notes sale will be placed into
escrow and would be released to help fund the cash portion of a
Sprint acquisition, the Englewood, Colorado-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. Dish will redeem the debt if a
deal doesn’t materialize, it said.  The offering comes a month after SoftBank sold $3.3 billion
of bonds denominated in dollars and euros to help fund its $20.1
billion bid for Sprint, Bloomberg data show.  The Dish bonds may be rated Ba2 by Moody’s Investors
Service, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
terms aren’t set. Barclays Plc, Jefferies Group LLC, Macquarie
Group Ltd. and Royal Bank of Canada are managing the offering.  The company is trying to win over Sprint’s board, which is
concerned about the debt that would be placed on the merged
company and has doubts about Dish’s estimate of $11 billion in
cost savings, people familiar with the situation said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
