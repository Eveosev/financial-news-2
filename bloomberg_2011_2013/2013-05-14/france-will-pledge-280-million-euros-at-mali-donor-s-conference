France  will pledge 280 million euros
($360 million) over two years at a conference tomorrow in
Brussels to help rebuild Mali, French officials said.  The meeting, to be hosted by the European Commission, will
be attended by representatives of 80 countries, including French
President Francois Hollande, the officials told reporters today.  Mali has identified development needs of about 4 billion
euros, of which it estimates it can raise half on its own. The
rest will come from national and multinational donors. The U.S.
has held off resuming aid until after elections set for July.  Of France’s total, 18 million euros have been spent on
emergency projects in Gao and Timbuktu following recent fighting
in which French forces ejected Islamist militants from the north
of  Mali .  To contact the reporter on this story:
