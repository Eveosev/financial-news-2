U.K. stocks  climbed, extending their
highest level in 5 1/2 years, as merger and acquisition activity
in the utility industry offset a selloff by metal producers.  Severn Trent Plc soared 14 percent after confirming that a
consortium of infrastructure investors has approached it about a
possible takeover.  Babcock International Group Plc (BAB)  rallied 6.8
percent after reporting an increase in profit.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  sank
7.3 percent after halting operations at its Marikana mine in
 South Africa .  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 54.3 points, or 0.8 percent, to
6,686.06 at the close in London, extending its highest level
since October 2007. The equity benchmark has rallied 13 percent
so far this year supported by central-bank monetary stimulus.
The broader  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  also gained 0.8 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index closed little changed.  “Central-bank stimulus has been extremely supportive,”
 Richard Hunter , head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in
London, said. “The unwinding of quantitative easing is going to
be difficult, but it’s not quite on the horizon yet. That kind
of support along with earnings means there is enough there to
support the market.”  Severn Trent jumped 14 percent to 2,077 pence after the
U.K.’s second-largest publicly traded water company said it
received an approach from a group comprised of Borealis
Infrastructure Management Inc., the  Kuwait  Investment Office and
the Universities Superannuation Scheme that “may or may not
lead to an offer being made.”  Severn Trent  The Financial News reported earlier that Kuwait’s
sovereign-wealth fund had formed a group to make a 5.3 billion-pound ($8.1 billion) bid for  Severn Trent. (SVT)  That would be about
20 percent above the company’s market capitalization of 4.4
billion pounds at yesterday’s close. The magazine cited people
with knowledge of the matter.  Rival utility companies  Pennon Group Plc (PNN)  and  United
Utilities Group Plc (UU/)  advanced 4.4 percent to 695 pence and 2.8
percent to 760.5 pence, respectively.  Babcock International climbed 6.8 percent to 1,163 pence
after the engineering company reported a 14 percent increase in
full-year operating profit to 376.6 million pounds, boosted by
overseas defense sales and nuclear energy activity. Babcock,
which helps design submarines for the U.K. government, said that
new contracts enabled it to grow.  BG Group  BG Group Plc gained 3.5 percent to 1,227 pence after the
the U.K.’s third-largest natural-gas producer said earnings will
grow faster than output as it expands trading in liquefied
natural gas. The company expects to sell 17 million to 20
million tons a year of LNG from 2015, with new supplies from
Australia and the U.S.  ICAP Plc (IAP)  rallied 14 percent to 339.7 pence after the
world’s largest broker of transactions between banks posted a
bigger  full-year profit  than it indicated less than two months
ago. Pretax profit before exceptional items in the year through
March fell 20 percent to 284 million pounds. ICAP lowered its
profit forecast on March 27 to 280 million pounds.  Lonmin tumbled 7.3 percent to 265.1 pence after the world’s
third-largest platinum producer said that its miners refused to
work at Marikana in the Rustenburg region of North West
province. The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union
said a local organizer was shot dead in a tavern near the
facility on May 11.  Lonmin’s Output  Lonmin said yesterday it plans to produce more than 700,000
ounces of platinum in concentrate this year. Repeated strikes
last year cut the company’s output and raised costs.  A gauge of mining companies slid 0.9 percent as copper led
industrial metals lower amid concern that  China ’s growth will
slow. JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its forecast for gross
domestic product growth in the world’s second-biggest economy in
2013 to 7.6 percent from 7.8 percent.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , which owns the largest platinum miner,
dropped 1.7 percent to 1,550 pence, while Rio Tinto Group
retreated 1.1 percent to 2,967.5 pence. Glencore Xstrata Plc
fell 1.4 percent to 340.35 pence.  “The long-term story for the mining companies is still
there,” Hunter said. “In the short term, discontent about the
way the companies have been run, along with intrinsic links to
commodity prices and speculative investors has made the sector
quote volatile.”  Betfair Group Plc (BET)  slipped 3.4 percent to 865 pence after
the company said it rejected a 950 pence-per-share offer from a
consortium led by CVC Capital Partners Ltd. The online gambling
operator said the bid undervalued its business. CVC said today
it was unable to agree financial terms with the board of Betfair
and “as a result has no intention of making an offer.”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 7.6 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
