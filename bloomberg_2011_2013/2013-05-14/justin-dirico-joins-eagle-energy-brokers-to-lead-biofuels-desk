Justin Dirico has joined Eagle Energy
Brokers LLC in  New York  to start a renewable energy desk.  Dirico will focus on Eagle Energyâ€™s trading of ethanol,
biodiesel and Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, he said
today in a telephone interview. He previously worked at SCB &
Associates, where he started the biofuels division four years
ago in  Chicago .  Eagle Energy, based in New York, is establishing the unit
after the value of RINs climbed to a record $1.06 in March from
7 cents in January, boosting interest in biofuels, Dirico said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
