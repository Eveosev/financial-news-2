U.S. stock-index futures erased
losses after hedge-fund manager  David Tepper  said he is still
bullish and the economy is getting better.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than
0.1 percent to 1,631.8 at 7:51 a.m. in  New York  after falling as
much as 0.3 percent earlier. The benchmark gauge of American
equities is up 15 percent in 2013 and closed at a record
yesterday for the seventh time in eight sessions. Tepper, co-founder and owner of Appaloosa Management, spoke in an interview
on CNBC.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
