Airbus SAS is in discussions with
 Japan ’s two biggest carriers about an order for its A350-1000, a
long-range plane aimed at eroding  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s dominance in
wide-body aircraft, three people familiar with the talks said.  Negotiations with  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202)  and  Japan Airlines Co. (9201) 
are advanced, and JAL may place an order by September to replace
some of its older Boeing 777s, said two of the people, who asked
not to be identified because talks are continuing. JAL, which
has never bought Airbus aircraft, may purchase as many as 20 of
the biggest A350 variant, one of the people said.  An order for Airbus’s newest model from Japan would mark a
victory for the European planemaker in a market where Boeing has
enjoyed near total hegemony for decades. Those ties were
underpinned on the 787 Dreamliner, with more than a third of the
structure built by Japanese suppliers. Boeing made JAL and ANA
the first operators, only to see the premiere sour amid a
months-long grounding of the fleet after batteries caught fire.  “An A350 order by JAL would be a disaster for Boeing,”
said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, a
Fairfax, Virginia-based aerospace forecaster.  “The Boeing-Japanese relationship is the longest and most important global
relationship in aerospace history. If they really do choose an
Airbus plane that would be a vote of no-confidence in Boeing.”  Three Variants  JAL looks at all types of aircraft, spokesman Kazunori
Kidosaki said when asked about the talks. ANA hasn’t started
discussing what plane it may buy after the current 777,
spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka said. Stefan Schaffrath, a spokesman
for Airbus in Toulouse,  France , said the company doesn’t comment
on discussions with existing or potential customers.  The first variant, the A350-900, will seat 314 and is set
to enter service by late 2014, with the debut flight planned for
mid-2013. A smaller variant, the A350-800 will follow in 2016,
with the largest, the A350-1000, slated for late 2017.  Airbus says the A350-1000, which costs $332.1 million at
list price, will offer 25 percent better operating economics
than Boeing’s best-selling 777-300ER.  To counter the potential threat from Airbus, Boeing has
begun marketing a successor to its 777, the 777X. Boeing first
disclosed potential plans to offer a 777 replacement at the
 Paris Air Show  in 2009. Four years later, Boeing has begun
marketing the 777X though hasn’t yet committed to building the
plane. Chief Executive Officer James McNerney has said Boeing
expects to have the plane in service around the end of the
decade.  Keep Waiting  ANA and JAL “are both 777 customers, but how long can you
be expected to wait for the 777X” said Robert Mann, an
aerospace consultant based in Port Washington, New York.  As of Dec. 31, JAL had 46 Boeing 777s in its fleet, while
ANA had 52 777s as of the end of April, according to the
companies’ websites.  While Airbus is on par with its rival globally, the
European company has a market share of less than 5 percent in
Japan, the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and
 China , and home to Haneda Airport, among the busiest globally.  Boeing’s stumbles on its 787 Dreamliner, which debuted
three years behind schedule and was grounded for more than three
months, may help Airbus win the endorsement of local
subcontractors that have typically shunned the European company
as the risky upstart.  Japanese companies designed and made 35 percent of the
structure of the 787, with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) 
supplying the wings and  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012)  and  Fuji
Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270)  building part of the front fuselage
section and center wing boxes.  The record level of work for Japanese suppliers coincided
with Japan’s airlines being among the Dreamliner’s top clients.
ANA placed the first order for the model in 2004, for 50 planes,
and JAL ordered 35.  Boeing hasn’t said yet whether it will ask Japanese
companies to build the wing for the 777X or take that work back
in house.  To contact the reporter on this story:
