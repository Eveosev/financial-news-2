A Brazilian judicial body has upheld
a 2011  Supreme Court  ruling that allows for civil unions between
gay partners as it seeks to end uneven implementation of the
law.  All notaries in  Brazil  must register civil unions between
people of the same sex, according to a statement published today
by the CNJ, which oversees the nation’s justice system. CNJ head
Joaquim Barbosa said it was “unjustifiable” that notaries,
which formalize unions, would refuse to do so based on gender.  “The expression of sexuality and homosexual affection
cannot be the basis of discriminatory treatment,” said Barbosa,
who also is the high court’s chief justice. “The step taken by
the Supreme Court cannot be ignored.”  Brazil’s decision comes amid signs that legal recognition
of gay marriage in  Latin America  is gaining ground. Argentina in
2010 became the first nation in the region to approve gay
marriage, followed by Uruguay where the Congress last month
approved same-sex marriages. Mexico’s Supreme Court has upheld a
2009 Mexico City law allowing gay partners to wed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
