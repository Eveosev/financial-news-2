Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan 
declared emergency rule in three northeastern states, giving
sweeping powers to the security forces against Islamist
insurgents he said were taking over parts of the region.  More troops will be deployed to Borno, Adamawa and Yobe
states with authority to arrest and detain suspects, take over
buildings and search areas suspected to be used for terrorist
activity, Jonathan said today in a national broadcast.  “Some northern parts of Borno state have been taken over
by those whose allegiances are to a different flag than
 Nigeria ,” he said. Security agencies “have orders to take all
necessary action, within the ambit of their rules of engagement,
to put an end to the impunity of insurgents and terrorists.”  The Boko Haram Islamist group, whose name  means “western
education is a sin” in the local Hausa language, started its
violent campaign to impose Shariah law on Nigeria after police
killed its founder,  Mohammed Yusuf , while in custody for his
role in clashes with the security forces in the northeastern
city of Maiduguri. More than 700 people, mostly his followers,
died in the violence.  Since then the group has carried out gun and bomb attacks
across the north and Abuja, the capital, that have killed more
than 1,500 since 2009, according to  Human Rights Watch . Africa’s
biggest oil producer and most populous country of more than 160
million people is roughly split between a mainly Muslim north
and a predominantly Christian south.  “These terrorists and insurgents seem determined to
establish control and authority over parts of our beloved nation
and to progressively overwhelm the rest of the country,”
Jonathan said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
