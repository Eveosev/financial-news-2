U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will make the agreement of a global strategy to fight dementia
one of his priorities for next month’s Group of Eight meeting.  About 35.6 million people worldwide have dementia,
according to Cameron’s office, a number the World Health
Organization estimates will double every 20 years. A G-8
dementia summit in London in September will bring scientists and
politicians together to find ways of cooperating.  “If the brightest minds are working together on this then
we’ve got a greater chance of improving treatments and finding
scientific breakthroughs,” Cameron said in a statement during a
visit to  New York  today. “I’ve said before that we need an all-out fight-back against dementia that cuts across society. Now we
need to cut across borders and spearhead an international
approach that could really make a difference.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
