SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the second-largest
U.S. solar company by market value, declined the most in more
than two months after posting a first-quarter loss related to
increased investments in rooftop systems.  SolarCity fell 12 percent to $31.44 at the close in  New
York , the most since March 7. The  San Mateo , California-based
company’s shares have almost quadrupled since its initial
offering in December.  SolarCity invested $138.2 million to install solar systems
in the first quarter, up 66 percent from a year earlier, as
demand surged for rooftop panels from homeowners and businesses.
The company said it’s boosting spending to build projects that
will deliver long-term revenue.  The first quarter loss was $31 million, or 41 cents a
share, compared with net income of $2.76 million, or 4 cents, a
year earlier, SolarCity said in a statement yesterday.  SolarCity installs power systems, often at no upfront cost
for customers, who sign decades-long contracts to purchase the
power. The company said in January that installations will climb
60 percent to 250 megawatts this year, from 156 megawatts in
2012.  For the second quarter, SolarCity expects to install 48
megawatts to 53 megawatts of solar systems, up from 46 megawatts
in the first quarter.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  is the largest U.S. solar company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
