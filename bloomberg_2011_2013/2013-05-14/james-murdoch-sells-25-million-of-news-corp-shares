James Murdoch , deputy chief operating
officer of News Corp. and son of Chairman Rupert Murdoch, sold
$25.1 million of nonvoting shares in the company, capitalizing
on a 65 percent gain in the stock over the past year.  Murdoch, 40, sold 752,000 Class A shares at $33.32,
representing more than a fifth of his stake, according to a U.S.
Securities and Exchange filing. Murdoch still owns 1,644  Class B (NWS) 
shares, which have voting rights in News Corp.  The sale comes ahead of a proposed split of News Corp.’s
entertainment assets from the declining publishing business,
where  earnings sagged  35 percent in the most recent quarter from
the year earlier. The company’s lucrative cable-network division
rose 17 percent in sales for the period.  This is Murdoch’s second-biggest stock sale in the past six
months. The executive, who made $16.8 million in salary, bonus
and stock awards last year, made a gift in December of 402,260
Class A shares to his charitable foundation Quadrivium, which
deals in conservation and educational issues in developing
nations. Those shares were valued at $13.5 million at
yesterday’s closing price of  $33.48. (NWSA)   Separately,  Rupert Murdoch  recently  bought a vineyard  in
the Los Angeles area that was listed at $29.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
