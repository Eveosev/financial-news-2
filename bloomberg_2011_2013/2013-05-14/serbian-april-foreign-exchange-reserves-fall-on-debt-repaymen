Serbiaâ€™s foreign-exchange reserves
fell 5.84 percent in April from the previous month as the
government repaid half of its outstanding debt to the London
Club of commercial lenders.  The reserves contracted to 11.15 billion euros ($14.46
billion) from 11.84 billion euros, Belgrade-based Narodna Banka
Srbije said in an e-mailed statement today. Outflows included
the repayment of 305.4 million euros to the London Club of bank
lenders and 72 million to other creditors, while banks withdrew
274.3 million euros from their mandatory reserve accounts.  Inflows included government borrowing worth 42.4 million
euros in the local market and 25 million euros in loans and
grants, the National Bank of Serbia said.  Net reserves, excluding the money commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the International Monetary
Fund, dropped to 7.3 billion euros from 7.6 billion euros in
March, the bank said.  Interbank foreign-currency trading rose 2.3 percent on the
month to 808.6 million euros, while the dinar gained a nominal
1.3 percent against the euro in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
