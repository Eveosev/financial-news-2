The euro is under pressure as
sovereign-wealth funds and central banks move reserves back into
dollars or diversify into other currencies,  Samarjit Shankar , a
Boston-based managing director for the foreign-exchange group at
Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp., said at a round-table with
reporters in  Tokyo .  The share of  euros  among global foreign-exchange reserves
slid to below 24 percent in the fourth quarter of last year from
a high of 28 percent in the third quarter of 2009, according to
the International Monetary Fund. Allocations in  dollars 
rebounded to nearly 62 percent after reaching a low of 60.5
percent in the second quarter of 2011.  On dollar as reserve:  “Global central bankers have realized that there is no
viable alternative asset to the U.S. dollar as a reserve
currency, so the allure of the euro has faded significantly.”  On euro strength:  “Chinese and other Asian FX reserve growth has been a
source of support for the euro because global central banks were
diversifying away from the U.S. dollar into the euro. However
going forward that is all changing. Asian FX reserve growth
including  China  has slowed down, the equity flows we’re seeing
into Europe are also slowing down, and as a result we find the
euro is likely to remain vulnerable in the coming months.”  On euro alternatives:  “The broad trend does suggest that there will be more
diversification” out of the euro into the Australian, Canadian
and New Zealand dollars. “The yen might benefit to some
extent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
