 Canada’s ruling Conservative Party
lost a seat in the House of Commons to the opposition  Liberal
Party  in a special vote last night.  With all 91 polls reporting, Liberal candidate Yvonne Jones
had about 48 percent of the vote in the district of Labrador on
Canada’s northern Atlantic coast, defeating incumbent
Conservative Peter Penashue, who had about 32 percent.  Penashue, former minister of intergovernmental affairs for
Prime Minister  Stephen Harper , resigned his seat and sought re-election after Elections Canada, the independent voting agency,
said he received ineligible campaign contributions in the 2011
general election.  “Today we have demonstrated that the Liberal message of
hope and hard work is resonating,” Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said in an e-mailed statement.  If Elections Canada’s preliminary  results  are confirmed,
the Conservatives would hold 164 seats in the 308-seat House of
Commons, while the  New Democratic Party , the official
opposition, would have 100. The Liberals would hold 36, the Bloc
Quebecois five, the Green Party one and two seats are held by
independents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
