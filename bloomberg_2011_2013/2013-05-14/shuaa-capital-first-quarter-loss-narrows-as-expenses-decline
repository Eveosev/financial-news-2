Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA) , the investment
bank controlled by Dubai’s ruler, said its first-quarter loss
narrowed after reducing costs by 37 percent.  The net loss was  5.9 million dirhams  ($1.6 million)
compared with 8.5 million dirhams a year earlier, Shuaa said in
an e-mailed statement today. Revenue fell to 36.2 million
dirhams from 55 million dirhams because of lower investment
returns on managed funds and a drop in fees, it said. Costs fell
to 39.2 million dirhams from 62 million dirhams.  Shuaa, which has reported annual losses since 2008 as the
global financial crisis led to a drop in volumes on local stock
markets, completed a restructuring program to reduce non-core
assets, cut jobs and generate recurring revenue. The company
stopped offering retail brokerage and said in October it plans
to boost lending to small and medium-sized businesses and high-net-worth individuals to improve profit margins.  “We are now focused on enhancing our revenue generation
capabilities in asset management and investment banking where
opportunities are starting to emerge as global investors are re-engaging with GCC markets,” Executive Chairman Sheikh Hasher Al
Maktoum said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
