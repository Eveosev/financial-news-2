Talks on closer ties between Veolia
Environnement SA and Suez Environnement ended because antitrust
authorities wouldn’t have allowed an agreement for their French
businesses, Veolia Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot said.  The CEO, speaking at an annual shareholders’ meeting in
Paris, called the discussions between the two French water
companies “an old story” that happened six months ago. He also
reiterated that closer ties between the utilities would have
made sense outside  France .  To contact the reporter on this story:
