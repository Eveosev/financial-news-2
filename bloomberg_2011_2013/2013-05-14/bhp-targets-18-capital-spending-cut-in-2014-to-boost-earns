BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, is targeting an 18 percent cut to
 capital spending  in fiscal 2014 as part of a drive to boost
returns from investment.  “We must challenge ourselves to increase returns from new
investment, in the same way that we need to squeeze returns from
our installed infrastructure,”  Andrew Mackenzie , the new chief
executive officer of Melbourne-based BHP, said today in notes
for a speech at a conference in Barcelona. “Capital and
exploration expenditure for the 2014 financial year will decline
significantly, to approximately $18 billion.”  Mackenzie, 56, this month took over as CEO from Marius Kloppers, amid a changing of the guard at the world’s biggest
mining companies as record commodity prices waned. Mackenzie
said in February that he will drive an “agenda of
productivity” before BHP unveiled $1.9 billion in cost savings
when reporting a 58 percent decline in first-half earnings.  “The rate of spend is expected to decline substantially”
after 2014, Mackenzie said. “By reducing our annual spend and
increasing internal competition for capital, we expect to
maximize returns from incremental investment, while delivering a
substantial increase in the group’s free cash flow.”  BHP rose 0.4 percent to A$34.67 at the close of trading in
Sydney.  Rio Tinto  Group was little changed.  The company estimates it will spend $22 billion on projects
and exploration this fiscal year after a record $22.7 billion in
fiscal 2012, according to Mackenzie’s presentation.  BHP in February joined Rio Tinto and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  in
reporting a drop in earnings. BHP and Rio are among companies
selling assets to shore up earnings and cut costs after more
than $60 billion of writedowns in the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
