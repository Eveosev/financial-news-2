Greece ’s biggest public-sector union
held a 24-hour strike and a rally in central  Athens  today to
oppose an emergency decree issued by the government to prevent a
walkout by the country’s high-school teachers.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras signed the decree on
May 11 to prevent the walkout by teachers, the third time this
year he has used the emergency legislation. The move came after
the teachers union, known as OLME, called a series of strikes to
coincide with university entrance exams in Greek schools.  ADEDY, the umbrella group for all state employees, said it
opposes the government’s “policy of absolute domination over
teachers”, according to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based union.  The teachers planned a 24-hour strike on May 17 and a five-day strike starting from May 20, in the middle of the exam
period. The union is opposed to government plans to cut jobs in
the education sector, according to a  statement  posted on OLME’s
website on May 10, part of the conditions attached to the
country receiving further payments under the 240 billion euros
of funds granted by the euro area and  International Monetary
Fund .  Greece’s government agreed April 15 to dismiss 15,000 state
workers by the end of next year. Identifying redundant positions
and mandatory exits for about 150,000 civil servants by 2015 was
a so-called milestone for the country to receive further
payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
