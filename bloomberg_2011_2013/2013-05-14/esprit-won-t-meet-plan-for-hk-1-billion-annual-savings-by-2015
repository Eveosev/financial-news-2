Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the Hong Kong-based apparel seller that last year lost two top executives,
said it won’t save HK$1 billion ($129 million) per year by June
2015 as planned as its performance isn’t meeting expectations.  The savings targets and other projections laid out under a
transformation plan announced in 2011 are “no longer
applicable,” Chief Executive Officer Jose Manuel Martinez Gutierrez said on a webcast. The plan was rolled out by the
company’s previous CEO Ronald Van der Vis.  The company this month forecast a “substantial” annual
loss on store closures and a drop in the value of goodwill. The
clothier has invested in advertising and store upgrades as it
faces competition from rivals including  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) ,
 Fast Retailing Co. (9983)  and  Inditex SA (ITX) ’s Zara.  Esprit plans to cut expenses and focus on improving
profitability in 6-12 months, Martinez said.  Esprit aims to improve its business and distribution by
cutting loss-making retail stores, unproductive product lines,
unprofitable wholesale business and exiting loss-making
countries, Martinez said today. It is also targeting keeping
operational expenses below 50 percent of sales, he said.  The company expects a further fall in sales in the fiscal
year ended June 2014 as it shuts more stores and a recovery in
business to begin over fiscal 2015, Martinez said today.  Esprit lost two executives in 48 hours in June. Former
Chairman Hans Joachim Koerber resigned a day after then-Chief
Executive OfficerVan der Vis quit. The departures fueled doubt
over the company’s ability to see its transformation plan
through. Van der Vis was replaced by Martinez.  To contact the reporter on this story:
