Ethanol weakened against gasoline on
concern that the highest returns for making the biofuel from
corn since 2011 will raise production rates.  The discount, or price difference, widened 3.46 cents to
18.46 cents a gallon, as the corn crush spread, or the
difference between the cost of a gallon of ethanol and the corn
needed to make it, rose to 17 cents, near the highest since Dec.
2, 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Production has
struggled to rebound since drought last summer eroded profits.  “These things take time to cycle through,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“Eventually you will see production come up to satisfy the
market.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery decreased 1.8 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.653 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 26 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery advanced 1.66 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.8376 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S., with one bushel
distilling into at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.
About 34 percent of this year’s corn crop will be used to make
ethanol, the Agriculture Department said in a May 10 report.  Supply Outlook  Blackford said farmers will plant more corn during the
spring and as the harvest approaches, making it easier for
ethanol companies to increase production.  “If the farmer gets the crop in the ground, he’ll be a
more willing seller,” Blackford said.  Corn for July delivery dropped 3 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$6.525 a bushel in  Chicago .  The corn crush spread for July was up from minus 35 cents
on Dec. 31. The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production,
which can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol  production  in the week ended May 3 averaged 843,000
barrels a day, down 12 percent from the record 963,000 barrels a
day in December 2011, Energy Information Administration data
show.  The Energy Department’s analytical arm is scheduled to
release the latest production and supply figures tomorrow at
10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  RINs Prices  The value of  corn-based ethanol RINs  was little changed at
78.5 cents at 4:41 p.m.  New York  time, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, decreased 0.7 percent to 90.5
cents.  RINs are certificates attached to each gallon of biofuel to
help track compliance with U.S. mandates. Refiners can trade the
RIN once they blend biofuel into petroleum or submit it to the
Environmental Protection Agency to show adherence to the law.  Stockpiles are also at record low levels for this time of
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Inventories fell 1.1 percent to 16.8 million barrels in the
week ended May 3, the lowest since Nov. 4, according to EIA.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up a record 97 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, up from 96 percent the previous week,
EIA said.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged at $2.765 a
gallon on the  Gulf Coast , up 0.5 cent to $2.705 in Chicago, up
2.5 cents to $2.825 on the West Coast and down 4 cents to $2.835
in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf expanded 2.5
cents to 6 cents. Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor slimmed
4.5 cents to 13 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
