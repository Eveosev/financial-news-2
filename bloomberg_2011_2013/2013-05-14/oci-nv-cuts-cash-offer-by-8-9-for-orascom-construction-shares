OCI NV (OCI)  reduced the cash offer to
stockholders of its subsidiary,  Orascom Construction  Industries,
by 8.9 percent as it seeks to complete a tender for the unit’s
shares listed in Egypt. The stock fell.  Amsterdam-based OCI NV will pay investors 255 Egyptian
pounds a share as an alternative to a stock swap, Orascom
Construction said in a  statement  on its website today. The
company had offered a cash option of  280 pounds  in January.  OCI NV, which plans to relocate Orascom Industries’ shares
to the Netherlands, said today it will formally proceed with
filing all necessary documentation to complete the offer. Cairo-based investment bank Pharos Holding said April 30 that a
revised offer won’t fall below 246.6 pounds a share, the average
closing price over the past three months and the minimum
required by the regulator.  OCI NV signed extensions to equity commitments made by U.S.
investors including Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates’
Cascade Investment, Southeastern Asset Management and Davis
Selected Advisers to fund the cash alternative to holders, it
said.  Orascom Constructions,  Egypt ’s biggest publicly listed
company that agreed on April 30 to pay about 7 billion pounds
($1 billion) over five years to settle a tax dispute, declined
2.1 percent to 240.61 pounds at 11:31 a.m. in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
