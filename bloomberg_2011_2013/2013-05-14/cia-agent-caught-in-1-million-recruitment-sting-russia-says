Russian authorities are expelling a U.S. official they accused of being a CIA officer who offered a member of the special services in Moscow as much as $1 million a year for information.  The accused spy, identified as Ryan Christopher Fogle, was detained in a sting operation on May 13, the Federal Security Service said yesterday on its  website . Fogle worked under a cover in the U.S. embassy’s  political section , according to the FSB, as the successor to the Soviet-era KGB is known in Russian.  Russia  declared Fogle persona non grata and is demanding that he be sent home as soon as possible, the Foreign Ministry said in a  statement  yesterday. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov conveyed “ protest ” over the incident to U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul at a meeting in Moscow today.  The incident marks a new source of tension between Russia and the U.S. Fogle’s arrest shows that intelligence services are resuming their Cold War spying tactics after the end of the “reset” policy championed by former President Dmitry Medvedev and his U.S. counterpart  Barack Obama , said Nikolai Kovalyov, who ran the FSB from 1996 to 1998, when he was replaced by Vladimir Putin.  “This won’t lead to global changes in relations between countries and security services, though it is a signal that Americans have returned to their old tactics and methods of work,” Kovalyov, now a member of the security committee in the lower house of parliament, said by telephone from Moscow.  Recruitment Foiled  The man the FSB identified as Fogle was detained in a nighttime operation that included video footage and  photographs  that were later distributed to media outlets and broadcast on state television. Fogle was returned to the embassy yesterday, an on-duty FSB officer said by phone.  A Russian official shown in the  video  says Fogle had tried to recruit an officer linked to counter-terrorism work in the North Caucasus, an area where intelligence services of the former Cold War foes have sought to broaden cooperation in the aftermath of the  Boston  Marathon bombing case.  Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his younger brother Dzhokhar, ethnic Chechens who moved to the U.S. from the Dagestan region of Russia, are suspected of detonating the two bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 at the Boston Marathon last month. The older brother was killed during a shootout with police on April 19, while the younger one is being held at a federal prison hospital outside Boston.  ‘Very Cooperative’  U.S. President Barack Obama said two weeks ago that Russia had been “very cooperative” in the investigation of the attack, which included a visit to Dagestan by a team of FBI agents.  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry refused to comment on the Russian charges today and emphasized U.S.-Russia cooperation on  Syria  instead as he stood beside Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting of the Arctic Council in Kiruna,  Sweden . In  Washington , Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman, declined yesterday to answer repeated questions about the Russian spying allegations and Fogle’s role.  “We can confirm that an officer at our U.S. embassy in Moscow was briefly detained and was released,” Ventrell said. He declined to say whether Fogle was still in Russia.  One photo of the nighttime operation shows the contents of the backpack the FSB said Fogle was carrying at the time of his arrest, neatly arrayed on a table, including dark and light wigs, sunglasses, a compass, a map of Moscow, two knives, a notepad, a microphone, a plastic cigarette lighter and an RFID shield.  ‘Dear Friend’  Another image showed what the FSB said was a printed letter in Russian that Fogle intended to deliver to the target of a recruitment effort. The missive, which starts, “Dear Friend,” promises $100,000 just to “discuss possible cooperation” and as much as $1 million a year for supplying information demanded by the U.S., state-run RT television said on its website. It instructs the recipient to open a new Gmail account, write an e-mail to unbacggdA@gmail.com and wait a week for a reply, RT said.  The FSB said in its statement the Fogle case is just the latest in “numerous attempts” by the U.S. recently to recruit Russians in law enforcement and the security services.  “To put it mildly, we are surprised by this brazen recruitment attempt at a time when Presidents Obama and Putin have pledged to step up cooperation and contacts between the security services of the two countries,” Putin’s foreign-policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters today.
