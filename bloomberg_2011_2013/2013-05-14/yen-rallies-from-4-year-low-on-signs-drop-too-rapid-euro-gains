The yen rallied from the lowest level
in more than four years against the dollar as technical
indicators signaled its recent decline was too rapid.  The yen touched the weakest since October 2008 yesterday as
the  U.S. economy  showed continued signs of recovery and Treasury
yields touched a seven-week high. The euro advanced today,
snapping a three-day decline, before data forecast to show
German investor confidence rose this month. The Australian and
New Zealand dollars climbed as gains in Asian stocks boosted
demand for riskier assets.  “The sheer scale of the yen move has given the impression
that it’s a one-way bet, and in  currency markets  there aren’t
any one-way bets,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency
strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Sydney. “The arguments
for buying the  U.S. dollar  on the notion of the Fed tapering off
QE any time soon are quite thin,” he said, referring to the the
Federal Reserve’s program of so-called quantitative easing.  The yen strengthened 0.3 percent to 101.5 per dollar at
10:22 a.m. in Tokyo from yesterday, when it touched 102.15, the
weakest since October 2008. It was little changed at 132.18 per
euro. The 17-nation euro gained 0.4 percent to $1.3020, after
falling 1.4 percent in the previous three sessions. The Swiss
franc climbed 0.5 percent to 95.30 centimes per dollar.  Australia’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to 99.92 U.S. cents.
 New Zealand ’s currency advanced 0.4 percent to 82.83 U.S. cents.  U.S. 10-year  Treasury yields  touched 1.94 percent
yesterday, the highest level since March 26. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of stocks gained 0.4 percent today.  Excessive Losses  The yen’s 14-day relative strength index versus the dollar
yesterday fell below the 30 level which indicates an asset price
has fallen too rapidly and it may be poised to reverse course.
The Japanese currency’s RSI against the euro was at 33.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
will probably say its index of investor and analyst
expectations, which aims to predict economic developments six
months in advance, rose to 40 from 36.3 in April, according to
the median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
before the data today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
