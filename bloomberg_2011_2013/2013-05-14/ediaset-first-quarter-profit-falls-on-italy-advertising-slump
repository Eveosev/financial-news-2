Mediaset SpA (MS) , the broadcaster
controlled by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi,
advanced the most in more than three weeks in Milan after the
company said it would achieve a cost-cutting target ahead of
schedule.  Mediaset said yesterday in its earnings statement that it’s
confident that it can reach the cost-reduction goal of 450
million euros ($581 million) in its 2012-2014 plan before the
end of the period.  “The results achieved in 2012 and the first quarter of
2013 make it possible to hope that the announced reduction in
structural costs can be achieved ahead of schedule,” Milan-based Mediaset said in the statement.  The broadcaster rose as much as 5.7 percent to 2.28 euros
and was trading at 2.27 euros at 11:35 a.m. in Milan.  “The shares are rising because the market liked the cost-cutting, even if we must be careful about being too
enthusiastic,” said Andrea De Vita, an analyst at Banca Akros
in Milan.  Mediaset reported a 7.9 percent decline in first-quarter
profit on lower advertising sales in  Italy . Net income fell to
9.3 million euros from 10.1 million euros a year earlier, the
company said. Revenue dropped 15 percent to 831.6 million euros.
That compares with an analysts’ estimate of 834.8 million euros,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mediaset is hurt by the weakness of the Italian advertising
market, which plunged 19 percent in the first quarter to 1.59
billion euros, according to researcher Nielsen Holdings.
Competition with Rupert Murdoch’s pay-TV provider, Sky Italia,
has intensified and to counter that challenge, Mediaset has held
talks with Qatar’s Al Jazeera and French pay-TV channel Canal+
about forming a partnership.  The company reported its first annual loss in March because
of impairment costs of 307.8 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
