Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , the wind-turbine
maker involved in India’s biggest convertible bond default in
October, sold 90 million euros ($117 million) of systems in
Germany.  Suzlon’s REpower Systems unit will supply 27 turbines for
four community wind projects in northern Germany, according to a
 statement  today from the Pune, India-based company.  Suzlon will deliver the turbines through 2014 and maintain
them for at least 15 years, according to the statement.  Community wind farms are responsible for about half of
REpower’s orders in Germany in the fiscal year that ended in
March, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
