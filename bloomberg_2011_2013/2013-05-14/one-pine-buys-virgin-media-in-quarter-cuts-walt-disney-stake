Lone Pine  Capital LLC bought  Virgin
Media Inc. (VMED)  and H&R Block Inc. in the first quarter, while
cutting its holdings in Walt Disney Co.  Lone Pine, run by Stephen Mandel Jr., purchased 5.66
million shares of New York-based Virgin Media and 6.75 million
shares of Kansas City, Missouri-based tax preparer H&R Block,
the firm said today in a filing.  Lone Pine, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, sold its entire
stake of 2.88 million shares of  Crown Castle International
Corp. (CCI) , a Houston-based wireless communication company, according
to the Form 13F filing.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within 45 days of each quarter’s end to list their
U.S.-traded stocks, options and convertible bonds. The filings
don’t show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the firms hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
