Confidence among U.S. small
businesses climbed in April to a six-month high as the outlook
for the economy and sales brightened.  The  National Federation of Independent Business ’s optimism
 index  increased to 92.1 last month from 89.5 in March. The 2.6
point gain was the biggest advance since October 2010. Four of
the measure’s 10 components contributed to the improvement, the
Washington-based group said.  The share of business owners expecting sales will increase
climbed 8 points to 4 percent in April and the portion planning
to create jobs increased. Those looking for business conditions
to improve over the next six months jumped 13 points to minus 15
percent.  At the same time, measures of credit-condition expectations
and capital-spending plans retreated. The gauge is less than two
points above its average of 90.7 since the start of the recovery
in June 2009.  “The sub-par recovery is still well in place for the small
business sector,”  William Dunkelberg , the group’s chief
economist, said in a statement. “Nothing in the NFIB data
suggests that the small business half of the economy is growing
other than by an amount driven by  population growth  and
associated new business starts now in excess of terminations.”  The NFIB report was based on a survey of 1,873 small-business owners through April 30. Small companies represent more
than 99 percent of all U.S employers, according to the U.S.
Small Business Administration. A small business is defined as an
independent enterprise with no more than 500 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
