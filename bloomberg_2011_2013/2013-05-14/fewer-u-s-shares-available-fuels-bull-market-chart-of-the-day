Repurchases are magnifying gains in
U.S. stocks and are poised to lift prices further, according to
Pavilion Global Markets Ltd. strategists.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the Wilshire 5000 Total
Market Index has risen more than the market value of all U.S.
companies since the current  bull market  started in March 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Through last week, the
gap was about 13 percentage points.  “The difference comes from a reduction in the number of
shares,”  Pierre Lapointe , head of global strategy and research
at the Montreal-based firm, and two colleagues wrote yesterday
in a report. “The resulting de-equitization is giving a boost
to this stock-market rally.”  S&P 500 calculations are based on 2.3 percent fewer shares
than in July 2011, when the total reached its high for the bull
market, the strategists estimated. A drop in stock outstanding
accounted for 25 percent of the past year’s earnings-per-share
growth for companies in the index, they added.  Apple Inc., the world’s largest company by market value,
increased its stock-buyback program last month by $50 billion.
That’s enough to pay for about 12 percent of the Cupertino,
California-based company’s shares at their closing price
yesterday. The program will run through 2015.  “De-equitization is a global phenomenon,” Lapointe and
his colleagues added. In most developed markets, FTSE stock
indexes rose faster than total market value during the past
year, according to their report. This was also the case in
Brazil, Mexico and  South Korea , three  emerging markets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
