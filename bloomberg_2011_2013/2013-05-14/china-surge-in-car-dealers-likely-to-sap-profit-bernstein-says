Chinese auto dealership returns will
decline as automakers add more of them, intensifying
competition, Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. said in a  report .  Foreign automakers are expanding distribution in  China ’s
central and western regions and into less-developed cities
dominated by domestic brands, while local marques are seeking to
attract higher-income buyers with more sophisticated products,
according to the Bernstein note distributed today.  “A crunch in returns is inevitable,” analysts led by  Max Warburton  wrote in the report.  Increasing competition in the world’s largest network of
dealerships will probably fall hardest on smaller sellers,
according to the report. “For some of the weaker brands whose
dealers sell relatively few cars even now, this could prove to
be a disastrous development,” Warburton wrote.  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  have focused on
the eastern, southern and northern parts of China, where incomes
are higher and are now expanding in the poorest regions,
according to the report.  Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and  BYD Co. (1211)  have the most
number of dealerships in the country, though they are
concentrated in poorer cities, sell fewer cars and have lower
profitability, according to Bernstein.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
