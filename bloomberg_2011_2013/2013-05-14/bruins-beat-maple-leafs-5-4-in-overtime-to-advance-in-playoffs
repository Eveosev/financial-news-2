The  Boston  Bruins rallied from a 4-1
deficit in the third period to beat the visiting Toronto Maple
Leafs 5-4 in overtime in the decisive seventh game and reach the
second round of the National Hockey League playoffs.  Patrice Bergeron scored with 50 seconds remaining in the
third period to force overtime and got the winning goal six
minutes, five seconds into overtime for Boston, which advances
to the Eastern Conference semifinals against the winner of
tonight’s game between the  New York  Rangers and the Washington
Capitals. That series is tied at three games apiece.  After Matt Bartkowski put the Bruins ahead in the first
period at TD Garden in Boston, the Maple Leafs built a 4-1 lead
with 14:31 to play in the third as Cody Franson scored twice and
Phil Kessel and Nazem Kadri added a goal each.  Nathan Horton pulled a goal back for the Bruins midway
through the third period and Milan Lucic made it 4-3 with 1:22
to play, 21 seconds before Bergeron tied it for Boston.  It’s the sixth straight postseason that the Bruins have had
to play a decisive seventh game. They’ve now won four of eight
deciders in that span, with the prior three victories coming in
2011, when they ended a 39-year wait for a sixth Stanley Cup
title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
