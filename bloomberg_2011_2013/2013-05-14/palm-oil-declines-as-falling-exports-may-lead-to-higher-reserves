Palm oil  dropped for a second day on
speculation that declining exports and rising output may boost
stockpiles in Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for July delivery declined as much as 0.6
percent to 2,296 ringgit ($768) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, before ending the morning trading session
at 2,300 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur.  Inventories fell 11 percent to 1.93 million tons in April,
the lowest level since June and compared with a record 2.63
million tons in December, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said May
10. Output rose 3.1 percent to 1.37 million tons, while exports
dropped 5.6 percent to 1.45 million tons, the board said. In the
first 10 days of this month, shipments plunged 17 percent to
380,047 tons, according to surveyor Intertek.  “Potentially exports are going to continue to decline
until the last quarter and production is going to increase as
well,” said Benny Lee, chief market strategist at Jupiter
Securities Sdn. “Looking forward at these prospects, we don’t
really see that inventories can reduce that much anymore.”  Stockpiles at major ports in  China , the second-biggest
importer after India, climbed last week to a record 1.35 million
tons, up about 50,000 tons from a week earlier, the China
National Grain and Oils Information Center said yesterday.  “China has fully stocked itself, so maybe in the next two
months, production will trend ahead of exports,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst with Alliance Investment Bank Bhd.  Refined palm oil for September delivery dropped 0.2 percent
to 6,106  yuan  ($994) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while  soybean oil  was little changed at 7,492 yuan. On the
Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for July delivery rose 0.2
percent to $14.22 a bushel and soybean oil was little changed at
49.60 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
