U.S. stock exchanges canceled trades
that caused a 19 percent surge in  Bonanza Creek Energy Inc. (BCEI) 
within seconds, while sudden price swings in at least three
other securities today were let stand.  NYSE Euronext and  Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc. said they would
break  trades  in Bonanza Creek that were executed above $39.55
between 3:40 p.m. and 3:41 p.m. today, according to e-mailed
notices from the exchanges. Shares of the Denver-based driller
jumped from $37.67 to $44.91 in that period after opening at
$35.68. They closed at $37.73, up 5.5 percent for the day.  While the decision to cancel the Bonanza Creek transactions
came after NYSE Arca Market Management and Nasdaq reviewed them
for errors, trades that caused abrupt swings in other shares
were untouched. The movements spurred speculation that a
brokerage’s computer trading system was experiencing errors as
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was on its way to a surge of
more than 1 percent to a record 1,650.34.  These trades are “more like flash crashes that we see
regularly now, just in this it was higher because it was a
strong day,” Rick Fier, director of equity trading at Conifer
Securities LLC in  New York , said by e-mail. His firm oversees $8
billion. “Either way, there was no liquidity to handle the
aggressive orders. Back in the day, if you had a fat finger
trade you wouldn’t move the market half as much as in today’s
markets.”  Pimco Fund  A series of trades in  Pimco Dynamic Income Fund (PDI) , an
exchange-traded product focused on global credit markets, pushed
the security’s price up 6.4 percent from $31.93 at 3:57 p.m. to
$33.97 in 26 seconds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The ETF erased most of the gain in less than 10 seconds. Total
volume for the day was 933,916 shares, the most since March 28.  Shares of  Mylan Inc. (MYL)  rose more than 3.6 percent within nine
seconds at 2:44 p.m., before reversing the gains almost
instantly. The trades occurred more than 80 minutes after
 Bloomberg News  reported that Actavis Inc. rejected a cash-and-stock offer from Mylan, according to people familiar with the
matter who asked not to be named because the discussions were
private.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  retreated from $86.40 to $85.88 and then
recovered in a matter of seconds at 9:47 a.m.  Sara Rich, a spokeswoman for NYSE Euronext, declined to
comment on trading of individual stocks. Robert Madden, a
spokesman for Nasdaq, didn’t immediately reply to an email
seeking comment.  Exchange  rules  allow trades to be considered clearly
erroneous and broken if the shares move a certain percentage
from their last price, among other factors. The threshold is 5
percent for stocks priced between $25 and $50, according to
guidelines on the NYSE website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
