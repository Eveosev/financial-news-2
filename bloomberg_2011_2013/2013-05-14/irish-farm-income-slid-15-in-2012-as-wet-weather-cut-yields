Farm income in Ireland fell 15
percent in 2012 from the prior year after wet weather raised
production costs and cut crop yields, the country’s agriculture
and food development authority said.  Average income slid to 25,483 euros ($33,059) a farm,
according to preliminary  estimates  released online today from
the government-funded researcher known as Teagasc. Direct
payments, including from the European Union’s Single Farm
Payment scheme, comprised 81 percent of income at 20,534 euros
on average for each farm. Ireland has about 80,000 farms,
according to the report.  “While agricultural commodity prices remained relatively
favorable in 2012, the inclement weather adversely affected
production costs and crop yields,” Thia Hennessy, the head of
Teagasc’s national farm survey, said in a statement. “In
particular, dairy farms were impacted by the wet summer” as
production costs rose about 21 percent.  About a third of Irish farms are “economically
vulnerable,” meaning they make too little money to pay family
laborers an average wage while returning 5 percent on non-land
assets, according to the  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
