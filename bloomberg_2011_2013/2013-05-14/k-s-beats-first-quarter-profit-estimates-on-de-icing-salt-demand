K+S AG (SDF) , Europe’s largest potash
maker, reported first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates after extended wintry weather in Europe boosted demand
for de-icing salt.  Earnings before interest and taxes and excluding some
hedging transactions, called Ebit I, rose 12 percent to 277.9
million euros ($361.5 billion) in the quarter, the Kassel,
Germany-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
predicted 274.9 million euros in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Norbert Steiner reiterated today
that earnings and sales will probably rise “slightly” this
year as increased demand for salt more than compensates for
lower potash prices. K+S and rivals such as  Russia ’s OAO
Eurochem plan to increase capacity for the crop nutrient as
prices are expected to stabilize.  “In the Salt business unit, continued wintry weather in
 Europe  at the start of the year resulted in above-average demand
for de-icing salt, which was significantly above the low level
of the same period a year ago,” Steiner said in the statement.  Sales gained 19 percent to 1.28 billion euros, also beating
a 1.23 billion-euro estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Net income
fell 11 percent to 187.5 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
