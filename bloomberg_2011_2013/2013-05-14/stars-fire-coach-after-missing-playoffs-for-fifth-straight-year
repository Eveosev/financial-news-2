The  Dallas Stars  fired coach Glen
Gulutzan and assistant Paul Jerrard after the National Hockey
League team failed to make the playoffs for the fifth
consecutive season..  The Stars finished the lockout-shortened season with a
22-22-4 record. It was the worst mark in the Pacific Division
and left  Dallas  seven points out of a playoff spot.  Gulutzan, 41, was in his second season as coach and led the
Stars to a 42-35-5 record in 2011-12. Assistant Curt Fraser and
goaltending coach Mike Valley will remain with the team, the
franchise said in a statement on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
