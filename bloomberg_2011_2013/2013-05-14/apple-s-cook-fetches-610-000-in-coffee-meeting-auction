A coffee date with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  fetched $610,000 for charity, according to press reports.  An online auction generated 86 bids for the meeting at Apple’s Cupertino, California, headquarters with Cook, who is raising money for the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights,  CNN  reported yesterday.  Charitybuzz.com, which organized the bidding, had estimated the event would raise $50,000. Glenda Felden, a spokeswoman for  Charitybuzz , said the group would put out a statement with details about the winning bid after it had coordinated with all of the parties involved.  Taking a cue from billionaire investor  Warren Buffett , business leaders such as Cook and  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  CEO  Howard Schultz  are  auctioning  their time for charity. Buffett last year raised $3.46 million for the Glide Foundation.  The winning bidder, who can bring a guest along, will meet with Cook for 30 minutes to an hour. Travel and accommodations aren’t covered for the trip.  The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights was founded in 1968 with the aim of helping realize the senator’s vision for “a more just and peaceful world,” according to its website. Cook succeeded Apple co-founder  Steve Jobs  as CEO in 2011.
