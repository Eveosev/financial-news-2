Cooking oil  imports  by  India , the
world’s second-biggest buyer, declined in April for the first
time in five months on ample stockpiles and as consumption
decreased because of the summer heat.  Purchases of vegetable oils, including for industrial use,
slumped 29 percent to 654,827 metric tons in April from 925,334
tons a year earlier, the  Solvent Extractors’ Association of
India  said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s lower than a
median estimate of 700,000 tons in a Bloomberg survey of five
processors and brokers.  A drop in imports by India, the biggest palm oil buyer, may
extend losses in futures traded in Kuala Lumpur. Prices are down
27 percent in the past year as production in Indonesia and
 Malaysia , the world’s biggest suppliers, outpaced demand.
India’s cooking oil stockpiles were at 1.8 million tons on May 1,
compared with 1.56 million tons a year earlier and a record 2.12
million tons in March, association data showed.  “We had overstocked on supplies in the last few months,”
B.V. Mehta, executive director of the association, said by phone.
An increase in the import duty narrowed the price difference
between crude and refined palm oil to $10 a ton, boosting
purchases of refined oil, he said.  In January, India almost doubled the taxable prices of
crude cooking oil imports and imposed a duty of 2.5 percent to
shield domestic oilseed growers from cheap overseas supplies.
Refined edible oil imports are taxed at 7.5 percent.  Local Demand  Crude palm oil  imports dropped 44 percent from a year
earlier to 233,987 tons, while refined  palm oil  purchases more
than doubled to 253,489 tons, the association said.  Soybean oil
imports  slumped to 50,999 tons from 216,509 tons, while
sunflower oil fell 32 percent to 88,368 tons, it said. India
buys palm from Indonesia and Malaysia, and  soybean oil  from
Brazil and  Argentina .  “Local consumption always slows in the summer months,”
said Mehta. “We can see a pickup in demand in August” when the
festival season begins in the country, he said.  Vegetable oil purchases in the six months to April rose 12
percent to 5.3 million tons, association data showed.  Palm for delivery in July fell 0.7 percent to 2,293 ringgit
($767) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange at 5:05 p.m.
in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures dropped 3.9 percent in April, the third
straight month of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
