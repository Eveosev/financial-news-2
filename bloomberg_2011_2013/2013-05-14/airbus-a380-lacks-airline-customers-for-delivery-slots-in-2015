Airbus SAS said it must step up
efforts to market its flagship A380 as it still lacks buyers for
some of the 30 double-decker planes it wants to build and
deliver in 2015, the year the program is supposed to break even.  While Airbus still believes in the business rationale
behind the superjumbo plane, the company needs to work harder to
win more customers, Harald Wilhelm, the chief financial officer
of Airbus and parent company European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co., told journalists today. Airbus reiterated that it
expects to deliver 25 double deckers this year.  “There are still some slots to be booked from 2015 so this
is a top priority for John and his team,” Wilhelm said,
referring to  John Leahy , the head of sales at the Toulouse,
France-based planemaker. “Our view on the A380 is unchanged.
This asset has its its place.”  Airbus brought in only four new orders for the A380 last
year, compared with a target of 30, and the company hasn’t
booked a purchase for the airliner this year, on a goal of 25
contracts. The company has cut back output plans as it works
through changing the wing structure, eating into sales growth
that EADS reiterated will be “modest” in 2013.  EADS rose as much as 84 cents, or 2 percent, to 42.04 euros
in Paris, and traded at 41.85 euros as of 10:34 a.m. The company
said earnings before interest, tax and one-time items in the
first quarter rose to 741 million euros ($963 million), boosted
by Airbus profit that more than doubled.  Cutting Output  Boeing Co. (BA)  said last month it is cutting the production
rate of its 747-8 model to 1.75 planes a month from two, citing
dwindling demand. Wilhelm declined to say if Airbus is also
considering adjustments. He didn’t say how many slots, or
production positions, lack promised buyers, saying it’s
“clearly in single digits” and that the company would make
every effort to deliver profitable planes regardless of output.  Airbus starts cutting metal for planned A380 deliveries
about two years before the plane is handed over, while it
doesn’t need to know the buyer for cabin customization until
about nine months before the transfer. A permanent fix for wing
rib feet will be incorporated into planes handed over from 2014.  Wilhelm said the A380 typically wins more business toward
the latter part of the year, and the aviation industry still has
the  Paris Air Show  and the equivalent expo in Dubai ahead, where
airlines tend to place large orders.  “They’ll need a good Paris Air Show, and certainly good
announcements at Dubai to fill the gap,” said  Yan Derocles , an
analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris. “I think it’s critical to
manage break-even on this program in 2015.”  Besides the A380, Airbus’s other challenge is getting its
smaller A350 wide-body jet ready for flight. The first flyable
A350 rolled out of the paint shop yesterday as engineers prepare
for its maiden take-off, and Wilhelm said today he’s more
confident of a first flight this summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
