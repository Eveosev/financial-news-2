Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest refiner,
posted a deeper-than-expected drop in first-quarter profit as
oil and gas production fell.  Net income  slumped 56 percent to 32.3 billion forint ($142
million), the company said in a statement to the  Budapest Stock
Exchange  today. That compared with a 40.2 billion-forint mean
 estimate  in a Bloomberg survey. Average oil and gas production
excluding  Syria  fell 10 percent to 110,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day as its fields in central and eastern Europe
are getting depleted and offshore production in Croatia shrank
27 percent from a year earlier, Mol said.  Stopping the decline in production will be one of the
company’s main goals for 2013 after “slow” economic growth,
pressure on fuel demand and the lack of Syrian production
weighed on first-quarter earnings, Chairman  Zsolt Hernadi  said
in the statement.  “The main problem is the drop in production,” with the
decline in Croatia especially concerning, the Budapest-based
broker unit of  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  said in an e-mailed report today.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization adjusted for special items and inventory
revaluation rose an annual 2 percent to 141.2 billion forint.  Mol shares fell 0.6 percent to 16,515 forint at 11:39 a.m.
in Budapest, extending this year’s decline to 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
