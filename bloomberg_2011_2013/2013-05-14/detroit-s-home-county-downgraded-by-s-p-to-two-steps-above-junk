Michigan ’s Wayne County, home of
 Detroit , had its credit rating cut to two steps above junk by
 Standard & Poor’s  because of declining property values and a
negative general-fund balance.  The downgrade to BBB reflects “financial deterioration
caused primarily by a prolonged structural imbalance,” an S&P
analyst, Jane Ridley, said in the report.  Cities located within Wayne County include Detroit and
Allen Park, which are among Michigan municipalities under state-appointed emergency financial managers. Flint,  Benton Harbor  and
Pontiac also have such managers, according to the state
treasurer’s  website . Hamtramck, also within the county, is under
review for an overseer.  With 707,000 residents across an area larger than  Boston ,
 San Francisco  and  Manhattan  combined, Detroit has eight people
per acre, down from 21 in 1950, and 65,000 vacant homes, many
slated for demolition.  Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said today that he won’t run for a
second term, though he would form an exploratory committee for a
possible campaign to become executive of Wayne County. Kevyn Orr
was appointed emergency manager of Michigan’s most-populous city
in March by Republican Governor  Rick Snyder .  To contact the reporter on this story:
