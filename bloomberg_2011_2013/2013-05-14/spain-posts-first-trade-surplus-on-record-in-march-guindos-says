Spain posted its first monthly trade
surplus on record in March, underscoring the country’s improved
competitiveness, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said.  The euro area’s fourth-biggest economy had a trade surplus
of “a little over” 600 million euros ($777 million), Guindos
told reporters in Brussels after a meeting of European Union
finance ministers. The government is scheduled to report the
March trade balance on May 20. The February deficit was 1.2
billion euros.  “Spain had never had, since records began, a monthly trade
surplus,” Guindos said. “This shows how exports have improved
and that they are the main driver of Spain’s recovery and of the
economy’s transformation.”  Growing investor confidence in Spain was underscored by the
sale of 7 billion euros of 10-year bonds, which attracted bids
exceeding 21 billion euros, the Spaniard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
