Israeli airstrikes against targets in
 Syria  were carried out after the Syrian government gained
ground, illustrating ties between  Israel  and Syrian rebels,
Iran’s Foreign Ministry said.  The Syrian government has informed Iran its response would
be “prompt” to any recurring attacks by Israel, Iran’s Foreign
Ministry spokesman Abbas Araghchi told reporters today in
Tehran, in comments aired on state television.  Syria threatened retaliation against Israel after an aerial
strike on May 5 on the outskirts of Damascus caused explosions
that rocked the capital. Israel has not confirmed carrying out
that attack or a May 3 airstrike in Syria that The Associated
Press said targeted missiles thought to be bound for Lebanon’s
anti-Israel Hezbollah movement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
