China Vanke Co. (000002) ,  Poly Real Estate Co. (600048) 
and  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  led declines by shares of property developers
on concerns that  China ’s economy is slowing and that authorities
may introduce new curbs to rein in home prices.  A gauge of developers listed in  Shanghai  declined as much
as  2.1 percent  and was 1.7 percent lower at 2:05 p.m., heading
for the biggest one-day drop since April 25. Vanke, China’s
biggest publicly listed developer, fell as much as 2.9 percent
in Shenzhen. Poly Real Estate fell as much as 3.8 percent and
Gemdale dropped as much as 4.5 percent in Shanghai. China’s
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.1 percent.  Homes sales in China fell 13 percent in April from the
previous month after measures ordered by the government this
year, including higher down-payment requirements and strict
enforcement of transaction taxes, began to take effect. The 21st
Century Business Herald reported today that the city of Beijing
is requiring developers get approval from the mayor’s office
before they can begin pre-sales of homes.  “Weekly sales aren’t strong and there is speculation that
the government may come out with more policies,” Jinsong Du, a
property analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in Hong Kong, said
by telephone today. Weaker-than-expected economic data is
another reason for the declines, Du said.  Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics
yesterday showed fixed-asset investment growth unexpectedly
decelerated for the first four months to 20.6 percent, compared
with the 20.9 percent pace for the first quarter. The median of
estimate of 37 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had been for
fixed-asset investment growth of 21 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
