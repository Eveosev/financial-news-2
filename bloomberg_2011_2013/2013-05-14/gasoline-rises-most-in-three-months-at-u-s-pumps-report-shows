Retail gasoline in the U.S. rose the
most since February in the past week after crude costs increased
and refinery outages on the West Coast disrupted supplies.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged across the U.S., advanced
6.5 cents from the prior week to $3.603 a gallon for the seven
days ended yesterday, according to  data  from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. It was the biggest gain since Feb.
18. The price was 15.1 cents lower than a year earlier.  Prices rose in every geographic region, led by the West
Coast where tariffs increased 12.7 cents to $3.938 a gallon.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  restarted a crude unit at its Ferndale refinery
in Washington state yesterday after shutting it last week to
repair a crack in the tower.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s Anacortes plant in
Washington finished maintenance May 10 on a fluid catalytic
cracker it shut May 6.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  on May 6 began
maintenance on several units at its Torrance refinery in
Southern California.  “There was a series of refinery problems,” said Dave Hackett, the president of Stillwater Associates, an  Irvine ,
California-based oil consultant. “There were shortfalls of
product supplies in the Northwest, the  Portland  area. California
sees that and reacts, and moves gasoline up from the Bay or Los
Angeles to Portland.”  West Texas Intermediate crude futures increased 11 percent
in a three-week period to $96.62 on May 8 from $86.68 a barrel
on April 17. WTI for June delivery fell 87 cents to $95.17 a
barrel yesterday, the lowest settlement since May 2.  “With the normal lag from crude oil to retail, I expect
retail is now responding to higher crude oil prices as well,”
Hackett said.  The cheapest gasoline was on the U.S. Gulf Coast, where
prices at the pump gained 6.5 cents to $3.364 a gallon. The
smallest increase was on the East Coast, where prices rose 3.2
cents to $3.484 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
