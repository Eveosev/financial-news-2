Copper declined for the first time in
three days, leading most industrial metals lower amid
speculation that  China ’s economic slowdown is deepening.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 1.3 percent to $7,322.50 a metric ton
and was at $7,342 at 12:09 p.m.  Shanghai  time. Aluminum lost 0.4
percent, lead dropped 0.2 percent and zinc and tin each slipped
0.1%. Nickel rose 0.3 percent.  China’s investment decelerated in April as industrial
output trailed estimates, data showed yesterday.  Power output 
was 399.4 billion kilowatt-hours last month, compared with 419.4
billion kilowatt-hours in March. Beijing home pre-sales will
need additional approval from the mayor’s office, in addition to
the regular housing bureau, the 21st Century Business Herald
reported today. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell as much as 1.6
percent, the most since April 23.  “The sliding stock market dragged down commodities,”
Zhang Tianfeng, an analyst at Dongxing Futures Co., said by
phone from Shanghai. “Investors are still very concerned about
China’s growth prospects.”  Copper for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.1 percent to 52,810  yuan  ($8,597) a ton, while
the contract for July delivery on the Comex retreated 0.8
percent to $3.3340 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
