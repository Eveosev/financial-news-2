KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel
retailer, dropped the most in almost three weeks on speculation
a major investor reduced their stake in the company.  The stock fell 3.7 percent to 9.15 shillings by the close
in the capital, Nairobi, the largest drop since April 24. About
19.3 million shares were traded, more than 18 times the three-month daily average. KenolKobil reported a loss of 6.28 billion
shillings ($75 million) in 2012 from a profit of 3.27 billion
shillings a year earlier, it said on April 8.  “There has been a big seller in the market since the
earnings were released,” Davis Mika, an analyst with Nairobi-based Contrarian Investing Kenya Ltd., said by phone, declining
to identify the investor.  Faith Atiti of NIC Securities Ltd. and Eric Musau of
Standard Investment Bank Ltd. also said by phone a KenolKobil
investor was cutting their stake. KenolKobil Managing Director
 Jacob Segman  was in a meeting and couldn’t immediately comment
when called by Bloomberg, according to a person who answered the
phone at his office.  In May last year KenolKobil said its main shareholders
agreed to sell their majority stake to Puma Energy BV, a
subsidiary of Trafigura Beheer BV. The talks were terminated,
KenolKobil said on March 1.  The stock has fallen 32 percent this year, compared with a
30 percent gain on the Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
