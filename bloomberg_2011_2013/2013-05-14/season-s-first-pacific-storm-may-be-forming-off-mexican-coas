An area of low pressure about 650
miles (1,046 kilometers) south of  Acapulco ,  Mexico , has a 30
percent chance of growing into a tropical system in the next two
days, the  U.S. National Hurricane Center  said.  If it develops, the system would be the first of the 2013
eastern Pacific hurricane season. A storm gets a name when its
winds reach 39 miles per hour and becomes a hurricane when they
attain 74 mph.  “Gradual development of this system is possible during the
next couple of days as it moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15
mph,” the Miami-based center said in special tropical weather
outlook.  The center will begin issuing regular updates on the system
tomorrow when the season officially gets under way. The first
storm of the year will be named Alvin, the center said.  Last year, 17 storms developed in the ocean off the coast
of Mexico.  In the Atlantic,  hurricane season  begins on June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
