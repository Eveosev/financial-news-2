Iran ’s nuclear policy is based on the
nation’s rights and will not be modified no matter who succeeds
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas
Araghchi said.  “The Islamic Republic’s policies, including on its nuclear
program, are based on people’s rights and can’t be compromised
under any government,” Araghchi told reporters in Tehran today.
The “next government will pursue the same process and defend
Iran’s rights.”  Iran holds a presidential election on June 14 in which
Ahmadinejad isn’t eligible to run.  Araghchi spoke a day before top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton
meet in Istanbul. The last round of nuclear negotiations between
world powers and Iran in April didn’t yield immediate results.
Iran maintains its nuclear program is solely civilian while the
U.S. says it may be a cover for developing atomic weapons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
