Spot Canadian crudes strengthened
versus futures amid speculation that U.S. refinery demand for
Canadian imports will rise as plants finish maintenance.  Refinery utilization  rates  probably increased for a third
week, to 87.5 percent of capacity, in the seven days ended May
10, up 0.5 percentage point, according to the median estimate
from  10 analysts surveyed  by  Bloomberg News . The Energy
Information Administration is scheduled to release its
assessment tomorrow.  Syncrude, a light crude from oil-sands bitumen processed in
an upgrader, strengthened to a 50 cent-per-barrel premium to
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude after trading at parity
yesterday, according to Net Energy Inc., a Calgary oil broker.
Western Canada Select heavy oil expanded by 25 cents to an
$18.50-per-barrel discount.  Several U.S. Midwest refineries that take Canadian grades
are restarting operations after maintenance.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
is scheduled to end seasonal repairs on May 22 at the 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet plant, shut since April 14.  BP Plc (BP/)  said on
April 30 the 420,000-barrel  Whiting plant  will bring units back
online during the second quarter and commission a new 102,000-barrel coker in the second half of the year.  Cushing Inventories  Oil buyers have been drawing from stockpiles at the
Midwestern supply depot of Cushing,  Oklahoma , where Canadian oil
imports are stored, during the past two weeks, according to the
EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Inventories fell
652,000 barrels to 49.1 million in the week ended May 3.  Canadian  oil prices  have regained ground after weakening
when a fire broke out May 3 in the coker unit at Flint Hills
Resources LLC’s 330,000-barrel-a-day Pine Bend refinery in
Minnesota.  Western Canada Select jumped $3.50 a barrel yesterday to a
$19 discount in the largest one-day move since March 8,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The grade had lost $5 a
barrel from May 2 to May 6, reaching its widest discount to WTI
in two months.  Jake Reint, a Flint Hills spokesman based in Rosemount,
 Minnesota , didn’t respond to e-mails requesting an update on the
status of the coker this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
