South Korean  stocks  gained the most
in  Asia , led by exporters, as a stronger yen eased concerns
about a loss of competitiveness to Japanese rivals.  The  Kospi index  rose 1 percent to 1,968.83 at the close.  LG
Electronics (066570)  Inc., the world’s second-largest television maker,
had its biggest gain in a month.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  increased the
most in almost three weeks, while affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
climbed 3.8 percent.  The Kospi has declined 1.4 percent this year, compared with
a 10 percent gain by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, as a slump in
the yen made Japanese exports relatively cheaper for overseas
customers. The yen gained 0.4 percent against the dollar today,
the most in two weeks.  Japan ’s currency has fallen 14 percent
against the greenback this year, compared with a 3.8 percent
drop by  South Korea ’s won.  The weakening yen “has been reflected too much on the
valuation of South Korean exporters,” said Han Sang Soo, a  fund
manager  at Samsung Asset Management Co., which oversees $114
billion. Technology companies and automakers are among shares
that are cheap “and the market is now responding positively to
it,” he said.  The Kospi trades at 9.9  times  12-month projected profit,
compard with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s multiple of 13.8,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Trading volumes in the South
Korean gauge were 1.6 percent less than the 30-day average.  Hyundai Climbs  Foreign investors bought a net 159 billion won ($143
million) of stocks today, while domestic institutions purchased
126 billion won, according to Korea Exchange data.  LG Electronics rose 2.8 percent, the biggest climb since
April 10, to 85,500 won. The company got 22 percent of its 2012
revenue from  North America . Hyundai Motor, South Korea’s biggest
automaker, advanced 2.7 percent to 193,500 won. The gain was the
most since April 25.  Kia, South Korea’s second-largest automaker, jumped 3.8
percent to 54,500 won. The company reported on April 26 a 35
percent drop in first-quarter profit as the won’s strength
versus the yen dragged on sales.  The won advanced 0.3 percent against the yen today to
10.92, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The won touched
10.82 yen on May 10, the highest level since September, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
