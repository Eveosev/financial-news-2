Salvatore Ferragamo SpA (SFER) , an Italian
maker of  $1,390 sandals , rose to a record in Milan trading after
first-quarter profit beat estimates and the company confirmed
its projection for earnings growth this year.  The shares gained as much as 4.5 percent to 24.15 euros,
the highest price since a June 2011  initial public offering. 
They traded at 24.13 euros as of 9:31 a.m., more than double the
IPO price of 9 euros a share, and giving the company a market
value of more than 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion).  “We see a compelling long-term investment proposition at
Ferragamo,” Louise Singlehurst, an  analyst  at Morgan Stanley,
said in a note today. Still, the valuation remains “rich” at a
multiple of 26 times estimated 2014 earnings, compared with 16
times for the wider luxury industry, she wrote.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 26 percent to 48 million euros, Florence,
Italy-based Ferragamo said after markets closed yesterday.
Analysts predicted 42.9 million euros, according to the average
of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The performance was driven by strong performances in the
U.S. and Latin America, while  Japan  is looking stronger, Laura
Abitbol, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a note.  “While this is a seasonally quiet quarter, it does provide
strong evidence of the operating leverage in the business,”
Abitbol wrote. Earnings growth was 3.4 times stronger than
revenue growth, the analyst noted.  Sales in the quarter advanced 8.6 percent to 281.9 million
euros, or by 9.6 percent excluding currency shifts.  Business patterns this year justify expectations for
increases in revenue and profit through 2013 even as sales
growth slows, Ferragamo Chief Executive Officer Michele Norsa
said on a conference call. Luxury competitors including  LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  and  PPR (PP)  SA-owned Gucci last month
reported the weakest quarterly sales growth in more than three
years as demand softened in Europe and Asia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
