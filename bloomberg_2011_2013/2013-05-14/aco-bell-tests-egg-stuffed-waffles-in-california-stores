If there’s a chain that can pull off
selling scrambled egg-stuffed waffles, it’s Taco Bell, which
brought the world the Doritos Locos Taco mashup.  The fast-food chain owned by  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM)  is testing a
waffle rolled up like a taco in “a handful” of restaurants in
southern  California , Rob Poetsch, a company spokesman, said in
an e-mail.  “We’re pleased with the initial reaction from our
customers and if the Waffle Taco does well in testing, we’ll
roll it out to all our restaurants that serve breakfast,” he
said.  Taco Bell, long a favorite among the late-night party
crowd, has recently been trying to attract customers in the
morning. Last year, it started selling breakfast foods, such as
the A.M. Crunchwrap and Cinnabon-brand doughnut bites, in about
820 U.S. stores, pitting it against  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  -- the
leader among fast-food chains selling breakfast.  Yum Brands, which also owns Pizza Hut and KFC, rose 1.7
percent to $70.10 at 3:32 p.m. in  New York . The shares gained
3.8 percent this year through yesterday, while the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index increased 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
