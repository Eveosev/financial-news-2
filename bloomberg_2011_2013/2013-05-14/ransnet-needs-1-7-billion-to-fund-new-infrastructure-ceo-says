Transnet SOC Ltd.’s funding
requirements for fiscal 2014 will increase 12 percent as the
company invests in new infrastructure and equipment, Chief
Executive Officer Brian Molefe said today.  South Africa ’s state rail and ports operator will need 15.7
billion rand ($1.71 billion), compared with 14 billion rand
