The won rose the most in two weeks as
global funds bought South Korean shares after an unexpected
increase in U.S. retail sales bolstered investor appetite for
emerging-market assets.  Government bonds  rose.  The currency rebounded after a 2.3 percent decline over the
last three days, the longest run of losses since April 8. Sales
at U.S. retailers advanced 0.1 percent in April following a 0.5
percent drop in March, official figures showed yesterday in
 Washington , prompting speculation the  Federal Reserve  may end
its monthly purchases of $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
debt. Foreign funds  bought  more South Korean shares than they
sold, halting two days of net sales, stock exchange data show.  “The improved U.S. retail sales data showed signs of an
economic recovery,” said Son Eun Jeong, an analyst at Woori
Futures Co. in Seoul. “Speculation that the Fed’s quantitative
easing program will end is rising and may slow the won’s rise.”  The currency rose 0.5 percent to 1,106.44 per dollar in
Seoul, the biggest advance since April 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
fell 36 basis points, or 0.36 percentage point, to 8.26 percent,
the data show.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent government bonds
due March 2018 fell two basis points to 2.64 percent, according
to prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
