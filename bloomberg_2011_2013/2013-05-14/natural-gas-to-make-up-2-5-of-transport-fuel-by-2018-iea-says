Natural gas  will increase its share
of road transport fuels to 2.5 percent in 2018 from 1.4 percent
in 2010 as consumers look for cheaper, cleaner forms of
propulsion, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Further displacement of oil as the leading transport fuel
is being held back by the need for “substantial”
infrastructure, the IEA said in its medium-term oil-market
report, published today. Oil will account for 96.4 percent of
road-transport fuel in 2018 from 97.8 percent in 2010, the
Paris-based IEA said.  Natural-gas fuel infrastructure buildup “could begin to
happen in a big way over the forecast period, but regardless may
not bear fruit until later,” the IEA said in the report.
“While this infrastructure development could eventually pave
the way for substantial displacement of oil by natural gas in
the transport sector, truly meaningful fuel switching is not
expected to occur until after the end of the forecast period.”  The prospect of bountiful, cheap gas extracted from shale
rocks has led to renewed interest in using the fuel to power
vehicles. In the U.S., natural gas is selling at about one-fourth the cost of crude oil. At $94.83 a barrel, oil costs
about $15.81 per million British thermal units compared with
$3.97 for U.S. gas, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. energy policy makers should offer incentives to
convert trucks to run on natural gas to promote energy
independence, billionaire  T. Boone Pickens  said May 1. Pickens,
whose  Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (CLNE)  has 400 natural gas filling
stations, wants the federal government to offer incentives to
convert 8 million 18-wheeler long-haul trucks to run on natural
gas, raising money for the plan by selling some of the 700
million barrels of oil now in the U.S. strategic petroleum
reserve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
