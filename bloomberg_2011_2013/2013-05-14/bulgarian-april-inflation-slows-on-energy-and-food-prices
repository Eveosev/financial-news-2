Bulgarian inflation slowed in April
as energy and food prices remained stable and consumption shrank
on high unemployment.  The inflation rate fell to 2 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 2.7 percent in March, the National Statistics
Institute in Sofia said in a statement today. The median
estimate of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 2.6
percent. Consumer prices dropped 0.4 percent on the month.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession
without an international bailout. The interim government cut
this year’s economic growth forecast to 1 percent from 1.2
percent and forecast average inflation to slow to 1.8 percent
this year from 2.4 percent in 2012.  The European Union forecast on May 3 Bulgaria’s EU-harmonized inflation rate to fall to 2 percent this year and
rise to 2.6 percent in 2014 as consumption increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
