  Jollibee Foods Corp ., the nation’s
biggest fast-food company, fell the most in two weeks in Manila
trading on speculation a recent rally was excessive.  The stock sank 2.6 percent to 77.90 pesos at the 12 p.m.
close of trading, snapping a five-day, 8.8 percent rally that
pushed the share price yesterday above its 30-day moving average.  “Jollibee has gone up sharply, making it ripe for
investors to sell the stock and make short-term gains,” said
James Lago, an analyst at Manila-based PCCI Securities Brokers
Corp. “The stock is also overvalued relative to the market.”  Jollibee trades at 25.4 times estimated earnings, compared
with the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index’s 12.5 times.
