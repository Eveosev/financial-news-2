The European Commission has told the
U.K. government that tax rules designed to discourage people
from avoiding U.K. tax obligations by moving money abroad are
“discriminatory” and “disproportionate” and don’t follow
European Union regulations on the free movement of capital, the
London-based Times  reported , citing the European Commission.  U.K. revenue officials must reply within two months or the
Commission may take the case to the  European Court  of Justice,
the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
