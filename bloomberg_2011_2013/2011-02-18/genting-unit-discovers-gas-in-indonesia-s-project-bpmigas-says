  Genting Bhd .’s exploration unit
discovered natural gas in the Kasuri block in the Indonesian
province of West Papua, said Elan Biantoro, a spokesman at
Indonesia’s oil and gas regulator BPMigas.  Genting Oil & Gas Ltd. found the gas at the Asap-1X
exploration well with a potential flow rate of 100 million cubic
feet a day, Biantoro said by phone from Jakarta today. The
discovery was earlier reported by Upstream publication.  “We hope the discovery will help us increase gas
production to meet increasing domestic demand,” Biantoro said.
The Kuala Lumpur-based company completed the drilling test at
three layers of the block on Jan. 28, he said.  Genting Oil , which has four oil and gas projects in  Indonesia , won rights from the Indonesian government to explore
the Kasuri block in May 2008. It also operates in China and  Morocco , according to information on the parent’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
