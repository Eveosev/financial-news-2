OAO MRSK Holding, which manages
Russia’s interregional power distributors, fell by its most in
three months after Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin   pledged to cap 
electricity-price increases at 15 percent this year.  The stock slumped as much as 6.4 percent and last traded
3.7 percent lower at 4.89 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in
Moscow, its biggest decline since Nov. 11. Putin made the
comments during a cabinet meeting yesterday.  “This is a populist move in an election year and is
damaging for names like MRSK,” Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist
at  Renaissance Capital , said by phone.  OAO RusHydro, Russia’s biggest renewable energy company,
dropped 2.3 percent to 1.46 rubles, its biggest loss since Jan.
