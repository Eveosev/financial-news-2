Russia’s agricultural products
safety service Rosselkhoznadzor can’t prevent African swine
fever spreading from the country’s southern regions to the
north,  Itar-Tass  reported, citing Deputy Chief Nikolai Vlasov.  The infection is advancing at a rate of 350 kilometers (217
miles) a year, Vlasov said. The service is taking preventive
measures and still can’t control the expansion as there’s no
vaccine, Vlasov said, according to Itar-Tass.  The virus is present persistently in the Southern and
North-Caucasian federal districts, Vlasov said. The latest
outbreaks were registered in the Rostov region on Feb. 10 and in
the Nizhny Novgorod region today, according to Vlasov and data
on the Rosselkhoznadzor  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
