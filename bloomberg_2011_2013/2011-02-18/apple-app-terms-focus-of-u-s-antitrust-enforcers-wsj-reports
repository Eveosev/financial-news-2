  Apple Inc .’s newly released terms
for media companies that want to sell content on the technology
company’s iPad and other devices has raised the interest of U.S.
antitrust enforcers, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  The U.S. Justice Dept. and Federal Trade Commission are
looking into the issue and a spokeswoman the newspaper didn’t
identify said the European Commission is “carefully
monitoring” the situation.  The U.S. agencies are examining whether Apple is violating
antitrust laws by requiring media companies to use its iTunes
store for payment by consumers and taking a 30 percent cut, the
Journal said.  Apple declined to comment on the story, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
