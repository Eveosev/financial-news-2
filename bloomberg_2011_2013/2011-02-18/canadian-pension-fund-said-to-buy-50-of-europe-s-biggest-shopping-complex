  Canada  Pension Plan Investment Board
agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in  Europe ’s largest retail
complex, CentrO near Dusseldorf,  Germany , for about 700 million
euros ($949 million), according to three people with knowledge
of the transaction.  Canada’s second-largest public pension manager signed a
contract to purchase the stake from British billionaire property
developer Eddie Healey, according to the three people, who asked
not to be identified because the transaction is private.  Healey’s agent didn’t return three telephone calls seeking
comment, while Toronto-based CPPIB declined to comment.  CentrO, located in Oberhausen about 30 kilometers (19
miles) northeast of Dusseldorf, has 72,300 square meters
(780,000 square feet) of space with more than 200 shops. It
opened in 1996 and work started in January on an 18-month
expansion program. Apple Inc., which opened an outlet there in
September, is among the tenants.  The 83-hectare (205-acre) site has an aquarium, a
recreation park, a marina, parking for 14,000 cars, a 12,000-
seat arena, a hotel, a theater exhibition center and a  business
park , according to CentrO’s  website . It attracts about 20
million visitors each year.  German retail properties will probably be the most popular
type of real estate in Europe for international investors this
year, according to a survey last month by Inrev. The country’s
export-led economic recovery is boosting employment and giving
consumers greater confidence.  Big Malls  Investors are favoring large, dominant malls where retail
sales exceed national averages and help generate secure rental
income that supports property values. Retail-related real estate
deals rose by 59 percent in Europe last year to $33 billion,
according to data compiled by New York-based  Real Capital
Analytics Inc .  The Canadian pension fund, which started investing in real
estate in 2005, said this month that it owned properties worth
C$9.2 billion, or 6.6 percent of its assets, at the end of 2010.  CPPIB acquired a 25 percent stake in the Westfield
Stratford City mall next to the site of the 2012 Olympics in
east London in November for about 436 million pounds ($700
million). In the same month, it joined  LaSalle Investment
Management  in acquiring a mall in the German city of Huerth,
near Cologne, for 157.3 million euros.  CentrO is the most valuable asset owned by Healey, who made
his fortune developing a derelict industrial site on the
outskirts of Sheffield,  England , into the Meadowhall mall. He
sold this in 1999 to British Land Co. in a deal that valued the
property at 1.17 billion pounds.  Last April, the Sunday Times estimated that the combined
fortune of Healey and his brother Malcolm at 1.35 billion
pounds, making them the U.K.’s 27th wealthiest residents.  Healey and investment partner Peninsular & Oriental Steam
Navigation Co. acquired the CentrO site in Oberhausen in 1991
and spent about 1.2 billion euros developing it. P&O sold its
remaining stake in the development in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
