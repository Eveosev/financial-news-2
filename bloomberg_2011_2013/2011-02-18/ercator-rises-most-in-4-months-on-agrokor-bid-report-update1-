  Mercator Poslovni Sistem  d.d., the
biggest retailer in the Balkans, rose the most in four months on
a report that Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s largest privately held
company, is preparing a hostile takeover bid.  Shares of Mercator rose 4.4. percent to 167 euros at 11:53
a.m. in Ljubljana, the biggest gain since Oct. 13, giving the
company a market value of 629 million euros ($852 million).
Mercator is the best performer this year on Slovenia’s six-
member SBITOP benchmark index.  Agrokor, based in the Croatian capital Zagreb, will offer
to acquire a 23.3 percent stake that’s being sold by Slovenia’s
Pivovarna Lasko Group d.d., with the aim of increasing the
holding to 50 percent later, the Slovenian newspaper Dnevnik
reported today.  “A hostile bid will be difficult to carry out and without
the blessing of politicians it probably won’t go through,”
Radivoj Pregelj, an analyst at Ljubljana-based Abanka Vipa d.d.,
said by phone today. “Current shareholders have their hands
tied, since Pivovarna needs to sell its stake and other
investors, especially banks, are probably ready to sell.”  Agrokor, which has tried to acquire Mercator in the past,
will apply to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development for help in funding the bid, according to Dnevnik.  To contact the reporter on this story:
