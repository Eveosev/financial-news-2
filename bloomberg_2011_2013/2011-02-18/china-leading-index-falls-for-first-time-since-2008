A leading economic index for  China  fell for the first time since 2008, The Conference
Board, a New York-based research organization, said on its
website today.  The measure declined 0.5 percent to 154.3 in December
from November, according to the statement.  It’s “too early to tell” if the world’s second-biggest
economy will have an economic slowdown, Jing Sima, an
economist for The Conference Board, said. “While the
construction and consumer sectors are weakening, growth in
the industrial sector remains strong.”  The world’s fastest-growing major economy expanded 9.8
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The threat
of asset bubbles and accelerating inflation have prompted the
government to raise  interest rates  and crack down on property
speculation in cities including Beijing.  While The Conference Board only began publishing the
index last year, it has plotted the data series back to 1986.  To contact the reporter on this story:
