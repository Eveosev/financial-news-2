Kenya’s parliament rejected
President  Mwai Kibaki ’s nomination of four people to head
judicial and budget offices in the country as unconstitutional,
the Daily Nation reported, citing Speaker Kenneth Marende.  Kibaki should work with Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  on a
new list of nominees for the posts of attorney general, chief
justice, director of public prosecutions and budget controller,
the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  Odinga last month objected to Kibaki’s nomination of the
four people, citing a lack of consultation as required
by law. The two men agreed to share power after violence in East
Africa’s largest economy following a disputed election in
December 2007 left 1,500 people dead.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
