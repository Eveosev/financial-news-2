Enbridge Energy Partners plans to
expand the capacity of a pipeline system transporting crude from  North Dakota  to  Minnesota  by 15 percent as production increases
at the Bakken Shale formation.  “The expansion involves an optimization of existing
facilities and services” at a cost of $7 million and is
expected to be ready in the first quarter, according to a
company statement. The line will have a total capacity of
185,000 barrels a day after the 23,500-barrel expansion,
Enbridge said.  North Dakota crude output jumped 83 percent to 329,000
barrels a day in August from two years earlier, according to the
U.S. Energy Department.  Enbridge’s North Dakota system transports crude for the
Bakken Shale formation from near Minot to Clearbrook, Minnesota.  The expansion “will enable us to be responsive to our
shippers’ needs for an immediate increase in the takeaway
capacity serving growing production from the Bakken formation,”
Stephen J. Wuori, president of the Houston-based company’s
liquids pipelines unit, said in the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
