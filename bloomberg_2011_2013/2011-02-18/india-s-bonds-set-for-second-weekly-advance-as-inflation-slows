  India ’s 11-year bonds, the most-
traded government debt, headed for a second weekly advance on
optimism slowing inflation will spur demand.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products including lentils, rice and vegetables rose 11.05
percent in the week ended Feb. 5 from a year earlier, the
commerce ministry said in a statement yesterday. The index
gained 13.07 percent the previous week. The government has
borrowed 4.16 trillion rupees ($92 billion) in the fiscal year
that started in April.  “The cooling of inflation is helping investors to add to
their portfolios,” said Amitabh Anand, a Mumbai-based fixed-
income trader at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “So far, there
is no indication the government will borrow more this year and
that’s also a positive.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022 fell
seven basis points this week to 8.14 percent as of 10:32 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
was little changed this week at 7.47 percent. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
