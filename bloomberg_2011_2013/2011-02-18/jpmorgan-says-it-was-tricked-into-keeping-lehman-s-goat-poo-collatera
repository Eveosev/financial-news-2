Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
tricked  JPMorgan Chase & Co . into holding onto collateral that
the bankrupt investment firm internally described as “goat poo,”
according to a court filing by JPMorgan.  JPMorgan was stuck with Lehman’s worst securities backing
$25 billion of loans as Lehman was sold to  Barclays Plc  in
September 2008, JPMorgan said in its filing yesterday in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. Lehman described the collateral
as “toxic crap” and “goat poo” to be scattered “in other
people’s backyards,” JPMorgan said.  “Only later was JPMorgan able to determine that the
position in which it unexpectedly found itself was the result of
collusion and deception” by Lehman and Barclays, JPMorgan said.  The accusations appeared in amended counterclaims against
Lehman in its lawsuit against JPMorgan. Both companies are based
in New York.  Lehman accuses JPMorgan of siphoning billions of dollars
from Lehman, leading to it collapse in September 2008. London-
based Barclays bought Lehman’s broker-dealer unit after Lehman’s
bankruptcy filing.  Kimberly Macleod, a spokeswoman for Lehman, and Mark Lane,
a spokesman for Barclays, both declined to comment.  The case is  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc . v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
