Eleven candidates vying for  Benin â€™s
presidency in an election planned for March 6 want a second
delay in the vote, Office de Radiodiffusion et Television
reported, citing Victor Topanou, a candidate and spokesman for
the group.  The contestants say 1.3 million people have not yet been
registered to vote, according to the Cotonou-based broadcaster.
The election was initially planned for Feb. 27, before it was
delayed due to issues with the registration, Candide Azannai,
government spokesman, said Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
