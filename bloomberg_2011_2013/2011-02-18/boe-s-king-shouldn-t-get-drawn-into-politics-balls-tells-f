  Ed Balls , Treasury spokesman for the
U.K.’s opposition Labour Party, said Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  should avoid being “drawn into the political
arena” and not associate himself “too closely” with the
coalition government’s “extreme” deficit-reduction plans in
order to avoid tarnishing the Bank of England’s reputation, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  Balls said King and the monetary policy committee have been
right to keep  interest rates  at 0.5 percent, and while a double-
dip recession was a possibility, it was “not the most likely
outcome,” the Financial Times said.  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is making the
“fatal error” of allowing political objectives to determine
economic policy and should slow down the pace and scale of the
austerity program to address the faltering economy and rising
jobless figures, Balls said in the interview.  While any deficit-reduction plan would depend on economic
conditions, “if we were in government we would be halving the
deficit over four years,” he said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
