  Intel Corp ., during a visit by
President  Barack Obama , announced plans to build a $5 billion
microprocessor plant in  Arizona  and hire 4,000 employees in the
U.S. this year.  The workers will focus on product development, research and
design, Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini said, as he showed
Obama around an Intel plant near Portland, Oregon. The new
factory will be built at the company’s existing site in
Chandler, Arizona.  Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is expanding its
factory network to meet increasing demand for chips. The company
said last month that it would spend $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion
on plants and equipment this year, compared with $5.2 billion in
2010. Revenue may rise 14 percent to $49.5 billion this year,
the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company, which does manufacturing in Oregon,  New Mexico 
and Arizona in the U.S. and Ireland, Israel and China
internationally, has called on the government for tax breaks to
make it cheaper to build facilities in the U.S.  Intel makes three-quarters of its products in the U.S. and
gets three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, the company
said. The new factory in Chandler will produce chips using so-
called 14-nanometer production.  Nanometers, billionths of a meter, are used to measure the
width of the microscopic circuits that make up chips. Shrinking
those circuits makes chips more powerful or cheaper to produce.  Intel rose 17 cents to $22.14 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have climbed 5.3 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
