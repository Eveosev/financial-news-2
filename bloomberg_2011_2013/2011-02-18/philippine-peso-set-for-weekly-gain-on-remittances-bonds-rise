The Philippine peso headed for its
biggest weekly gain in five months after a report this week
showed money sent home by citizens living abroad climbed to a
record last year.  Remittances from Filipinos living abroad increased 8.1
percent from a year earlier to $1.69 billion in December and
totaled an unprecedented $18.8 billion in 2010, the central bank
said on Feb. 15. Benchmark three-year bonds rose, snapping a
four-day drop, after Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said
yesterday the government is ahead of its revenue target this
year on rising tax collection and dividends from state agencies.  “Remittance flows provide support to our balance-of-
payments position,” said Lito Biacora, vice president for
treasury at Bank of the Philippine Islands in  Manila .
“That is providing support to the strength of the Philippine
peso.”  The peso rose 1 percent this week and 0.1 percent today to
43.377 per dollar as of 9:55 a.m. in Manila, according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency is headed for its biggest
weekly gain since the five-day period ended Sept. 10, when it
rose 1.4 percent.  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 dropped
10 basis points to 5.40 percent today, according to Tradition
Financial Services. The yield was unchanged for the week. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter for this story:
