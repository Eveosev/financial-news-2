Ghana ’s current account deficit
widened 62.5 percent last year as imports soared, Bank of  Ghana 
Governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur said.  The shortfall expanded to $2.6 billion, with imports rising
33 percent to $10.7 billion, Amissah-Arthur told reporters in
the capital, Accra, today.  In November, the Ghana Statistical Service revised up its
calculation of the West African nation’s gross domestic product
last year by 75 percent, after changing the way it measures
sectors of the economy. The economy grew 6.6 percent in 2010
based on the new data, the statistical agency said.  “The data shows the current account deficit remains high
at an estimated 8.5 percent of GDP from our estimate of 19
percent of GDP using pre-rebase data,”  Razia Khan , London-based
head of Africa research at Standard Chartered Plc, said in an e-
mailed comment today. “It highlights how a surge in the price
of imported oil would still be a great concern to the West
African nation.”  The oil-imports bill rose 36 percent to $2 billion last
year, Amissah-Arthur said.  The country’s exports grew 35 percent to $7.9 billion,
buoyed by cocoa and gold shipments. Cocoa-bean exports grew 16
percent to $2.2 billion, while gold sales rose 49 percent to
$3.8 billion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
