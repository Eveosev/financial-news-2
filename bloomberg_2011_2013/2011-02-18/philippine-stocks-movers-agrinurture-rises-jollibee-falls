Shares of the following companies
had unusual price changes in Philippine trading. Stock symbols
are in parentheses, and prices are as of the 12 p.m. close in
Manila.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index decreased 0.4 percent
to 3,851.24.    AgriNurture Inc . (ANI PM), a fruit and vegetable grower,
rose 3.3 percent to 8.44 pesos, the highest since Feb. 4. The
company plans to acquire the Philippine master franchise of
Tully’s Coffee, a stock exchange filing showed.    Jollibee Foods Corp . (JFC PM), the largest fast-food
company, sank 2.6 percent to 77.90 pesos, the most since Feb. 1.
It snapped a five-day, 8.8 percent rally that pushed the share
price yesterday above its 30-day moving average.  “Jollibee has gone up sharply, making it ripe for
investors to sell the stock and make short term gains,” said
James Lago, an analyst at Manila-based PCCI Securities Brokers
Corp. “The stock is also overvalued relative to the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
