U.S. fuel consumption edged higher
in January from a year earlier, as winter storms curbed demand
growth, according to the  American Petroleum Institute .  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, climbed 1.7 percent to 18.8 million barrels a day last
month, the second-lowest January total in 10 years, the
industry-funded group said today in a report.  “Total demand was up from the weak levels a year ago,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the Washington-based API, said
in a telephone interview. “Gasoline deliveries were weak
because of winter storms.”  Gasoline consumption increased 0.9 percent to 8.6 million
barrels a day in January from the same month last year, the
report showed.  Heating oil consumption surged 41 percent to 882,000
barrels a day, the report showed. It was the second-biggest one-
month gain since 1995, Felmy said.  “There was a big increase in heating-oil consumption
because of the cold weather,” Felmy said. “This has become a
relatively small market in recent years so big changes aren’t
that unusual.”  Total demand for distillate fuel, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, rose 9.6 percent to 4 million barrels a
day. Consumption of ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, climbed 3.2 percent to average 3.13 million barrels a
day, the report showed.  Jet-fuel use climbed 4.6 percent to an average 1.43 million
barrels a day last month, compared with the same period in 2010.  U.S. crude-oil production slipped 3.7 percent to an average
5.24 million barrels a day in January. Output in the lower 48
states increased 0.3 percent to 4.76 million barrels a day.
Alaskan production slipped 31 percent to 481,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
