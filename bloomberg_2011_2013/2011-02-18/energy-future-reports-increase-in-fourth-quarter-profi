Energy Future Holdings Corp., the  Texas  power company that was taken private in 2007 in the
largest buyout in history, said fourth-quarter profit rose 18
percent on gains from buying back debt at a discount.  Net income rose to $161 million compared with $137 million
a year earlier, the closely held company said in a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made public today.
Sales dropped 7.4 percent to $1.64 billion.  Net income included a gain of $417 million as the company
paid down debt and was able to borrow at a lower rate, Energy
Future said in a statement. The company bought back $6.9 billion
of debt in 2010 at a cost of $5 billion, according to today’s
filing. The company also reported a $218 million gain from
contracts used to hedge against interest rate changes.  Energy Future, based in  Dallas , has more than $20 billion
in debt coming due in 2014, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Total long-term debt fell $1 billion during
the quarter to $39.6 billion as of Dec. 31, according to the
filing.  Cash and cash equivalents for 2010 rose $373 million, or 32
percent, to $1.53 billion, excluding Oncor, its state-regulated
unit that owns  power lines .    Standard & Poor’s  cut its rating on the company to CCC+
from B- on Dec. 21, citing lower cash-flow expectations starting
in mid-2013 from a decrease in natural-gas prices and the
expiration of hedging contracts used to lock in commodity
prices. That will add to the “already immense challenge” of
financing debt due in October 2014, the ratings company said.  Energy Future, formerly known as TXU Corp., was sold to a
group led by KKR & Co. LP and TPG Capital in 2007, in a $45
billion transaction including $13 billion of assumed debt.  Energy Future’s units include the regulated entity Oncor,
TXU Energy, a retail electricity seller with more than 2 million
customers; and Luminant, which has more than 15,400 megawatts of
generation capacity in Texas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
