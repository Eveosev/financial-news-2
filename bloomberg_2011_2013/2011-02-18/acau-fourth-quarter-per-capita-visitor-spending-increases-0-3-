Macau’s fourth-quarter per-capita
visitor spending, not including gambling, increased 0.3 percent
from a year earlier to 1,812 patacas ($226), the Chinese city’s
Statistics and Census Service said.  Excluding shopping, spending dropped 21 percent to 866
patacas, according a statement posted on the agency’s website
yesterday. The amount spent on shopping gained 33 percent to 947
patacas. About half of visitors said they’d gambled.      To contact the editor responsible for this story:
