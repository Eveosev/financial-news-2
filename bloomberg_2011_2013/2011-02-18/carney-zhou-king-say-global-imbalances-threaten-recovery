Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
said global imbalances are re-emerging, threatening the economic
recovery.  “The imbalances and financial vulnerabilities that plagued
the global economy before the crisis have begun to re-emerge,”
Carney said in a paper for the Bank of France’s Financial
Stability Review that was published today.  “In the context of deficient global demand and
exceptionally low  interest rates  in many countries, one likely
result is excessively risky behavior in the financial sector,”
the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker wrote.  China Central Bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan and Bank of
England Governor  Mervyn King  echoed Carney’s comments in the
Review. King said officials must look beyond disputes on foreign
exchange to consider rules for controlling capital inflows.  “Over-concentration of foreign assets in one particular
currency may bring about undesired consequences,” Zhou wrote.
So in addition to improving regulation and rationalizing savings
allocation, the G-20 “should move forward in reforming the
international monetary system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
