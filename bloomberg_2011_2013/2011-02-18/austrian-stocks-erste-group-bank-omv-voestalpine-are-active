  Austria ’s benchmark ATX Index ended
little changed, falling less than 0.1 percent to 2,978.46 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Vienna. The measure rose 0.2 percent this
past week.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Austrian market. Symbols are in parentheses.    CA Immobilien Anlagen AG  (CAI AV) rose for the first time
in four days, adding 2.2 percent to 12.37 euros, after saying
that UniCredit Bank Austria AG holds 16.9 percent of the
Austrian real-estate company following a voluntary partial
takeover bid for as much as 29 percent.  OMV AG (OMV AV), central Europe’s largest oil company, lost
1.3 percent to 33.98 euros. OMV Petrom SA, Romania’s largest oil
company, has shut its Arpechim refinery. OMV owns OMV Petrom.    Voestalpine AG  (VOE AV) advanced for a third day this week,
gaining 1.8 percent to 33.80 euros, as Austria’s biggest
steelmaker increased its profit forecast for the 2011 fiscal
year for the second time in a month, citing the economic
recovery in Asia, South America and Europe.  The Linz-based company, led by Chief Executive Officer
Wolfgang Eder, predicted that earnings before interest and taxes
will rise to about 850 million euros ($1.16 billion) from 352
million euros a year earlier. That compares with the 888.8
million-euro average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
