Co-operative Group Ltd., a mutually
owned U.K. food retailer and financial company, is introducing
an ethical operating plan that it hopes will set new standards
for corporate responsibility on carbon reduction, fair trade and
community involvement, the Guardian reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Peter Marks.   In an interview with the newspaper, Marks said the group
plans to increase its involvement with schools, create 2,000
apprenticeships and spend 5 million pounds ($8 million) a year
on alleviating poverty around its stores and branches, the
newspaper said.  The credit crisis raised questions about the capitalist
model, and people want businesses they can trust, with a strong
sense of social responsibility, Marks told the Guardian.  The Co-op aims to cut its operational carbon emissions by
35 percent in the next six years and have 90 percent of its
primary commodities from the developing world certified as
Fairtrade by 2020, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
