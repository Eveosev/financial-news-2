The Czech koruna dropped to its
weakest in more than a month against the euro, heading for its
biggest weekly depreciation in 2 1/2 months.  The currency lost 0.7 percent to 24.479 per euro, its
weakest intraday level since Jan. 12. It has lost 1.1 percent so
far this week, poised for its biggest one-week retreat since the
five days ended Dec. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
