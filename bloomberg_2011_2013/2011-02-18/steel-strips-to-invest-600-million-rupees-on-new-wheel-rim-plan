  Steel Strips Wheels Ltd ., an Indian
auto-part maker, plans to invest about 600 million rupees ($13.3
million) to build a truck tire accessories plant.  The company will build the factory in the southern Indian
city of Chennai, Sanjeev Raghuvanshi, a company spokesman, wrote
in an e-mail. Steel Strips, based in the state of Punjab, will
borrow 400 million rupees, he said.  Steel Strips is adding capacity as rising trade in Asia’s
second-fastest growing major economy spurs road haulage.  Daimler
AG  yesterday said it will start selling 6 ton to 49 ton vehicles
under the BharatBenz brand to tap demand. Volvo AB and  Navistar
International Corp . have also formed local ventures.  Steel Strips will make 500,000 truck wheel rims in the new
plant raising its total capacity by 4 percent to 12.5 million
tons, Raghuvanshi said.  The company’s shares fell 7 percent to 275 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The benchmark Sensex index declined
1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
