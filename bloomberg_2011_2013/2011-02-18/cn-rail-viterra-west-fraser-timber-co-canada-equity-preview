Canadian stocks fell for a second
day as copper mining companies declined on concern surging  oil
prices  will curb economic growth, outweighing gains by energy
producers.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd., the country’s second-largest
publicly traded copper producer, sank 7.1 percent.  Suncor Energy
Inc ., Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer, advanced 1.1
percent, as oil in New York surged to the highest intraday level
in more than two years as intensifying violence in Libya
threatened to disrupt oil supplies.  Cenovus Energy Inc .,
Canada’s fifth-largest energy company, gained 2.9 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index declined 172.17
points, or 1.2 percent, to 13,950.94 at 1:30 in Toronto.  “If you look at the metals like copper, you can see it’s
going down because oil going up so much is not good for the
overall economy,” said Stephen Gauthier, who helps oversee
C$500 million ($499 million) as a money manager at Fin-XO
Securities in  Montreal .  The S&P/TSX rose 5 percent this year before today as
economic data and corporate earnings signaled the global
economic recovery is becoming more entrenched. The S&P/TSX fell
for the first time in five days on Feb. 18 on concern higher  interest rates  in China will curb demand for copper. A gauge of
diversified metals and mining shares in the Canadian equity
benchmark index fell 3.8 percent last week.  Oil advanced 6.1 percent to $91.45 a barrel in New York
after soldiers deserted Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s
government and diplomats resigned. U.S. and Canadian financial
markets were closed yesterday for holidays.  Energy Producers  Suncor Energy advanced 0.8 percent to C$44.63. Cenovus
gained 1.7 percent to C$37.12.  Copper for May delivery dropped 2.2 percent to $4.398 a
pound in  New York . First Quantum sank 7.1 percent to C$117.82.
Teck Resources Ltd. slipped 4.6 percent to C$51.82 after
touching C$51.47, the lowest intraday price since Nov. 30.  “Investors are taking a wait-and-see approach for copper
as they watch the emerging markets wrestle with inflation,”
said  Ian Nakamoto , director of research for MacDougall
MacDougall & MacTier Inc. in Toronto, which manages about $4
billion. “They want to see that they can bring down inflation
without bringing down the economy.”  Before today, the metal rose 36 percent in the past year as
the global economic recovery accelerated.    Bank of Nova Scotia , Canada’s third-largest lender by
assets, declined 2 percent to C$59.38, after the bank was cut to
“neutral” from “outperform” at Macquarie Group Ltd. The 12-
month price estimate is C$62.50.  Royal Bank of Canada , the
country’s largest lender by assets, dropped 1.1 percent to
C$56.49.  To contact the reporter on this story:
