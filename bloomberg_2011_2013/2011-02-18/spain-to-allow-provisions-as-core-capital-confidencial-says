Spain’s Finance Minister Elena Salgado will allow  Spain ’s savings banks to consider generic
provisions and preferred shares as core capital,  El Confidencial 
reported.  The decision, which will be set out today in a decree
outlining  capital requirements , will provoke protest from
publicly traded banks and other European countries as the
instruments have never been classed as core capital, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified people with access to the
text of the decree.  Salgado had previously said that new core capital
requirements set for Spanish banks this year would use the
definition of core capital set out in Basel III.
