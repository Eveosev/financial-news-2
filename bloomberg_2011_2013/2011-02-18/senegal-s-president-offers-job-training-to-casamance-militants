Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade
yesterday called for an “emergency plan” to offer job training
to militants who give up the fight for independence in the
southern Casamance province.  The program should focus on training militants for jobs on
public works projects, Wade told the Cabinet, according to the
e-mailed statement today.  The proposal came a day after the Dakar-based newspaper Le
Pop reported a request by separatists in Casamance for the  African Union  to organize a referendum on secession in the
province.  Militants in the rice-growing region, which is separated
from most of  Senegal  by the Gambia, have been fighting for
independence since 1982.  To contact the reporter on this story:
