Canadian automobile chiefs want
free-trade talks with  South Korea  and the European Union to be
halted and are urging the government to support the industry,
which is threatened by the strengthening dollar and competition
from lower-cost countries, the Globe & Mail reported.  The chief executive officers of the five carmakers with
Canadian assembly plants, along with  Magna International Inc .
CEO Don Walker, meet today with Industry Minister Tony Clement
to make the case for government financial support for plant
upgrades, the newspaper said.   They will give Clement a report by a competitiveness
working group of the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council, a
copy of which has been reviewed by the Globe & Mail.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
