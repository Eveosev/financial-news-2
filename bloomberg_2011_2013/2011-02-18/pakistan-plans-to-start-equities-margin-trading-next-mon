  Pakistan ’s Karachi Stock Exchange
will begin fund transaction from next month, after getting
approval from the regulator today.  “The  exchange  will hold a mock session tomorrow and we
will implement margin trading between March 1 and March 7,
after a government notification is issued,” said acting
managing director Haroon Askari in a phone interview today.
“The government approved the rules today.”  The board of the Karachi Stock Exchange proposed the
introduction of margin trading in a report to the commission
in July, and met with the regulator on Aug. 31.  The practice was abolished when price curbs were imposed
in 2008, following the index’s biggest slump in a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
