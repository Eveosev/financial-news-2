  Ghana ’s currency, the cedi,
depreciated against the  U.S. dollar  as a company in the
petroleum industry sold the local currency to repay a greenback-
denominated loan.  The cedi traded at 1.5 per dollar as of 1:27 p.m. in  Accra ,
the capital, from 1.4950 at 9 a.m., according to data from
Access Bank Ghana Ltd.  “Demand in the market for dollars is coming from one bank
whose client in the oil and gas sector needs to repay a letter
of credit,” said Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader with the
lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
