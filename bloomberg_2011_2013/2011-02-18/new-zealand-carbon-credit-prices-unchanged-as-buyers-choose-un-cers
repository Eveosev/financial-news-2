The spot price of emission credits
in  New Zealand ’s carbon market remained little changed last week
as buyers opted for contracts in the global United Nations-
backed market, Auckland-based broker OMFinancial Ltd. said.  Spot carbon credits traded at NZ$19.20 ($14.57) a metric
ton today, unchanged from a week earlier, the broker said today
in an e-mailed statement. That compares with 11.47 euros
($15.59) for UN Certified Emission Reduction credits on the ICE
Futures Europe Exchange in  London  yesterday.  New Zealand credit holders are waiting for spot prices to
rise, shunting buyers to the CER market, the broker said. Buyers
are also choosing CERs for forward contracts because the market
is more liquid and the price isn’t capped, the statement said.
New Zealand companies that emit  greenhouse gases  have the option
to pay a tax of NZ$25 a ton of emissions or buy the contracts.  “The attraction of buying the CER forwards even at a
premium is the fact they are very liquid, exchange traded, have
global interest and are not capped at NZ$25,” the statement
said. New Zealand credits will continue to trade in a tight
range in the short-term, with support at the lower level and CER
prices dictating the upper limit, the broker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
