(Corrects amount in headline.)  Olympic Properties SA, the state-run
agency that manages the venues built for the 2004  Athens 
Olympics, made a 32.9 million-euro ($45 million) loss in 2009,
compared with a 2.6 million-euro profit in 2008, according to
the company’s financial statement, published in  Kathimerini 
newspaper.  The loss was mostly due to a 48.5 million-euro provision
for “extraordinary risks.” Revenue increased to 37.2 million
euros from 34.1 million euros in 2008, according to the company
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
