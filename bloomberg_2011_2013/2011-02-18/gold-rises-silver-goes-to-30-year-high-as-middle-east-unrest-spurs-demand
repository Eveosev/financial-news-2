Gold rose, silver gained to a 30-
year high and palladium jumped to the highest price in almost 10
years on demand for precious metals to hedge against declines in
other assets because of unrest in the Middle East.  At least five people have been killed since demonstrations
against Bahrain’s ruling Al Khalifa family began on Feb. 14.
Demonstrators in  Libya  yesterday demanded the government’s
overthrow. Gold bar and coin demand in the Middle East jumped 39
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to
World Gold Council figures released yesterday.  “If you see violence, you would buy gold expecting that
the domestics would buy gold,” said  Peter Fertig , owner of
Quantitative Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg,  Germany .  Gold for immediate delivery climbed $2.85, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,386.95 an ounce by 8:49 a.m. in London, bringing the gain
this week to 2.2 percent, the most since the last week of 2010.
Gold futures for April delivery climbed $2.20, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,387.30 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  Silver jumped as much as 0.6 percent to $31.9775 an ounce,
the highest since March 7, 1980, and palladium climbed 0.5
percent to $848.88 an ounce, the highest since Feb. 28, 2001.  The record for spot gold is $1,431.25 an ounce, set on
Dec. 7. The metal will probably climb to $1,440 in two or three
weeks, Fertig said.  Assets in gold-backed exchange traded products increased
3.5 tons to 2,019.92 tons yesterday, the first rise in three
days, data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show.
Holdings reached a record 2,114.6 tons in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
