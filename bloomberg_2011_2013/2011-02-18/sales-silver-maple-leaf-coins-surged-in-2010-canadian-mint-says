Sales of 1-ounce Maple Leaf silver
coins may have touched a record in 2010, according to the Royal
Canadian Mint.  About 10.3 million ounces were sold in 2009, and the mint
is “on pace” to surpass that level for 2010, Alex Reeves, the
agency’s communications manager, said yesterday. Last year’s
sales data will be released in late March, Reeves said.  “Demand has exceeded supply, and we are trying to be fair
to all our customers by putting caps on the size of the
orders,” Reeves said. “We are not going to sell all of our
silver to one distributor.” Reeves declined to comment on the
specifics of the caps.  Silver has almost doubled in the past 12 months, touching a
30-year high of $31.79 an ounce in  New York  this week. The  U.S.
Mint  sold 6.4 million ounces of silver in January, the highest
monthly total since sales began in 1986.  To contact the reporter on this story:
