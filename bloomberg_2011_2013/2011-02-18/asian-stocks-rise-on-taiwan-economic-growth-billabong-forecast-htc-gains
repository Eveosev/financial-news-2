Asian stocks rose, driving the
regional benchmark index toward its best week since Dec. 3, as  Taiwan  announced faster-than-estimated economic growth and
companies increased earnings forecasts.    HTC Corp ., a Taiwanese handset maker, gained 3 percent in
Taipei.  Billabong International Ltd ., the world’s biggest

percent in  Hong Kong  after saying premiums increased.  “Investors are feeling more bullish on the economic
outlook,” said Kazuhiro Takahashi, a general manager at Tokyo-
based Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent to 139.77 as
of 7:26 p.m. in Tokyo, with about twice as many stocks gaining
as declining. The gauge is headed for a 2.9 percent advance this
week, the most since the week ended Dec. 3, as reports showed
the U.S. economic recovery and corporate earnings are improving.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average and Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index were little changed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
gained 1.3 percent, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index
dropped 0.9 percent.  Taiwan Index Jumps    South Korea ’s Kospi Index and Taiwan’s Taiex Index both
jumped 1.8 percent, the biggest gains among benchmark indexes in
the Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan’s gross domestic product climbed

percent.  HTC advanced 3 percent to NT$993 in Taipei. Taiwan

sentiment ,” said Alan Ho, a  fund manager  at Union Securities
Investment Trust Co. in Taipei, who helps oversee the equivalent
of $1.36 billion.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.2
percent today. The index rose 0.3 percent yesterday in  New York 
to the highest level since June 2008 as improving corporate
earnings and manufacturing data overshadowed higher-than-
forecast consumer price inflation.  Kinki Nippon Tourist  Billabong gained 6.4 percent to A$8.51 in Sydney, the
biggest advance in  Australia ’s benchmark index. The company said
full-year sales may total A$1.7 billion ($1.7 billion), higher
than the A$1.57 billion average of four analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg in the past four weeks.  In Tokyo, Kinki Nippon Tourist surged by its upper daily
limit of 30 yen, or 33 percent, to 120 yen, the steepest gain

net income forecast by 12 percent.  Of the 466 companies in the MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index that
have reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 182
have exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 144 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Relative Valuations  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.1 percent this year

its life-insurance unit had accumulated written premiums of 25.4
billion yuan ($3.86 billion) in January, compared with 21.1
billion yuan a year earlier.  Chinese banks and developers advanced after the country’s
new home prices rose from a year earlier in all but two of the
70 cities monitored by the government, defying government
policies aimed at restraining inflation.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s
biggest lender, climbed 1.9 percent to HK$5.93 in Hong Kong and
