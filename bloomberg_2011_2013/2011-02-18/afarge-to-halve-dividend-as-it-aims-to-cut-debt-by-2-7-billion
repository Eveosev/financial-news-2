  Lafarge SA , the world’s biggest
cement maker, proposed a 50 percent cut to its dividend and
pledged to reduce debt by at least 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion)
this year to protect its investment-grade  credit rating .  Net income was 62 million euros in the fourth quarter, in
line with analysts’ estimates, compared with a 38 million-euro
loss a year earlier. Shareholders will be asked to approve a
dividend of 1 euro a share, the Paris-based company said in a
statement today. That’s below a Bloomberg forecast of 1.60 euros.  “2010 was a tough year for the building-material sector
and for Lafarge,” Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont said at
an analyst presentation. “While we are set for 2011 earnings
growth, we are ready to significantly reduce debt. An
investment-grade rating is the right profile for Lafarge.”  The CEO is stepping up asset sales and cutting costs and
investment in 2011 as a building slump in mature markets and
rising energy costs squeezed earnings. He now faces the risk of
a slowdown in parts of North Africa and the Middle East, the
group’s most profitable market, as Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s  threaten to downgrade the rating of the cement
maker to “junk” unless it strengthens its balance sheet.  Net debt held at 14 billion euros at the end of 2010, up 1
percent from a year earlier, the French company said. At the end
of last year, Lafarge had 3.8 billion euros in committed credit
lines with an average maturity of around 3 years, and 3.3
billion euros of cash on hand, it said.  Lafarge climbed 2.3 percent to 47.06 euros in Paris as of
9:45 a.m.  Slow Recovery  Lafarge today forecast that cement demand in its markets
will grow by 3 percent to 6 percent in 2011 as developed markets
“continue to slowly recover” and emerging economies remain the
main driver. Pricing “is expected to move higher,” it said.  The economic impact of the political turmoil in Egypt,
which represented 4 percent of the group’s revenue in 2010, is
limited, Lafont said on a conference call with journalists.
Lafarge cement sales in  Egypt , which were halted for seven days,
resumed on Feb. 5, and are “near pre-crisis levels,” the
company said in a statement today.  New capacities that Lafarge added in 2009 and 2010 will
generate 150 million euros in additional earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2011, Lafont
said on a conference call with journalists today.  To improve its  cash flow , Lafarge cut “structural costs”
by 220 million euros in 2010. The cement maker plans to reduce
costs by another 200 million euros in 2011 and to reduce capital
expenditure by 400 million euros.  Disposals, Venture  The company also said it will sell at least 750 million
euros of assets in 2011. Lafarge said it “secured” the sale
550 million euros of assets last year.  Lafarge and Anglo American Plc agreed today to combine
their cement, aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt and
contracting businesses in the U.K., creating a business with 1.8
billion pounds ($2.8 billion) in sales. Sales rose 9 percent in
the fourth quarter from a year earlier to 3.96 billion euros,
and current operating income climbed 7 percent, Lafarge said.
Like-for-like, sales were unchanged in the quarter and operating
income dropped 4 percent.  German rival HeidelbergCement AG, the world’s third-largest
maker of cement and concrete, said Feb. 10 fourth-quarter sales
and operating income rose 5.9 percent and 32 percent,
respectively. Cemex SAB, based in Mexico, said Feb. 3 that
fourth-quarter revenue rose 1.4 percent as sales gains in  Mexico 
and  South America  made up for drops in the U.S. and  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
