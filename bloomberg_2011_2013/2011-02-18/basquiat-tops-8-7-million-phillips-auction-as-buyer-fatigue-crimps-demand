A Jean-Michel Basquiat painting was
the most expensive lot at a London sale as dealers said demand
was tempered by caution and fatigue from a week of auctions.  Phillips de Pury & Co’s offering of 29 lots last night
raised 5.4 million pounds ($8.7 million), with the mixed-media
work by Basquiat accounting for 1.1 million pounds of the total.  “Considering everything, the sale was solid,” the New
York- and Sao Paulo-based private dealer Andrew Terner said.
“At the end of the week, people are tired. Phillips is a more
intimate, boutique salesroom.  Sotheby’s  and Christie’s
International are the machines that generate the big bucks.”  Auction prices for some contemporary works are rising, with
61.4 million pounds sold at Christie’s the evening before -- the
highest total in London since 2008 at the height of the boom.  Basquiat’s 1985 painting “Overrun” featured an urban
landscape covered in texts above a skull-like head. Offered by a
Swiss collector, it was bought by a European telephone bidder.
Its hammer-price estimate was 1 million pounds to 1.5 million
pounds.  The 2008 painting “Absence of God III: And His Tears of
Blood Will Drown the Cities of Men II,” by  Raqib Shaw  sold to a
phone buyer for 553,250 pounds. Though the price fell short of
the low estimate of 600,000 pounds, the seller, who had bought
the work from the  White Cube  in  London  within the last two
years, made a profit, said dealers.  Rudolf Stingel ’s 2002 aluminum foil “Untitled” was one of
six works from the Valencia Contemporary Art Collection. It sold
to the London-based adviser Hailey Ritcheson for 361,250 pounds,
against an estimate of 300,000 pounds to 500,000 pounds.  Marlene Dumas’s 1993 painting “Equality” was another
Valencia Collection entry, selling to a phone bid of 121,250
pounds against a top valuation of 120,000 pounds.  The auction’s low estimate was 5.7 million pounds, based on
hammer prices. Though the total was down on the 6.1 million
pounds raised last February, 83 percent of the works found
buyers.  “The market is even-keeled and somewhat rational,’’
Michael McGinnis, Phillips’s head of contemporary art, said
after the sale.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
