Thousands of supporters of Bolivia’s
biggest labor association marched toward the center of  La Paz 
today demanding a higher  minimum wage  after consumer prices in
the Andean nation accelerated.  The Bolivian Workers’ Center, which includes unions
representing miners and teachers, is holding a 24-hour strike in
the country’s biggest cities today.  Bolivian consumer prices accelerated 1.76 percent in
December from November, the biggest monthly jump since May 2008.
Finance Minister Luis Arce said Feb. 10 that the country may tap
its record $10 billion in reserves to boost agricultural
production and stockpile food staples.  To contact the reporter on this story:
