U.K. stocks fell, trimming the  FTSE
100 Index ’s weekly advance, as  China  took further steps to cool
its economy and Iran’s application to send two warships through
the Suez Canal increased tension in the Middle East.  Rio Tinto Group led mining companies lower after China, the
biggest consumer of base metals, raised reserve requirements for
lenders for the second time this year to counter inflation.  Rentokil Initial Plc  plunged 5.6 percent after posting an annual
loss.  Go-Ahead Group Plc ,  London ’s biggest bus operator, surged
7 percent after first-half profit rose.  The benchmark FTSE 100 slipped 4.4, or 0.1 percent, to
6,082.99 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, leaving it 0.3
percent higher this week. The gauge has advanced 3.1 percent
this year, extending its rally since March 2009 to 72 percent,
as investors bet that a stronger economic recovery will boost
corporate earnings. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also dropped 0.1
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 0.9 percent.  “It looks as if investors are using the ongoing unrest in
the Middle East as a reason to wind down some of their exposure
going into the weekend,” Ben Critchley, a sales trader at
London-based IG Index, wrote in e-mailed comments. “Equity
investors are giving more weight to the various geopolitical
tensions of the last few days.”  Suez Canal  U.K. stocks extended their losses earlier today as Egypt’s
Foreign Ministry confirmed it has received and is studying a
request from Iran for two military ships to pass through the
Suez Canal, a move that Israel says will be a “provocation.”
Egypt has approved the request, according to Egyptian state
television.    Rio Tinto , the world’s third-biggest mining company, slid
2.3 percent to 4,397 pence and  BHP Billiton Ltd . retreated 2.2
percent to 2,391 pence. Reserve ratios for China’s lenders will
increase half a percentage point starting Feb. 24, the People’s
Bank of China said on its website today.  Rentokil lost 5.6 percent to 92.5 pence, the lowest price
since Dec. 8. The world’s biggest pest-control company reported
a 23.4 million-pound ($38 million) net loss for 2010 after snow
in the U.K. hurt turnaround efforts at the City Link parcel-
delivery unit.  Go-Ahead climbed 7 percent to 1,408 pence, the highest
price since April 2010. The bus operator said first-half net
income rose to 36.5 million pounds from 3.1 million pounds a
year earlier.    Northumbrian Water Group Plc  gained 3.5 percent to 326.1
pence. The water supplier to about 4.4 million customers in the
U.K. advanced after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
recommendation to “buy” from “neutral,” saying E.ON AG’s
potential sale of U.K. regulated power assets may lead to
renewed focus on mergers and acquisitions in the water industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
