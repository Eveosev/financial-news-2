  Cenovus Energy Inc .,  Canada ’s fifth-
largest energy company, is considering partnerships to speed
development of its oil-sands projects, Chief Executive Officer
Brian Ferguson said.  Cenovus has been approached by “several interested
parties,” Ferguson said on an investor conference call today.
The company, which has undeveloped oil-sands assets in the  Alberta ’s Athabasca region, reported about 1.2 billion barrels
of proved bitumen reserves at the end of last year.  “We have a small team focused on strategic initiatives and
our target is to be able to complete one transaction in 2011,”
Ferguson said. He declined to name possible partners or give a
potential transaction size.  In 2010, China Petrochemical Corp. paid $4.65 billion to
buy a stake in Syncrude Canada Ltd. and Total SA paid $1.74
billion to buy into Suncor Energy Inc.’s oil-sands developments.
Oilsands Quest Inc. said last month it’s in discussions with
potential partners to develop assets in Alberta and
Saskatchewan.  Cenovus, based in Calgary, said today that fourth-quarter
profit fell 17 percent to C$140 million from C$169 million a
year earlier. The company spent C$706 million on  capital
investment  in the quarter, a 39 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
