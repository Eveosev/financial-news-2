  South Korea  will increase imports of
zero-tariff powdered milk and temporarily cut the rates on about
24 commodities including cheese and aluminum ingots to help ease
gains in domestic prices.  Tariff-free shipments of powdered milk will climb by 21,000
metric tons to 30,000 tons this year, the Ministry of Strategy
and Finance said in an e-mailed statement today. The country
imported 9,000 tons under zero duty last month, it said.  The government will next week complete details about
amounts and tariff rates for the 24 commodities, which will also
include butter, cotton threads, ferrosilicon and titanium
ingots, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
