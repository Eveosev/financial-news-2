German electricity for delivery next
year advanced to its highest in more than two weeks as rising
natural  gas prices  signaled more expensive generation costs for
utilities in  Europe ’s biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012, the regional benchmark contract,
increased 55 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 52.75 euros ($72.08),
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg at 5:43 p.m.
Berlin time. That’s the highest since Feb. 3. Baseload is
delivered around the clock.  The contract had its third weekly advance in four. It has
traded between 54.15 euros and 51.15 euros this year.  U.K. gas for the six months through September rose as much
as 0.9 percent to 52.4 pence a therm. A therm is 100,000 British
thermal units. The U.K. is Europe’s biggest market for gas,
influencing prices on the continent. Gas is used to generate
about 40 percent of power in the U.K. and 15 percent in  Germany .  Germany also produces electricity from coal, nuclear, wind
and solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
