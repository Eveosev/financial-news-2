Pakistan’s  Supreme Court  suspended
exploration at  Barrick Gold Corp . and  Antofagasta Plc ’s Reko Diq
copper and gold mine,  Diario Financiero  reported.  The exploration license, originally held by BHP Billiton
Ltd., expires this month and can’t be renewed until claims over
irregularities are investigated, the Santiago-based newspaper
said, citing Burhanul Islam, Pakistan’s ambassador in Chile. The
court may take a month to rule in the case, it reported.  “Our exploration license was expiring on Feb. 19 so we
have applied for the mining lease from the Baluchistan
government, and the Supreme Court didn’t bar us from doing
that,” Samia Ali Shah, a spokeswoman for Tethyan Copper Co.
Pakistan, the companies’ local joint venture for the project,
said by phone from Islamabad.  The next court hearing is on Feb. 26, Shah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
