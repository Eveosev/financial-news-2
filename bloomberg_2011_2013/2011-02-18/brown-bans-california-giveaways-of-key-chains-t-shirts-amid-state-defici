California Governor  Jerry Brown 
ordered state agencies to stop buying give-away items such as
key chains, coffee mugs, t-shirts and squeeze toys to help
eliminate a $25 billion  budget deficit .  The nation’s most indebted state spent $7.5 million on such
promotional and marketing items -- known as “swag,” for
“stuff we all get” -- from 2007 to 2010, Brown said in a
statement today.  “Not a cent of taxpayer money should be spent on
flashlights, ashtrays or other unnecessary items, most of which
likely end up in landfills,” Brown said. “Every taxpayer
dollar we save by cutting waste is a dollar that can be used to
pay for critical public-safety and social services.”  The 72-year-old Democrat has proposed $12.5 billion in
spending cuts to close a deficit projected at $25.4 billion
through June 2012. Brown ordered a statewide hiring freeze and
directed public workers to turn in half of the 96,000 state-paid
mobile phones. The governor also said he wants to trim  California ’s fleet of 13,600 vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
