  Standard Chartered  Private Equity
Ltd. will invest $83 million to take a stake in Wellard Group
Holdings, Australia’s biggest livestock exporter.  The private equity group, a unit of  Standard Chartered Plc ,
will invest in closely-held Wellard, based in Fremantle, Western
Australia, through a convertible note, according to a joint
 statement  e-mailed today.  Australia is one of the largest exporters of live sheep to
the Middle East and ships cattle to destinations including
Indonesia and  China . Wellard’s business also includes road
transport, feedlot and grain production operations.  The investment would provide increased exposure to demand
growth for meat and grain, particularly in the Middle East and
Asia, Standard Chartered Private Equity Global Head Alastair
Morrison said in the statement.  Australia is forecast to ship 2.8 million sheep this year,
down from 3 million in 2010, according to Sydney-based industry
group Meat & Livestock Australia. Cattle shipments are forecast
at 880,000 head, up 1 percent from a year earlier, the group
said in a report released this month.  Standard Chartered will become the second-largest
shareholder in Wellard after the notes convert, according to the
statement, The Balzarini family will remain the majority
shareholders, it said, without giving further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
