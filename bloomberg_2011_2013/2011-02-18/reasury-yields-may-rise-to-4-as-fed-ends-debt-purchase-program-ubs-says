Treasury 10-year yields may rise to
4 percent in the next two months on speculation an improving job
market will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to end its program of
debt purchases, according to UBS AG.  Employment reports for March and April will be crucial in
gauging the state of the U.S. labor market, said Atsushi Ito, a
senior rate strategist in Tokyo at  Switzerland ’s biggest bank.
If nonfarm payrolls rise by about 160,000, the pace of recovery
would be faster than projected by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
and convince the central bank to forego a third round of its so-
called quantitative-easing program, Ito said.  “That will prompt the Treasury market to price in the end
of QE2, with an added boost coming from the recent strong
economic data,” Ito said. “Yields will rise above the recent
high of 3.77 percent and target 4 percent,” he said.  The 10-year Treasury yielded 3.60 percent as of 9:52 a.m.
in Tokyo after rising from last year’s low of 2.33 percent set
on Oct. 8. The yield jumped almost a percentage point in the two
months after touching the low in October and climbed to 3.77
percent on Feb. 9. The last time the rate was above 4 percent
was April 5.  Fed policy makers pledged in November to buy $600 billion
of Treasuries through June to help cap borrowing costs in a
second round of quantitative easing, building on the $1.7
trillion first phase that ended in March 2010.  Japan’s Yields  Japanese bond yields will also rise following the advance
in U.S. rates, though gains will be limited due to increased
purchases by banks before the start of the fiscal year in April,
Ito said.  With lending stagnating and  interest rates  on loans
averaging about 1.2 percent, bonds yielding more than 1.4
percent will attract demand from banks, Ito said.  Given the  Bank of Japan  is unlikely to raise interest rates,
10-year yields will range between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent,
he said.  Japan’s 10-year yield fell to a seven-year low of 0.82
percent in October before climbing to a 10-month high of 1.35
percent on Feb. 9. The yield was 1.32 percent today.  Ten-year yields will end this year at 1.24 percent,
according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
financial companies with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
