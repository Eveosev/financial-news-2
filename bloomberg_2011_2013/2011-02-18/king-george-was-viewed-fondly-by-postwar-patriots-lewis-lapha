Once liberated from British rule,
many American Patriots felt they had less freedom than under
King George III.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Years before, these people had put aside self-interest to
join with their neighbors in mobilizing against their British
oppressors. They grew strong by forming coalitions across
social, geographical and religious lines.  Once the hostilities started in 1775, popular movements
helped convince people to share the costs of the war, distribute
and price goods fairly, and curb the influence of Loyalists.  Toward the end of the Revolutionary War, power began to
shift away from artisans, farmers and free laborers and toward
the moneyed classes. Self-interest was newly celebrated as a
duty, even a virtue, and once popular meetings, committees,
petitions and resolutions became emblematic of mob rule.  One aspect of the Patriot economy to be lost was the
capacity for people to decide the use and value of property
based on social purpose and human need, and not simply leave it
to market forces.  I spoke with Barbara Clark Smith, author of “ The Freedoms
We Lost : Consent and Resistance in Revolutionary America,” on
the following topics:  1. Consent in Law’s Execution  2. Crime & Punishment  3. Patriotism in Action  4. Loyalty to People  5. Freedom for Avarice  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .    Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
