German  government bonds  extended
declines and Euribor futures fell after European Central Bank
Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the bank may
need to raise  interest rates  as inflation pressures mount.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bund rose four basis
points to 3.23 percent as of 12:49 p.m. in London. The implied
yield on the December Euribor futures contract increased eight
basis points to 1.88 percent.  “As the economy gradually recovers and global inflationary
pressures arise, the degree of accommodation of monetary policy
has to be monitored and, if needed, corrected,” Bini Smaghi said
in an interview with daily newsletter Bloomberg Brief:
Economics. Commodity-price increases will “have an unavoidable
impact” and “it is a key challenge for monetary policy to
avoid spillovers,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
