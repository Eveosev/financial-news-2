The following table is an overview
of liquefied natural gas tankers scheduled to arrive in the
U.K.,  Belgium  and northwest  Europe .  The snapshot is compiled using AISLive data on Bloomberg
and information from port authorities. It includes spot and
multiyear-contract cargoes and may not capture all ships. Tanker
capacity is given in cubic meters of LNG, which is gas cooled to
a liquid for transport by tanker. Data on whether the ship is
loading for export or unloading is given if known.  The U.K. is Europe’s largest and most active gas market.
Interconnector (U.K.) Ltd. operates a two-way  pipeline  between
Zeebrugge, the location of Belgium’s only LNG terminal, and
Bacton, east  England .  To contact the reporters on this story:
