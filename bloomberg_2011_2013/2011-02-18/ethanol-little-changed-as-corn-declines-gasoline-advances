Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as corn declined and gasoline rose.  The grain-based additive was steady as corn slipped on
favorable weather for South American crops and as gasoline
climbed on concern that tensions in the Middle East may disrupt
fuel production. Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., is blended
with gasoline to augment supplies of the fuel.  “Corn has had a little less influence on ethanol this week
because of the energy markets,” said Terry Reilly, an analyst
at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “Any changes in
the ethanol market are coming from the energies.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 0.1 cent to
$2.504 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are 48
percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf climbed 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.525 a gallon, and on the West Coast
increased by 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.575, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  rose 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.575 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel added 0.5 cent to
$2.46.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 2.75 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $7.2025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel distills
into about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for March delivery advanced 2.36 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.5513 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 8 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 2 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
