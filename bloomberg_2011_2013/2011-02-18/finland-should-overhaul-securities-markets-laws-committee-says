A Finnish Finance Ministry committee
proposed that the Nordic country should overhaul its securities
markets legislation to allow indirect holding of assets,
bringing it in-line with the rest of the world.    Finland , Greece and Slovenia are the only European
countries to employ a direct holding system, according to the
Confederation of Finnish Industries. The new system would
establish an indirect holding system to boost competition and
cut costs, a working group at the Helsinki-based Ministry of
Finance said in a  report  today.  Under Finland’s current system, investors enter their
holdings in accounts held in a register maintained by Euroclear
Finland Oy. In the proposed indirect system, the accounts would
be held by banks and brokers, bolstering competitiveness and
diversifying the supply of financing.  “One of the benefits of the multi-tiered holding system is
that Finnish retail investors will be on a more equal footing
with foreign institutional investors,” Managing Director Piia- Noora Kauppi at the Federation of Finnish Financial Services
said in a statement “Finland should take up the indirect 
holding system without delay to ensure the competitiveness of 
the Finnish securities markets.”  The working group, which was tasked to design an overhaul
of securities markets legislation, also recommended extending
the right to use nominee registration of securities to domestic
investors, a right that’s already exists for foreign
shareholders.  Finland should reduce the number of interim reports
required of small listed companies to trim their administrative
burden, Deputy Managing Director Leena Linnainmaa at the Chamber
of Commerce said in a separate statement. Finland should also
ensure regulation doesn’t add to companies’ costs, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
