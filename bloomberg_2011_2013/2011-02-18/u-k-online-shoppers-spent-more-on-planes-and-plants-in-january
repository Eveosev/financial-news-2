U.K. consumers spent 5.1 billion
pounds ($8.2 billion) with Internet retailers in January, as
spending rebounded from a year earlier, according to a survey by
 Interactive Media in Retail Group  and  Capgemini.   Online travel spending gained 31 percent over January 2010,
with an average value of 886 pounds ($1,431), the most since the
survey started recording travel spend in December 2008. Spending
for the home and garden increased 56 percent to an average
basket value of 120 pounds, according to the report.  “We had a lot of negative news about the economy, a lot of
poor weather,” said Tina Spooner, spokeswoman for London-based
IMRG, said in a telephone interview. “They’re factors in
getting people to think about their holidays.”  Total online sales in the U.K. rose 21 percent over last
January, to about 83 pounds per person, according to the study.
January 2009 was the worst yearly start of the survey, which
began in April 2000.  Worst-performing categories last month were health and
beauty, where online spending fell 3 percent, and shoes, up only
4 percent, the report said.  The monthly report uses actual sales from 95 to 100 U.K.
retailers, and estimates for the rest of the market, according
to Spooner. Online-only retailers include  Asos Plc  and
Lastminute.com Ltd., and those with stores and websites such as  Tesco Plc ,  J Sainsbury Plc  and John Lewis Partnership Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
