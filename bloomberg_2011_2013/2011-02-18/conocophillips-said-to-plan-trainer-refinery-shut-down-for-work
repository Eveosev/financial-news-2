  ConocoPhillips  plans a plant-wide
shutdown to conduct maintenance at its Trainer refinery in
Pennsylvania in September, according to a person familiar with
refinery operations.  The work is expected to last from six to eight weeks, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  “ConocoPhillips does not provide or comment on turnaround
schedules in advance,” Rich Johnson, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mail.  The refinery can process 190,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
