Canadian natural gas for March
delivery rose as buyers stocked up before the President’s Day
holiday in the U.S. and temperatures were forecast to drop in
the Northeast.  Demand for heat in  New York  will be 39 percent above normal
Feb. 22, according to Belton, Missouri-based Weather
Derivatives. Temperatures will top out at 33 degrees Fahrenheit
(1 Celsius) that day, about 10 degrees below normal, State
College, Pennsylvania-based AccuWeather Inc. forecast. Markets
in the U.S. and Alberta, Canada’s biggest gas producer, will be
closed Feb. 21.  “We’re seeing some pre-weekend buying,” said Carl Neill,
an energy consultant for Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. Prices
are in a seasonal decline and a larger-than-forecast drop in
storage last week probably won’t cause them to rally, he said.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
rose 2.01 cents to $4.0453 on the  Intercontinental Exchange .
Alliance is an express line that can carry about 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  Alberta gas for March rose 3.5 cents to C$3.265 per
gigajoule ($3.14 per million British thermal units) as of 1:45
p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. Northeast, Midwest and West Coast.  British Columbia Border  Natural gas for March delivery rose 1.5 cents to $3.883 per
million Btu on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia prices fell for the first time in four days, dropping
2.68 cents to $3.809 per million Btu, according to ICE. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas fell 4.35 cents to $3.8482.  Volume on  TransCanada Corp. ’s  Alberta  system, the biggest
gas-gathering network in the nation was 16.4 billion cubic feet
at 1:30 p.m. Volume on the system decreased by 51 million cubic
feet in the past four hours.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.66 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.54 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system, which carries gas to the U.S. border at Eastport, Idaho,
was 939 million cubic feet. The system was forecast to carry
1.82 billion cubic feet today, about 66 percent of capacity.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.97
billion cubic feet at 12:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
