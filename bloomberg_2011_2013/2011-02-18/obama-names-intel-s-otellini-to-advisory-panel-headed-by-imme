U.S. President Barack Obama will
name Paul Otellini, the chief executive of  Intel Corp ., the
world’s largest semiconductor maker, to a presidential panel on
jobs and competitiveness, the White House said in a statement.  The panel of outside economic advisers, which is headed by  General Electric Co . chief executive officer Jeffrey Immelt, was
created by the president last month to find ways to encourage
hiring and boost U.S. economic competitiveness.  Obama will name Otellini to the panel today in Hillsboro,
Oregon, where the president is touring an Intel semiconductor
factory to promote science, math and technology education. Other
members of the panel will be announced in the coming weeks, the
administration statement said.  The competitiveness panel replaced one designed to advise
the administration on responding to the financial crisis that
was headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. The
new President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness meets
quarterly and is supported by Treasury Department staff.  Before traveling to Oregon, Obama last night met with
technology executives including  Apple Inc . Chief Executive
Officer Steve Jobs, Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg, and  Google Inc . Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt to discuss his
economic policies.  Obama has said innovation and exports can help lower the
nation’s 9 percent unemployment rate, and has cited the
technology industry as a driver for future growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
