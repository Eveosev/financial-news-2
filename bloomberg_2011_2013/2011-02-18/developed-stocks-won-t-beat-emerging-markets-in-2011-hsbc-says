Developed countries’ stocks won’t
continue to outperform emerging-market equities in 2011, because
the valuation of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has become too
attractive to pass up, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  The emerging markets gauge has fallen 2.8 percent in 2011,
while the  MSCI World  Index, of advanced country markets, has
rallied 6.2 percent so far this year. Developed-market stocks
have outperformed because they have attracted more new money,
HSBC’s Hong Kong-based equity strategist Garry Evans, said.  “We remain comfortable that EM will outperform DM during
2011,” Evans wrote in a report today. “While it is possible
that EM might continue to underperform for a little longer, it
is highly unlikely to do so for the year as a whole. We fail to
find a reason why the long-term structural outperformance of the
EM universe should not continue.”  In January, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research described
the practice of investors moving money into the worst-performing
developed nations as part of a global re-allocation of assets
that the brokerage dubbed the “Great Rotation.” The developed-
market MSCI World trades at 13.4 times the estimated earnings of
its companies, according to Bloomberg data. This compares with a
multiple of 11.4 times predicted profits for the MSCI Emerging
Markets index, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
