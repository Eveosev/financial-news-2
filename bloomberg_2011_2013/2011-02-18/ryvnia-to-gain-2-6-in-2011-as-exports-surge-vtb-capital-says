The hryvnia may gain about 2.6
percent by the end of the year as higher prices for the
country’s commodity exports and “strong capital inflows”
bolster the currency, VTB Capital said.  Ukraine’s currency will strengthen to 7.75 per dollar this
year, Alexey Moiseev and Dmitry Fedotkin, economists at VTB
Capital in Moscow, wrote in a research note e-mailed today.  The country’s main exports, including steel, surged almost
30 percent last year and make up about 50 percent of gross
domestic product. The eastern European nation’s economy expanded
4.2 percent in 2010 after a 14.8 percent slump in the previous
year, the state statistics committee said Feb. 15.  “The hryvnia appears to be firmly set in a situation when
both the incentives and the fundamentals point to a gradually
appreciating currency,” Moiseev and Fedotkin wrote. “Ukraine
has been benefiting from a surge in commodity prices, which
could result in the country’s posting a current-account surplus
in the first quarter” and next quarter.  The hryvnia strengthened 0.1 percent to 7.9554 per dollar
at 3:28 p.m. in Kiev, from 7.96 yesterday.  The hryvnia slumped almost 42 percent against the U.S
currency between September 2008 and December 2009, becoming the
world’s second-worst performer against the greenback that year
among the 127 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The currency has
added about 0.2 percent this year.  Ukraine’s central bank “has so far been extremely careful
not to let the hryvnia appreciate,” VTB Capital, the investment
banking unit of  Russia ’s second-biggest lender, said.  Conservative Policy  “It is concerned about a bubble potentially building up,
the economists wrote. “Another reason for this conservative
policy is the political might of the steel lobby, which is
obviously very sensitive to any loss of competitiveness as a
result of the currency appreciating.”  Ukraine’s “net debt inflows” may total between $4 billion
to $7 billion this year, VTB Capital estimates. Companies may
borrow $3.4 billion more in 2011 than they received last year,
according to the report.  Ukraine’s government raised $1.5 billion from a sale of
Eurobonds on Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
