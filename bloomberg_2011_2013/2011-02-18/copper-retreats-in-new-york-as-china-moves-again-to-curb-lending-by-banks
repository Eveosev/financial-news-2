Copper prices rose in  London  on
speculation that consumption in China, the world’s biggest metal
user, will remain robust.  China has boosted borrowing costs three times since mid-
October, partly to damp inflation, and copper has climbed 17
percent in the period. Today, the central bank raised reserve
ratios for lenders by half a percentage point, 10 days after an
interest-rate increase.  “China took measured steps as opposed to drastic
measures,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. “That led people to believe
the rally can continue.”  Copper for delivery in three months rose $55, or 0.6
percent, to $9,860 a metric ton ($4.47 a pound) at 6:55 p.m. on
the London Metal Exchange. On Feb. 15, the metal reached a
record $10,190. The price fell 1 percent this week.  “Raising the reserve-requirement ratio is not the same as
hiking  interest rates ,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “In past months, any price dip
following monetary tightening in China was short-lived. It
remains to be seen whether it’s different this time.”  Copper also gained as the dollar fell for the fourth
straight day against a basket of major currencies, boosting the
appeal of commodities as an alternative investment, McGhee said.  In  New York , copper futures for May delivery fell 0.1 cent
to $4.496 a pound on the Comex.  Tin, lead, nickel, zinc and aluminum rose in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
