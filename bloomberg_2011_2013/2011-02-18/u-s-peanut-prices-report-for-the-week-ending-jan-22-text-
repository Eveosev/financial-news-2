Statistical Methodology  Survey Procedures: Price and marketing information included in this report is 
provided the beginning of each week by first buyers of farmer stock peanuts. 
Each week, respondents are asked to report total pounds purchased 
(marketings) from farmers and total dollars paid, by type (Runners, Spanish, 
Valencias, and Virginias), for the previous week. The reported data are to 
include all qualities and grades and exclude peanuts used for seed. Data are 
collected by telephone, fax, and internet each week for the previous week. 
The peanut price survey is an enumeration of all known first buyers of farmer 
stock peanuts from growers. Every effort is made to obtain a report from all 
buyers.  Estimating Procedures: Since a complete report is not received from all 
buyers each week, the reported quantities purchased and total dollars paid 
for each type are expanded to account for non-response. These expanded data 
are then used to calculate the weighted average price for each type. 
Estimates of price and marketings are prepared by the Agricultural Statistics 
Board and reviewed for reasonableness with recent historic estimates and 
between the different peanut types.  Revision Policy: Price and marketing estimates for the prior three weeks are 
subject to revision based on late reports. At the end of the marketing year, 
all buyers will have an opportunity to update or provide any late data for 
any week during the marketing year. After this data is incorporated with 
previously reported data, revised weekly estimates will be published for the 
entire marketing year.  Reliability: The peanut price survey is subject to non-sampling errors such 
as omission, duplication, imputation for missing data, and mistakes in 
reporting, recording, and processing the data. These errors cannot be 
measured directly, but are minimized through rigid quality controls in the 
data collection process and a careful review of all reported data for 
consistency and reasonableness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
