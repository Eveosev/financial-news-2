Northern Rock Plc and U.K. Financial
Investments Ltd. are set to appoint  Morgan Stanley  to advise the
government on its options, including a possible sale of the
state-owned lender, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter.  Morgan Stanley won the role after Northern Rock and UKFI,
which manages the British government’s stakes in lenders, took
applications from about 20 other firms, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. A sale
isn’t imminent, the people said.  Officials at Northern Rock and Morgan Stanley declined to
comment. Sky News reported the details late yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
