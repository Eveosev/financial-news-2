A small town in the Australian state
of Victoria is changing its name from Speed to Speedkill for a
month in a bid to promote safe driving, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported, citing residents.  Speed, with a population of 45, lies 250 miles north of
Melbourne, and is named after a railway commissioner; its
residents decided to change the name to Speedkill for the month
of March after being approached by the Victoria Transport
Accident Commission, the newspaper said.  Local sheep farmer Phil Down said heâ€™d agreed to change his
name for the month to Phil Slow Down, the Telegraph cited him as
saying.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
