OAO Russneft plans to raise oil
output 14 percent to 14.7 million metric tons next year after
creditors made higher output a condition for restructuring debt,
RIA Novosti said, citing Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Gutseriev.  OAO Sberbank and Glencore International AG agreed to
restructure loans after Russneft pledged to raise output by
about 1 million tons a year, RIA said, citing Gutseriev in
Krasnoyarsk,  Russia . Russneft targets output of 13.6 million
tons this year, RIA said.  The bank and commodities trader agreed earlier this year to
lower loan rates to 9 percent from 12 percent and extend the
term of $6.2 billion of debt to 2020, RIA said. That will allow
Russneft to raise investments by $200 million a year, RIA said.  Russian billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov â€™s holding company
AFK Sistema, which owns 49 percent of Russneft, has said it may
seek to increase its stake when Russneft reduces debts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
