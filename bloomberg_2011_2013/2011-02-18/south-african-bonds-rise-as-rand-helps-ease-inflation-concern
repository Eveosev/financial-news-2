South African bonds rose, poised for
their biggest one-week jump in almost four months, after a rand
rebound over the past five days helped damp concern that
inflation may accelerate as global food and fuel prices rise.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rose for a
sixth day, adding 6 cents to 122.01 rand at 4:32 p.m. in
Johannesburg, taking its gain in the past week to 62 cents. A
close at that level would be the biggest one-week climb since
Oct. 29. The yield fell 2 basis points to 7.69 percent, for a
slide of 16 basis points in week. The rand added 0.5 percent
versus the dollar to 7.1673, taking its appreciation in five
days to 1.5 percent and snapping six weeks of declines.  Inflation in  Africa ’s biggest economy has remained within
the central bank’s target for 12 consecutive months, enabling
policy makers to lower the benchmark interest rate to a 30-year
low of 5.5 percent. A report this week showed consumer price
growth quickened to 3.7 percent in January, from 3.5 percent in
December, still within the 3 to 6 percent target.  “A moderation in inflation expectations on the back of the
stronger rand environment has boded well for domestic bonds and
remains a supporting factor for now,” Tradition Analytics
analysts led by Quinten Bertenshaw in Johannesburg, wrote in a
client note today.    South Africa ’s currency has slumped from best performer in
the two years through 2010 to this year’s worst among more than
20 emerging market counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. The rand
has lost 8 percent this year versus the dollar following a 42
percent surge between the start of 2009 and the end of 2010
helped contain inflation by reducing the rand costs of imports
including crude oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
