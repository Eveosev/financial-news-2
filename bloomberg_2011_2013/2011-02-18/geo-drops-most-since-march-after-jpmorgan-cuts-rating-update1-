Corp. Geo SAB fell the most since
March after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut the homebuilder’s rating,
citing its debt and revenue growth that missed estimates.  Geo tumbled 5.1 percent, the most since March 17, to 36.41
pesos at 4 p.m. New York time. The stock was cut to “neutral”
from ‘overweight’’ and assigned a 12-month price estimate of 43
pesos a share, JPMorgan analysts including Adrian Huerta wrote
in a research note.  “Leverage is quite high and could be a drag for future
growth,” Huerta said. “Credibility on earnings expectations is
lower now as earnings in the past two years have been weaker
than expected.”  Net sales rose 1 percent to 5.6 billion pesos ($465.5
million) in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the company
said in a statement to the Mexico stock exchange Feb. 16. Total
liabilities rose 10 percent to 21.6 billion pesos in 2010 from a
year earlier, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
