  Adani Enterprises Ltd ., India’s
biggest coal importer, and Australia’s Carbon Energy Ltd. plan
to partner in the South Asian nation to convert coal into a
cleaner-burning gas.  Adani and Carbon Energy have signed a memorandum of
understanding valid for 18 months to establish a joint venture
in India to pursue underground coal gasification, according to a
statement filed to the Australian Stock Exchange today.  The companies plan to submit a bid to establish a
underground coal gasification project at mines owned by  Coal
India Ltd ., it said. Coal India is the world’s largest producer
of the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
