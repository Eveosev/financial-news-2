Jim Edmonds, a four-time All-Star
and eight-time Gold Glove winner, announced his retirement after
a 17-year Major League Baseball career, saying he didn’t want to
risk permanent injuries.  Edmonds, a 40-year-old outfielder who signed a minor-league
deal with the  St. Louis  Cardinals two weeks ago, had surgery
last month to relieve pain in his left Achilles’ tendon. Team
doctors said they wouldn’t clear Edmonds to play and that they
couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t rupture the tendon, according to
a release on the team’s  website .  “As much as I regret this announcement, I feel that it is
for the best,” Edmonds said in the statement.  Edmonds finished as a career .284 hitter with 393 home runs
and 1,199 runs batted in. He won Gold Gloves for his defense
eight times in nine seasons from 1997 through 2005.  Edmonds spent eight seasons with St. Louis from 2000 to
2007, winning a  World Series  in 2006. He ranks fourth on the
team’s all-time home run list, with 241.  Edmonds started his major-league career with the California
Angels in 1993 and played with the franchise for seven years. He
also spent time with the San Diego Padres,  Chicago Cubs ,  Cincinnati Reds  and Milwaukee Brewers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
