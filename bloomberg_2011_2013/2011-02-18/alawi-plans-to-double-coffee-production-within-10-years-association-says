Malawi,  Africa ’s second-largest tea
producer, plans to more than double coffee output within the
next 10 years, according to the Coffee Association of Malawi.  Production of the beans may increase to between 4,000
metric tons and 5,000 tons from an expected 2,000 tons this year
as farmers plant more of the crop, Chairman Harrison Kalua said
in an interview late yesterday at a coffee conference in Arusha,
in northern  Tanzania .  Some small-scale farmers have started growing coffee in
addition to tobacco, which is their primary source of income, he
said. Coffee production in Malawi declined from a peak of 7,000
tons in 2000 because of an increase in fertilizer costs,
according to the Association.  Malawi is Africa’s largest tea producer after  Kenya .  To contact the reporter on this story:
