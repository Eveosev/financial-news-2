The cost of protecting U.S.
investment-grade corporate bonds from default using a credit-
default swaps index held near the lowest in 13 months.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 0.3 basis point to a mid-
price of 79.6 basis points as of 5:10 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, fell to a one-year low of
79 on Feb. 8 from as high as 101 on Nov. 30.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
