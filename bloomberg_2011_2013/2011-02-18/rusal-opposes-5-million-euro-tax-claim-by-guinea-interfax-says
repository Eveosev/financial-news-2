United Co. Rusal said a 5 million-
euro ($6.85 million) tax claim by Guinea’s Ministry of Economic
and Financial Control is without merit, Interfax said, citing a
company statement that the news agency said was distributed in  Guinea .  The aluminum producer said it pays taxes in accordance with
Guinean laws, according to Interfax. Two spokeswomen at Rusal’s
central office in Moscow didn’t immediately return calls for
comment from Bloomberg News, and a message left at the office in
Guinea wasn’t immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
