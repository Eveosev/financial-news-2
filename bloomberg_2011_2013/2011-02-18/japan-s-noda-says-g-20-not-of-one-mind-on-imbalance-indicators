Japan’s Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said while it’s possible for Group of 20 officials to agree
on economic indicators to monitor global imbalances, there’s
still disagreement on which data are appropriate to use.  If the G-20 can decide on which indicators to monitor,
“that would be big progress, and I think that’s possible,”
Noda told reporters today in Paris, where he is attending a
meeting of G-20 finance chiefs and central bankers.  European Union officials want the data to measure skewed
trade and financial flows to include the current-account balance,
public deficit and debt, savings ratio, net foreign assets,
reserve adequacy and the real effective  exchange rate , according
to an EU position paper.    China  and  Germany , the world’s two biggest exporters,
fended off U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner’s call in
October for current-account surpluses or deficits to be capped
at 4 percent of gross domestic product.  Noda said China and emerging market economies have “a
variety of opinions” on whether the real effective exchange
rate and foreign exchange reserves should be included in the
criteria. “I think that it’s possible to agree on some” of the
indicators, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
