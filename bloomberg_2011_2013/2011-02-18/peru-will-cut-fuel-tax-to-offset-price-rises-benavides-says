Peruvian Finance Minister Ismael Benavides said the government will cut a tax on fuel to offset
higher crude  oil prices .  “Fuel prices are not going to rise at the consumer level
because the government is going to reduce the tax,” Benavides
said in an interview with Lima-based Canal N late yesterday.  The South American country cut its  sales tax  last week to
18 percent from 19 percent after higher food and fuel costs
sparked the biggest rise in domestic consumer prices in 27
months in January.  Crude for March delivery increased $1, or 1.2 percent, to
$87.36 a barrel at 9:34 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Earlier, it touched $87.56. The contract, which
expires Feb. 22, has risen 2.1 percent this week. The more
active April contract gained $1.31, or 1.5 percent, to $90.15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
