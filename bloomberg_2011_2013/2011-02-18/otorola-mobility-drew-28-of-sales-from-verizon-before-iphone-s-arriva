Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.’s
sales to Verizon Wireless grew to 28 percent of revenue last
year, underscoring the carrier’s importance to the mobile-phone
maker as Verizon begins selling  Apple Inc .’s rival iPhone.  Motorola’s revenue from Verizon Wireless and parent Verizon
Communications Inc. increased from 17 percent in 2009 and 13
percent in 2008, the company said today in a regulatory filing.  Sprint Nextel Corp . accounted for 13 percent and 7 percent of
revenue in those two years.  “The loss of, or a significant reduction in revenue from,
one or more of these customers could have a negative impact on
our business,” the Libertyville, Illinois-based company said in
the filing.  Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, began
selling the iPhone this month, ending  AT&T Inc .’s exclusive hold
on the device in the U.S. The iPhone had already triggered
“some slowdown,” Sanjay Jha, Motorola’s chief executive
officer, told analysts on Jan. 26.  Jha is relying on the growing popularity of  Google Inc .’s
Android mobile-phone platform to sell more models of its phones
at Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Sprint.  Motorola Mobility rose 20 cents to $30.03 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
