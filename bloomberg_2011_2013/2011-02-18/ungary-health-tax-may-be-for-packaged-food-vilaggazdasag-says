Hungary may impose a tax of 10
forint (5 U.S. cents) per package of “unhealthy” food
containing “excessive” sugar, salt or fat,  Vilaggazdasag 
reported, citing a study which it said the Cabinet is using in
its planning.  The proposed levy, which previous reports referred to as a
“hamburger tax,” may be imposed only on packed goods and not
on fast food sold in restaurants, the newspaper said, citing the
Strategic Alliance for Hungarian Hospitals, an association whose
tax proposal forms the basis of the government plans, according
to Vilaggazdasag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
