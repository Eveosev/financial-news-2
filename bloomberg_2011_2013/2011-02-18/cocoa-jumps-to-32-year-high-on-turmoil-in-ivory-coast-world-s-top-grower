Cocoa futures jumped to a 32-year
high on mounting political unrest in  Ivory Coast , the world’s
largest producer.  The only way to resolve the Ivorian presidential-election
dispute is to organize protests similar to those that ousted
Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, according to the prime minister appointed
by  Alassane Ouattara , recognized internationally as the winner
of Ivory Coast’s Nov. 28 vote. Units of at least six
international banks closed this week amid security concerns.  “Things are starting to rumble up again,” said Drew
Geraghty, a commodity broker at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,
New Jersey. “People are afraid of the potential for increased
unrest.”  Cocoa for May delivery climbed $61, or 1.8 percent, to
settle at $3,499 a metric ton at 12:06 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price reached $3,511, the highest for
a most-active contract since February 1979. The commodity has
gained 25 percent since late November.  The price may rise to $4,000, said  Boyd Cruel , a senior
analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago. He didn’t give a
timeframe. The record high was $5,379 on July 18, 1977.  “We are getting a lot of buying interest,” Cruel said.  Ouattara pledged to extend a one-month ban on cocoa exports
should Laurent Gbagbo refuse to step down before Feb. 23, the
Financial Times said this week. The bid to cut off funds for
Gbagbo was imposed on Jan. 23.  In London, cocoa futures for March delivery advanced 36
pounds, or 1.6 percent, to 2,280 pounds ($3,702) a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
