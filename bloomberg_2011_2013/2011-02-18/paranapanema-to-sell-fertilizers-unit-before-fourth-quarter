  Paranapanema SA , the Brazilian
copper smelter that  Vale SA  tried to buy last year, said it’s
seeking to sell its fertilizers unit before the fourth quarter.  Paranapanema, based in Dias D’Avila,  Brazil , is working to
appoint advisers for the transaction, Chief Executive Officer
Luiz Antonio Ferraz Jr. said today in an interview, declining to
give details on a possible buyer. The deal is expected to be
closed before October, he said.  "The fertilizers market continues to be very interesting,
but for us it’s a question of focus," he said by telephone from
Salvador, in the northeast state of Bahia. Once advisers are
hired, "they will quickly start that work."  Fertilizers producers are snapping up assets and expanding
capacity as food needs from  China  and emerging markets grow. BHP
Billiton Ltd. made an unsuccessful $40 billion bid in August for
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer. Paranapanema controls  Cibrafertil , a unit
founded in 1994 to supply a type of fertilizer known as single
superphosphate. It sold 131,500 metric tons in the first nine
months of 2010.  Paranapanema said late yesterday that it will invest 630
million reais ($379 million) by 2013 to expand its capacity to
refine copper to 280,000 metric tons a year by 2014. Up to 80
percent of that investment will be financed by loans from banks
including Banco do Nordeste do Brasil SA and the national  development bank , known as BNDES, Ferraz said.  Paranapanema fell 5 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to 5.52 reais
in Sao Paulo trading at 2:51 p.m. New York time. The company has
declined 22 percent in the past twelve months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
