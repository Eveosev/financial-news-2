Business Secretary Vince Cable’s
plan to diversify Britain’s economy away from financial services
may be undermined by the lack of credit available to companies,
a panel of lawmakers said.  While the government has taken some steps to support
businesses, they don’t “add up to a comprehensive growth
strategy,” Parliament’s cross-party Business Committee said in
a report published today.  “Warm words and aspirations are not enough,” said Adrian Bailey, the opposition Labour Party lawmaker who chairs the
panel. “The banks’ role in providing finance to business is
crucial to the success of the economy.”  Two months of negotiations between the government and
banks, known as Project Merlin, concluded last week with  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc ,  HSBC Holdings Plc ,  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc ,  Barclays Plc  and Banco Santander U.K. agreeing to
make loans of about 190 billion pounds ($307 billion) to
companies to help bolster the economic recovery.  Lawmakers said the pledge will count for little if banks
continue to attach “onerous” terms and conditions or high
costs to credit.  “The agreement between the government and banks may look
like positive engagement, but the jury will remain out until it
delivers real benefits to industry,” Bailey said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
