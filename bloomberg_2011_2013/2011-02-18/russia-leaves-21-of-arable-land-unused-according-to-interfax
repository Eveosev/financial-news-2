Russian farms are leaving 20.7
million hectares (51 million acres) of arable land unused, or 21
percent of the national total, Interfax reported, citing  Russia ’s Grain Union.  Of that area, 37 percent has been out of use for more than
a decade and 53 percent for between 2 and 10 years, the news
agency today cited Arkady Zlochevsky, the union’s president, as
saying. He also said farms plan to expand arable land this year
by 800,000 hectares, down from 1.1 million hectares in 2010 and
1.6 million hectares in the prior year, according to Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
