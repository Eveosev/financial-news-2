A  KBR Inc . unit faces U.S.  Justice
Department  involvement in a whistleblower lawsuit filed by a
former corporate employee claiming the company illegally paid
federal money to a Turkish subcontractor.  The department, in a press statement issued today, said it
intervened in a 2007 lawsuit filed by former Kellogg Brown &
Root Services Inc. worker James A. Brady III challenging
payments the company made to a Turkish business while under
contract to the U.S. Army.  “Brady alleges that KBR violated the  False Claims Act 
because it was unable to account for materials paid for” under
its subcontract with the Turkish company, the U.S. said.  KBR is accused of violating the act in connection with
“Logcap III,” the third generation of the U.S. Army’s
Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, under which the company
provided support to U.S. troops in Iraq, Kuwait and  Afghanistan .  KBR Inc. is based in Houston. There was no immediate reply
to a request for comment submitted to the company’s media
relations department through its Web portal.  “We’ve decided to pursue the allegation that money that
was intended to support the troops was instead used to pay
claims that were false,” said Springfield,  Illinois , U.S.
Attorney Jim Lewis in the Justice Department statement.  Neither the Justice Department, nor Lewis’s office made a
copy of the federal complaint immediately available. The case is
pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of
Illinois.  To contact the reporter on this story:
