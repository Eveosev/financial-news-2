food company by market value, gained 20.55 naira, or the maximum
daily limit of 5 percent and its biggest advance in four months,
to 431.55 naira in Lagos. The close was the highest since at
least January 2002.  Full-year profit jumped 29 percent to 12.6 billion naira
($82 million), according to a statement e-mailed by the Nigerian
Stock Exchange.    Ireland Blyth Ltd . (IBL MP), the second-biggest diversified
company in Mauritius, advanced 0.5 rupees, or 0.7 percent, to
76.50 rupees, the highest in a week.  The company expects revenue to climb by 17 percent this
year to more than 16 billion rupees ($543 million) in the full-
year through June, Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Maigrot said.    Phoenix Beverages Ltd . (PBL MP), Mauritius’s largest brewer
and soft drinks maker, rose 2 rupees, or 0.9 percent, to 220
rupees in Port Louis, its highest level since at least 1995.  The stock may have rallied due to “the price readjustment
on its soft drinks following the surge in the sugar price at the
beginning of the year, which the bottler had yet to pass on to
clients,” Kishen Nadassen, a senior analyst at Port Louis-based
CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said by phone. The new prices came into
effect today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
