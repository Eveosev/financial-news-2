Red Electrica Corporacion SA expects
to complete the installation within a few months of a 240
kilometer (150-mile) electricity cable between the Spanish
mainland and the island of  Mallorca , Expansion reported.  The link, with a 400-megawatt capacity, will run along the
bottom of the Mediterranean sea as much as 1,485 meters below
the surface, making it the world’s second-deepest after the
power cable between Sardinia and the Italian mainland, the
report said, citing the Spanish power-grid operator.  The project, built by Italy’s Prysmian and Nexans of  Norway , is budgeted at 375 million euros ($509 million) and is
scheduled to enter operation in 2012, the report said. It’s part
of a 530 million-euro plan that includes a possible link from
Mallorca to Ibiza, an adjacent island in the Spanish Balearics,
Expansion said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
