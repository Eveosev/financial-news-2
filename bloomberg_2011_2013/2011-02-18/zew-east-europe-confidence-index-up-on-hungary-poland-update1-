Investor confidence in central and
eastern  Europe  rose in February on optimism about the outlook
for Hungary and Poland’s economies, the ZEW Center for European
Economic Research and Erste Group Bank AG.  The ZEW index of investor and analyst expectations rose 8.3
points to 24.5 points, according to a report e-mailed today.
Hungary’s index rose 11.1 points to 32.5 points while Poland’s
increased 11.9 points to 37.5 points.  “The improvement of the economic expectations for the
central and eastern Europe region on a six-month time horizon
can be mainly ascribed to the positive outlook for the economies
in Hungary and Poland,” the report said.  Economic expectations also rose for  Croatia , Czech Republic
Romania and Slovakia. Austria’s and  Turkey ’s country indexes
fell.  The ZEW index reflects the difference between the
percentage of analysts who have positive outlooks and those with
negative views. Ratings range from a maximum of 100 points to a
minimum of minus 100 points.  To contact the reporter for this story:
