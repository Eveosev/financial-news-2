  Access Bank Plc , a Nigerian lender,
said it suspended its operations in Ivory Coast, where a
disputed election in November led to an economic and political
crisis.  “The bank’s management will continue to monitor
developments in the hope that a return to stability allows the
resumptions of operations,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  At least 300 people have been killed in post-election
violence after incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  refused to
cede power to Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized
winner of the Nov. 28 vote.  At least five banks closed operations this week because of
security concerns in the country, the world’s biggest producer
of cocoa. Gbagbo yesterday ordered the seizure of “some” of
the banks that suspended operations, including units of  BNP
Paribas  SA and  Societe Generale  SA, according to a statement
read out on state-owned television.  Access lost 11 kobo, or 1.1 percent, to 10.11 naira, by the
2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. The
stock has gained 6.4 percent this year, compared with a 7.5
percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index over
the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
