Coffee production in Rwanda may
climb 10 percent this year, boosted by wider use of fertilizers
and as trees planted three years ago begin to yield, the  Rwanda 
Coffee Development Authority said.  Output may increase to 22,000 metric tons in the 12 months
through December, from 20,000 tons last year, Managing Director
Alex Kanyankole said at a regional coffee conference yesterday
in Arusha, northern Tanzania. Last year, production fell 17
percent after “bad weather” cut yields, he said.  “We are using more fertilizers and the new trees are coming
into production,” Kanyankole said. “The weather has so far been
favorable.”  Rwanda plans to boost coffee production to as much as
40,000 tons over the next five years through wider planting,
according to the authority’s website.  Starbucks Corp ., the
world’s largest coffee-shop chain, is the biggest buyer of the
country’s coffee.  The East African nation’s production in 2010 was 26 percent
lower than an initial forecast of 27,000 tons, according to the
authority. The country earned $56 million from last year’s
harvest, Kanyankole said.  Coffee in Rwanda, which produces the arabica variety, is
reaped from March to July. The country exports more than 98
percent of its crop in the form of green beans, the authority
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
