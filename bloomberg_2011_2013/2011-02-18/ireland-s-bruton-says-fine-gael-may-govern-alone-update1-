John Bruton, a former Irish Prime
Minister, said the country’s largest opposition party, Fine
Gael, may be able to form the next government alone after
elections next week.  “Fine Gael is edging closer and closer to single-party
government,” said Bruton in an interview in  Frankfurt 
yesterday. “It might be the best thing for the country.”  Fine Gael, which Bruton led until 2002, had 38 percent
support of the electorate, according to a poll conducted by
Millward Browne Lansdowne between Feb. 12 and Feb. 14. Ireland
will hold national elections on Feb. 25.  “In an economic crisis, when you need to make decisions
quickly, when you need internal coherence in what you’re doing
rather than compromises between differing approaches, single-
party government makes a lot of sense,” said Bruton.  “In normal times, in calmer times, coalition is obviously
more representative, it has a wider base. But at the present
time, I think it is arguable that it’s decision-making of a
reasonably rapid and coherent kind that’s required. That’s the
national requirement now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
