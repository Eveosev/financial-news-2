Gold may advance on speculation
accelerating costs will boost demand for the precious metal as a
hedge against inflation, a survey found.  Eleven of 15 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 73 percent, said the metal will rise next week.
Three predicted lower prices and one was neutral. Gold for April
delivery was up 1.5 percent for this week at $1,380.90 an ounce
at 10 a.m. yesterday on the Comex in  New York .  Consumer costs in the U.S. gained for a seventh straight
month in January and the U.K. consumer price index rose to a 26-
month high. Oil traded near the highest in two years, cotton
topped $2 a pound for the first time ever and copper rose to a
record this week.  “Rising commodity prices are the symptoms of a dollar
debasement strategy and in no way can bring down the rate of
inflation,” said  Michael Pento , a senior economist at Euro
Pacific Capital in New York.  The attached chart tracks the results of the Bloomberg
survey, with the red bars derived by subtracting bearish
forecasts from bullish estimates. Readings below zero signal
that most respondents expect a decline. The green line shows the
gold price. The data are as of Feb. 11.  The weekly gold survey that started six years ago has
forecast prices accurately in 199 of 350 weeks, or 57 percent of
the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 11 Bearish: 3 Neutral: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
