U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said today that cutting foreign aid to Afghanistan, as
some congressional Republicans have proposed, would be “a grave
mistake.”  “I certainly appreciate the tight budget environment we
find ourselves in. But the fact is that these civilian
operations are crucial to our national security,” Clinton said
in a speech at the Asia Society in  New York .  “Consider Iraq, where the transition to a civilian-led
mission is helping the Pentagon save $45 billion,” while the
State Department and the U.S. Agency for International
Development ask for “an increase of only $4 billion” to lead
operations in Iraq next year, she said. “That’s a good deal by
any standard. So we are working with Congress to ensure the
civilian surge in  Afghanistan  and Pakistan receives the support
it requires.”  In a nearly hour-long speech reviewing President Barack Obama’s policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Clinton stressed
that the transition from U.S. to Afghan-led security in
Afghanistan will “be formally launched next month, with troop
reductions starting in July and continuing based on conditions
on the ground. It will be completed by the end of 2014.”  Clinton named Marc Grossman, a former U.S. ambassador to
Turkey who served in Pakistan early in his career, as the new
special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, replacing
Richard C. Holbrooke, who died last December.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Mark Silva  at
