The European Union sugar market has
“tightened considerably” and companies are having difficulty
finding supplies of the sweetener, the  Association of the German
Confectionery Industry  said.  “Our companies have a supply problem with sugar,”
Managing Director Torben Erbrath said by phone from Bonn today.
The situation stems from changes to the European Union sugar
industry adopted in 2006, he said.  The EU changed its sugar policy to conform with a World
Trade Organization ruling, cutting production quotas to make the
27-nation bloc an importer.  Developing countries  have
preferential access to the EU because they pay no import tariffs
and as of 2015 will have no limits on the amount of shipments,
according to the  International Sugar Organization .  “The quota went down in  Europe  with the sugar regime in
2006 on expectation imports from least developed countries”
would increase, Erbrath said. “Imports didn’t increase in big
amounts, and that’s why we have a problem with supply.”  The association, also known as the BDSI, said it welcomes a
proposal by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, to
allow sales of so-called out-of-quota sugar in the bloc and
provide for more imports. The group speaks for companies
including  Alfred Ritter GmbH & Co. KG , the maker of Ritter Sport
chocolate bars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
