The following is the text of the
Electric Power Flash report from the U.S. Department of Energy:  In December 2010, the contiguous United States as a whole
experienced temperatures that were near normal.  However, there
was a significant contrast in temperatures across the country as
the western United States experienced above average temperatures,
while the more densely populated eastern part of the nation
experienced temperatures that were significantly below average.
Accordingly, the total population-weighted heating degree days
for the  United States  were 9.9 percent above the December normal.  Retail sales of electricity increased 2.9 percent from December
2009.  Over the same period, the average U.S. retail price of
electricity increased 1.3 percent.  For the 12-month period
ending December 2010, the average U.S. retail price of
electricity increased 0.6 percent over the previous 12-month
period ending December 2009.  Total electric power generation in the United States increased
3.1 percent compared to December 2009.  Over the same period,
coal generation increased 0.6 percent, while natural gas
generation increased 6.9 percent.  Petroleum liquids generation
had the largest percentage change, increasing 67.0 percent,
mainly due to the increased need for peaking generation due to
the significantly below average temperatures experienced in the
Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest.  Nuclear generation increased
4.2 percent compared to December 2009.  Consistent with the year-over-year increase in coal generation,
the consumption of coal to produce electricity increased 0.3
percent.  Over the same period, natural gas consumption
increased 7.8 percent, while petroleum liquids consumption
increased 71.6 percent when compared to December 2009.  Total coal stocks decreased 4.1 percent from the previous month.
Accordingly, the average number of days of burn for coal plants
consuming bituminous or subbituminous coal as their primary fuel
exhibited a slight decrease from the previous month.  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Energy
