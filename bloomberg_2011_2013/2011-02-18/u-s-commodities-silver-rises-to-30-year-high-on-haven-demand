Silver extended a rally to a 30-year
high, and gold climbed to a one-month peak as mounting unrest in
the Middle East spurred demand for precious metals as a haven.  Egypt approved a request from Iran to send two naval ships
through the  Suez Canal  on their way to  Syria , while  Israel 
called the passage a “provocation.” Bahrain’s security forces
attacked protesters for a second day. Gunfire broke out in
Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, as pro-democracy demonstrations spread
to Libya and  Iran .  “If you see violence, you would buy precious metals for a
safe haven,” said  Peter Fertig , the owner of Quantitative
Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg,  Germany .  In other markets, cocoa futures jumped to a 32-year high on
mounting political unrest in  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest
producer. Coffee also gained. The UBS Bloomberg Constant
Maturity Commodity Index was little changed at 1,714.49.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 72.6 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $32.296 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Earlier,
the price reached $32.87, the highest for a most-active contract
since March 1980. This week, the metal gained 7.7 percent, the
most since early December.  Gold futures for April delivery gained $3.50, or 0.3
percent, to $1,388.60 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached
$1,392.60, the highest since Jan. 13. The metal climbed 2
percent this week.  Cocoa  Cocoa for May delivery climbed $61, or 1.8 percent, to
settle at $3,499 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $3,511, the highest for a most-active
contract since February 1979. The commodity has gained 25
percent since late November.  The only way to resolve the Ivorian presidential-election
dispute is to organize protests similar to those that ousted  Egypt ’s Hosni Mubarak, according to the prime minister appointed
by  Alassane Ouattara , recognized internationally as the winner
of Ivory Coast’s Nov. 28 vote. Units of at least six
international banks closed this week amid security concerns.  “Things are starting to rumble up again,” said Drew
Geraghty, a commodity broker at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey . “People are afraid of the potential for increased
unrest.”  The price may rise to $4,000, said  Boyd Cruel , a senior
analyst at Vision Financial Markets in  Chicago . He didn’t give a
timeframe. The record high was $5,379 on July 18, 1977.  Coffee  Coffee extended a rally to the highest since 1997 on signs
that global demand will outstrip production as investors snapped
up shares of U.S. retailers including Starbucks Corp. in a bet
that sales will increase.    Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc ., the largest U.S.
seller of single-serve brewers, trades in New York at 295 times
cash flow, more than any company in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, according to Bloomberg data. Arabica-coffee futures have
doubled in the past year as adverse global weather slashed
supplies including in  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer.  “Demand is pretty strong,” said Thomas Mikulski, a senior
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “There are no
fresh developments on new crops, so that has left the market
focusing on current tight supplies.”  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery gained $4.15, or
1.5 percent, to $2.73 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the price reached
$2.759, the highest since May 1997.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
