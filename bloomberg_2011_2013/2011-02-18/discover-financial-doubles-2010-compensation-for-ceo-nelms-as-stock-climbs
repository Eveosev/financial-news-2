  Discover Financial Services  Chief
Executive Officer  David Nelms ’s 2010 compensation almost doubled
from a year earlier, matching the gain posted by shares of the
credit-card network last year.  Nelms, 50, was awarded $8.55 million in salary and stock
after receiving $4.38 million in 2009, according to a regulatory
filing today. His 2010 salary increased to $4.55 million from $1
million, and he received a $1.7 million cash bonus after not
receiving any the previous year. The 2010 package included $2.27
million in stock awards, down from
$3.33 million.  Discover posted a 1 percent decline in profit for 2010. The
Riverwoods, Illinois-based company was the last of the top six
U.S. credit-card issuers to repay federal bailout funds to the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, which came with curbs on
executive pay. Discover repaid $1.22 billion in TARP money on
April 21.  The stock fell 47 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $21.52 in 10:45
a.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares rose
26 percent during 2010, double the gain for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Stock Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
