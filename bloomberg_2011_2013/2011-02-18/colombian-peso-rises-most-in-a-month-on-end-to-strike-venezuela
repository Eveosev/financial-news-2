  Colombia ’s peso rose the most in a
month after truckers agreed to end a two-week strike and traders
speculated trade with neighboring Venezuela will rise.  The peso climbed 0.9 percent, the biggest jump since Jan.
18, to 1,876.75 per  U.S. dollar  at 11:59 a.m. New York time,
from 1893.75 yesterday. The currency has risen 0.5 percent this
week, its first weekly gain since the five days ended Jan. 21.  “The local market is euphoric today,” said  David Aldana ,
head analyst at brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA in Bogota. “People
are optimistic on a potential rise in trade with Venezuela,
while the end to the truckers’ strike alleviates concern over
its impact on the economy.”  Colombia’s Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin met with
her counterpart Nicolas Maduro in Caracas this week in a bid to
renew trade ties. Venezuela has paid $365 million of a total
$700 million owed to Colombian exporting companies and the
countries have agreed on a plan to pay the remaining amount,
Maduro said Feb. 16. There is now “complete openness” to
Colombian products in  Venezuela , Holguin said in a statement.  Truckers blocked roads across the South American country
earlier this week, preventing goods from reaching market,
according to the government.  Concern the strike stoked inflation this month continues to
push declines in government fixed-rate debt, Aldana said.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.30
percent, the highest level on a closing basis since May 18. The
bond’s price dropped 0.52 centavo to 117.10 centavos per peso.  Aldana forecasts higher food prices will lead monthly
inflation to quicken to 1.03 percent in February from 0.91 in
January. He also predicts annual inflation will end at 4.07
percent this year, above the central bank’s 2 percent to 4
percent target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
