U.S. regulators said  Verizon
Communications Inc .’s networks may have dropped a “truly
alarming” number of wireless emergency calls during a snow
storm last month, and asked the carrier to investigate.  Reports indicate Verizon’s network failed to connect 10,000
calls to 911 numbers in  Washington ’s suburbs during the Jan. 26
storm, the Federal Communications Commission said in a letter to
the carrier today that was released by e-mail.  “We are particularly concerned that this problem may be
widespread across Verizon’s footprint,” Jamie Barnett, chief of
the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, said in
the letter. The agency wants Verizon to investigate the extent
of the problem across its network, he said.  “We have been addressing this issue directly with the
counties involved, and will work cooperatively to address the
FCC’s questions, as well,” Harry Mitchell, a Verizon spokesman,
said in an e-mail. The outage, which affected Montgomery and
Prince George’s counties in  Maryland , was triggered by a “mass
call event,” Mitchell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
