Electricite de France SA said the
halt of its 550-megawatt Dungeness B22 reactor in southeast  England  was unplanned.  Generation stopped at about 5 a.m. local time today,
according to a website run by National Grid, the network
operator. The reactor had been running below full capacity since
Dec. 6, data on Bloomberg show.  “It was unplanned and we are currently assessing the
situation,” Marjorie Barnes, a company spokeswoman, said today
in an e-mailed statement. EDF decided to switch the unit off,
she said.  About 20 percent of the U.K.’s electricity can come from
nuclear power stations that usually operate around the clock, so
changes in output can influence electricity markets. The
Dungeness power station comprises two 550-megawatt units.
Reactor B22 at the site has been idle since Jan. 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
