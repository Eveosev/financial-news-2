Cashew prices doubled in  Nigeria  in
the last few months as political tensions in Ivory Coast,  Africa ’s second-biggest producer, curbed supply of the nuts, an
industry official said.  “The price of a metric ton of cashew from Nigeria to the
international market has gone up from about $600 to $1,200 since
November,” Olatunji Owoeye, president of the National Cashew
Association of Nigeria, said in a phone interview yesterday.  Ivory Coast is in the midst of a standoff as incumbent
President  Laurent Gbagbo  refuses to cede power to  Alassane
Ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of a Nov. 28
election. Ouattara and the Cotton and Cashew Monitoring
Committee, which tracks Ivory Coast’s cashew industry, have
called for a halt in exports of the nuts to cut off funds to
Gbagbo.  “The situation in Ivory Coast has reduced access to the
country’s cashew nuts, so there is pressure on countries like
Nigeria,” Owoeye said. “Buyers who fear that the political
crisis in  Ivory Coast  would get worse are quickly scrambling for
Nigeria’s cashew.”  Declining production in countries such as Vietnam and
higher world food costs also helped to boost cashew prices on
the global market, he said.  The nuts are among the main non-oil export commodities from
Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, along with cocoa, leather
and rubber, according to the country’s Export Promotion Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
