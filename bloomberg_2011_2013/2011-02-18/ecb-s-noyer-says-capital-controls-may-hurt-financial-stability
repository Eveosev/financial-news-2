  European Central Bank  governing
council member  Christian Noyer  said the impact of authorities’
efforts to curb capital flows is “uncertain” and may undermine
financial stability.  “Countries differ, some, as in  Europe , are totally open to
capital flows,” Noyer, who is also head of France’s central
bank, said at a Group of 20 nations meeting in Paris today,
according to a copy of his speech. “Others are very
restrictive. Recently, capital flow volatility has led to a
mushrooming of capital controls” and that may contribute, “in
some cases, to overall financial instability.”  Noyer also said “there are good reasons to think that a
large part of those imbalances are ‘policy induced. They don’t
result from conscious and rational choices made by well informed
economic agents.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
