Yang Hui, executive director at
Citic Securities Co. in Beijing, comments on the lifting of
banks’ reserve-ratio requirements.  China ’s central bank asked
lenders to set aside more cash as deposit reserves for the
second time this year, raising the ratio by 50 basis points,
effective Feb. 24.  “I see very little room for further increases in banks’
reserve ratios, which are already at record highs. Cash
availability at smaller banks is very tight. Extra cash reserves
at big banks have also dropped very quickly since before the
Chinese New Year holiday.  “There were rumors circulating recently that yuan
positions at local banks resulting from their purchases of
foreign-exchange were still at a high level, exceeding 400
billion yuan ($61 billion) in January.  “The increase will help drive up bond yields again after
declines this week.”  --Belinda Cao. Editor: Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
