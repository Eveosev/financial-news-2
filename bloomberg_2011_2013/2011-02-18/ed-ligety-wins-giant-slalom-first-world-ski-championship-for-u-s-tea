Ted Ligety won the giant slalom and
clinched the first gold medal for the U.S. at the  FIS Alpine Ski
World Championships  in Garmisch-Partenkirchen,  Germany .  Ligety was the fastest over two runs, with a total time of
2 minutes, 10.56 seconds on the Kandahar course in  Bavaria ,
southern Germany. France’s  Cyprien Richard  took silver, 0.08
seconds behind, while Austria’s  Philipp Schoerghofer  won bronze,
0.43 seconds back from the American.  Ligety, the giant slalom leader in the  World Cup , had been
in fourth position after the first leg of the race on a course
that was shortened because of fog.  Aksel Lund Svindal  of  Norway ,
the fastest skier after the first leg, finished in fourth
position. Svindal had won a gold medal on the super-combined
race last week.  Ligety, the 2006 combined Olympic champion in Turin, won a
bronze in the giant slalom at the 2009 world championships in
Val d’Isere,  France . The 26-year-old won his first world title
after he failed to finish last week’s super-G and super-combined
races in Garmisch.  Defending giant slalom Olympic and world champion  Carlo
Janka  ended in seventh place after he nearly fell on the steep
section of the second leg. The Swiss will have heart surgery at
the end of the season for an irregular heartbeat.  Ligety’s teammate Bode Miller, the 2003 giant slalom world
champion, finished in 12th place after the reigning Olympic
super-combined champion made a mistake in the first run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
