Royal Dutch Shell Plc sought to sell  North Sea  Forties crude without success. Russian Urals was
little changed as Eni SpA kept its bid stable.  North Sea  Shell failed to sell 600,000 barrels of Forties for loading
March 5 to March 7 at parity to Dated Brent, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the daily Platts
trading window.  No bids and offers were made yesterday. On Feb. 16, Shell
bought one shipment for loading March 3 to March 5 from BP Plc
at 5 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window that ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior to the
window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future cost 5 cents
more than Dated Brent yesterday, compared with a 5-cent discount
the previous day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.    Brent crude  for April settlement traded at $102.84 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of
the window, down from $104.08 yesterday. The May contract was at
$103.18, 34 cents more expensive than April.  Mediterranean  Eni maintained its bid for 80,000 metric tons of Urals for
March 8 to March 12 at a discount of $2.40 to Dated Brent
without finding any sellers, the survey showed.  Litasco, OAO Lukoilâ€™s trading unit, failed to sell 80,000
tons of Urals for March 10 to March 14 at $2.00 less than Dated
Brent for the second day, according to the survey.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. issued its third spot tender for crude oil
loading in April, according to official documents obtained by
Bloomberg News. The tender will close Feb. 24, and all offers
will be valid until Feb. 25.  -- Editors: Stephen Cunningham, Raj Rajendran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
