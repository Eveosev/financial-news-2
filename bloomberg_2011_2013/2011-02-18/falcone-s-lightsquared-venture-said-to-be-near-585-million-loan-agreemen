  Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared Inc.
venture is close to securing a $585 million loan to build its
wireless network, as it negotiates a wholesale deal with a
nationwide carrier, said two people familiar with the plans.  An official announcement of the loan could come as early as
today, said the people, who wouldn’t be identified because the
deal isn’t public. The loan, from  UBS AG  and  JPMorgan Chase &
Co ., will bring LightSquared’s cash on hand to about $1 billion,
said one of the people. The company has said it currently has
roughly $1.75 billion in debt and equity.  LightSquared said this week it has agreements with five
customers to provide wholesale fourth-generation service,
including two carriers, a national retailer, a device
manufacturer and a website.  LightSquared is seeking to compete with  AT&T Inc .,  Verizon
Wireless  and  Clearwire Corp . in selling 4G capacity. The company
plans to offer space on its network to retailers, computer
manufacturers and consumer electronics makers, allowing
companies such as  Apple Inc . and Sony Corp. to sell their own
wireless service in competition with existing providers.  Under a Federal Communications Commission order, the
company has to build a network that covers up to 100 million
Americans by the end of 2012 and 260 million by 2016. The new
funds are in addition to an existing $850 million credit
facility Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared has with UBS, said
one of the people.  Satellite Bid?  Last month, LightSquared received a waiver from the FCC
lifting a requirement that devices using its service communicate
directly with satellites, expanding its potential customer base.
The FCC said LightSquared must participate in a working group
with makers and users of global-positioning systems to ensure
its service doesn’t interfere with those communications.  LightSquared is preparing a bid for the satellite companies
TerreStar Corp. and DBSD North America Inc., two people said
this month.  Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined in an e-mail
to comment.  Karina Byrne , a UBS spokeswoman, said in an e-mail
she didn’t have an immediate comment. Audrey Schaefer, a
LightSquared spokeswoman, said the company is in discussions
with investors all the time and there is nothing new to report.  LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, will begin network trials this year in Las
Vegas, Baltimore, Denver and Phoenix after completing testing in
a lab in the Dallas area.  The company is negotiating agreements for nationwide
wholesale service with carriers both based in and outside the
U.S., said one of the people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
