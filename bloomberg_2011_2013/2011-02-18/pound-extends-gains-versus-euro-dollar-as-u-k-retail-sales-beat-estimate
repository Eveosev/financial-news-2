The pound extended gains versus the
dollar and the euro after a government report showed U.K. retail
sales rose last month by almost four times as much as predicted
in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.6219 at 9:32 a.m. in  London  and strengthened 0.5 percent versus the euro to 83.76
pence.  Sales gained 1.9 percent in January, compared with a
revised drop of 1.4 percent the previous month, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in London. The gain was the
biggest since February 2010 and exceeded the 0.5 percent median
forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
