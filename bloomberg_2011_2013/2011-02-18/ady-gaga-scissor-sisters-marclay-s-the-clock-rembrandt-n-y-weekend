Strap on your sass and hit the
Wellmont Theatre for the Scissor Sisters.  Jake Shears, Ana Matronic and crew will tear the roof off
the joint with their glitter-soaked madness.  Think of this solo gig as a taste of what’s to come when
they head out on the road with Lady Gaga. Their high velocity
disco-inflected dance-pop will slip in nicely with the Monster
Ball, which rolls into Madison Square Garden on Monday.  Wellmont Theater, 5 Seymour St., Montclair,  New Jersey .

 http://www.thegarden.com/   Saturday  There’s still time to catch Christian Marclay’s hypnotic
video “The Clock” at Paula Cooper Gallery in Chelsea.  Footage from some 3,500 films showing clock towers, wrist
watches, buzzing alarm clocks and the occasional cuckoo has been
edited into a 24-hour sequence, which the viewer experiences in
real time.  Since its debut in London last fall, Marclay’s video has
acquired a cult status, so be prepared to wait outside.  The gallery will stay open for its final screening from 10
a.m. on Friday to 6 p.m. on Saturday.  534 W. 21st St. Information: +1-212-255-1105;
 http://www.paulacoopergallery.com .  Free Marathon  Hear Emanuel Ax, Jeremy Denk, Eugenia Zukerman, and 97
other artists perform everything from Bach to Kenji Bunch at the
free musical marathon celebrating the 50th anniversary
celebration of Young Concert Artists, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.  Schubert Hour starts at 1 p.m., the Chopin Hour begins at 3
p.m., and such favorites as Mendelssohn’s “Octet” and
Granados’s “Goyescas” are scattered throughout the day.  Symphony Space is at 2537 Broadway, near 95th St.

of the starriest ensembles on Broadway: Kiefer Sutherland
(“24”), Jason Patric (whose father, Jason Miller, wrote the
play), Chris Noth (“Sex and the City”), comedian Jim Gaffigan
(“Hot Pockets”) and Brian Cox, a veteran of the stage and the
Bourne screen thrillers.  It’s been two decades since the former high school
basketball players had their state championship season (“Forty,
yeah, it’s like half-time!”). Turns out small-town life isn’t
all glory, as their lives implode.  In previews, opening March 6th at the Bernard Jacobs
Theatre, 242 W. 45th St. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

beginning with the cooling atrium fountain and those flippy
Fragonards. For something more serious, visit the new
installation of “Rembrandt and His School,” as seen through
the eyes of Henry Clay Frick and fellow collector Frederik
Johannes Lugt.  The star of the show is the newly-scrubbed 1658 “Self-
Portrait,” just released from layers of varnish. Then there are
the drawings, rarely on display, among them “Woman Leaning on a
Window Sill,” and “Interior with Saskia in Bed.”  Runs until May 15 at 1 E. 70th St. Information: +1-212-288-
0700;  http://www.frick.org .  Relax over brunch at  Orsay , a Parisian-style brasserie with
Art Nouveau touches. Start with a classic Bloody Mary, and then
have steak, either tartare or perfectly grilled with Bearnaise
sauce and frites.  1057 Lexington Ave. at 75th St. Information: +1-212-517-
6400.  Drummer Boys  It’s not 76 trombones, but rather 72 percussionists filling
the Park Avenue Armory’s 55,000-square-foot Wade Thompson Drill
Hall. Starting out in concentric circles, they move around,
disappear and reappear during the performance of John Luther
Adams’s “Inuksuit.”  It’s part of the Tune-In Music Festival curated by
irreverent new music group, eighth blackbird. The performance
starts at 4 p.m., but if you want to know what you’re in for,
the composer will be on hand for a talk at 2:30 p.m.  Premiered outdoors in the Canadian Rockies, this is the
work’s first performance under a roof.  The Park Avenue Armory is at 643 Park Ave. between 66th and
67th Streets. Information: +1-212-616-3930;
