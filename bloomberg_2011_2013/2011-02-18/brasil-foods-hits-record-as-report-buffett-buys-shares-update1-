BRF Brasil Foods SA rose to its
highest ever in Sao Paulo trading amid a news report that
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc .
started buying shares in the Brazilian foodmaker.  Brasil Foods, the world’s largest poultry exporter, climbed
94 centavos, or 3.3 percent, to settle at 29.65 reais at 3:08
p.m. New York time. Earlier, it touched 29.98 reais, the highest
since the company formerly known as Perdigao SA began trading in
1997. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.6 percent.  Buffett started buying shares after fund managers at his
company visited Brasil Foods units, Sao Paulo-based newspaper
Valor Economico reported today, citing unidentified investors
who spoke to the company’s executives.  “The speculation is that Buffett is seeking to have 5
percent of the company,” Fausto Gouveia, who helps manage 270
million reais in stocks at Legan Administracao de Recursos, said
today in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “Whoever is
short on this stock is buying shares now.”  Buffett didn’t respond to an e-mailed request for comment
to his assistant, Carrie Kizer. A spokeswoman for Brasil Foods,
who can’t be named because of company policy, declined to
comment.  Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, is the biggest
shareholder of  Coca-Cola Co . and  Wells Fargo & Co ., and sold
shares of  Bank of America Corp . and  Nike Inc . at the end of
2010, according to a regulatory filing Feb. 14. Buffett,
Berkshire’s chairman, oversees more than 70 operating units and
an investment portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
