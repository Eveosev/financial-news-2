Gold is set for its biggest weekly
advance this year as unrest in the Middle East, rising inflation
and a weakening dollar combined to fuel demand for the metal as
an alternative investment. Silver rose to a 30-year high.  Immediate-delivery bullion was little changed at $1,385.38
an ounce at 1:32 p.m. in  Singapore  and has gained 2 percent this
week, the biggest advance since the week ended Dec. 31. Futures
for April delivery were little changed at $1,385.80.  “Gold remains as attractive as ever,” said  Gavin Wendt , a
Sydney-based resource analyst with MineLife Pty Ltd. “There’s
no compelling reason to sell gold, with growing political
uncertainty in North Africa and potentially elsewhere,
escalating food prices fanning inflation and the U.S. sitting on
an ever-growing pile of debt.”  Gold has fallen 2.5 percent this year after rallying 30
percent in 2010 and touching a record $1,431.25 an ounce in
December. Eleven of 15 traders, investors and analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg, or 73 percent, said the metal will rise next week.    China , India, Indonesia, Thailand and  South Korea  have
boosted  interest rates  as policy makers sought to cool the
economies leading a global rebound. Pro-democracy demonstrations
in Bahrain and civil unrest in Libya and Yemen have renewed
concern fanned by the overthrow of Egypt’s President Hosni
Mubarak.  Bullion is “supported by continued unrest in the Middle
East and a weaker  U.S. dollar ,”  Mark Pervan , senior commodity
strategist with ANZ Banking Group Ltd., wrote in a note to
clients today. The Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
dollar’s value, has declined 0.6 percent this week, reversing an
advance last week. Gold typically moves inversely to the dollar.  Record Demand  Indian and Chinese jewelry demand climbed to a record last
year, the World Gold Council said in a report yesterday. Usage
in  India  advanced 47 percent in the fourth quarter to 210.5
metric tons, and consumption in China rose 26 percent to 115.8
tons, the group said.  Assets in gold-backed exchange traded products increased
3.5 tons to 2,019.92 tons yesterday, the first rise in three
days, data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show.
Holdings reached a record 2,114.6 tons in December.  Silver for immediate delivery increased to $31.81 an ounce
today, the highest level since 1980, before trading at $31.69 an
ounce. Platinum for immediate delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$1,840.45 an ounce and spot palladium was up 0.2 percent at
$846.43 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
