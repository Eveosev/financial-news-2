The Mayor of London and Transport
for London plan to provide 4 million pounds ($6.5 million) in
funding to 13 London boroughs to help them create cycling hubs
in town centers and encourage more people to use bicycles to
travel in the city, Transport for  London ’s press office said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The 13 so-called “Biking Boroughs” may bid for a share of
the total funds from Feb. 21 to the end of March, the statement
said. Transport for London will adjudicate the submissions and
allocate the funds accordingly, TfL said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
