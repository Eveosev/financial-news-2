  OMV Petrom SA ,  Romania ’s largest oil
company, said its Arpechim refinery is shut because the plant is
unprofitable.  The plant “is currently in economic shutdown,” the
Bucharest-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. The
refinery in Pitesti has the capacity to process 70,000 barrels
of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A fire broke out at a “cooling tower from the
petrochemical plant which belongs to Oltchim SA,” OMV Petrom
said. “The fire was extinguished very quickly, there were no
casualties and the installations of Arpechim refinery were not
affected.”  The petrochemical plant is in the same industrial area as
the refinery. Two officials at Oltchim’s offices couldn’t
immediately comment on the fire when contacted by Bloomberg.
They declined to be identified, citing company policy.  OMV Petrom SA is a unit of Austria’s  OMV AG .  To contact the reporter on this story:
