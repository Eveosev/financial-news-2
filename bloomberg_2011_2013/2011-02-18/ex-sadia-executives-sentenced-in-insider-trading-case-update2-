Two former executives of Sadia SA,
the foodmaker that BRF  Brasil Foods  SA bought to form the
world’s biggest poultry exporter, were sentenced and fined in
the country’s first  insider trading  court ruling.  Former Chief Financial Officer Luiz Gonzaga Murat Jr. was
sentenced to 21 months in prison and fined 349,712 reais
($210,100),  Brazil ’s securities regulator said today in an e-
mailed statement. Romano Ancelmo Fontana Filho, a former board
member, was sentenced to 17 months and fined 374,941 reais. Both
can serve community service in lieu of prison.  Murat, who was Sadia’s CFO for 12 years until resigning in
2006, and Fontana were charged with illegally purchasing
American depositary receipts of Perdigao SA before Sadia made a
hostile bid to buy the rival in 2006. Murat and Fontana settled
similar allegations of insider trading with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission in 2007.  Brasil Foods, formerly known as Perdigao, agreed to buy
Sadia in 2009 after the rival booked more than 3 billion reais
in derivative losses the year before. Brasil Foods rose to its
highest ever in Sao Paulo trading today amid a news report that
Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc .
started buying shares in the company.  Brasil Foods gained 1.09 reais, or 3.8 percent, to 29.80
reais as of 10:59 a.m. New York time. Earlier, it touched 29.98
reais, the highest since the company started trading in 1997.
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.5 percent.  Murat’s lawyer, Celso Vilardi,  will appeal the ruling
today, he said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. Fontana’s
lawyer, Eduardo Reale, didn’t return calls to his office.  Derivatives Case  In December, Brazil’s securities regulator barred another
former Sadia CFO, Adriano Ferreira, from managing public
companies for three years for his role in exceeding company
limits for derivatives trading in 2008. Board members were also
fined 2.6 million reais as part of the same case.  Sadia fired Ferreira in September 2008. Less than two weeks
later it accepted the resignations of Chairman Walter Fontana
Filho and Vice Chairman Eduardo Fontana d’Avila.  To contact the reporter on this story:
