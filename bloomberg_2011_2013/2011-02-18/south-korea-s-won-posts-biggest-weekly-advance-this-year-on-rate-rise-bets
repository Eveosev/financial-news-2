South  Korea ’s won posted its biggest
weekly gain this year on speculation the central bank will boost  interest rates  next month to curb inflation.  The currency reached a one-week high today after data on
Feb. 16 showed import prices rose 14.1 percent last month from a
year ago, compared with 12.7 percent in December. The  Bank of
Korea  unexpectedly kept benchmark policy rates unchanged at 2.75
percent at a review last week, even after inflation breached its
4 percent ceiling in January. The next policy meeting is on
March 10.  “Inflation is a hot topic and one of the reasons for the
won gains is that Bank of Korea may raise rates next month as
they didn’t do it in February,” said Ko Yun Jin, a currency
trader at Kookmin Bank in  Seoul . “The overall atmosphere in the
global stock market is also better.”  The won strengthened 1.5 percent this week to 1,112.10 per
dollar as of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 0.5 percent today and earlier
reached 1,111.45, the strongest since Feb. 10. Last week’s 2.2
percent slide was the biggest loss since November.  Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said on Feb. 9 that the
government needs to act “preemptively” to curb inflation as
price gains can weaken the foundation of a stable economy.  In a split decision, policy makers kept the seven-day
repurchase rate at 2.75 percent on Feb. 11. The outcome was
forecast by three of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
while nine predicted a 25-basis point rise. The last rate
increase in January was the third since June. Governor Kim Choong Soo signaled Feb. 11 that the pause may be only temporary,
saying the central bank will move at its own pace in
“normalizing” rates.    South Korea ’s benchmark five-year bonds rose this week. The
yield on the 4 percent note due September 2015 dropped six basis
points to 4.42 percent, according to Korea Stock Exchange. The
rate fell three basis points from yesterday. Yields reached 4.51
percent on Feb. 8, the highest level since the notes began
trading in September. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
