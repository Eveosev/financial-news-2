Soybeans fell in  Chicago , heading
for a second weekly drop, after export sales from the U.S. slid
and  China  scrapped an order, signaling importers may be
switching to South American supplies.  U.S. exporters sold 396,332 metric tons of soybeans from
the prior and next harvests in the week to Feb. 10, a 59 percent
plunge from a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said yesterday. It also said China, the biggest buyer, canceled
a 120,000-ton purchase from the U.S. That would have been for
delivery in the marketing year to Aug. 31.  “Beans are starting to turn a bit negative, and two weeks
of poor sales and cancellations cannot be good,” said Connor Noonan, an analyst at Castlestone Management Ltd. in  London .  May-delivery soybeans slid 20.5 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$13.96 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The oilseed is down 1.4 percent this week.  “We expect at this time of the year a seasonal decline in
U.S. exports as importers switch to South American supplies,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said by phone. “The cancellation of 120,000 tons of
U.S. beans by the Chinese is perhaps along those lines.”  Prices also fell as China raised banks’ reserve
requirements for the second time this year to counter inflation.
The country is the world’s biggest soybean importer.  The soybean crop in  Brazil , the largest exporter after the
U.S., may be 71 million tons, beating last year’s record 68.7
million tons, and exports may rise 13 percent to an all-time
high of 33 million tons, Oil World said in a report Feb. 15.
Normal or above-normal rain in the past six weeks has improved
conditions, it said.  Corn for May delivery lost 6.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$7.165 a bushel. The grain reached $7.25, the highest price
since July 2008.  Wheat for May delivery dropped 12.25 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $8.7125 a bushel, poised for a 3.1 percent decline this week.
Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
slipped 0.2 percent to 261 euros ($355.98) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
