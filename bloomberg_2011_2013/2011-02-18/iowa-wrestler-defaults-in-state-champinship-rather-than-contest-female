An  Iowa  high school wrestler gave up
his chance to become a state champion when he refused to try to
pin a female contender.  Joel Northrup, a sophomore and 112-pound contestant in the
state wrestling tournament, said he didn’t think it was
appropriate for girls and boys to wrestle. He was slated to go
to the mat with Cassy Herkelman (20-13), the state’s first
female state qualifier.  “As a matter of conscience and my faith, I do not believe
it is appropriate for a boy to engage a girl in this manner,”
Northrup said in a statement released yesterday by Scott
Mahmens, athletics director at Linn-Mar High School in Marion,
Iowa. “It is unfortunate that I have been placed in a situation
not seen in most other high school sports in Iowa.”  Northrup (35-4), a sophomore who is home-schooled by his
mother and his minister father and wrestles on the Linn-Mar
team, defaulted on the match, which allows him to enter the
consolation round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
