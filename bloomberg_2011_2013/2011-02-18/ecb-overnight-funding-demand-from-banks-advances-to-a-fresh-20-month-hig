Demand for overnight loans from the  European Central Bank  increased to a fresh 20-month high
yesterday.  Banks borrowed 16 billion euros ($21.7 billion) via the
ECB’s marginal lending facility at 1.75 percent, 75 basis points
higher than the central bank’s benchmark rate. That’s the most
since June 2009 and up from 15.8 billion euros the previous day.  “Some bank, which is still dependent on the ECB for
funding, missed the main refinancing operation on Tuesday,”
said  Christoph Rieger , head of fixed-income strategy at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “This will add to the excess
liquidity, which we already calculated to be abundant for the
remainder of this reserve period, thus keeping the downward
pressure on EONIAs intact.”  The euro overnight index average between banks, or EONIA,
fell to 0.625 percent yesterday from 1.023 percent a week
earlier.  Banks yesterday lodged 18.8 billion euros in the ECB’s
overnight deposit facility at 0.25 percent, the central bank
said, up from 14.7 billion euros a day earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
