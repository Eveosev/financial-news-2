Egyptian prosecutors ordered the
detention of three former ministers and Ahmed Ezz, a steel
tycoon, after questioning them on corruption-related charges,
the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, will be held for 15 days
along with former Housing Minister Ahmed El Maghraby, former
Tourism Minister Zoheir Garranah and former Interior Minister
Habib El-Adly, MENA reported late yesterday, without saying how
it got the information.  Allegations of corruption against businessmen and officials
close to former President  Hosni Mubarak ’s regime helped fuel the
protest movement that ended his 30-year rule.  Egypt ’s Supreme
Council of the Armed Forces assumed interim authority after
Mubarak stepped down on Feb. 11.  Ezz said in a statement on Feb. 14 that he refutes all
allegations against him of corruption and embezzlement of public
funds. No one close to the three former ministers could be
immediately reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
