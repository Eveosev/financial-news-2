Spot jet fuel spreads in New York
and on the  Gulf Coast  reached their highest levels in 19 months
as Hovensa LLC reduced rates at its St. Croix refinery in the
U.S. Virgin Islands and airlines flew more.  The rates were lowered while a unit is started to replace a
distillate desulfurization unit damaged in a Feb. 11 fire, Alex Moorhead, a Hovensa spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The differential for New York jet fuel against New York
Mercantile Exchange heating oil futures rose 1.37 cents to a
premium of 11 cents a gallon at 11:53 a.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level since July 15,
2009. Prompt delivery rose 1.3 cents to $2.8417 a gallon.    Sunoco Inc .’s Philadelphia refinery also shut units for
repairs last week.  Most of the largest airlines in January increased capacity,
a measure of seats and miles flown.  AMR Corp.’s American Airlines’ capacity rose 2.5 percent
last month from a year ago, while  Southwest Airlines Co .’s
increased 7.5 percent.  Delta Air Lines Inc ., the second-biggest
U.S. carrier, increased 4.2 percent and United Continental
Holdings Inc.’s capacity, including regional carriers, rose 0.4
percent.  The premium for jet fuel in the Gulf Coast held steady at
yesterday’s level of 7.25 cents, also a 19-month high. Prompt
delivery fell 0.85 cent to $2.7964.  The discount versus futures for conventional, 87-octane
gasoline in New York Harbor widened 0.25 cent to 2.13 cents a
gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
