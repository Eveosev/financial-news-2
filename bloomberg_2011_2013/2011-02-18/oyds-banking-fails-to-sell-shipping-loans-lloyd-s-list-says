Lloyds Banking Group Plc has tried
and failed for almost six months to sell a portfolio of shipping
loans worth between $8 billion and $12 billion,  Lloyd’s List 
reported, citing bankers it didn’t identify.  Banks that have made offers have sought discounts that are
too large for Lloyds Banking Group to accept, the newspaper
reported today.  Lloyds Banking Group spokeswoman  Sara Evans  declined to
comment on the story when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
