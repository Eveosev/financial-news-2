Nassau County,  New York ’s wealthiest
by per-capita income, received a stay today that will allow it
to postpone submitting a revised budget that was due Feb. 22.  Supreme Court Judge  Arthur M. Diamond  granted the stay in
Mineola. The county, home to New York City suburban communities,
filed a lawsuit last month against an oversight agency, which on
Jan. 26 took control of the county’s budget. The judge heard
arguments on that move today.  A takeover by the  Nassau County Interim Finance Authority 
is unconstitutional because it impairs the county’s ability to
govern, William M. Savino, attorney for Nassau County, told the
judge.  Nifa acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when its six
directors voted unanimously to impose a takeover on the
condition that there was “substantial likelihood” and
“imminent” threat of a deficit of 1 percent or more less than
a month into the fiscal year, he said.  Savino compared the timing of this takeover to a Yankees
baseball game announcer deciding the outcome of a game on just
one inning.  “Don’t call this game, your honor,” he told the judge.
“It would be truly unfair to call this budget a deficit on 26
days of operation.”  Nifa’s responsibility is to help fix  budget  problems before
they “snowball” and deficits grow bigger, said Christopher J. Gunther, attorney for Nifa. The state created Nifa in 2000 to
bail out the county after years of deficits.  The case is County of Nassau v. Nassau County Interim,
1455/2011, New York Supreme Court, Nassau County (Mineola).  To contact the reporter on this story:
