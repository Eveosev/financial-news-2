Metallurgical coal prices on the
U.S. spot market increased ahead of final negotiations for the
quarterly benchmark contract, Energy Publishing Inc. said.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal gained $1.25, or
0.4 percent, to $321.25 a ton in the week ended today, according
to the  Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider. High-volatility
coal was unchanged at $287.50.  Energy Publishing said buyers and sellers of metallurgical
coal are anticipating that the benchmark contract between the
BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance and Japanese steelmakers will
be announced by March 2.  “U.S. producers continue to be in a bit of a holding
pattern as they await news of the quarterly settlement,” Energy
Publishing said.  Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
