Tiger Woods will seek to end a 15-
month winless streak at next week’s Match Play Championship.  Woods won the World Golf Championships event in 2003, 2004
and 2008. The tournament will feature the 64 top-ranked players
in the world and will be played Feb. 23-27 at the Ritz-Carlton
Golf Club in Marana,  Arizona , for the third straight year.  Woods didn’t play last year, when Ian Poulter defeated
English countryman  Paul Casey  in the final.  Woods hasn’t won a tournament since he confessed to marital
infidelity, which led to his divorce last year. His title
drought has dropped him to No. 3 in the Official World Ranking.  Last weekend, he shot a 3-over 75 in the final round of the
Dubai Desert Classic to finish in a tie for 20th place. It was
his worst performance in six appearances at a tournament he won
in 2006 and 2008.  Woods opened his season in January by tying for 44th at the
Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Club in  La Jolla ,  California . He’d won on his previous five visits to the course.  To contact the reporter on this story:
