Employment at U.S. airlines rose 0.2
percent in December, the first time since June 2008 that
passenger carriers created more jobs to keep pace with rising
demand for travel.  Hiring by companies such as  Delta Air Lines Inc . is
starting to show up in data from the  U.S. Bureau of
Transportation Statistics , which said today that the industry
workforce climbed to 379,651 from 378,953 a year earlier.  The job-loss streak was the second-longest for U.S.
airlines since the government began keeping track in 1990. Full-
time employment at passenger carriers has fallen by about
143,000 since 2000, BTS data show, the equivalent of erasing the
combined payrolls of Delta and  American Airlines .  “They’re beginning to add some heads in the customer
service area, flight attendants and reservations,” said William Swelbar, a research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s  air transportation center . “Everyone is looking in
the mirror and saying ‘I need to add here and there.’”    AMR Corp .’s American said today it is recalling 200
furloughed attendants, expanding on the 368 recalls announced
Feb. 9, and  US Airways Group Inc . took applications in December
for 420 attendant jobs. Atlanta-based Delta has added more than
4,000 new employees over the past year.  November’s employment total was little changed, according
to BTS, with a drop of 23 jobs. The record streak for declines
in the industry workforce is the 31-month period from February
1993 to August 1995.  ‘Bottoming Out’  “Things are bottoming out,” said Jerry Glass, a former
labor executive at  US Airways  who is now president of
Washington-based consulting firm F&H Solutions Group. “I would
expect some moderate hiring in 2011.”  Airline payrolls shrank for most of the last decade as the
2001 terrorist attacks and two recessions sapped  travel demand 
and dragged carriers such as Delta into job-slashing
bankruptcies. The industry learned to operate with fewer
workers, with employment dropping 27 percent from the 2000 peak
while traffic rose by about 15 percent.  Four of the five largest U.S. airlines posted profits last
year as  air travel  recovered, with  Fort Worth , Texas-based AMR
alone in reporting a full-year loss. Passenger traffic climbed
3.5 percent in 2010 through October over a year earlier.  For all of 2010, the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index rose 22
percent after tumbling 53 percent from the end of 2006 through
2009. The gauge of 12 carriers was little changed this year
through yesterday.  ‘Starts to Percolate’  “As the economy starts to percolate again there’s more
demand,” said John Challenger, chief executive officer of
Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement
consulting firm. “As that gathers momentum the hiring will pick
up and has started to do that.”  Carriers probably will be cautious in hiring because the
shocks of 2008-09 are still fresh, Glass said. They cut about
22,000 jobs in those two years, BTS data show, and parked more
than 500 planes as oil surged to a record and travel wilted.    United Continental Holdings Inc ., the world’s largest
carrier, is among the airlines saying it plans to limit
increases in available seating to roughly match the growth in
U.S. gross domestic product. The Chicago-based carrier formed in
the October merger of United and Continental airlines is
eliminating 500 jobs in Continental’s Houston headquarters.  “Airlines have learned from past mistakes,” Glass said.
“I don’t think there’s going to be an explosion of capacity
growth which would lead to a lot of hiring.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
