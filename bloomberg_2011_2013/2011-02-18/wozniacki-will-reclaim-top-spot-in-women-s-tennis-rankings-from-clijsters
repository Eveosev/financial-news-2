  Caroline Wozniacki ’s defeat of
Israel’s Shahar Peer means the Dane will reclaim the top spot in
women’s tennis from Australian Open champion  Kim Clijsters  next
week.  Wozniacki takes back the No. 1 ranking she lost to
Clijsters for one week after beating Peer 6-2, 6-4 today to move
to the semifinals of the  Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships .
The WTA rankings will be published Feb. 21.  The 20-year-old first rose to the No. 1 ranking in October,
taking over from an injured  Serena Williams . Wozniacki clinched
six titles last season, but has yet to win a major. She lost in
the semifinals of the Australian Open in January to eventual
runnerup  Li Na  of China.  Clijsters, who won her fourth major in Australia, had taken
the top spot this week after advancing to the semifinals of an
indoor event in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
