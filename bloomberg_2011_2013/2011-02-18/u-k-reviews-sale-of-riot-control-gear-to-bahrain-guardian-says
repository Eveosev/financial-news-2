Britain is urgently reviewing its
arms sales to Bahrain after five anti-government protestors were
killed by police using tear gas and other riot control
equipment, the Guardian reported, citing Foreign Office Minister
Alistair Burt.  Britain has licensed the sale of riot control equipment,
including tear gas rounds, to Bahrain over the past nine months
and Burt said export permits would be revoked if criteria on
internal repression were found not to have been met, the
newspaper said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
