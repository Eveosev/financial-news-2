  Telefonica O2 Czech Republic AS 
rose, poised for its biggest rally in a month, before the
countryâ€™s largest phone operator publishes fourth-quarter
earnings.  The stock advanced 1.3 percent to 399.5 koruna at 1:10 p.m.
in Prague. A close at that level would give the stock its
biggest advance since Jan. 18. The company is scheduled to
report earnings at 3 p.m. in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
