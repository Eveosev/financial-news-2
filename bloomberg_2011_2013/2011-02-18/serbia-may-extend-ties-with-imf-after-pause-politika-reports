  Serbia  won’t seek to immediately
renew ties with the Intenrational Monetary Fund after its
current arrangement expires in April and it may ask to restart
cooperation “a few months” later,  Politika  newspaper reported,
citing government officials it did not name.  Serbia’s central bank and Finance Ministry officials are in
favor of a new deal with the multinational lender, whose
delegation is in Belgrade for policy review talks concerning the
current arrangement and discussing a new, possibly
“precautionary” agreement with the country, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
