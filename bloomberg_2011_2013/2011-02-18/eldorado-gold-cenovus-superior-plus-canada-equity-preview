Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in five days as mining companies slipped on concern higher  interest rates  in  China  will curb demand for metals and
fertilizer.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest
producer of the crop nutrient, fell 3.6 percent. Teck Resources
Ltd.,  Canada ’s largest base-metals and coal producer, declined
2.8 percent. First Quantum Minerals Ltd., the country’s second-
largest publicly traded copper producer, sank 3 percent as the
metal dropped.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slumped 13.04
points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 14,123.11 in Toronto. The
index rose 2.6 percent this week as energy producers, which make
up about 27 percent of Canadian stocks by market value, rallied
on concern unrest in the Middle East will crimp supplies.  “Given how hard the market has rallied, I think there is a
shift under way,” said Marcus Xu, director of equity
investments at Genus Capital Management in  Vancouver , which
manages C$1.7 billion ($1.72 billion). “The interbank rates are
early signs of the housing market in China closing down. That’s
why a lot of the funds are repositioning themselves out of the
mining space and into energy, which is less tied to the housing
market.”  The S&P/TSX has risen 5.1 percent this year as economic
data and corporate earnings signaled the global economic
recovery is becoming more entrenched. A subgroup of energy
companies in the Canadian benchmark equity index gained 4.6
percent this week.  Reserve Requirements  China’s central bank raised reserve requirements for
lenders 10 days after boosting interest rates as Premier  Wen
Jiabao  tackles accelerating inflation and the risk of asset
bubbles in the fastest-growing major economy. Lending surged in
January and inflation quickened as new  home prices  rose in all
but two of 70 cities monitored by the government, official
reports showed this week.  Wheat fell for the third time in four days on speculation
China’s demand for grain and oilseeds will ease. Potash Corp.
fell 3.6 percent to C$59.17. Agrium Inc.,  North America ’s third-
largest fertilizer producer, fell 3.9 percent to C$92.01, the
biggest decline since June.  Teck Resources Ltd. declined 2.8 percent to C$54.33, the
lowest price since December 2010. First Quantum Minerals Ltd.
sank 3 percent to C$126.79, the lowest price since Feb. 3.  Barrick Gold advanced 1.8 percent to C$50.82, as futures
for the metal rose on demand for precious metals to hedge
against losses in other assets because of Middle East unrest.  Goldcorp Inc . added 0.8 percent to C$44.47, the highest price
since Jan. 4.    Bombardier Inc . advanced 1.2 percent to C$6.57, the highest
price since September 2008. The world’s third-biggest planemaker
was raised to “outperform” from “market perform” at Raymond
James Financial Inc. The 12-month price estimate is C$7.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
