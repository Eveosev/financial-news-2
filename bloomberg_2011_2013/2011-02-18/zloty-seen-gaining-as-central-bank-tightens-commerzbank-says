The zloty may appreciate in the
coming weeks as  Poland ’s central bank continues to increase
borrowing costs, Commerzbank AG said today.  “The zloty will benefit from the positive rate outlook
over the coming weeks,” Commerzbank analysts, including Lutz Karpowitz in  Frankfurt , wrote in a note.  The Warsaw-based Narodowy Bank Polski lifted the benchmark
seven-day rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent last month in
its first increase since June 2008. The move was the start of a
“gradual tightening,” according to a copy of the minutes of
the meeting sent from the central bank yesterday.  It is “premature” to conclude from the word “gradual”
mentioned in the minutes that the central bank won’t raise
interest rates at the next meeting in early March, the
Commerzbank analysts wrote. Inflation data published after the
policy makers’ January meeting was more than the bank’s 2.5
percent target, the Commerzbank analysts added. Poland’s
inflation rate rose to 3.8 percent in January, a 21-month high,
the  Central Statistical Office  said in Warsaw on Feb. 15.  The zloty was little changed at 3.9004 per euro as of 10:42
a.m. in Warsaw, giving the currency a gain this week of 0.4
percent.  The  Hungarian forint  added less than 0.1 percent to 269.47,
taking this week’s increase to 0.5 percent.  Hungary ’s central
bank will probably hold its key interest rate at 6 percent on
Feb. 21 after three consecutive months of quarter-point
increases, according to 17 out of 17 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
