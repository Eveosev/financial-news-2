Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped this month to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative
to Chicago futures as farmers curbed sales after prices fell.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
February at  Gulf of Mexico  ports rose to 58 cents to 59 cents a
bushel above March futures, compared with 56 cents to 57 cents
yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The average
bid was the highest since Dec. 1. Soybean premiums rose to 69
cents to 70 cents above March futures from 68 cents to 70 cents.  “Farmer sales of corn and soybeans slowed this week,
boosting the basis bid to attract some supplies,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing adviser for Toay Commodity Futures
Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois . “There is an impressive
lineup of corn shipments the next several months, but soybeans
may slow” as overseas buyers turn to cheaper supplies from  South America , he said.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 3 cents, or 0.4
percent to $7.0975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
earlier touching $7.15, the highest for the contract that began
trading in April 2009.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 36.5 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $13.68 a bushel. On Feb. 9, the price reached
$14.5575, the highest since the contract began trading in
October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
