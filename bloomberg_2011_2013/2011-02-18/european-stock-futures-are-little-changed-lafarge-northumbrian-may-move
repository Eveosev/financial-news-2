European stocks slipped, dragging
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index from a 2 1/2-year high, as China
raised the reserve requirement ratio for its domestic lenders,
draining cash from the financial system.    Rentokil Initial Plc  slumped 5.6 percent as the world’s
largest maker of pest-control products posted a loss for 2010.  TomTom NV  tumbled 11 percent after Europe’s biggest maker of
portable navigation devices forecast “broadly flat” sales and
earnings in 2011.  Lafarge SA  jumped 4.1 percent after saying it
will merge its cement and ready mixed concrete businesses in the
U.K. with  Anglo American Plc .  The Stoxx 600 lost 0.1 percent to 291.02 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London . Even so, the gauge climbed 1.1 percent this
past week, its third straight weekly advance. The rally has
pushed the measure’s valuation to more than 15 times the
reported profits of its companies, near the highest level in
nine months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is just the start from  China  and they will continue
tightening lending and raising interest rates,” Philippe Gijsels, the Brussels-based head of research at BNP Paribas
Fortis Global Markets, said. “If the Chinese start to take out
the liquidity that’s been so important, it’s got the potential
to be a disturbance for the world’s stock markets.”  National benchmark indexes declined in 8 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.1 percent,
while Germany’s DAX Index added 0.3 percent and France’s CAC 40
Index gained 0.1 percent.  Stoxx 600 Earnings  About 56 percent of Stoxx 600 companies that have reported
annual profit since Jan. 10 have topped analysts’ estimates for
per-share profit, Bloomberg data show.  Stocks slid after China increased its banks’ reserve
requirement ratio for the second time this year to counter
inflation and curb property-price gains. Reserve ratios will
increase half a percentage point starting on Feb. 24, the
People’s Bank of China said. Today’s move came 10 days after
China last raised  interest rates .  European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the bank may need to raise interest rates as global
inflation pressures mount, without specifying when the bank
might increase rates.  In Egypt, the Foreign Ministry approved a request from Iran
to let two warships pass through the Suez Canal on their way to
Syria.  Rentokil slumped 5.6 percent to 92.5 pence, its largest
decline since November, after posting a loss for 2010 because
early winter snow in the U.K. hampered efforts to turnaround its
City Link parcel-delivery unit. Rentokil reported a 23.4
million-pound ($38 million) net loss, compared with a 47.6
million-pound profit in 2009. City Link’s operating loss,
excluding amortization and one-off gains or costs, widened to
9.6 million pounds from 5.6 million pounds.  TomTom, Schibsted  TomTom tumbled 11 percent to 6.47 euros after the
navigation-device maker reported a fourth-quarter operating
profit of 65 million euros ($88.8 million). TomTom also forecast
“broadly flat” sales and earnings per share in 2011.    Schibsted ASA  dropped 3.5 percent to 174.70 kroner after
Norway’s biggest media company reported fourth-quarter earnings
that missed estimates and it proposed a lower-than-predicted
dividend of 2 billion euros this year.    Eutelsat Communications  SA lost 1.7 percent to 28.40 euros
even as the world’s third-largest satellite company said fiscal
first-half profit climbed 25 percent, aided by demand for
capacity on its satellites.  Lafarge, Voestalpine  Lafarge gained 4.1 percent to 47.90 euros as the French
company and Anglo American announced that they will merge their
cement and ready mixed concrete businesses in the U.K.
Separately, Lafarge proposed cutting its dividend to 1 euro a
share from 2 euros a share. The company also pledged to reduce
debt this year to protect its investment-grade credit rating.
Lafarge posted fourth-quarter net income of 62 million euros,
compared with a 38-million euro loss a year earlier. That was in
line with analysts’ estimates for a 64.5 million-euro profit.
Anglo American lost 2.1 percent to 3,227 pence.    Voestalpine AG  gained 1.8 percent to 33.80 euros as
Austria’s biggest steelmaker increased its profit forecast for
2011 for the second time in a month, citing the economic
recovery in Asia,  South America  and Europe.    Northumbrian Water Group Plc  rallied 3.5 percent to 326.1
pence as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised buying the shares,
saying that the provider of water to households in the northeast
of England remains the cheapest U.K. water company and could
rally 28 percent.  Greek banks rallied after  National Bank of Greece SA 
offered to buy Alpha Bank SA for about 2.9 billion euros.  EFG
Eurobank Ergasias SA  rallied 17 percent to 5.26 euros, the
biggest gain since its 1999 initial public offering, while  Piraeus Bank SA  surged 15 percent to 1.87 euros, its largest
increase in more than two years. National Bank and Alpha Bank
were suspended from trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
