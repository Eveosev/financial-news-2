Chile’s Economy Minister Juan Andres Fontaine said influencing the value of the  U.S. dollar  is not
the government’s primary concern,  Diario Financiero  reported.  Chile’s government is focused on improving the investment
climate and increasing productivity to counteract the negative
effect the peso’s appreciation is having on exporters, the
Santiago-based financial newspaper cited the minister as saying
in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
