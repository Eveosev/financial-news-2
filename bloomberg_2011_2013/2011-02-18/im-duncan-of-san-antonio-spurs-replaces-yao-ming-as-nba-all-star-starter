     Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -  Tim Duncan  of the San Antonio Spurs
will start at center for the injured Houston Rockets’ Yao Ming
in the National Basketball Association All-Star game, Western
Conference coach Gregg Popovich said.  Yao, who was voted a starter by fans, is sidelined for the
rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left ankle. NBA
Commissioner David Stern selected Minnesota Timberwolves forward
Kevin Love to take Yao’s spot on the roster.  The 34-year-old Duncan will be appearing in his 13th
consecutive All-Star game. The decision, announced yesterday by
Spurs coach Popovich, means Duncan will be making his 12th
straight start. Among active players, that’s second only to the
13 straight starts by the  Los Angeles  Lakers’  Kobe Bryant .  The 60th NBA All-Star game will be held Feb. 20 at the
Staples Center in Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
