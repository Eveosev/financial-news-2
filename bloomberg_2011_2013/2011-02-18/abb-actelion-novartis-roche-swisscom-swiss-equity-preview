Swiss stocks rose as the  Swiss
Market Index  advanced for a third week.    ABB Ltd . climbed 1.6 percent. Holcim Ltd., the world’s
second-biggest cement maker, rose after Lafarge SA forecast
cement demand in its markets will grow.  Nestle SA , the world’s
largest food company, slipped after ZKB cut its recommendation
on the shares.  The SMI of the biggest and most actively traded companies
increased 0.2 percent to 6,717.25 in Zurich, rising 0.8 percent
this week. The benchmark gauge has climbed 4.4 percent this year
as investors speculated that the economic recovery is
accelerating and policies to support indebted euro-area
countries will succeed. The broader Swiss Performance Index
advanced 0.1 percent today.  “The feeling has been really good since the start of the
year,” said John Plassard, director at Louis Capital Markets in
Geneva. “The banking system is coming back. The next three to
six months should be clear.”  ABB, the largest maker of power-transmission gear, advanced
1.6 percent to 22.76 francs after falling 3.3 percent yesterday.
Underperformance by ABB stock provides a good entry point for
investors, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Holcim climbed 3.3 percent to 71.15 francs. Lafarge, the
world’s biggest cement maker, forecast cement demand in its
markets will grow by 3 percent to 6 percent in 2011 as developed
markets “continue to slowly recover” and emerging economies
remain the main driver. Pricing “is expected to move higher,”
it said.  Nestle slipped 1.2 percent to 52.25 francs. ZKB cut the
stock to “underweight” from “market weight.”    Actelion Ltd . retreated 1.6 percent to 52.7 francs. The
stock was cut to “equal-weight” from “overweight” at
Barclays Capital.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. advanced 1.8 percent to 59.25 francs.
The stock is up 6.8 percent this week. The world’s second-
biggest reinsurer on Feb. 17 said it almost tripled its dividend
after repaying capital injected by  Warren Buffett .  To contact the reporter on this story:
