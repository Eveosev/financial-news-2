  Ageas , the Belgian insurer formerly
known as Fortis, agreed to buy 31 percent of Turkey’s  Aksigorta
AS  for $220 million.  Ageas will buy the stake from  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS 
and become a 50-50 partner with Sabanci in the venture, Sabanci
said in a filing with the Istanbul Stock Exchange today.  Turkey’s insurance industry, which makes up less than 1
percent of the country’s gross domestic product, compared with 4
percent to 5 percent in the European Union, has attracted
investment from companies such as Groupama SA, Mapfre SA, Zurich
Financial Services, AXA SA and Aviva Plc into non-life and its
new pension-fund sector.  Ageas and Sabanci will have equal control in Aksigorta’s
management, according to the statement. No offer will be made to
buy the remaining shares in the company from minority
shareholders, it said.  Aksigorta fell 1 kurus, or 0.4 percent, to 2.38 liras on
the main  ISE National 100 index  yesterday.  Citigroup Inc. and Turkish broker Ak Yatirim were hired as
advisers for the sale in March last year.  -Editor: Mark Bentley  To contact the reporter on this story:
