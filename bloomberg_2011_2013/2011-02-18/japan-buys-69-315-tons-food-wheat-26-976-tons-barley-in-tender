Japan bought 69,315 metric tons of
food wheat and 26,976 tons of food barley today through a tender
system introduced to loosen government grain-import controls.  The shipments must be made by May 31, said Masafumi Otsuka
at the grain-trade division of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries. Of the total wheat, 39,780 tons were
from  Canada  and 29,000 tons were from Australia and the
remaining volume was from the U.S. and France. Of the total
barley, 25,000 tons were from  Australia  and the rest was from
Germany.  The tender was held under the so-called simultaneous buy-
and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
