Credit-default swaps on  Saudi Arabia 
surged on concern political unrest in neighboring Bahrain will
spread to the world’s biggest oil exporter.  Swaps on Saudi Arabia, used as a measure of confidence in
the country although they reference no debt, jumped 11.5 basis
points to 138, the highest since July 2009, according to CMA.
Contracts on Bahrain rose for a fifth day, climbing 21 basis
points to 307, the highest in 19 months.  Governments are cracking down on pro-democracy activists as
uprisings that toppled autocratic leaders in Tunisia and Egypt
spread to  Libya ,  Iran ,  Algeria  and  Yemen . Clashes in Bahrain, a
close Saudi ally, increased as security forces used tear gas
against protesters, gunfire was heard and ambulances were on the
streets of the capital.  “The impact of Saudi unrest on  oil prices  would escalate
further the inflationary pressures already building within the
global economy,” said Greg Venizelos, a credit strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in London.  Unrest in Bahrain, which is linked by a 26-kilometer (16-
mile) causeway with Saudi Arabia, and whose capital, Manama, is
only a four-hour drive from  Riyadh , has in the past spread
across the border. In 1995 the Saudi government arrested a large
number of Shiite Muslims in the Eastern Province on suspicion of
involvement in protests taking place in Bahrain, according to
Human Rights Watch.  Oil Rises  A member of the Saudi royal family, Prince Talal Bin Abdul
Aziz, said in an interview with BBC Arabic TV that unless King
Abdullah introduces more political participation and human
rights, the nation may also see protests.  “Unless problems facing Saudi Arabia are solved, what
happened and is still happening in some Arab countries,
including  Bahrain , could spread to Saudi Arabia, even worse,”
Prince Talal told the London-based TV broadcaster in an
interview aired late yesterday.  Crude oil rose in New York, headed for its first weekly
gain in three weeks. Crude for March delivery increased $1, or
1.2 percent, to $87.36 a barrel at 9:34 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, it touched $87.56. The contract,
which expires Feb. 22, has risen 2.1 percent this week. The more
active April contract gained $1.31, or 1.5 percent, to $90.15.  Tension is building throughout the Middle East. Credit-
default swaps on Dubai increased 13 to 436,  Abu Dhabi  was up 6
at 107 and Qatar rose 3 basis points to 105, all the highest
since Jan. 31.  Egypt  increased 5 basis points to 355 and  Israel 
was up 5 at 152, the highest since July 2009.  Medium Term  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting $10
million of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
$1,000 a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  “Tensions in the Middle East are nothing new, but the
latest bout covers virgin territory and has the potential to
extend from the short to the medium term,” Harpreet Parhar, a
strategist at Credit Agricole SA in London, wrote in a note.  Unrest in the Middle East so far has had limited impact on
sentiment outside the region. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index
of 50 companies with mostly junk credit ratings fell as much as
6 basis points to 379, the lowest since Jan. 3, 2008, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The index cost 384 basis points at 3
p.m. in  London .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was rose 0.5 basis point to 96.75. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers rose 1.25
basis point to 161.75 and the subordinated index was unchanged
at 270.  To contact the reporter on this story:
