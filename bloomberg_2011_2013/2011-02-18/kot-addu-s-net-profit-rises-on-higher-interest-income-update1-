Kot Addu Power Co.,  Pakistan ’s
biggest non-state electricity producer, posted a 31 percent
increase in second-quarter profit after interest from dues rose.  Net income in the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to 1.81
billion rupees ($21 million), or 2.06 rupees a share, from 1.38
billion rupees, or 1.57 rupees, a year earlier, the Lahore-based
company said in a filing to the  Karachi Stock Exchange  today.  Kot Addu operates a 1,600 megawatt plant that can use
furnace oil, natural gas and diesel to generate electricity,
which is sold to the state-run  Water & Power Development
Authority . According to the company’s agreement with the
government, Kot Addu earns interest if payments from Water &
Power are delayed.  “The government has to pay 47 billion rupees to Kot
Addu,” said Usman Saeed, a research analyst at Arif Habib Ltd.
in Karachi, who has a “buy” recommendation on the stock.
“Interest income on dues helped the company to improve profit
after sales declined.”  Kot Addu’s other operating income rose to 2.43 billion
rupees during the quarter from 582.9 million rupees a year
earlier, according to the statement. Administrative expenses
fell 16 percent to 88.75 million rupees. Sales fell 34 percent
to 13.8 billion rupees.  “During the second quarter, the government reduced its
power purchase from the company,” said Farrah Marwat, a
research analyst at KASB Securities Ltd. in Karachi. “The
floods left enough water for power generation from dams.”  Kot Addu gained as much as 4.4 percent to 44.50 rupees and
traded at 43.80 rupees at 12:29 p.m. in Karachi. The stock has
climbed 7.7 percent this year. The benchmark Karachi Stock
Exchange 100 index was little changed over the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
