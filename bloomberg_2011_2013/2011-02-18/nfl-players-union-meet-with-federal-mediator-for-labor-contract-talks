The  National Football League  and its
players union began meeting with a federal mediator in  Washington  for discussions aimed at reaching a new labor
agreement.  “George Cohen, the director of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, has requested, and both sides have agreed,
that the NFL Players Association and the NFL refrain from making
any public comments about any aspect of the mediation process,”
both sides said in a joint news release.  NFL owners voted in 2008 to end the labor deal this year,
saying it didn’t account for costs such as those of building
stadiums. Issues in the talks include what share of revenue
players should get, expanding the season to 18 games from 16, a
rookie pay cap and health care.  To contact the reporter on this story:
