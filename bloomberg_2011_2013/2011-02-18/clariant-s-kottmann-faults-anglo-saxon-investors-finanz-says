Clariant AG did not pay too much to
acquire Sued-Chemie AG despite the market’s reaction, Finanz &
Wirtschaft cited Chief Executive Officer Hariolf Kottmann as
saying in a pre-release on an article to be published tomorrow.  “We knew exactly what we were buying,” Kottmann told the
paper. “The market reaction was triggered by Anglo-Saxon
investors who jumped in imagining they could make a profit.”  Clariant “will not make another acquisition of this size”
in the next two years, Kottmann said, adding that a dividend
payment “was an option” for 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
