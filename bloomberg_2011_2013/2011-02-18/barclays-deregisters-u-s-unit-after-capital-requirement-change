  Barclays Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest bank, deregistered Barclays Group U.S. as a bank-holding
company, partly to sidestep capital requirements mandated by the
Dodd-Frank Act.  “The purpose of the restructuring was to better align the
businesses with the appropriate capital regimes,” said the
London-based lender in an e-mailed statement today.  The U.S. Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 will require the U.S.
holding companies of overseas banks, such as Barclays, to comply
with the same capital rules as domestic lenders. They were
previously exempt as long as their foreign parents were
regulated by a U.S.-recognized entity.  Without the move, Barclays would have needed to add $12
billion to the U.S. bank-holding unit, according to the Wall
Street Journal, which reported the move earlier today.  Before the change,  Barclays Capital  was held within
Barclays Group U.S. Inc., which was subject to federal  capital
requirements . It will now be subject to Securities and Exchange
Commission regulation instead.  A Barclays spokesman in  London  declined to comment beyond
the statement. The bank disclosed the restructuring when it
reported earnings this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
