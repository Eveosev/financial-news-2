  American Airlines , the third-biggest
U.S. carrier, will bring 200 more furloughed flight attendants
back to work in the second such recall announced this month.  American also can hire up to 30 new flight attendants who
speak Chinese Mandarin, under an accord announced today by the
 Association of Professional Flight Attendants  and the Fort
Worth, Texas-based carrier. The agreement extends unlimited
recall rights to 228 remaining furloughed attendants.  The move is the latest by airlines expanding employment as
they return to profit and add back some capacity pared during
the recession.  Southwest Airlines Co . is hiring 200 attendants,
US Airways Group Inc. is adding 420 and recalling 80 pilots and  Delta Air Lines Inc . is growing by 1,000 attendants.  “This is tremendous news,” Laura Glading, union
president, said in the statement. “I am extremely happy that
even more people will be back to work.”  During the recession, U.S. carriers cut flights the most
since 1942 because of sagging demand. Employment at U.S.
airlines rose 0.2 percent in December, the first time since June
2008, the U.S.  Bureau of Transportation Statistics  said today.  American said Feb. 9 it would bring 368 attendants back to
work. The carrier last October began recalling 545 flight
attendants and 250 pilots to work. Airline labor contracts
generally require companies to give laid-off workers a chance to
return to their jobs before hiring new employees.  LAX to Shanghai  The latest agreement calls for 100 attendants to return by
July 15, with another 100 returning by Oct. 15. The Chinese-
speaking attendants are needed for a Los Angeles-to-Shanghai
route at American.  The recalls were announced as the flight attendants’ union
pushes federal mediators to declare contract talks with American
at an impasse, moving the union a step closer to a possible
strike. The union, which represents 16,550 active-duty
attendants, has been negotiating with American since September
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
