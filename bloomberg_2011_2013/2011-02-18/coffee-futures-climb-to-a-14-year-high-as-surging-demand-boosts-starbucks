Coffee extended a rally to the
highest since 1997 on signs that global demand will outstrip
production as investors snapped up shares of U.S. retailers
including  Starbucks Corp . in a bet that sales will increase.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc., the largest U.S.
seller of single-serve brewers, trades in  New York  at 295 times
cash flow, more than any company in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, according to Bloomberg data. Arabica-coffee futures have
doubled in the past year as adverse global weather slashed
supplies including in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer.  Consumers are drinking more coffee in the past year as
demand has rebounded amid the global economic recovery.
Inventories monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have plunged to the
lowest since April 2000. Green Mountain shares have jumped 47
percent in the 12 months before today, and Starbucks, the
world’s largest coffee-shop operator, gained 45 percent. The  S&P
500  was up 22 percent in that time.  “Demand is pretty strong,” said Thomas Mikulski, a senior
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “There are no
fresh developments on new crops, so that has left the market
focusing on current tight supplies.”  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery gained $4.15, or
1.5 percent, to settle at $2.73 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $2.759, the highest since May
1997.  ‘Can’t Drink Enough’  “People just can’t seem to drink enough coffee,” said
John Carey, a Boston-based money manager at Pioneer Investments,
which oversees about $250 billion.  Surging prices will also boost expenses for retailers.
Costs “will get progressively worse,” Thomas Cawley, the chief
financial officer of Peet’s Coffee & Tea Inc., said this week.  The  International Coffee Organization  said global supplies
probably will stay around 13 million bags, the lowest since the
organization began keeping records in the 1960s.  A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  In  London , robusta-coffee futures for May delivery advanced
$32, or 1.4 percent, to $2,337 a metric ton.  Arabica is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed by
specialty companies including Starbucks. Robusta beans, used in
instant coffee, are harvested mostly in  Asia  and parts of
Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
