The  European Central Bank  expanded
purchases of Portuguese government bonds, according to two
people with knowledge of the transactions.  The central bank returned to the market to buy the
securities, said the people, asking not to be identified because
the deals are confidential. The ECB bought debt due in five
years, one of two people said earlier. A spokesman for the
central bank in  Frankfurt  declined to comment. A spokeswoman
declined to comment about the additional purchases.  Portuguese bonds rebounded from earlier declines, with the
10-year yield little changed at 7.45 percent as of 3:04 p.m. in
London. The yield reached 7.59 percent, the most since Feb. 10,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on the five-
year note was little changed at 7.04 percent after rising to the
most since before the euroâ€™s start in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
