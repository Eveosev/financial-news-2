A U.S. government operation
targeting 10 child-pornography websites led to the inadvertent
seizure of a number of lawful sites, a spokeswoman for
Immigration and Customs Enforcement said today in a statement.  The operation, carried out by the Homeland Security and
Justice departments, was announced in a  news release  Tuesday.  “During the course of a joint DHS and DOJ law enforcement
operation targeting 10 websites providing explicit child
pornographic content, a higher level domain name and linked
sites were inadvertently seized for a period of time,” Cori
Bassett, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman said
in an e-mailed statement. “Those sites were restored as soon as
possible to normal functionality.”  The statement did not indicate the number of lawful
websites that were affected.  "I think that given that they’ve admitted they’ve made this
mistake, they need to do a lot more to set the record straight,"
said Corynne McSherry, intellectual property director for the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy rights group
