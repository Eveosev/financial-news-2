Poland should consider temporary
changes in transfers to private pension funds to slow down an
increase of public debt, central bank Governor Marek Belka wrote
in an article on Rp.pl, the website of Rzeczpospolita newspaper.  Still, changes to the pension system will not “replace
fiscal consolidation,” Belka said. A “sudden fiscal
tightening” may curb the growth of the Polish economy and is
not needed now from the point of view of financing of the  budget
deficit , he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
