  Stagecoach Group Plc  has been told
by U.S. authorities that its joint venture to operate  New York 
City sightseeing buses has too much market power and must split
up or sell a unit, the Financial Times reported.  The venture, called Twin America, was formed in 2009
between Stagecoach’s Gray Line and a closely held company called
CitySights NY and has almost 90 percent of New York’s
sightseeing market, the newspaper said.  The U.S. Surface Transportation Board found that savings
resulting from the transaction, estimated at $7 million to $11
million, weren’t passed on to customers; fares rose between 10
percent and 17 percent, which the board described as “a
hallmark of unrestrained market power,” the FT said.  Twin America, in which Stagecoach has 50 percent of the  voting rights  and 60 percent of the economic rights, has been
told that it can either split up again or sell its interstate
services between New York and  New Jersey , Washington,
Philadelphia and Canada, the newspaper said.  Stagecoach said it has complied at all times with its
obligations, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
