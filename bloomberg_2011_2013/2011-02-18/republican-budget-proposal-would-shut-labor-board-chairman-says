A Republican plan to cut $50
million, or 18 percent, from the  National Labor Relations
Board ’s budget would force furloughs, shutting the agency that
handles labor-management disputes, the chairman said.  The measure pending in the Republican-led U.S. House also
would curtail investigations of illegal practices by employers
and unions and halt oversight of workplace union elections, NLRB
Chairman Wilma Liebman said today in an e-mailed  statement .  The proposed cut would “occur at a great cost to working
people and responsible employers trying to survive the difficult
economic climate, and would have the potential to destabilize
relations between labor and business,” she said.  Lawmakers are considering a House bill that would eliminate
at least $61 billion in spending. A vote may occur as soon as
today, sending the measure to the Senate where a Democratic
majority is likely to reject the plan. Failure to pass the bill,
which would continue spending when temporary authority expires,
raises the possibility of a government shutdown.  Republicans have said the labor board has become pro-union
at a time when the Obama administration has tried to help
businesses and grow the economy.  The proposed funding cut would would require the board to
furlough all its staff for 55 days, Liebman said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Holly Rosenkrantz in  Washington  at   hrosenkrantz@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
