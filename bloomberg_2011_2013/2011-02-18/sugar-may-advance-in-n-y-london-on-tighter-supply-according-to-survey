Sugar futures may advance next week
on mounting concern that production will trail demand.  Five of 12 traders, analysts, and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar traded in  New York  will rise,
while four said it will decline. Three were neutral. Before
today, prices fell 1.8 percent this week to 28.86 cents a pound
on ICE Futures U.S.  Refined sugar may gain on London’s NYSE Liffe, said five of
10 respondents. Four said it will fall, and one was neutral.  Seven of 10 people surveyed said refined sugar’s premium
over raw sweetener will widen. One said it will narrow, and two
expect it to be little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
