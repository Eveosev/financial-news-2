  Rentokil Initial Plc , the world’s
largest pest-control company, posted a loss for 2010 after snow
in the U.K. hurt turnaround efforts at the City Link parcel-
delivery unit.  The net loss was 23.4 million pounds ($37.8 million)
compared with net income of 47.6 million pounds in 2009,
Rentokil said today in a statement. City Link’s adjusted
operating loss, excluding currency effects, widened to 9.4
million pounds from 5.6 million pounds.  Rentokil Chief Executive Officer Alan Brown took over City
Link’s day-to-day operations in December in a bid to stem losses
at the division. He replaced Stuart Godman, who was the second
City Link manager to leave in 18 months. Snow that disrupted
traffic in Britain late last year hampered Rentokil’s efforts to
return the business to profit.  “City Link’s operational inefficiencies are expected to be
addressed by October 2011, but financial delivery will be weak
until then,” Brown said in today’s statement.  Revenue fell to 2.5 billion pounds from 2.53 billion
pounds, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
