  TeliaSonera AB ,  Sweden ’s biggest
phone company, offered to spend as much as 9.9 billion kronor
($1.5 billion) to buy back shares at a 17 percent premium over
yesterday’s closing price.  Shareholders were offered the right to sell one share at 62
kronor for every 28 owned, Stockholm-based TeliaSonera said in a
statement today. TeliaSonera rose as much as 1.9 percent and
traded at 53.65 kronor at 2:05 p.m. in the Swedish capital.  TeliaSonera, which also  operates  phone companies from  Norway  to  Nepal , this month raised its dividend and forecast
improved sales and profitability after fourth-quarter earnings
beat estimates. The company’s balance sheet will still leave
“good flexibility” to increase ownership in subsidiaries,
Chief Executive Officer Lars Nyberg said Feb. 3 after announcing
the buyback program approval and quarterly earnings.  “When we have earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to debt of 1.2, 1.3 and we don’t
want to buy something, then we have an obligation to return that
money to the shareholders,” Nyberg said Feb. 3.  The company, which boosted its stakes in its Nepalese,
Uzbek and Estonian subsidiaries over the past few years, said
last month that it’s interested in buying Polish mobile-phone
operator Polkomtel SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
