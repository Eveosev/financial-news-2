  LyondellBasell Industries NV  plans
to restart an olefins unit this weekend at the La Porte chemical
plant in  Texas , Jim Gallogly, the company’s chief executive
officer, said in a conference call with investors and analysts.  “La Porte was increasing operating rates when it
encountered an unrelated issue and temporarily shut down,”
Gallogly said. “We expect to restart the facility this
weekend.”  Lyondell plans to begin a startup at 6 p.m. local time
today and flare until 6 p.m. Feb. 23, according to a  filing  with
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  The Netherlands-based company also plans second-quarter
maintenance on one of the steam crackers at its Channelview
complex, Gallogly said.  “It’s been nine years since the last turnaround on this
cracker,” he said. A turnaround on the second cracker at the
site is scheduled for 2012, according to Gallogly.  The cracker uses pressure and heat to split oil products
like naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases.  The La Porte complex, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of
Houston, produces ethylene, propylene, linear low-density
polyethylene and low-density polyethylene, according to the
company  website .  The Channelview complex, 20 miles east of Houston, has two
olefin units at the north-side plant that manufacture ethylene,
propylene, butadiene and benzene, according to the company
 website . The south-side plant uses many of these products to
produce gasoline blending products and other chemicals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
