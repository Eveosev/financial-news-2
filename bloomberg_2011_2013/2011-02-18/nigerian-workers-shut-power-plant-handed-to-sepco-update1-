Nigerian workers have shut down the
Olorunshogo Power Plant to protest a government decision to hand
it over to  SepcoIII Electric Power Construction Corp.  of  China ,
a labor union leader said.  The workers closed down the plant two days ago on concern
the agreement may lead to job losses, Joe Ajaero, general
secretary of the National Union of Electricity Employees, said
today by phone from Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. The
government ceded the power plant to SepcoIII, on Feb. 15.  “On the day the government handed over the power plant to
the Chinese, they barred workers from entering some sections, so
by the next day, the workers decided to equally lock out the
Chinese,” Ajaero said.  Africa’s most populous nation and top oil producer plans to
sell six state-owned transmission and 11 thermal-generation
companies by July, Minister of State for Power Nuhu Wya said in
November. Power cuts occur daily in  Nigeria , where demand for
electricity is almost double the current supply of more than
3,000 megawatts. The government wants to increase output to
14,019 megawatts by 2013.  Electricity workers oppose the plan, saying that private
and public industries should be allowed to compete. They also
say that selling off state power assets will lead to job losses.  Labor unrest may spread unless the government and companies
reach agreements with workers on  job security  before changing
ownership of  power plants , Ajaero said.  “We could have worse problems by the time the government
hands over the other power plants,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
