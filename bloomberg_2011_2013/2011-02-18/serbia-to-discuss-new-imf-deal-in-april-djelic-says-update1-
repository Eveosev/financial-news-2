Serbia will probably discuss a new
agreement with the  International Monetary Fund  in April, when
the lender holds its spring session with the  World Bank , Deputy
Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said today in Belgrade.  The IMF this week started the formal final review of
Serbia’s policies and compliance with terms agreed under a 3
billion-euro ($4.1 billion) bailout loan, which runs through
April. The country has drawn half the funds available, central
bank Deputy Governor Bojan Markovic said on Feb. 16.  Serbia is struggling to emerge from its first recession
since 1999 when a NATO bombing, aimed at forcing the country’s
troops to withdraw from Kosovo, destroyed most of its
infrastructure. A new IMF agreement would probably be
precautionary, aimed at propping up investor confidence,
Markovic said.    Serbia  has great interest to ensure stability and
continuity in all important segments,” Djelic told reporters on
the sidelines of a parliamentary committee meeting today in
Belgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
