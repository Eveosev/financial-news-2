  Phoenix Beverages Ltd ., Mauritius’s
largest brewer and soft drinks maker, rose to its highest since
at least 1995 after it increased prices to compensate for higher
sugar costs.  The stock advanced 2 rupees, or 0.9 percent, to 220 rupees
by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis.  Phoenix may have rallied due to “the price readjustment on
its soft drinks following the surge in the sugar price at the
beginning of the year, which the bottler had yet to pass on to
clients,” Kishen Nadassen, a senior analyst at Port Louis-based
CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said by phone.  The new prices came into effect today, Nadassen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
