U.K. Business Secretary  Vince Cable ,
writing in the Financial Times, said the country needs private
investment to drive economic growth and the government’s role is
“to create an environment for business to expand, invest and
innovate.”  Financial stability through  deficit reduction  lays the
ground for the operation of business, beyond this, growth must
come from the private sector, not from government or private
consumption, Cable said, with traded activities such as
manufacturing taking a leading role.  The government’s growth strategy includes staying “out of
the way of private-sector recovery” and is based on a “liberal
economic policy” agenda of “deregulation, competition, free
trade and inward investment,” he wrote.  Describing the government’s approach as “pragmatic, not
ideological,” Cable said there are some market failures to
correct, in the energy, telecommunications, transport and waste
infrastructure markets, and state investments to be made,
including investing in education to address the country’s skills
deficit, and investing in science and technology in order to be
in a position to “cultivate next-generation technologies.”  Pledging reform in the land market and planning regime,
Cable said Project Merlin, committing banks to lend to small
businesses, will help offset the risks to growth posed by costly
bank finance.  “There is no quick or easy way out of the mess,” Cable
wrote. “But in eight months we have averted disaster and
created a platform for private sector recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
