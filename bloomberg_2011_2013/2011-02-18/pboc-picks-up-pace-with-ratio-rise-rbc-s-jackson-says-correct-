(Corrects abbreviation of bank in headline.)    Brian Jackson , an emerging-markets
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong , commented on
the Chinese central bank’s decision to raise the reserve ratio
requirement for lenders for the second time this year.  Jackson made comments by e-mail.  “Beijing was relatively slow to start normalizing monetary
policy over 2010 and this contributed to the recent acceleration
in headline inflation. But policy-makers have definitely picked
up the pace in the last few months, and today’s move is the
latest sign of this increased sense of urgency.  “We still think there is more to come in the months ahead,
including additional increases in policy rates and a faster pace
of currency appreciation. This won’t stop inflation moving
higher in the next few months, but the cumulative impact of
policy measures over the last six months should start to have an
impact later in the year.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
