U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  says the war in Afghanistan must have “an intensified
diplomatic push” to go along with the surge in combat troops to
ensure success and allow U.S. troops to withdraw.  The diplomatic “surge” will help “support an Afghan-led
political process to split the weakened Taliban off from al-
Qaeda and reconcile those who will renounce violence and accept
the Afghan constitution with an increasingly stable Afghan
government,” according to excerpts of a speech Clinton is
scheduled to deliver to the  Asia Society  in  New York  today.  “That would leave al-Qaeda alone and on the run,” Clinton
says in the speech excerpts released by the State Department.  She said the Obama administration is still committed to
begin withdrawing U.S. troops from  Afghanistan  in July “based
on conditions on the ground.” The military withdrawal is
scheduled to be completed at the end of 2014.  The U.S. and allies “will continue to support the
stability of the Afghan government and the durability of a
responsible political settlement,” Clinton says. “That is the
vision of transition -- shared by the Afghan government -- that
we are pursuing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
