Ghana’s  central bank left its
benchmark interest rate unchanged for the third consecutive
meeting of its monetary policy committee after inflation climbed
for the first time in 19 months.  The key lending rate was maintained at 13.5 percent, Bank
of  Ghana  Governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur told reporters today in
the capital, Accra. Six of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
had forecast the decision. One person expected it to be either
maintained or increased, without giving a specific figure.  “Although inflation has turned, we still see it within a
fairly narrow 300 basis-points range around the current print,”
said  Razia Khan , London-based head of Africa research at
Standard Chartered Plc, in an e-mailed note Feb 15.  Inflation accelerated to 9.1 percent in January from 8.6
percent the month before, as gasoline prices jumped 30 percent,
the Ghana Statistical Service said on Feb. 9. The central bank
lowered its key rate four times between November 2009 and July
last year as inflation slowed from a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009.  The bank is unwilling to raise rates as it looks to prevent
an appreciation of the cedi, Yvonne Mhango, sub-Saharan Africa
economist at  Renaissance Capital , said in an e-mailed note on
Feb. 15.  The Ghanaian currency has weakened 1.5 percent against the
dollar this year after declining 3.7 percent in 2010.  While Renaissance has increased its forecast for average
inflation this year to 10.5 percent from 9.3 percent, that does
not “call for a tightening of policy,” Mhango said. Higher
rates would attract more portfolio investment into the country,
strengthening the cedi and making it harder for local industry
to compete, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
