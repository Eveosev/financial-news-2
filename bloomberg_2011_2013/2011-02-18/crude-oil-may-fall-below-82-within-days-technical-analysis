Crude oil may fall below $82 a
barrel within days after settling below the 100-day moving
average twice this week, according to a  technical analysis  by
T&K Futures & Options.  The April contract, which becomes the front-month contract
on Feb. 23, closed below the 100-day average of $88.36 on Feb.
15 and Feb. 16. The last time the contract slipped below the
100-day average was Nov. 23, when the intraday low was $81.82.  “This is a trend ender,”  Michael Smith, president of T&K
in Port Saint Lucie,  Florida , said yesterday in an interview.
“If it closes below the average for several more days straight,
then it should go down to the Nov. 23 low.”  If the Nov. 23 support level is breached, the next support
will be at $79.88, the contract’s intraday low on Sept. 28,
Smith said.  To reverse the downward trend, “futures would have to
close above $88.36 for a couple of days in a row,” Smith said.
“Then there would be no resistance until $94.89, the Jan. 31
intraday high. It could get there pretty quick, within the next
week or two if it holds.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1 on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  yesterday settle at $88.84 a barrel. The
intraday low of $87.35 was below the 100-day moving average for
a third consecutive day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
