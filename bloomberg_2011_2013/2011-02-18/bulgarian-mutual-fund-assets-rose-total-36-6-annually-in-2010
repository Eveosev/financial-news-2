The assets of Bulgarian investment
funds rose 36.6 percent at the end of 2010 from the same period
a year ago as the country recovers from its worst recession in
13 years.  Assets managed by the 342 investment funds operating in the
Balkan nation rose to 878.8 million lev ($610 million) as of
December 31, from 643.5 million lev a year ago, the central bank
in Sofia said on its  Website  today.    Bulgaria  is recovering from a recession after a three-year
lending boom stalled and foreign investment dried up during the
global credit crisis. The  European Union’s  poorest country in
terms of per-capita GDP is counting on exports to boost economic
growth, which is forecast at 3.6 percent this year after a 2.1
percent expansion in the fourth quarter.  Assets managed by 98 domestically owned investment funds
21.1 percent in the year to 382.5 million lev, while assets
managed by the 244 foreign-owned funds grew 51.5 percent to
496.3 million lev, the central bank said. Pioneer Investments,
the asset management arm of UniCredit SpA, is the biggest
international fund in Bulgaria.  Insurance companies and pension funds are the main
investors in the foreign funds, holding 51 percent of their
assets, the central bank said.  Bulgarian funds invested mostly in equity. In terms of
currency structure, 79 percent of the Bulgarian investment
funds’ assets are in lev, and 17.2 percent in euros. The rest
are denominated in other currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
