Peru’s sol fell from a 34-month high
as local banks added to dollar positions on concern the central
bank will buy the U.S. currency to offset capital inflows.  The sol weakened less than 0.1 percent to 2.7675 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close of trading, from 2.7663 yesterday.  Banks sought to increase their dollar holdings after the
sol rose to its highest level since May 2008 yesterday and
approached 2.76 per dollar, a level which may prompt the central
bank to purchase dollars, Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco
Santander  in  Lima , said in an e-mailed note to clients.  The central bank last purchased dollars a week ago, buying
$130 million at an average 2.7658 per dollar. The central bank
didn’t buy dollars today, according to its website.  Peruvian banks had a negative dollar position including
dollar forwards contracts of $138 million yesterday, according
to central bank data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 was unchanged at 6.05 percent, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
