Ontario Finance Minister Dwight
Duncan discussed the proposed merger of the companies that own
the Toronto and  London  stock exchanges with their chief
executive officers last week and was unimpressed by the case
they presented, the Globe & Mail reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, he questioned whether
Thomas Kloet, who heads TMX Group Inc., and Xavier Rolet, his
counterpart at London Stock Exchange Group Plc, have thought
through the substance of their proposal, since they made a poor
job of communicating it.   If Canada needs to participate in global stock-exchange
consolidation, Duncan said, it might be better to reach an
agreement with the U.S., the country’s biggest trading partner,
rather than with the U.K., the Globe & Mail reported.  London isn’t a “particularly robust” market, Duncan told
the newspaper, and it might be better for the Toronto exchange
to join the merger of  Deutsche Boerse AG  and  NYSE Euronext .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
