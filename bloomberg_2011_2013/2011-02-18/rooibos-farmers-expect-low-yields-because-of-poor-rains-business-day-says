  South Africa ’s rooibos tea industry
expects low yields this season after poor rains led to smaller
harvests,  Business Day  reported.  Low stocks may also put pressure on prices of the leaf, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing Donnee MacDougall,
director of marketing for the South African Rooibos Council, an
industry body.  Rooibos, which means  “red bush”  in Afrikaans, is a
popular herbal tea in South Africa, made from the leaves of a
plant commonly found in the country’s Western Cape province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
