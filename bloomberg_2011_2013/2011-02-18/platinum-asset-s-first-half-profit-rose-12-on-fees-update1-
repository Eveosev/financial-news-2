  Platinum Asset Management Ltd . said
first-half profit rose 12 percent as management fees climbed.  Net profit for the six months ended Dec. 31 increased to
A$78.4 million ($79.4 million) from A$69.9 million a year
earlier, the Sydney-based company said in a statement today.  Asset managers in  Australia , home to the world’s fourth-
largest pool of pension assets, face weaker flows of new money
as volatility on stock markets and uncertainty about sovereign
debt leaves investors jittery. Platinum rival, Axa Asia Pacific
Holdings Ltd., said this week that full-year profit fell 11
percent as assets under management dropped.  Assets under management as at Dec. 31 totaled A$18.3
billion, Platinum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
