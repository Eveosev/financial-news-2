Copper may fall as lower prices
encourage consumers to delay purchases and await further
declines, a survey showed.  Eleven of 18 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 61 percent, said the metal will drop next week.
Five predicted higher prices and two forecast little change.
Copper for delivery in three months was down 2.3 percent for
this week at $9,730 a metric ton at 4 p.m. yesterday on the
London Metal Exchange.  “I imagine consumers will hold off from buying to see how
far the correction runs,” said  William Adams , an analyst at
Basemetals.com in London. The metal rose to a record $10,190 a
ton this week, stoking speculation about demand destruction and
substitution.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of Feb. 11.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
58 of the past 124 weeks, or 47 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bearish: 11 Bullish: 5 Hold: 2  To contact the reporter on this story:
