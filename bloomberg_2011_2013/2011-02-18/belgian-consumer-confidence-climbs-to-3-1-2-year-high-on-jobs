Belgian  consumer confidence  improved
in February, erasing two months of declines and climbing to the
highest level in more than 3 1/2 years, because of brightening
economic prospects and easing concerns about the job market.  The consumer sentiment index for Belgium increased to 1,
the highest value since June 2007, from minus 3 in January, the
Brussels-based National Bank of  Belgium  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  A gauge measuring concerns about rising unemployment in the
coming year fell to 8, the lowest level since April 2008, and a
sub-index gauging householdsâ€™ assessment of the economy in the
coming year increased to 4, the highest reading since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
