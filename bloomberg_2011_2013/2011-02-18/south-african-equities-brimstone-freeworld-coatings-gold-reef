  South Africa ’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index declined for a fourth day, losing 170.77, or 0.5
percent, to 32,552.14 as of 2:45 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.    Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 11 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, fell for a fourth day, losing 7.42 rand, or 2 percent, to
373.65 rand, the lowest intraday level since Feb. 2. Anglo will
prioritize investments in growth projects over dividends, Chief
Executive Officer Cynthia Carroll said.  Brimstone Investment Corp. (BRN SJ), gained 35 cents, or
6.3 percent, to 5.95 rand, the highest intraday level since Aug.
23. The investment holding company said earnings per share
excluding one-time items probably rose to between 1.62 rand and
1.94 rand in the year to Dec. 31, from 1.31 rand a year earlier.    Freeworld Coatings Ltd . (FWD SJ), a paint supplier, dropped
for the fourth day in five, losing 21 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
11.60 rand. The company’s board said it will continue to
“monitor developments” regarding Kansai Paint Co. Ltd.’s offer
to buy the South African company. The Securities Regulation
Panel, which regulates takeovers, yesterday ruled that Kansai’s
offer circular contained enough information for Freeworld
shareholders to make a decision.    Simmer & Jack Mines Ltd . (SIM SJ), a gold mining company,
fell the most since Jan. 26, losing as much as 4.4 percent,
before recovering to trade 3.3 percent lower at 89 cents. A
shaft at the company’s Buffelsfontein mine in South Africa was
closed yesterday following a fatal accident.    Vox Telecom Ltd . (VOX SJ), an internet-service and software
company, fell for a second day, losing 1 cent, or 2.5 percent,
to 39 cents, the lowest since Nov. 23. Chief Executive Officer
Tony van Marken has resigned with effect from March 31, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
