A gauge of U.K. residential rents
fell for a second month in January as more property investors
entered the buy-to-let market, pushing up supply,  LSL Property
Services Plc  said.  The average monthly rent for a home in England and  Wales 
fell 0.3 percent to 682 pounds ($1,102) from December, the
lowest average since July, the Newcastle, England-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today. From a year earlier, it was
up 4 percent.  While rents rose last year as prospective homebuyers were
put off purchases as banks curbed mortgages and the government’s
budget squeeze undermined confidence, lending to landlords is
now increasing, bolstering the number of properties for rent,
LSL said. The number of buy-to-let loans rose 6 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to the  Council of Mortgage Lenders .  “The recent loosening in the buy-to-let mortgage market
has boosted the supply of rental homes on the market, a crucial
factor in the temporary drop in rents,” David Newnes, estate
agency managing director of LSL, said in the statement. “There
are signs that this trend is continuing into 2011.”  The decline in rents in December and January may also be
partly caused by landlords cutting asking prices during the
slower holiday season to avoid properties being empty, Newnes
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Scott Hamilton  in London at
