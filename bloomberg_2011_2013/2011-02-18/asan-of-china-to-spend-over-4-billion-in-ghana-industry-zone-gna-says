Hasan International Holding Group  of  China  plans to invest more than $4 billion in the Sekondi
Industrial Freezone in western Ghana, the state-owned Ghana News
Agency reported.  The first stage of the project will be the construction of
an aluminum processing complex, the Accra-based agency said,
citing Luke Luang, president of Hasan’s local unit, who spoke at
a ceremony in Sekondi-Takoradi yesterday.  The development, near the port city of Takoradi, would also
include logistics terminals, housing and exhibition centers,
government news said. Ghana’s government will build two hydro-
electric  power plants  on the nearby Pra River to provide
electricity for the industrial zone, the report added, citing
Kobina Prah Annan, chief executive officer of metropolitan
Sekondi-Takoradi.  In September Hasan International’s Chairman Zheng Gang
signed a $2 billion letter of intent with  Ghana ’s Trade Ministry
to develop the Sekondi area, according to a  statement  on the
company’s website. The project, located near the offshore
Jubilee oilfield, will also help develop Ghana’s petro-chemical
industry, it said.  Hasan will build the industrial area and be responsible for
“organizing and inviting both Chinese and Ghanaian
enterprises,” the company said.  Ghana currently earns most of its export income from cocoa
and gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
