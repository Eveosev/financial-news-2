Czech economic ministers agreed on
the basic parameters of a pension-system overhaul that will
strengthen private savings for retirement,  Lidove Noviny 
reported, citing Social Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Viktorie
Plivova.  Private saving for retirement will be voluntary and the
government may unify value-added tax at 20 percent to cover the
deficit in the state-run pay-as-you-go pension system, the
newspaper reported. The government is to debate the proposal on
Feb. 23, Lidove said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
