Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 11:30 a.m. Jakarta-time break.  The  Jakarta Composite index  advanced 60.51 points, or 1.8
percent, to 3,494.89, set for the steepest advance since Jan.
26. The measure rose 3 percent in the holiday-shortened week.  PT Astra International (ASII IJ), Indonesia’s biggest
automotive retailer, rose 3.9 percent to 53,000 rupiah, poised
for the highest close since Jan. 3. The company’s financing
unit, PT Astra Sedaya Finance, said it increased the size of a
planned bond sale this month to as much as 2.15 trillion rupiah
($243 million) from the 1.5 trillion rupiah announced Jan. 24.
The proceeds will be used to expand its automotive lending
business, the unit said Jan. 24.  PT Bank Danamon Indonesia (BDMN IJ), which is owned by
Temasek Holdings Pte and Deutsche Bank AG, gained 3.1 percent to
6,650 rupiah, on course for the highest close since Dec. 8. The
bank said profit more than quadrupled in the fourth quarter last
year on loan growth and non-interest income such as fees and
insurance. Net income surged to 680 billion rupiah from 167
billion rupiah a year earlier, Danamon said.  PT Perusahaan Perkebunan London Sumatra  Indonesia  (LSIP
IJ), the nation’s second-largest listed plantation company by
market value, jumped 5.2 percent to 11,100 rupiah, the steepest
increase since Jan. 25. London Sumatra was rated “buy” in a
new coverage by Fadil Kencana, an analyst at PT Ciptadana
Securities.  PT Ramayana Lestari Sentosa (RALS IJ), a retailer, fell 2.6
percent to 750 rupiah. Ramayana’s 2010 sales increased 7.5
percent to 6.04 trillion rupiah, missing the target of 6.25
trillion rupiah as lower commodity prices reduced consumers’
purchasing power, Kontan reported, citing Director Setyadi
Surya. Ramayana’s main markets are located in commodity
producing regions outside of Java, the report said. Surya
couldn’t be reached when called at his office in Jakarta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
