  Billabong International Ltd ., the
biggest surf-wear maker by market value, rose the most in 17
months in Sydney trading after boosting first-half revenue and
forecasting full-year sales exceeding analyst estimates.  Billabong advanced 6.4 percent, the biggest gain since Aug.
24, 2009, to A$8.51 at the 4:10 p.m. market close in Sydney.
Revenue in the six months ended Dec. 31 jumped 16 percent to
A$837.1 million ($847 million), and full-year sales may total
A$1.7 billion, the company said today.  The sales forecast compares with the A$1.57 billion average
of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg in the past four
weeks. Revenue growth in the first half was driven in part by
last year’s acquisition of Canadian retailer West 49 Inc., which
helped boost North American sales 38 percent, the  Gold Coast ,
Australia-based company said today in an  earnings presentation .  First-half profit slumped 18 percent as Australian consumer
demand stalled and gains in the nation’s currency cut the value
of overseas sales. Net income fell to A$57.2 million, or 23
cents a share, from A$69.7 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement.  The company will pay an interim dividend of 16 cents, down
from 18 cents a year earlier.  Currency Impact  The Australian dollar gained against its U.S. counterpart
during the fiscal half year, reaching a record on Dec. 31 and
crimping North American earnings. Without the currency impact,
profit would have been A$6 million higher, Billabong said.  Full-year earnings will be “flat” in constant currency
terms and may fall about 10 percent in reported terms based on
current trading and exchange rates, Billabong said. The company
had 2010 net income of A$146 million.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization in the Americas, the company’s biggest market by
sales, fell 14 percent to A$29.1 million.  Earnings at the Australasian division, which includes  Australia ,  New Zealand  and  Asia , fell 32 percent to A$40.3
million. European earnings dropped 17 percent to A$24.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
