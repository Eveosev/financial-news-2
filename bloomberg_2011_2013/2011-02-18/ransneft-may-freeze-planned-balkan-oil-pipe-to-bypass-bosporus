OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s crude oil
pipeline operator, may put on hold plans to build a link
bypassing Turkey’s crowded Bosporus straits if Bulgaria fails to
support the project, according to the company’s website.  The Transneft-led venture Trans-Balkan Pipeline BV voted to
allow Bulgaria until March 20 to pay a debt of 6.2 million euros
($8.5 million) to the project that was originally due Dec. 15,
company Vice President Mikhail Barkov said in a statement on the
 website . If Bulgaria does not pay the debt or approve the
environmental study, the project will be suspended, he said.  Greece, the other country across which the pipeline will
run, also owes money to the project, Transneft said following a  shareholders’ meeting  in Rome yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
