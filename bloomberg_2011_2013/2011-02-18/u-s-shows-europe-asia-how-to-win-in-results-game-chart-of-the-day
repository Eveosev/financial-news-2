U.S. companies beat analysts’
earnings estimates more consistently than rivals in Europe and  Asia , suggesting they may be better at managing investor
expectations.  The CHART OF THE DAY plots the number of companies that
topped per-share forecasts as a ratio of those that missed. In
the U.S., earnings exceeded estimates more than twice as often
as they fell short while elsewhere in the world the numbers were
more equally spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The communications departments at U.S. companies are
sharp and know the game,” said Yves Maillot, head of
investments at Robeco Gestions in Paris, which oversees $5.4
billion. “It’s possible that they manage their communications
with analysts to be a bit lower than what they see internally.
It’s in their best interest to be less optimistic.”  In the current earnings season that kicked off Jan. 10,
companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index have topped
estimates 2.7 times more often than they missed, according to
Bloomberg data. That compares with 1.1 times in western  Europe 
and 1.3 in developed Asia Pacific markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
