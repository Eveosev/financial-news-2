Traders on the Polish Power
Exchange, known as Polpx, may be manipulating prices at
auctions,  Gazeta Wyborcza   reported , citing eight dealers it
didn’t identify.  The differences between auction and spot prices cited by
the newspaper as evidence of manipulation are “justified” and
regulators have the right to investigate any alleged wrongdoing,
Grzegorz Onichimowski, chief executive officer of the exchange,
told Bloomberg News by phone today.  Poland’s financial market regulator didn’t answer two calls
seeking comment. The energy regulator “will be looking into”
the way auctions are held, Agnieszka Glosniewska, a spokeswoman
for the watchdog, told Bloomberg News by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
