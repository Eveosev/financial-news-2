A member of  Saudi Arabia ’s royal
family warned that the Arab world’s largest economy may see
protests unless  King Abdullah  Bin Abdul Aziz introduces reforms,
according to  BBC Arabic TV .  Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz told the London-based
broadcaster in an interview aired last night that “unless
problems facing Saudi Arabia are solved, what happened and is
still happening in some Arab countries, including Bahrain, could
spread to Saudi Arabia, even worse.”  Necessary reforms include developing the Shoura Council and
implementing human and women’s rights, BBC Arabic reported on
its website, citing Prince Talal. King Abdullah is the only
member of the ruling family who believes in such reforms and is
able to carry them out, according to the prince.  Prince Talal also supported turning Saudi Arabia into a
constitutional monarchy, the  BBC  added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
