Cannibalization. It's an awful word, isn't it? When it gets thrown around in business contexts, people don't stop to think about its origins. The online etymology dictionary (there  is  a website for everything!)  traces  the word traces back to Christopher Columbus' description of a tribe in the Caribbean that was believed to eat human flesh. Nasty stuff. It's a critical topic for many companies. I bet many readers have had a project shut down or seriously altered because of corporate fears of cannibalization â€” the idea that a lower-priced product might eat away at the market of a higher-priced one. It's not that the fears are ungrounded. After all, what company would want to replace a high-priced product with a low-priced product? That's a good way to end up on the corporate chopping block. But companies must come to grips with their cannibalization concerns, because getting overly defensive can curtail powerful growth strategies. The topic came up on the panel I moderated in Singapore the other week. Shamik Desgupta, the head of Medtronic's CRDM division in Asia, noted how he has to deal with a strange but real challenge: Medtronic's core business is, well, amazingly profitable. The company's gross margins are around 75%, and its net margins after taxes are about 20%. Almost anything looks bad in comparison.  So how do you combat cannibalization concerns? Three ideas emerged from the panel discussion. Cannibalization is a real concern. But the right framing and the right strategic approach can make sure it doesn't stop the pursuit of high-potential growth strategies.
