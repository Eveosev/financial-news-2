  TomTom NV , Europe’s biggest maker of
portable navigation devices, posted a less-than-expected 29
percent drop in fourth-quarter profit.  Net income fell to 52 million euros ($71 million) from 73
million euros a year earlier, the Amsterdam-based company said
in a statement today. That beat the average estimate of 43.7
million euros in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts.  TomTom, which competes with  Garmin Ltd . and  Google Inc .,
aims to get more revenue from maps, services and built-in
systems in cars as sales of portable navigation devices, or
PNDs, slow. The company also faces increasing competition from
smartphones which feature similar services.  “In 2011, we will accelerate the development of the
technologies,” Chief Executive Officer Harold Goddijn said in
the statement.  TomTom said it sees “broadly flat” revenue and earnings
per share this year compared with 2010.  In the fourth quarter, sales fell 3 percent to 516 million
euros, beating the 489.75 million-euro average estimate of 12
analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
