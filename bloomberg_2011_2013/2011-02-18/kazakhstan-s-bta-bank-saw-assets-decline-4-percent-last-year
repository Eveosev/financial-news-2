Kazakhstan’s BTA Bank, which
defaulted in 2009, saw assets decline an annual 4 percent in
2010 to 1.89 trillion tenge ($12.9 billion) as it curtailed
lending.  State-controlled BTA had 929 billion tenge of loans on its
books as of Dec. 31, 2010, down from 1.04 trillion tenge a year
earlier, the bank said in a  statement  on its website.  BTA, the former Soviet republic’s third-largest lender by
assets, defaulted in April 2009, two months after being taken
over by the state-owned National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna.
BTA’s indebtedness fell to $4.2 billion last year from $16.7
billion after it distributed $945 million in cash to creditors
and issued new debt and shares, the bank said in September.  Liabilities fell 49 percent to 1.87 trillion tenge in 2010
from a year earlier, BTA said in the statement. Net interest
income was 100 billion tenge after a 2009 loss of 774 billion
tenge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
