(Corrects identity of company in first paragraph. The story
was first published on Feb. 18.)    Senegal ’s Renewable Energy Ministry
signed an accord with a company known as Plambeck Emirates
Global Renewable that may lead to the construction of solar and
other alternative energy plants, according to an e-mailed
statement from the ministry.  The memorandum of understanding was signed after a
government-led audit recommended a move away from diesel power
stations in the West African nation. Diesel plants currently
account for 78 percent of generating capacity, according to the  World Bank .  “We can’t continue down this path of petrol,” Papa Dieng,
communications adviser to President Abdoulaye Wade, told
Bloomberg on Jan. 11. “Every little thing Senegal earns, we
have to spend it on petrol.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
