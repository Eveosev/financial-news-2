The following is the text of
Canada's  consumer price index  report for January released
by  Statistics Canada .  Consumer prices rose 2.3% in the 12 months to January
2011, following the 2.4% increase posted in December 2010.  Energy prices rose 9.0% during the 12 months to
January, following a 10.5% increase in December. Gasoline
prices increased 13.0% in January, matching the increase
in December. Consumers also paid 6.4% more for electricity
in January compared with the same month last year.  Excluding energy, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose
1.7% in the 12 months to January, identical to the
increase in December.  On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, consumer prices
rose 0.3% from December 2010 to January 2011, the seventh
consecutive monthly increase. In addition, the
transportation index, which includes gasoline, also
increased for the seventh consecutive month, rising 1.1%
from December to January. The food index went up 0.5%,
matching the increase in December.  12-month change: Increases in seven of the eight major
components  On a year-over-year basis, prices increased in seven of
the eight major components of the CPI in the year to
January. The only exception was clothing and footwear.  The largest increase occurred in the transportation
component, where prices rose 4.8% in the 12 months to
January, following a 4.9% advance in December.  In addition to higher gasoline prices in the 12 months
to January, consumers paid 4.8% more in passenger vehicle
insurance premiums. They also paid more for the purchase
of passenger vehicles and for air transportation.  Shelter costs rose 2.2% in January, following a 2.7%
rise in December. Along with higher electricity prices,
homeowners' replacement cost increased 3.6%. However, the
mortgage interest cost index, which measures the change in
the interest portion of payments on outstanding mortgage
debt, continued to decrease.  Food prices rose 2.1% in the 12 months to January,
following a 1.7% increase in December. Consumers paid 4.0%
more for meat and 10.7% more for sugar and confectionery.
Prices for food purchased from restaurants also increased
2.7%.  The recreation, education and reading price index rose
1.6% in January, after increasing 1.1% in December. Prices
rose for cablevision and satellite services and for the
use of recreational facilities and services. Conversely,
prices fell for computer equipment and supplies as well as
for video equipment.  Prices for household operations, furnishings and
equipment increased 1.6% between January 2010 and January
2011. Within this component, higher prices were recorded
for several items, notably for child care and domestic
services.  Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products
rose 3.1% in January. Consumers paid 5.4% more for
cigarettes.  In January, prices for clothing and footwear continued
to decline on a year-over-year basis. Clothing and
footwear prices fell 2.4% in January, following a 2.0%
decrease in December. Consumers paid less for women's
clothing and children's clothing.  The provinces  Consumer prices rose in every province between January
2010 and January 2011. Drivers continued to face double-
digit increases for gasoline in most provinces.  In Ontario, consumer prices rose 2.9% in the 12 months
to January, after advancing 3.3% in December. Gasoline
prices rose 15.6%. Consumers in Ontario also paid more for
passenger vehicle insurance and electricity.  On January 1, 2011, consumer prices were affected by an
increase in the Quebec Sales Tax. In  Quebec , consumer
prices increased 2.1% in the 12 months to January,
following a 1.6% increase in December. Prices for gasoline
rose 12.9%, while prices for meat increased 4.9%.  Prices in British Columbia increased 2.3% in the 12
months to January. Consumers in British Columbia paid
10.9% more for gasoline and 7.9% more for food purchased
from restaurants. Electricity prices and homeowners'
replacement cost also rose.  In Alberta, prices rose 1.0% in January following a
0.8% increase in December. Alberta drivers paid 11.4% more
at the pump. Natural gas prices, which in  Alberta  are
prone to larger fluctuations, were down 24.2% in the 12
months to January. This contrasts with a 3.3% decrease for  Canada  as a whole.  In Manitoba, consumer prices increased 2.0%, after
increasing 1.2% in December. Almost half of the 0.8
percentage point increase can be attributed to higher
gasoline prices.  The Bank of Canada's core index  The Bank of Canada's core index advanced 1.4% in the 12
months to January 2011, following a 1.5% rise in December.  The seasonally adjusted monthly core index rose 0.1%
from December 2010 to January 2011, following a 0.2%
increase in the previous month.  Note to readers  On January 1, 2011, the Quebec Sales Tax increased from
7.5% to 8.5%. In Quebec, if prices before taxes had
remained the same, this tax change would have increased
the all-items CPI by about half a percentage point in this
province. At the national level, under the same
assumptions, this change in the  tax rate  would have
increased the all-items CPI by about 0.1 percentage
points.  The Bank of Canada's core index excludes eight of the
Consumer Price Index's most volatile components (fruit,
fruit preparations and nuts; vegetables and vegetable
preparations; mortgage interest cost; natural gas; heating
oil and other fuels; gasoline; inter-city transportation;
and tobacco products and smokers' supplies) as well as the
effects of changes in indirect taxes on the remaining
components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
