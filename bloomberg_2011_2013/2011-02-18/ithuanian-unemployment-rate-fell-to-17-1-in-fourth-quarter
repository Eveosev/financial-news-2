Lithuania’s unemployment rate fell
for a second consecutive quarter in the final three months of
2010 as the country’s economic recovery gathers pace, a labor-
force survey showed.  The rate dropped to 17.1 percent from 17.8 percent in the
third quarter, the Vilnius-based  statistics office  said in an
e-mailed statement today. The rate was at 15.6 percent in the
fourth quarter last year.  Unemployment is declining on growing demand for workers in
the construction and transport industries. Gross domestic
product expanded a preliminary 4.6 percent in the fourth
quarter, the fastest rate in more than two years. The
improvement in the labor market has also been helped by rising
emigration as more Lithuanians seek jobs in western European
countries.  The jobless rate rose to 17.8 percent for all of 2010,
compared with 13.7 percent in the previous year, the statistics
office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
