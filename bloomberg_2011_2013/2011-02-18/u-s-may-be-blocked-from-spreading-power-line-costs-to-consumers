U.S. electricity regulators would be
blocked from spreading the costs for building interstate power
lines among customers of regional systems, under legislation
introduced by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators.  The bill would force the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, which plans to adopt rules for paying to build
transmission lines, to limit who pays for the construction to
consumers who are served by the new lines.  Utilities including Atlanta-based  Southern Co ., Newark, New
Jersey-based  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc . and Detroit-
based  DTE Energy Co . are concerned that they will end up paying
for transmission lines to support out-of-state projects, such as
those for renewable energy. The utilities are in a group called
the Coalition for Fair Transmission Policy.  “Governors and utilities from across the country have
spoken out against FERC’s attempt to shift transmission costs
from states that benefit to those that don’t,” Senator  Bob Corker , a Tennessee Republican, said in a  statement  yesterday.
Corker sponsored a similar bill during the previous Congress.  FERC is considering regulations for planning and paying
costs to build transmission lines, as utilities seek to
transport power generated from solar panels and  wind turbines  in
remote sites to cities.  In addition to Corker, the bill’s sponsors are Senators Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and Republicans Lisa Murkowski of
Alaska, Richard Burr of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
