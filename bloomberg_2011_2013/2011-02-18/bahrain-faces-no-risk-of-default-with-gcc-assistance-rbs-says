  Bahrain  won’t default “even in the
worst case scenario” because other members of the six-nation
Gulf Cooperation Council will come to its aid, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “There is no risk of default in Bahrain,” said Raza Agha,
an emerging-markets strategist at RBS in London. “The other GCC
states will more than likely provide sufficient support to
Bahrain, over and above its debt servicing requirements.”  The cost of insuring Bahrain’s debt, which rose for a fifth
day today, may continue to increase if clashes between pro-
democracy protesters and the government escalate, he said. Swaps
on Bahrain climbed 21 points to 307, according to CMA. That’s
the highest in 19 months and implies a 19 percent likelihood the
nation will default within five years.  Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal and
counterparts from other members of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council pledged to Bahrain they will stand “united
in the face of challenges” and wished it “continued progress,
security and stability” at an emergency meeting late yesterday
in Manama, the official Saudi Press Agency said.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting $10
million of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
$1,000 a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
