Investors should buy the dollar
against its Australian and New Zealand counterparts because the
U.S. economic expansion this year will probably outpace global
growth, according to Barclays Plc.  “The U.S., which has been the laggard, appears to be
catching up,” currency strategists including Aroop Chatterjee
wrote in a research report dated yesterday. “When the U.S.
cycle catches up with the global cycle, the dollar tends to
firm. The dollar has its greatest potential against the
Australian dollar and the  New Zealand dollar .”  Australia’s dollar, known as the Aussie, was little changed
at $1.0121 as of 8:35 a.m. in  London . The so-called kiwi
strengthened 0.4 percent to 76.21 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
