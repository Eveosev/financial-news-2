The dollar may fall to a six-week
low against the yen as the pair remains in a “triangular
consolidation” formation, Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd.
said, citing trading patterns.  The U.S. currency has risen 2.7 percent this year and is
likely to pare gains gradually as it trades in the triangle
formed by two trend lines, said  Daisaku Ueno , president of the
unit of Japan’s largest online currency broker in Tokyo. The
upper line connects the highs of 85.93 yen on Sept. 16 and 83.98
yen on Feb. 16, and the lower line joins the lows of 80.22 yen
on Nov. 1 and 81.13 yen on Feb. 4, according to Bloomberg data.  “As the currency stays in the triangle, it may be moving
back into a range” between lower 81 yen and mid 83 yen, Ueno
said. “The currency may go back to around 81 yen.”  The dollar traded at 83.38 yen as of 10:11 a.m. in Tokyo
from 83.31 yen in  New York  yesterday. The greenback last traded
below 81 yen on Jan. 3.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
