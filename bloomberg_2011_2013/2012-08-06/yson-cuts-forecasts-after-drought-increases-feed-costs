Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the largest U.S.
meat processor, cut its full-year sales forecast and said profit
will be lower after the cost of  animal feed  rose because of the
country’s drought. The shares fell the most in more than three
years.  Revenue will be $33 billion in the year through September,
compared with a previous prediction of $34 billion, the
Springdale, Arkansas-based company said today in a statement.
The average of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg is
for $34 billion. Tyson didn’t give a specific forecast for full-
year earnings. It said in May that profit might be $2 a share.  “Our beef and pork segments have been operating in very
difficult market conditions that will result in our earnings for
fiscal 2012 coming in lower than we previously projected,”
Chief Executive Officer Donnie Smith said in the statement.
“While we ultimately expect to pass along rising input costs,
these costs, coupled with continued soft demand, are likely to
pressure earnings in 2013.”  Corn prices jumped to a record in Chicago trading on July
31 as hot weather scorched the U.S. Midwest. Parts of Iowa and
Illinois, the country’s largest corn and soybean growers, had
less than 25 percent of normal rain in the past 30 days,
National Weather Service data show. Only 24 percent of corn was
in good or excellent condition July 29, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture , which updates its crop ratings today.  Corn Record  Tyson dropped 7.9 percent to $14.17 at the close in  New
York , the biggest drop since July 20, 2009.  Tim Ramey , an
analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co. in  Lake Oswego ,  Oregon , today cut
his rating on Tyson to hold from buy.  Tyson’s net income fell to $76 million, or 21 cents a
share, in the three months through June 30, from $196 million,
or 51 cents, a year earlier. Profit excluding a debt-
extinguishment charge was 50 cents a share, trailing the 54-cent
average of 13 estimates. Sales rose 0.7 percent to $8.31
billion, missing the $8.71 billion average of 12 estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
