Swimming Australia  will conduct a
review of its performance in the London Olympics after failing
to win an individual gold medal for the first time  since the
1976  Montreal games.  “It is clear the world has lifted the bar when it comes to
swimming and so must we,” Swimming  Australia  President David
Urquhart said today in an e-mailed statement. “We must do
everything possible to get Australian swimming back on top.”  Australia’s 400-meter women’s freestyle relay team won the
country’s only swimming gold at this year’s games. The medal
tally marks a change of form for the nation’s swimmers, who have
amassed more than 178 medals since Freddy Lane won Australia’s
first two swimming golds in 1900, according to the country’s
Olympic team website.  “I am today announcing a review of our London performance,
focusing on Swimming Australia’s high-performance programs and
administration,” Urquhart said. “No one should doubt the
commitment or effort of our swimmers.”  Athletes including James Magnussen in the men’s 100-meter
freestyle and Christian Sprenger in the 100-meter breaststroke
placed second in  London , bringing Australia’s silver-medal count
in the sport to six. The country’s swimmers have won three
bronze medals at this year’s games.  Susie O’Neill, who took gold medals in the 200-meter
butterfly in 1996 and the 200-meter freestyle in 2000, will lead
the performance review with team coach Bill Sweetenham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
