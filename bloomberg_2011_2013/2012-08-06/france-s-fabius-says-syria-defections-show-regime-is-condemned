The defection of  Syria ’s former Prime
Minister Riad Hijab underscores the weakening of the regime of
Bashar al-Assad and the country’s ruling “clan,” French
Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a statement.  France is convinced that al-Assad’s regime is condemned,
Fabius said today. France will maintain pressure on the
“criminal” regime to yield power to a “democratic and
pluralistic” Syria, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
