(Corrects headline, first paragraph to show newspaper
report was in Corriere della Sera.)  French President  Francois Hollande  is
pushing Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  to request aid from
Europe’s bailout fund to help ease speculation among investors,
Italian newspaper  Corriere della Sera  reported, without citing
anyone.  Hollande’s strategy, which also includes pressing Spain
toward a request for aid, is designed to help protect France
from market speculation, Corriere said. Monti doesn’t like the
idea of requesting aid and may speak today with European Central
Bank President Mario Draghi, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
