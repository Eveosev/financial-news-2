Oil options volatility fell to the
lowest level since May 29 as futures reached a two-week high
amid stronger equities and optimism that  Europe ’s debt crisis
can be contained.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.41 percent at 3:38 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 30.72 Aug. 3.  “It’s down pretty significantly and that’s mostly
attributable to the higher price and smaller range,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for September delivery rose 80 cents to $92.20 a
barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement since July 19.  The dollar fell against most of its major counterparts,
