Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  named former Intel
Corp. executive Anand Chandrasekher as its chief marketing
officer, aiming to benefit from his experience as the company
pushes deeper into the personal-computer market.  Chandrasekher will oversee global marketing efforts and
report to President and Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf, San Diego-based Qualcomm said today in a statement.  Qualcomm, the largest seller of mobile-phone
semiconductors, is working to parlay that dominance into a
bigger piece of the PC-chip market -- Intel’s turf.
Chandrasekher, who spent 25 years at Intel, oversaw the
chipmaker’s Atom processor and earlier served as co-general
manager for the 486 line.  “His extensive experience in marketing and management
makes Anand well-suited to help grow Qualcomm’s communications
and marketing efforts across the world,” Mollenkopf said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
