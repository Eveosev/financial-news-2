Medicare beneficiaries will pay the
same premium for  prescription drugs  next year as they did this
year, the  U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services said.  Premiums for drug plans that accompany basic Medicare
coverage for the elderly and disabled will be an average of $30
in 2013, the department said today in a statement. The estimate
is based on bids from private insurers who offer the plans to
Medicare patients.  “Premiums are holding steady, and thanks to the health-
care law, millions of people with Medicare are saving an average
of over $600 each year on their prescription drugs,” Health and
Human Services Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius  said in the
statement.  The 2010 Affordable Care Act provides a discount on drug
prices for people who enter a gap in Medicare’s insurance
coverage known as the “doughnut hole.” Medicare’s annual
enrollment period for drug plans and private coverage begins
