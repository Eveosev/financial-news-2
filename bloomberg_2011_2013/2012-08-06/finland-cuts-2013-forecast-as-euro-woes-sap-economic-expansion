Finland’s economy may stall next year
as  Europe ’s debt woes damp growth in the northernmost euro
country, Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said.  Economic growth next year may be between zero and 1
percent, Urpilainen said today in Helsinki as the ministry began
forming its proposal for next year’s budget. The government in
June forecast growth of 1.2 percent next year.  Urpilainen said that the government plans no new tax
increases or spending cuts even as it needs to stay prepared for
a potential worsening of the economic turmoil.  Finland has kept its  budget deficit  within European Union
rules since 1996 and targets a balanced budget by 2015. The
government has announced 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in tax
increases and 1.2 billion euros in spending cuts to help reach
that target.  Finland , which charges investors to hold its two-year debt,
is the euro area’s top-rated country at Moody’s Investors
Service. The nation has a Aaa rating with a stable outlook after
the rating company last month reduced the outlook on German,
Dutch and Luxembourg debt to negative.  The government will decide on the budget on Aug. 29 to Aug.
30 and its proposal will be sent to parliament on Sept. 17,
according to a schedule posted on the Finance Ministry website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
