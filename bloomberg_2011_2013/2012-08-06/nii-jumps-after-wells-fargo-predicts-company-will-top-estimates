NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , the wireless
carrier that operates the Nextel brand in  Latin America , tumbled
24 percent after the company cut its profit and sales forecasts,
citing mounting competition and network spending.  The shares fell to $6.11 in New York, marking the biggest
one-day decline since the stock began trading in 2002. The
company has lost 71 percent of its value this year.  Operating income before depreciation and amortization will
be about $1 billion this year, compared with an earlier
projection of $1.4 billion, the Reston, Virginia-based company
said today in a statement. NII lopped $1 billion from its 2012
sales forecast, saying it was now predicting $6.1 billion in
operating revenue.  The report dashed investor optimism that had built up
yesterday, when NII shares climbed 19 percent. The company faces
the dual challenges of growing competition and an upgrade to
third-generation wireless service, which has forced it to spend
more on its network.  “We recognize that much work remains to be done to improve
our results as we respond to changes in the competitive
environment and prepare our business for the transition to 3G,”
Chief Executive Officer Steve Dussek said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
