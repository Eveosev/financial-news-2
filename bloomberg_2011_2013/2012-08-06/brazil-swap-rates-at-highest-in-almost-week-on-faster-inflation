Brazilian swap rates rose to the
highest level in almost a week as a report showed inflation is
picking up, reducing speculation the central bank will sustain
the pace of cuts in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014 increased
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, 7.79 percent today in
Sao Paulo, the highest level on a closing basis since July 31.
The real fell 0.1 percent to 2.0311 per  U.S. dollar .  Inflation as measured by the IGP-DI index accelerated in
July to 1.52 percent from 0.69 percent in the prior month, the
Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today. The median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey was for 1.46 percent inflation.  “The IGP-DI came higher than expected, and food prices are
going to suffer more with the drought in the U.S.,” Eduardo Galasini, the head of treasury at Banco Banif in Sao Paulo, said
in a telephone interview.  Analysts in a central bank survey reduced their 2012 growth
projection. The economy will expand 1.85 percent in 2012,
compared with a projection of 1.90 percent growth last week,
according to the median forecast of about 100 responses in a
central bank survey published today.  The central bank has cut the target lending rate by 4.5
percentage points since August 2011 to a record low 8 percent to
help spur growth and shield  Brazil ’s economy from the European
sovereign-debt crisis.  The analysts in the central bank survey lowered their
estimate for the 2012 year-end target lending rate for the first
time in almost two months. Policy makers will cut the Selic to
7.25 percent, according to the median estimate.  Low employment and real wage increases will help drive
Brazil’s economic growth to a 4 percent annual rate by year-end,
bank President Alexandre Tombini told reporters in late July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
