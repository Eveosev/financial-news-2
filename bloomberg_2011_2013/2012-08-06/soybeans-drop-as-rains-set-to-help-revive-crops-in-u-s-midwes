Soybeans declined to the lowest level
in more than a week as rains forecast in parts of the Midwest
may help revive parched crops in the largest U.S. growing
region. Corn and wheat also fell.  Soybeans for November delivery lost as much as 3.3 percent
to $15.7575 a bushel, the lowest price on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade since July 27. They traded at $15.92 at 2:24 p.m.
Singapore time.  A few areas in the northwestern parts of the Midwest may
see near normal amounts of rainfall in the 10 days from Aug. 3,
Telvent DTN Inc. said that day.  “The forecast rains in the U.S. Midwest this week are
putting downward pressure on prices,” Toshimitsu Kawanabe, an
analyst at broker Central Shoji Co., said by phone from  Tokyo 
today. “Investors are also awaiting the monthly USDA report,”
he said, referring to the agricultural supply and demand
estimate due on Aug. 10 in  Washington .  Crushers in  China , the world’s largest importer, will
actively participate in sales of government stockpiles of
soybeans, including the 400,000 metric tons set for auction on
Aug. 16, state-researcher Grain.gov.cn said. Processors are
turning to the government for cheaper supply, as domestic prices
of products crushed from soybeans, including the meal for animal
feeds and cooking oil, failed to keep pace with import costs for
the raw material, it said.  Imported soybeans cost about 5,300  yuan  ($832) a ton,
compared with the minimum price of 3,950 yuan a ton set for next
week’s auction.  Corn for December delivery slipped as much as 2.3 percent
to $7.8925 a bushel in Chicago before trading at $7.985. Wheat
for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to $8.98 a bushel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
