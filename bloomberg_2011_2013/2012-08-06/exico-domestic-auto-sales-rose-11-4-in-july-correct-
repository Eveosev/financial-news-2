Mexico  domestic sales of cars may
rise to over 1 million units this year as the economy proves
resilient and consumer confidence picks up, the nation’s car
dealership association said.  Sales of cars and light trucks may reach as much as 1.02
million units this year, up from the previously forecast 880,000
units, Guillermo Rosales, the director of government relations
at the association, or AMDA, said today in Mexico City. Domestic
sales rose 11.4 percent in July from the same month a year
earlier to 76,376 units, AMDA said.  Total sales  came to 905,886
units in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s auto industry is booming as both vehicle
production and exports reached their highest levels in the first
seven months of the year for any January to July period, said
the nation’s Automobile Industry Association, or AMIA. Domestic
sales are picking up as banks grant more loans and the economy
grows faster than the 3.3 percent originally estimated by
Congress at the start of the year, AMDA’s Rosales said.  “A cycle of better economic performance, better confidence
on the part of the consumer and more disposition by banks to
grant loans are contributing to the results we’re reporting
today,” Rosales told reporters.  The  consumer confidence  index rose last month to its
highest since March 2008 after previously reaching a four-year
high in April. Economists forecast gross domestic product to
grow 3.71 percent this year, in an Aug. 1 central bank survey.  Vehicle production rose 17.7 percent to 238,146 units in
July from the year-earlier period and exports climbed 5.8
percent to 2008,151 units over the same period, AMIA said. Both
production and exports were the highest for any July on record,
AMIA said.  July’s domestic sales fell 2.7 percent compared with 78,508
units sold in June, according to AMDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
