Gasoline fell as Tropical Storm
Ernesto appeared to be less of a threat to U.S. Gulf Coast oil
refining and on concern that Europe’s debt crisis is deepening.  Futures retreated as Ernesto was on a path that will
probably take it toward landfall on Belize and then Mexico’s
Yucatan Peninsula, the  National Hurricane Center  said. Italy’s
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  warned of a potential breakup of
Europe without greater urgency in efforts to lower government
borrowing costs.  “The track of the storm appears less threatening and last
week’s enthusiasm about the European debt bailout is waning,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
 Chicago .  Gasoline for September delivery declined 4.01 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.8909 a gallon at 9:47 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange.  The fifth storm of the  Atlantic hurricane season  had winds
of 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour and was moving west in the
Caribbean at 12 mph, the Miami-based center said in an  advisory 
at 8 a.m. East Coast time. Ernesto was about 145 miles east of
Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaragua-Honduras border.  Monti, in an interview with  Germany ’s Der Spiegel magazine
published yesterday, said that disagreements within the 17-
nation euro area are detracting from the policy response to the
debt crisis and undermining the future of the European Union.  Heating oil for September delivery fell 0.72 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.9189 a gallon.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.9
cent to $3.619 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That’s the
highest price since May 30. Prices have fallen 8.1 percent from
a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4, according to AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
