Hidroelectrica SA,  Romania ’s state-
owned hydropower generator, will cut electricity supplies
starting tomorrow after a drought lowered river water levels.  Hidrolectrica, declared insolvent last month, will activate
a force-majeure clause for 23 contracts as it estimates it will
produce about 700 gigawatt-hours of power this month, compared
with a planned 1,100 gigawatt-hours, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Hidroelectrica’s judicial administrator said the company is
“trying to keep the force-majeure for the shortest time period
possible,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
