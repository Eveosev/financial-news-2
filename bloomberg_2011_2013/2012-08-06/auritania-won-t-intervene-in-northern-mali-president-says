Mauritania won’t intervene in
neighboring  Mali , where Islamist groups have taken control of
the country’s north, President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz said.  The northwest African nation will only extradite Abdullah
al-Senussi, the head of  Libya ’s intelligence services under
 Muammar Qaddafi , with certain conditions, he said, declining to
give details.  Aziz was commenting on a televised program on his time in
office since he won an election in 2009, which was held less
than a year after he led a coup against Mauritania’s first
democratically elected president.  In the period, the country’s economy grew to 1.22 trillion
ouguiya ($4 billion) from 854 billion ouguiya in 2008, he said.
Tax revenue in the first six months of this year was 95 billion
ouguiya, Aziz said, without giving a comparative figure.  Revenue from mining was 107 billion ouguiya in 2011, up
from 44 billion ouguiya in 2008, Aziz said. Mauritania has $65
million in a fund that holds the country’s earnings from oil, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
