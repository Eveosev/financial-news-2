President  Barack Obama  said the
nation needs to “examine additional ways” to stem gun
violence, in his first remarks after a gunman killed six people
at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee.  Obama gave no specifics in responding to questions from
reporters after he signed legislation to give federal health
benefits to some Marines and their families at Camp Lejeune who
were sickened by contaminated water.  “All of us are heartbroken,” by killings at the temple,
Obama said. The gunman, identified as U.S. Army veteran Wade
Michael Page, 40, was fatally shot by police.  The president’s spokesman,  Jay Carney , indicated earlier
today that there were no new initiatives planned by the
administration to restrict the sale of firearms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
