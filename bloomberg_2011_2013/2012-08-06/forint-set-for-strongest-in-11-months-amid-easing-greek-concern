The forint gained a second day
against the euro, heading for its strongest in 11 months, amid
easing concern over  Greece  after international creditors said
the country is making progress on meeting bailout terms.  The Hungarian currency advanced 0.3 percent to 276.68 per
euro by 11 a.m. in Budapest, heading for its strongest closing
level since Sept. 7.  Greece and its creditors agreed on the need for more budget
cuts to comply with bailout terms after more than a week of
meetings in  Athens . Representatives from the so-called troika of
the European Commission,  European Central Bank  and  International
Monetary Fund  met with Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras
as the parties work to determine whether Greece continues
receiving funds from the country’s 240 billion euros ($297
billion) of rescue packages.  Developments in Greece “may lead to the pricing out of a
prominent market fear, prompting a continuation of last week’s
optimism,” analysts at Budapest-based brokerage Equilor Zrt.
said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The cost of insuring against default on Hungary’s debt with
credit-default swaps fell 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 434.167 basis points, the lowest since Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
