The  European Central Bank ’s financing
to Portuguese lenders fell in July from the previous month, the
 Bank of Portugal  said.  ECB financing decreased to 56.8 billion euros ($70 billion)
from a record 60.5 billion euros in June, the Lisbon-based Bank
of  Portugal  said today on the BPStat portion of its website.  Portugal sought a bailout in April 2011, the third euro-
area country to do so after Greece and Ireland, and will receive
78 billion euros under the agreement with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union. The plan earmarks as much
as 12 billion euros to recapitalize Portugal’s lenders.  The  Portuguese government  announced on June 4 that it has
committed to inject more than 6.6 billion euros in  Banco
Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) ,  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  and state-owned Caixa Geral
de Depositos SA to recapitalize the lenders.  As part of the Portugal’s aid plan, the country’s lenders
were required to raise their core Tier 1 capital ratios to 9
percent by the end of 2011 and 10 percent by the end of 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
