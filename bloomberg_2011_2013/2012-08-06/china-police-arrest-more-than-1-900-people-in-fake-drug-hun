Police in China arrested more than
1,900 people and seized about 1.16 billion  yuan  ($182 million)
worth of counterfeit drugs and related goods amid a government
crackdown in the world’s fastest-growing pharmaceuticals market.  The fake drugs seized were illegally advertised to treat
illnesses including hypertension, diabetes, skin diseases and
cancer, the Ministry of Public Security said in a  statement 
yesterday. More than 18,000 members of the police contributed to
breaking up drug-counterfeit rings across the country, it said.  “The criminals have come up with new ways to conceal,”
the ministry said in the statement. “Counterfeit drug crimes
have still not been eradicated.”  Less than  1 percent  of medicines in developed markets and
 as much as 30 percent  or more in  developing countries  are fake,
 World Health Organization  estimates show.  China  and  India  are
the biggest suppliers of the counterfeits, which cause 700,000
deaths a year among malaria and tuberculosis sufferers alone,
 according to  the Washington-based International Policy Network.  The statement didn’t specify whether the fake drugs were
meant for the domestic or international market.  The Ministry of Public Security will offer as much as
50,000 yuan to anyone who contributes to uncovering fake
medicine rings and operations, it said in the statement.  China criminalized the manufacture of counterfeit medicines
last year and  raised  maximum penalties to the death sentence to
try to contain illegal production.  Drug spending in China is forecast to rise at a compound
annual rate of 19 percent to 22 percent in the five years to
2015, reaching as much as $125 billion,  IMS Health Inc.  said in
a May 2011 report. That’s the fastest growth rate globally,
according to the Parsippany, New Jersey-based researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
