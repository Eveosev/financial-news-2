The gunman in the shootings at a Sikh
temple in  Wisconsin  was a 40-year-old Army veteran named Wade
Michael Page, according to a U.S. defense official.  Page was discharged honorably from the Army in 1998 after
six years of service. He had been a Hawk missile repairman and a
“psychological operations specialist,” said the defense
official who asked for anonymity to release the details.  Seven people, including the gunman, died in the shootings
yesterday at the temple near Milwaukee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
