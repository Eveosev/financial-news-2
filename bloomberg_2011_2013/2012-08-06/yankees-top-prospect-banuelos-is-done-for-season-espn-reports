Manny Banuelos, the top prospect in
the  New York  Yankees’ minor league system, won’t pitch again
this season, according to ESPN.  Banuelos hasn’t pitched since May 18 after suffering a bone
bruise in his left elbow and won’t return in 2012, ESPN reported
citing Yankees Vice President of Baseball Operations  Mark Newman .  Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment.  The team wants the 21-year-old left-hander to be healthy
for offseason leagues and to be able to participate in next
year’s Major League Baseball spring training, according to ESPN.  Banuelos, who first pitched for the organization in 2008,
was 0-2 with a 4.50 earned-run average and 22 strikeouts in six
starts with the  Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees , a Triple-A
affiliate of the major-league club.  Baseball America  ranked him
the No. 29 prospect in baseball this year and the highest rated
player in the Yankees’ system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
