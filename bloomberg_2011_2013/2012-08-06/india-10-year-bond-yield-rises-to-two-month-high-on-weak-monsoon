India ’s bonds fell, sending yields to
the highest level in almost two months, on concern inadequate
seasonal rainfall will curb farm output and spur food inflation.  India’s monsoon rains this year were 18 percent below
normal as of yesterday, the state weather forecaster said on its
website. That may prompt the central bank, which cited  inflation 
risks as it refrained from cutting  interest rates  last week, to
delay further policy easing, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.
Bonds also declined on speculation demand for existing
securities will weaken as the government boosts debt sales to
meet a record borrowing target for the year through March 2013.  “We are looking at backloaded interest-rate cuts now,
given inflationary concerns,” said Vivek Rajpal, a fixed-income
strategist in Mumbai at Nomura. “Investors are probably in no
hurry to buy bonds given the current debt-supply environment.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent securities due June 2022 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.27 percent as
of 10:35 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That rate is the highest level for benchmark 10-year
bonds since June 11.  Nomura predicts the  Reserve Bank  of India will hold its
repurchase rate at 8 percent in 2012. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
last cut the repo rate by 50 basis points in April, after
raising it by a record 375 basis points through 2010 and 2011.
The rate was left unchanged at a policy review on July 31.  The finance ministry plans to borrow 5.69 trillion rupees
($103 billion) this fiscal year, according to budget estimates.  The benchmark wholesale-price  index  rose 7.25 percent in
June from a year earlier, after climbing 7.55 percent in May,
the commerce ministry last month.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, were little
changed at 7.76 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
