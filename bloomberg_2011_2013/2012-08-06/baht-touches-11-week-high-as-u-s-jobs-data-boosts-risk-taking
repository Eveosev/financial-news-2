Thailand ’s baht touched an 11-week
high as better-than-expected U.S. payroll data encouraged risk-
taking.  Government bonds  advanced.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares climbed the most in
more than a week after a Labor Department report on Aug. 3
showed U.S. employers added 163,000 jobs last month, more than
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for 100,000 positions.
Global funds bought $84 million more local equities and $983
million more Thai government debt than they sold last week,
according to data from the stock exchange and the Thai Bond
Market Association.  “An equity rally and the improving risk sentiment are
boosting the baht and other regional currencies,” said Disawat
Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “A
main theme this week remains whether the U.S. will introduce
quantitative easing.”  The baht added 0.2 percent to 31.50 per dollar as of 8:39
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
gained as much as 0.9 percent to 31.27 earlier, the strongest
level since May 22. The currency may trade between 31.30 and
31.60 for the rest of this week, Disawat said. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was little changed at 4.51 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.15 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
