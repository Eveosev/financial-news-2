Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE) , a state-
owned reinsurer, jumped to its highest level in more than three
weeks after saying it introduced a Shariah-compliance team to
evaluate new products and investments.  Kenya Re, as the company is known, climbed 2 percent to
10.45 shillings by the close in Nairobi, the strongest price
since July 11.  The board’s role is to “evaluate all our business and
ensure that we are Shariah-compliant,” Managing Director Jadiah Mwarania said in a phone interview today. “It will also
evaluate our investments and ensure they are complaint to
Islamic guidelines.”  In June the company announced plans to tap into the
expanding Islamic-finance industry in  Africa  and the  Middle
East . The company will also venture into micro-insurance and
political-risk insurance, Mwarania said June 13.  The plan to introduce Shariah-compliant products “widens
their income streams; investors must have taken that
positively,” Brenda Kithinji, a research analyst at Nairobi-
based Standard Investment Bank Ltd. said in a phone interview
today.  In May, the  Capital Markets Authority , Kenya’s financial-
markets regulator, said the east African nation aims to
introduce new products including Islamic bonds, Shariah-
compliant mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and venture
capital funds.  Kenya Re, which has risen 67 percent year to date and is
the second best performing Kenyan stock, is scheduled to release
first-half earnings on Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
