PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest
lender, headed for a two-week high after posting the biggest
first-half profit in eight years.  The shares rose as much as 1.2 percent to 32.93 zloty
before trading 0.8 percent stronger at 32.8 zloty by 9:50 a.m.
in Warsaw, the highest on a closing basis since July 19.  Net income increased to 1.95 billion zloty ($590 million)
from 1.84 billion zloty a year earlier, PKO said in a regulatory
statement today. That compares with the 1.93 billion-zloty mean
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. First-half
profit is the highest since the six months to June 2004,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “PKO is our favorite Polish bank,” Tomasz Walkowicz, a
London-based analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a research note today.
“Fundamentals remain strong and valuation looks very attractive
versus peers.”  PKO trades at 10.5 times estimated earnings, compared with
13.4 for  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , the country’s second-largest lender,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
