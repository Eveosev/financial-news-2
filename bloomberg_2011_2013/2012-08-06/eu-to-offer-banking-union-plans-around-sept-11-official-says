The European Union will offer a slate
of banking union plans around Sept. 11, including a proposal to
give the  European Central Bank  a centralized oversight role in
the euro area, an EU official said.  The plans also will lay out the role of the European
Banking Authority as the banking union develops and how the EBA
will work with the 10 EU nations that donâ€™t use the euro, the
official told reporters in Brussels today.  One option under consideration would make the ECB the sole
representative of the 17 euro-area nations at EBA meetings, an
option preferred by the Frankfurt-based central bank, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The proposals
also may establish what day-to-day duties the ECB could delegate
to the EBA, the official said.  Senior officials are expected to hold a meeting in Brussels
in late August to discuss the proposals, the EU official said.
The goal is for the proposals to be adopted by the European
Parliament and EU governments by a December summit, the official
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
