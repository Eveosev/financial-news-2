The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff’s 
brokerage can’t sue spouses of the confidence man’s sons for 
fraud, Stephanie Mack and Deborah Madoff said in court papers, 
citing a law that says a fraudulent enterprise can’t accuse 
others of fraud.  The Madoff trustee tried to demand money from them using an
exception that applies only to corporate fiduciaries who control
a company, and they had “absolutely no role” at the brokerage,
weren’t fiduciaries and had no control over its activities, they
said in a brief filed to U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff in
 Manhattan . Rakoff, who is reviewing hundreds of the Madoff
trustee’s lawsuits to recoup money for customers, had told the
spouses to address the trustee’s use of the so-called insider
exception to the in pari delicto law governing suits by the
trustee of a fraudulent company.  Madoff trustee  Irving Picard  in 2009 first sued the Madoff
family for $198 million, alleging they used the firm as a
“family piggy bank.” U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Burton Lifland  later
gave him permission to add the Madoff sons’ former wives as
defendants, saying they could be sued for unjust enrichment.
They took the case to Rakoff for review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
