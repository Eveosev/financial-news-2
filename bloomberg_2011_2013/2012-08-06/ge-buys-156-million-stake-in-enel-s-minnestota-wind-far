General Electric Co. (GE) , the largest
maker of power-generating equipment, bought 51 percent of a wind
farm in southern Minnesota from  Enel SpA. (ENEL)   GE paid about $156 million for the stake in the 200-
megawatt Prairie Rose wind project, its Stamford, Connecticut-
based Energy Financial Services unit said today in a statement.
Enel’s Green Power North America unit committed $149 million for
a 49 percent stake and will manage the project.  The wind farm will use 119 of GE’s 1.68 megawatt wind
turbines and is expected to be completed this year, according to
the statement.  Prairie Rose will deliver power to  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) ’s
Northern States Power Co. under a 20-year contract.  A group of banks led by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  have agreed to
provide $190 million in tax-equity financing for a stake in the
wind farm once it’s complete, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
