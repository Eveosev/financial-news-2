Abilio Diniz,  chairman  of Cia.
Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar, is in talks to
sell his entire stake in Wilkes Participacoes SA, which controls
the Brazilian retailer, to  Casino Guichard Perrachon SA (CO) , a
company official familiar with the matter said.  The talks, which began in September, may lead to a sale of
Diniz’s stake before 2014, said the official, who requested
anonymity because the matter hasn’t been made public.  The Brazilian billionaire, 75, announced yesterday he will
exercise an option to sell 2.4 percent of his Wilkes shares to
Casino for $10.5 million. Under an agreement signed with Casino,
Diniz has a second option to sell his remaining Wilkes stake,
equal to 47.6 percent, after 2014.  Casino became the sole controller of Pao de Acucar on June
22 when the presidency of Wilkes passed to Casino Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Jean Charles Naouri. The transfer stems
from an agreement signed between the French retailer and Diniz
in 1999 and amended in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
