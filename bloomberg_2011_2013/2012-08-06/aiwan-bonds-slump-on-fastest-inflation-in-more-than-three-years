Taiwan’s bonds fell, with 10-year
yields rising to an almost four-week high, on speculation the
central bank will leave  interest rates  unchanged after inflation
quickened more than forecast. The local dollar strengthened.  The  consumer-price  index rose 2.46 percent from a year
earlier, the most since September 2008, the Statistics Bureau
said today. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for a 1.95 percent gain.  Stock indexes  rallied across
 Asia  after better-than-expected U.S. jobs data eased concern
that growth is slowing in the world’s largest economy.  “The high CPI number has killed expectations of a rate
cut,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-
President Assets Management Corp., who helps manage $1.6 billion
of fixed-income assets. “Good U.S. data is also helping drive
the stock-market rally today, leading to higher bond yields.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.19 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the highest level
since July 10. The government will auction NT$30 billion ($1
billion) of 20-year debt tomorrow.  Taiwan’s central bank left  borrowing costs  unchanged at
1.875 percent in June, and is scheduled to discuss monetary
policies again in September.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.96
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, dropped six basis points to 3.64 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate  fell one basis point to
0.387 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
