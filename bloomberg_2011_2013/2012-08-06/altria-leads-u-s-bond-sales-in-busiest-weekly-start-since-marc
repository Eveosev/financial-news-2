Altria Group Inc. (MO)  sold $2.8 billion
of debt to lead the busiest weekly start for U.S. corporate bond
sales in more than four months as company borrowing costs hold
at about record lows.  Altria, the largest U.S. seller of tobacco, and Summit, New
Jersey-based biopharmaceutical company  Celgene Corp. (CELG)  led
borrowers issuing $12.6 billion of bonds in the most active
start to the week since March 19, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That follows $10.7 billion of offerings on July 30,
marking the first time this year that sales opened at more than
$10 billion for two straight weeks.  Companies from the most creditworthy to the riskiest are
tapping debt markets after yields on dollar-denominated bonds
reached a record low 3.9 percent on Aug. 2, down from 4.8
percent at the end of 2011, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  index
data  show. Corporate issuers have sold $813 billion of debt in
the U.S. this year, up 3.4 percent from last year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  As investors seek higher-yielding assets while the  Federal
Reserve  holds its benchmark  interest rate  near zero for a fourth
year, the extra yield borrowers demand to own U.S. corporate
debt instead of  government securities  narrowed to 272 basis
points Aug. 3, from 299 basis points at the end of June, the
index data show.  Altria Bonds  Altria sold $1.9 billion of 2.85 percent, 10-year bonds
yielding 130 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries
and $900 million of 4.25 percent, 30-year debt with a 168 basis-
point spread, Bloomberg data show. The securities may be rated
Baa1 by Moodyâ€™s Investors Service, three levels above
speculative grade, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  Altria may use proceeds from the sale to repay debt and
repurchase obligations linked to its $2 billion tender offer for
four bond issues including the 2039 securities, the Richmond,
Virginia-based company said today in a regulatory filing.
Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG
managed the offering.  Celgene, the maker of cancer-fighting drugs Istodax and
Abraxane, sold $1.5 billion of bonds in its first offering since
October 2010. The company issued $500 million of 1.9 percent,
five-year notes to yield 130 basis points more than Treasuries
and $1 billion of 3.25 percent, 10-year debt at a relative yield
of 170 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , the Australian lender that ranks
among the 20 most-active debt issuers globally this year, sold
$1.25 billion of five-year U.S. dollar-denominated notes. The 2
percent bonds yield 137.5 basis points more than Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. The bank is the 17th most-active issuer of
bonds globally in 2012, the data show.  Other issuers include  Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ) , the wine
producer behind  Robert Mondavi  and Clos du Bois, with a $650
million sale to help fund its acquisition of a stake in Crown
Imports LLC and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) , the second-
biggest U.S. pipeline operator, with $1.75 billion of bonds in a
two-part offering, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
