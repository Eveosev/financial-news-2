Morgan Stanley (MS) , which had the largest
trading-revenue drop among major U.S. banks last quarter, lost
money in that business on 15 days in the period, up from eight
days a year earlier.  The firm’s traders generated more than $100 million on
three days in the period, compared with seven days in the second
quarter of 2011, the New York-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. None of the daily losses exceeded the firm’s
value-at-risk, a measure of how much the bank estimates it could
lose on 95 percent of days.  Morgan Stanley had a 48 percent year-over-year decrease in
trading revenue, excluding accounting gains, led by a 60 percent
drop in fixed-income revenue. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, said last month that some clients shied away from
doing business with the bank as they waited to see whether
Moody’s Investors Service would cut the firm’s credit rating two
or three grades. Moody’s lowered the assessment two levels in
June.  Trading revenue accounted for 40 percent of the firm’s
total in 2011. Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 54, said
last month he will shrink the fixed-income trading business to
free up capital. He plans to reduce so-called risk-weighted
assets in the unit by 30 percent from the third quarter of 2011
through the end of 2014.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-largest U.S. lender, said
in a filing last week that it recorded trading losses on three
days in the quarter, with the largest loss at $11 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
