New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
signed legislation that makes it harder for teachers in the
state to earn tenure and easier for them to lose it.  The bill lengthens to four years from three the time it
will take to earn tenure. Teachers could face the possible loss
of the  job security  if they score poorly in evaluations.  The measure was sponsored by Democrats, the majority party
in the state Legislature, and Republicans. Christie, a first-
term Republican, said in June that he opposed a provision in the
bill that would preserve “last-in, first-out,” a protection
that requires districts firing multiple teachers to base their
selection on seniority, rather than on performance.  The governor, 49, has battled with the New Jersey Education
Association, the state’s largest teachers union, over his
proposals. The union supported the tenure legislation once an
end to the seniority rule was removed. Barbara Keshishian,
president of the NJEA, attended Christie’s bill-signing at a
middle school in Middlesex.  Under the bill, student test scores will be part of a
teacher’s evaluation. Any educator who receives two
“ineffective” ratings, which is the lowest of four tiers, on
two consecutive annual evaluations will face tenure charges.
Binding arbitration would be required for any contested tenure
cases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
