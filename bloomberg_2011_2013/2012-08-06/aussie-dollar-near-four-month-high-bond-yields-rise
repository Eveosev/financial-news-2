Australia ’s dollar traded 0.1 percent
from the highest in more than four months and government bond
yields climbed on bets the  Reserve Bank  will refrain from
lowering the developed world’s highest interest rate tomorrow.  New Zealand’s currency was 0.2 percent from a three-month
high as Asian stocks extended a global rally in equities,
spurring appetite for higher-yielding assets. Demand for the
South Pacific nations’ dollars was tempered before reports
tomorrow that may show declines in Italian industrial production
and German factory orders, fueling concern Europe’s debt crisis
is curbing prospects for growth.  “Our rates are not moving lower, so that’s always seen as
a positive for the currency,” Hans Kunnen, chief economist at
St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney, said in reference to the Aussie.
“The Australian dollar is perceived as a pocket of risk. It was
risk-on over the weekend and that’s likely to flow through
today.”  Australia’s dollar was at $1.0565 as of 4:51 p.m. in Sydney
from $1.0569 last week, when it reached $1.0580, the strongest
since March 20. It earlier touched 83.17 yen, the highest since
May 2, before trading at 82.86.  The South Pacific nation’s 10-year yield rose 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 3.26 percent and touched
3.3 percent, the highest since May 14. The rate for the 15-year
note climbed as much as 19 basis points to 3.55 percent and
closed above the cash rate for the first time since May 4.  New Zealand ’s dollar was at 81.82 U.S. cents from 81.89 on
Aug. 3, when it touched 81.99, the highest level since April 30.
The so-called kiwi was at 64.17 yen from 64.25 last week.  RBA Bets  Interest-rate swaps data indicate traders see an 84 percent
chance RBA policy makers will hold the overnight cash-rate
target unchanged tomorrow for a second straight meeting. Of the
27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, 26 predict no change
while one forecast a reduction to 3.25 percent.  Australia has the highest benchmark borrowing costs among
major developed economies. Policy rates in New Zealand,  Norway ,
 Sweden ,  Canada  and the euro region range from 0.75 percent to
2.5 percent. Rates in  Japan  and the U.S. are as low as zero.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks advanced 1.8 percent.
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rallied 1.9 percent on Aug. 3.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 2.4 percent.  European Economy  The Aussie and kiwi slid versus most of their 16 major
counterparts amid concern the 17-nation euro region economy is
weakening as leaders struggle to find a resolution to the fiscal
crisis.  Figures from Italy’s statistics office due tomorrow may
show  output  dropped 1 percent in June after a 0.8 percent gain
in the previous month, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Factory orders  in  Germany  may have fallen
0.8 percent in the same period, after rising 0.6 percent in May,
a separate poll showed before tomorrow’s report.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  signaled last
week the central bank may purchase bonds from the region.
Details of the plan will be fleshed out in coming weeks, he
said.  “The market is still seemingly hoping for fresh stimulus
out of the ECB,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a strategist at
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore. “The Aussie’s looking a
little rich up above the $1.05 level, particularly given that
commodity prices are just not bouncing because of concerns
around the global economy.”  Oil and copper prices lost 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
