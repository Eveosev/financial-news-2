Agennix AG (AGX) ’s experimental
treatment for non-small cell lung cancer failed to meet targets
in a late-stage trial, casting doubt on the German biotechnology
company’s future.  Talactoferrin, a replica of the human protein lactoferrin,
didn’t meet its primary endpoint of improving overall survival
rate, Agennix said today in a statement.  “We are extremely disappointed and surprised
with today’s results, especially considering the earlier
promising results we had seen in two randomized Phase II trials
with talactoferrin alfa in non-small cell lung cancer,” said
Rajesh Malik, chief medical officer. “We plan to thoroughly
analyze the data to better understand these results.”  Tests of the drug involved 720 patients worldwide whose
cancer hadn’t responded to two previous therapies. The primary
target of the trial was overall survival and the secondary goal
was the drug’s effectiveness in delaying or halting the spread
of the disease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
