The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars held at the lowest in a year, according to a money
market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was little
changed at 39.5 basis points below the euro interbank offered
rate at 8:30 a.m. in  London , data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The cost is the cheapest since July 26, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 42.5 basis points, or 0.425
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 43 on Aug. 3.  The European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight indexed
average, or Eonia, was set at 11.1 basis points on Aug. 3 from
10.9 the day before. An estimate of overnight borrowing costs
over the next three months, the Eonia OIS swap, was unchanged at
8.6 basis points, the highest since July 26.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank 
to a seven-month low, placing 300 billion euros ($371 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based ECB on Aug. 3 from 324 billion euros
the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
