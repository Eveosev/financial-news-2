Investor confidence in the euro area
fell less than economists forecast in August after the  European
Central Bank  said it may take new measures to tame the region’s
debt crisis.  Germany’s Sentix research institute said its index
measuring  sentiment  in the euro-area economy fell to minus 30.3
from minus 29.6 in July. Economists forecast a decline to minus
31, the median of seven estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
shows. Sentix said a gauge of expectations rose to minus 23.3
from minus 24, while a measure of current conditions dropped to
minus 37 from minus 35.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  on Aug. 2 said the central bank
may start buying  government bonds  in tandem with  Europe ’s
bailout fund to reduce yields in countries such as Italy and
Spain. That followed his pledge a week earlier to do “whatever
it takes to preserve the euro.”  Draghi’s remarks prompted the improvement in the gauge of
expectations, Sentix said. It said 856 investors participated in
the survey, which was conducted between Aug. 2 and Aug. 4. The
results are never revised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
