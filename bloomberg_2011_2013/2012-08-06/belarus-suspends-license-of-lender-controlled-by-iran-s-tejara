Belarus’s financial regulator
suspended the license of ZAO Trade Capital Bank, controlled by
 Iran ’s third-largest lender, Bank Tejarat, for one year.  “The decision was made as a result of Trade Capital Bank
failing to comply with the requirement to fix its violations of
Belarusian law as well as in order to protect interests of the
bank’s creditors,” the central bank said today in an e-mailed
statement. Trade Capital didn’t return a call for comment.  The U.S. Treasury Department in January designated Trade
Capital as providing financial services to the Export
 Development Bank  of Iran amid sanctions against the Persian Gulf
nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
