Arcadis NV (ARCAD) , the largest Dutch
designer of dikes that last week forecast 2012 profit from
operations would rise 20 to 25 percent, acquired  Brazil ’s
biggest water engineering and consultancy company.  The company said it bought ETEP Consultoria, Gerenciamento
e Servicos Ltda. to expand in the Brazilian water market. No
terms were disclosed for the purchase of Sao Paulo-based ETEP,
which Arcadis said earns 83 percent of its revenue from water
supply, water treatment and wastewater “in the fast-developing
Brazilian water market.”  Water makes up 15 percent of Arcadis’s gross revenue, it
said last week when the Amsterdam-based company reported order
intake was strong in the second quarter, especially in the U.S.
Arcadis shares have climbed 33 percent over the past year.  ETEP has 300 employees and an annual net revenue of 16
million euros ($20 million), Arcadis said today in a website
statement. It acquired the shares from management, “who will
all stay with the business,” Arcadis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
