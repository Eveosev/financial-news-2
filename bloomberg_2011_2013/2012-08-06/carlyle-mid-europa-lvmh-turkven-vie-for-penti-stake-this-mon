Owners of  Turkey ’s hosiery and
swimwear maker  Penti Corap Sanayi & Ticaret AS  will decide this
month to sell a stake to one of the three shortlisted potential
buyers, said Kerim Kotan, managing director of sell-side adviser
 Pragma Corporate Finance .  The  Carlyle Group , Mid Europa Partners LLP and a
partnership between a unit of  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA (MC)  and Istanbul-based Turkven Private Equity are shortlisted
from “many private equity firms” that showed an initial
interest in the minority asset, Kotan said in a telephone
interview in Istanbul today.  Last year, 46 mergers and acquisitions were done by private
equity firms in Turkey, out of a total of 241 deals, Deloitte &
Touche LLP said in January. BC Partners Ltd., Abraaj Capital
Ltd. and Carlyle are among international private equity firms
that have invested in Turkey in recent years as companies seek
to tap the country’s $772 billion economy, which grew 8.5
percent in 2011, the fastest pace among Group of 20 countries
after  China  and  Argentina .  “We are hoping to find the best partner for Penti to carry
its operations forward and the deal is likely to be signed
within a few weeks,” Kotan said.  Penti’s owners, the Kariyo and Beresi families, hired
Istanbul-based M&A adviser Pragma to advise them on the sale and
they are seeking to sell a minority stake of as much as 49
percent, Sami Kariyo, chairman of Penti, said on April 25.  Istanbul-based Penti, which sells underwear and stockings,
has 27 shops in 15 countries outside Turkey and seeks to
increase the number of its domestic outlets to 180 from 140,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
