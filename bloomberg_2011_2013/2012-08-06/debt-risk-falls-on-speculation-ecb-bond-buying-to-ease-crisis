The cost of insuring sovereign and
corporate debt fell on speculation the  European Central Bank ’s
plan to buy  government bonds  will help lower borrowing costs and
stem the euro area’s crisis.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 15
basis points to 579 at 11:30 a.m. in London, the lowest since
March 21. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Credit markets extended a rally triggered last week when
ECB President  Mario Draghi  signaled the central bank may buy
debt, though the details are still being worked out. The plan
won support from German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government
and Spain said it hasn’t ruled out requesting aid.  “The market is clearly encouraged by ECB’s guidance as
bearish bets continue to be pared back,”  Jim Reid , head of
fundamental strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a
note to investors. “If we can get to a stage where the ECB
aggressively buys bonds then it will give Europe more time to
try to find a growth miracle.”  Credit-default swaps on Italy fell 14 basis points to 459.5
and Spain dropped 12 to 523, both the lowest in a month. The
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of 15 governments fell
1.5 basis points to 248, the lowest since the series started
trading in March.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell four basis points to 146 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers fell eight basis points to 238 and the
subordinated index declined 12 to 393.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
