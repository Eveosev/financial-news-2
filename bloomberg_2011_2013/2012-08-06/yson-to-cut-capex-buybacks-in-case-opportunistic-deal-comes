Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the largest U.S.
meat processor, is cutting  capital expenditures  and stock
buybacks partly to keep “a lot of dry powder around for an
opportunistic acquisition,” Chief Executive Officer Donnie Smith said.  “The parts of our business where we want to accelerate
growth is value-added poultry, our prepared foods business and
our international businesses,” Smith said in a conference call
with reporters today to discuss the Springdale, Arkansas-based
company’s third-quarter earnings. “Those would be the three
areas where we would likely be pursuing acquisitions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
