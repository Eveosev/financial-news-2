Prada SpA (1913) , the Italian fashion
company that owns the Miu Miu and Church’s brands, climbed to a
record in  Hong Kong  trading after posting first-half sales that
beat analyst estimates amid higher demand from Asian shoppers.  Prada rose as much as 4.4 percent to HK$56, the highest
level since its public offering in June last year, before
gaining 3 percent to HK$55.25 at 9:50 a.m. local time. The
benchmark  Hang Seng  index gained 0.2 percent.  Sales increased 37 percent from a year earlier to 1.55
billion euros ($1.9 billion) in the six months ended July 31,
the company said yesterday. Analysts projected revenue of 1.5
billion euros, based on the average of seven  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli is counting on
the strength of Prada’s brand to overcome Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis and slowing economic growth in China. The company
has lower store penetration than competitors, giving it a lot of
potential to expand, according to Candy Huang, an analyst at
Barclays Plc in Hong Kong.  The company said its directly operated stores recorded a
like-for-like sales growth of 19 percent. Prada’s  revenue 
increased 31 percent in the Americas, 37 percent in  Europe  and
45 percent in Asia Pacific ex-Japan during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
