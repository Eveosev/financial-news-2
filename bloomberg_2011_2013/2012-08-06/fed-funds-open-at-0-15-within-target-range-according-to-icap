Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.15 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.10 percent on Aug. 3 after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.15 percent and averaging 0.133 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will buy $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion of
Treasuries maturing from August 220 to May 2022. The purchases
are part of the Fed’s program to replace $267 billion of short-
term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an
effort to keep borrowing costs low.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  may also conduct
”small-value” repurchase agreements with its primary dealers
as part of its “operational readiness program.” The operations
don’t represent any change in Fed monetary policy and are part
of the central bank’s efforts to test its readiness to conduct
temporary open market operations in the future.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
