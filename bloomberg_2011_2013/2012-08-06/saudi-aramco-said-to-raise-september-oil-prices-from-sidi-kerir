Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worldâ€™s
largest crude exporter, raised its September official selling
price for Arab Light blend from the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Saudi Aramco , as the state-run producer is known, increased
the differential of Arab Light by $2.35 to a premium of 60 cents
a barrel to the Brent weighted average, or BWAVE, posted by the
 Intercontinental Exchange , said the people, who declined to be
identified as the information is confidential.  Prices of all four grades from Sidi Kerir were 45 cents
more expensive than those from  Ras Tanura  in the  Persian Gulf 
for customers in the Mediterranean, they said.  The following table gives differentials for the four blends
loading from Sidi Kerir in relation to BWAVE on a free-on-board
basis, the month-on-month change and the degrees of gravity as
defined by the  American Petroleum Institute . Prices are in U.S.
dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
