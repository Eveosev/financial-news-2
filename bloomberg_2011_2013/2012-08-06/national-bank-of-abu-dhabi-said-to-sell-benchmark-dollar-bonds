National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , the
United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest bank by assets, will raise
$750 million from the sale of seven-year dollar bonds, according
to a banker familiar with the deal.  The notes will be priced to yield 180 basis points above
the benchmark midswap rate, the banker said, asking not to be
identified because the information is private.  Citigroup Inc (C) ,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and National Bank
of Abu Dhabi are managing the sale of the securities and the
bonds may be priced early this week, the banker said.  The bank, rated the  fourth-highest investment  grade by
Moody’s Investors Service, last sold dollar bonds in March,
raising $750 million from the sale of five-year debt. The
securities were priced at 190 basis points over the midswap
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks in the Persian Gulf are taking advantage of midswap
rates near their lowest in more than 20 years to sell bonds as
they seek to raise long-term funds and refinance debt.
Governments and companies in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council, which includes the U.A.E.,  Saudi Arabia  and Qatar, have
raised $26.2 billion from bond sales this year, more than twice
the $12 billion sold in the same period last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on National Bank of  Abu Dhabi ’s 3.25 percent
bonds maturing in March 2017 gained three basis points, or 0.03
of a percentage point, to 2.55 percent at 4:26 p.m. in Dubai.
The yield tumbled 32 basis points last month.  The bank on July 24 reported a 2 percent increase in
second-quarter profit to  1.05 billion dirhams  ($286 million),
meeting analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
