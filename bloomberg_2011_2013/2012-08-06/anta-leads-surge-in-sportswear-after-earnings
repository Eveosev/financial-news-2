Anta Sports Products Ltd. (2020)  surged the
most in more than three years in Hong Kong trading, leading
other sportswear companies higher, after reporting first-half
earnings that beat estimates.  Anta jumped 17 percent to close at HK$4.85, its biggest
gain since November 2008. Competitor Li Ning Co. climbed 12
percent,  Peak Sport Products Co. (1968)  gained 8.9 percent and  361
Degrees International Ltd. (1361)  gained 5.7 percent.  Anta’s reported earnings of 770 million yuan for the first
six months of the year, topping the average estimate of 717
million yuan from three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. China’s
sportswear industry has been hurt by excess inventory in the
segment and Anta said today that it has “strictly” controlled
new store openings and closed less efficient ones.  “The result was lifted by a reduction in marketing
expenses and the previous estimates could be overly
pessimistic,” said Forrest Chan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
CCB International.  To contact the reporter on this story:
