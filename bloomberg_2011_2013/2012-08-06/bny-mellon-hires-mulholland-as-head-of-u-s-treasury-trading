BNY Mellon Corp., the world’s largest
custody bank, hired Dan Mulholland of  RBC Capital Markets  as
head of U.S. Treasury trading in its capital markets unit and
recruited an eight-person team specializing in mortgage-backed
securities from Ally Securities.  The mortgage team will be led by Dave Piersol as head of
sales and Joe Gaziano as head of MBS pass-through trading, New
York-based BNY Mellon said in a statement today. On the Treasury
side, Avram Altaras also joined the bank from RBC.  The new additions will help enhance “our ability to
service clients across the full-range of fixed-income
securities,” Gary Strumeyer, president of BNY Mellon Capital
Markets, said in the statement. The capital markets group is a
non-bank broker dealer subsidiary of the bank.  BNY Mellon has $27 trillion in assets under custody and
$1.3 trillion in assets under management. The shares have gained
9.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
