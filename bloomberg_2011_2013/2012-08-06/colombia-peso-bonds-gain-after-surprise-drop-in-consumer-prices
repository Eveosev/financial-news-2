Colombia ’s peso bonds rose after an
unexpected decline in consumer prices last month fueled
speculation that the central bank will cut borrowing costs
further this year.  Prices fell 0.02 percent in July, compared with a gain of
0.08 percent in June, the national statistics agency said in an
Aug. 4 report. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 0.06 percent increase.  Annual inflation 
slowed to 3.03 percent, within the central bank’s 2 percent to 4
percent target.  “This is an additional sign that in terms of inflation the
central bank feels comfortable and therefore there is room to
cut the  interest rate  further if needed,” Daniel Lozano, an
analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota, said in a telephone
interview.  The yield on the government’s 11.25 percent peso-
denominated debt due in October 2018 fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 5.99 percent, according to the central
bank. The price rose 0.257 centavo to 126.585 centavos per peso.  Today’s rally extended the decline in yields on the
securities to 24 basis points since the central bank
unexpectedly cut the  overnight lending rate  by a quarter-
percentage point to 5 percent on July 27.  The peso erased an earlier gain, declining 0.1 percent to
1,788.50 per  U.S. dollar . It has gained 8.4 percent this year,
the best performance after the Chilean peso among Latin America
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Dollar Purchases  Colombian Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry stepped up
pressure on the central bank to boost dollar purchases and damp
a rally in the peso that threatens to undermine local industry
and farmers.  Echeverry said in an Aug. 3 interview that increased daily
dollar purchases and boosted spending on infrastructure in the
second half will help Colombia achieve his growth target of as
much as 4.8 percent this year.  Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe reiterated July 27 that
Banco de la Republica will keep buying a minimum of $20 million
daily in the  spot market  until at least Nov. 2.  A report from the  Finance Ministry  released last month said
the central bank should buy $54 million daily to reach an
“optimum” level of international reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
