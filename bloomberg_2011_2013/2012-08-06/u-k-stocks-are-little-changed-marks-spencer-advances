creditors agreed on the need to strengthen policy efforts.  Rio Tinto  Group, the world’s third-largest mining company,

volumes.”  The number of shares changing hands on the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  was 21

billion) of rescue packages.  “The week has got off to a very quiet start,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index in London. “After last

the Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the
information. A spokeswoman for Marks & Spencer declined to
comment.  Burberry Gains  Burberry Group Plc, the U.K.’s biggest luxury-goods
company, rose 1.9 percent to 1,330 pence. Prada SpA, the Italian
