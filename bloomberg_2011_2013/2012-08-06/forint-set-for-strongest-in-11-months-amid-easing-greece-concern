The forint gained a second day
against the euro, heading for its strongest level in 11 months,
as easing concern over  Greece ’s fiscal performance boosted
investor appetite for emerging-market assets.  The Hungarian currency advanced 0.7 percent to 275.56 per
euro by 1:41 p.m. in Budapest, heading for its highest close
since Sept. 2. The yield on  government bonds  due in 2022 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.39 percent, the
lowest in two weeks.  Greece and its creditors agreed on the need for more budget
cuts to comply with bailout terms after more than a week of
meetings in Athens as representatives of the European
Commission,  European Central Bank  and  International Monetary
Fund  said the country is making progress on meeting bailout
terms. Hungary, which has the EU’s highest benchmark interest
rate and is the bloc’s most-indebted eastern member, will resume
financial aid talks with the IMF and the EU next month and hopes
to seal an agreement “by the end of autumn,”  Mihaly Varga , the
government’s chief negotiator with the lenders, said July 26.  Developments in Greece “may lead to the pricing out of a
prominent market fear, prompting a continuation of last week’s
optimism,” analysts at Budapest-based brokerage Equilor Zrt.
said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The cost of insuring against default on Hungary’s debt with
credit-default swaps fell 11 basis points to 434.337 basis
points, the lowest since Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
