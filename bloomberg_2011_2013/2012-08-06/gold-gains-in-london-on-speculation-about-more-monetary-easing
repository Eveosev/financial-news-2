Gold gained for a second day in
London on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will do more to
support growth.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  speaks on economic measurement
in Cambridge, Massachusetts today. Labor Department data on Aug.
3 showed U.S. payrolls rose 163,000 in July, the most since
February and exceeding the 100,000 gain estimated by economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Still, the  unemployment rate  rose to
8.3 percent from 8.2 percent in June.  “New job additions surprisingly rose much more than what
the markets had anticipated, but the unemployment rate too
unexpectedly rose,” analysts at Mumbai, India-based AnandRathi
Commodities Ltd. said today in a report. “The latter kept the
door open for QE3,” they said, referring to quantitative
easing.  Immediate-delivery bullion rose 0.3 percent to $1,608.93 an
ounce by 11:10 a.m. in London. Prices dropped 1.2 percent last
week, the most since June 22. December-delivery futures were 0.1
percent higher at $1,611.40 on the Comex in  New York .  Gold at the morning “fixing,” used by some mining
companies to sell output, increased to $1,606.75 an ounce in
London from $1,602 in the afternoon on Aug. 3.  Hedge funds  and other money managers increased their bets
on higher  gold prices  by 35 percent in the week ended July 31,
U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission  data  show. Holdings in
exchange-traded products expanded for a fourth day on Aug. 3,
climbing 3.6 metric tons to 2,400.8 tons, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The Fed said on Aug. 1 that it “will provide additional
accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery
and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a
context of  price stability .” Gold rose about 70 percent as the
Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of quantitative
easing that ended in June 2011.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at
$27.7775 an ounce. Palladium declined 0.7 percent to $576.63 an
ounce. Platinum was 0.5 percent lower at $1,399.13 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
