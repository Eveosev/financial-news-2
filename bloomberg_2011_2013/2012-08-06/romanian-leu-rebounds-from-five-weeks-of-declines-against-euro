Romania ’s leu strengthened from its
record low after the nation’s central bank was said to buy the
currency.  The leu appreciated 1.1 percent to 4.5743 per euro by 5:26
p.m. in Bucharest. The Romanian currency was the world’s second-
worst performer last month with a 3 percent slump against the
euro, and reached an all-time intraday low of 4.6520 on Aug. 3.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei exchanged euros into lei in
the first half of today, said two traders at Bucharest-based
banks, who couldn’t be identified because of company policy.
Mugur Stet, a spokesman with the central bank, declined to
comment when contacted by phone by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
