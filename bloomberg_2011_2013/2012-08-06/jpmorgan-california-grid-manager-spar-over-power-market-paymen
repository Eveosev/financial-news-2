JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said accusations
of market manipulation by  California ’s electric-grid operator
are “irrelevant and unproven” as the parties spar over
payments for power from 2009 to 2011.  The California Independent System Operator, which oversees
the wholesale power market in the state, has said the payments
were excessive and the result of bidding behavior and took the
case to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. JPMorgan
said the California operator reached conclusions before FERC
completes its investigation.  The state operator “cannot muster any meaningful,
substantive responses to the legal arguments” in the case,
according to an Aug. 3 filing made by JPMorgan. “Therefore it
resorts to irrelevant and unproven allegations” about the
bidding.  FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in March that the agency
will be vigorous in seeking to stop companies from manipulating
electricity markets, after the agency reached a record $245
million settlement with Constellation Energy Group Inc. for
trading practices in  New York  and  New England .  JPMorgan’s role was disclosed when the agency, responding
to a complaint from the state, asked a federal judge in
 Washington  to retrieve some of JPMorgan’s e-mails as part of the
investigation. JPMorgan has said it acted within the law in its
bidding for California power.  FERC doesn’t have any deadline for ruling on California’s
request, agency’s spokesman Craig Cano said by phone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
