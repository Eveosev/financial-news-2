Coffee production in  Vietnam , the
world’s biggest grower of robusta, may drop 10 percent in
2012-2013 after old branches were pruned following a record
harvest, resulting in fewer fruit, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders, growers and shippers.  Output may drop to 1.3 million metric tons next year
compared with this season’s 1.45 million tons, according to the
median estimates in the survey. A total of 10 respondents gave
forecasts for this year, while seven offered figures for next
year. Vietnam’s 2012-2013 season starts in October.  The outlook for a smaller crop may reinforce speculation
that supplies of the bitter-tasting beans, used in instant
drinks, may be limited next year as demand gains. Global robusta
output will exceed demand by only 500,000 bags of 60 kilograms
each next season, according to CoffeeNetwork, a unit of INTL
FCStone Inc. Demand this season has risen 5.5 million bags,
London-based fund Holland Capital LLP said in July.  “After such a good coffee harvest branches become weaker,
so they had to cut old branches for new ones to come out,” said
Le Tien Hung, Dak Lak-based deputy general director of Sept. 2nd
Import-Export Co. “New branches won’t be strong enough to bear
many fruit, so output will probably fall.”  Robusta for September delivery ended at $2,224 a ton on
Aug. 3 on NYSE Liffe. Most-active prices have rallied 23 percent
this year as roasters boosted the share of the variety in
blends, cutting the amount of costlier arabica, and as emerging-
market demand rose. Arabica prices fell 23 percent.  ‘Stronger Demand’  There’s “stronger demand for cheaper coffee,” the
 International Coffee Organization  said in a monthly report on
Aug. 2, citing record robusta shipments and higher prices.
Exports climbed 11 percent to 31.7 million bags from the start
of the season in October through to June, ICO data showed.  The 2012-2013 harvest in Vietnam may be 5 percent to 7
percent smaller than the 2011-2012 crop, Amsterdam-based
Nedcoffee BV said in a report last month. The 2012-2013 crop may
decline 15 percent as flowers that blossomed early dropped off
trees, leaving no beans,  Luong Van Tu , chairman of the Vietnam
Coffee & Cocoa Association, said in June.  The survey’s findings differ from projections from the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture , which puts this year’s total harvest
at 21 million bags (1.26 million tons) and 2012-2013’s at 22.4
million bags.  Output in Vietnam may drop 16 percent to 1.08 million tons
by 2015 as the government replaces aging trees with new ones,
and as the growing area is cut to make room for other crops, the
Ministry of Agriculture and  Rural Development  said July 26.
Robusta is harvested mainly in Asia and parts of Africa, while
arabica is grown in  Latin America  and is favored for specialty
drinks such as those made by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
