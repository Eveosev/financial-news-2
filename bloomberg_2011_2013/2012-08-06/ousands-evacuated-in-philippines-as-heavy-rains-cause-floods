Thousands fled their homes in the
 Philippines  as heavy rains overnight caused rivers and dams near
the capital to rise, Office of Civil Defense Director Susana
Cruz said in a mobile-phone message today.  More than 4,000 people were evacuated in Marikina City and
about 300 more in Valenzuela City, while more than 800 families
in Quezon City spent the night in temporary evacuation centers,
Cruz said. Some local governments in the capital suspended
classes because of flooding, the Philippine Star reported today.  The local weather bureau warned in its 11 a.m. bulletin
that the southwest monsoon could trigger flashfloods and
landslides in northern and central Philippines. In 2011, the
damage due to typhoons and other calamities reached 59.2 billion
pesos, Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan told
lawmakers today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
