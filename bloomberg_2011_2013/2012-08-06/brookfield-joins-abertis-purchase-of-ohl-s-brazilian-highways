Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE)  said it
will buy a stake in  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) ’s Brazilian unit
jointly with Brookfield Infrastructure, and the deal may prompt
a full takeover bid for Sao Paulo-listed  OHL Brasil. (OHLB3)   Abertis and Brookfield will buy 60 percent of OHL Brasil,
giving Madrid-based OHL 10 percent of Abertis and taking on 504
million euros ($623 million) of liabilities, Barcelona-based
Abertis said in a filing today. Brazilian law may require a bid
for the remaining OHL Brasil shares, the company added.  Brookfield is helping Abertis in a plan it announced in
April to diversify away from  Spain , where toll-road traffic is
suffering amid the second recession since 2009. The company said
last month it may include a financial partner to buy the
Brazilian highways.  Abertis shares rose 0.5 percent to 9.92 euros at 11 a.m. in
 Madrid . OHL rose 0.9 percent and the Ibex 35 main share index
added 0.3 percent. Brookfield Infrastucture invests in
utilities, transport, energy and timber assets.  The purchase will add 800 million euros of revenue and 500
million euros of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization in 2013, Abertis said. It will increase the amount
of roads the company manages to 7,000 kilometers and reduce the
share of the Spanish road business to 27 percent of revenue,
while  Brazil  will account for 20 percent. The deal will close by
the end of the year.  OHL will increase its holding in Barcelona-based Abertis to
15 percent after receiving 10 percent from Abertis and
Brookfield, which are splitting the transaction 51 percent to 49
percent respectively.  Abertis said it will place as much as 4.9 percent of its
own shares that it now holds as treasury stock “at the disposal
of Brookfield.” The deal also involves Abertis and Brookfield
making a payment of 10.7 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
