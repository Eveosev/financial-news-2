Iran  “firmly” rejects claims that a
group of people abducted by Syrian rebels near Damascus include
members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Iranian deputy
foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said.  All the individuals are pilgrims who sought to visit holy
sites in Damascus to commemorate the birth of one of the Muslim
Shiite Imams, Amir-Abdollahian  said  in an interview with the
state-run Al-Alam news channel.  “Those who carried out this operation had pre-planned it
and they have kidnapped Iranians before,” he said in a report
published on Iranian state television’s website. “Their aim is
to put pressure on Iran to end its support for the Syrian
nation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
