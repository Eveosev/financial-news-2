Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) ’s bonds
surged for a second day after the market maker said it raised
$400 million by selling convertible preferred securities to
cover losses from a software failure.  The company’s $375 million of 3.5 percent convertible bonds
due in March 2015 jumped 8.4 cents to 87.4 cents on the dollar
at 2:11 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The debt, which traded as low as 40 cents on the dollar on Aug.
2, is yielding 9.1 percent, down from 20.5 percent last week.  Knight, whose market-making unit executes about 10 percent
of U.S. shares, has been fighting for  survival  since a computer
malfunction spurred price swings of 10 percent or more in dozens
of companies on Aug. 1. That led to a $440 million loss, almost
quadruple the firm’s 2011 net income.  Investors agreed to buy preferred stock that will be
convertible into about 267 million common shares, the company
said today. Getco LLC, an automated trading firm, Blackstone
Group LP, brokerages Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and  TD Ameritrade
Holding Corp. (AMTD) , and the investment banks Stephens Inc. and
Jefferies Group Inc. are investing, according to a statement.
The new investors will own about 73 percent of the company once
the 2 percent preferred shares are converted into stock,
according to calculations based on Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
