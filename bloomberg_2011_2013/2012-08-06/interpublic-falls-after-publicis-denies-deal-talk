  Interpublic Group of Cos . tumbled
after  Publicis Groupe SA (PUB)  said it hasn’t held takeover talks with
the ad company or engaged a bank to support discussions,
following a newspaper report saying the French company may bid.  Interpublic fell 7.8 percent to $10.11 at the close in  New
York , for the  second-worst performance  in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. The owner of ad agencies McCann and Draftfcb had
risen 13 percent this year through Aug. 3.  “Following the speculations published by FT.com Alphaville
and their resulting widespread publicity, Publicis Groupe denies
having engaged in any discussions with Interpublic Group of Cos
and confirms that it has not commissioned any bank to undertake
any such discussions,” the Paris-based company said in a
statement today.  On Friday, the Financial Times’ Alphaville section reported
that Publicis was working with a group of banks, including
Rothschild, on a cash-and-stock bid for New York-based
Interpublic that would value the target at about $15 a share,
citing people it didn’t identify.  “Our usually knowledgeable sources turned out to be
lacking on this occasion,”the newspaper said, after Publicis
denied the talks.  Publicis, owner of ad agency  Saatchi & Saatchi , rose less
than 1 percent to 41.03 euros in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
