Theodoros Pantalakis, former head of
 Agricultural Bank of Greece SA , repatriated most of the money he
sent abroad to make investment transactions,  Euro2day  reported,
without saying how it got the information.  The transactions didnâ€™t take place so that Pantalakis
returned most of the money which was legally earned and declared
to tax authorities, the Athens-based financial web site reported
today.  Pantalakis left Agricultural Bank in July when its healthy
assets were bought for 95 million euros ($117.5 million) by
 Piraeus Bank SA. (TPEIR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
