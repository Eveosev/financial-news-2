HTC Corp. (2498) ,  Asia ’s second-largest
smartphone maker, dropped to its lowest level in more than two
years in Taipei trading after forecasting revenue that missed
analyst estimates amid intensifying competition.  The company  fell 6.9 percent to NT$258.50 as of 9:48 a.m.
local time, set for the lowest close since Feb. 8, 2010. The
stock has declined 48 percent this year. The benchmark Taiex
index rose 1.4 percent today.  New models from Samsung Electronics Co. and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  will
suppress revenue at HTC until the end of the year, according to
KGI Securities Co. Third-quarter revenue will be NT$70 billion
($2.3 billion) to NT$80 billion, HTC said, compared with the
NT$87 billion average of 10 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg in the 28 days before the company, maker of the One,
Sensation and Desire handsets, issued its forecast.  “We expect HTC’s One series will continue to face
competition from Samsung’s Galaxy S3, Note 2 and Apple iPhone 5
in the second half of 2012,” KGI Taipei-based analyst Richard Ko wrote in an Aug. 3 report, cutting his price estimate 33
percent to NT$180 and reiterating an underperform rating.  HTC has reported revenue that missed analyst estimates for
four consecutive quarters, according to Bloomberg  data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
