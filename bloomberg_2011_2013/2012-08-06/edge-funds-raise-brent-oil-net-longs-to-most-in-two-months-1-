Hedge funds  and other money managers
raised bullish bets on  Brent crude  to the highest level in more
than two months, according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 86,065
contracts in the week ended July 31, the London-based exchange
said today in its weekly Commitment of Traders report. That’s an
increase of 8,555 lots. Net longs were at 91,208 on May 22, the
data show.  Bearish bets by producers, merchants, processors and users
of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 176,948 lots, compared
with 168,555 last week. Swaps dealers were net-long 91,891
positions, from 94,312 a week earlier.  Money managers’ net-long bets on ICE gasoil futures and
options rose to 38,148 positions, compared with 37,801 contracts
