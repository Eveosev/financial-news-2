Mexico ’s peso rose for a third day as
better-than-estimated corporate earnings in the U.S. boosted the
economic outlook for the chief destination of the Latin American
country’s exports.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 13.071 per dollar at 9:50
a.m. in Mexico City, bringing its rally this year to 6.6
percent, the biggest among the most-traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  About 73 percent of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
companies that reported second-quarter results have beaten
analysts’ earnings estimates even as 59 percent missed sales
projections, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Mexico depends on
exports for about 30 percent of its gross domestic product and
sends 80 percent of them to its northern neighbor.  The earnings “are being interpreted as good,” Eduardo
Rodriguez, a currency trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB, said
in a phone interview from Guadalajara, Mexico. “The environment
of optimism is definitely going to continue. The peso has a big
margin for appreciation for structural reasons.”  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024
declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.40
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.2 centavo to 141.38 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
