Farmers turned more than 23 million
acres (9.3 million hectares) of wild habitats into corn, soy and
wheat fields since 2008, as crop prices and subsidies rose,
according to a report by an environmental group.  Texas ,  South Dakota ,  Iowa  and  Nebraska  were the top states
for switching grasslands and wetlands to crops, according to a
 report  today by the Washington-based Environmental Working Group
that analyzed satellite data from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  Exports, ethanol production and cattle-feed demands have
pushed up demand for corn, the largest U.S. crop, and with it
corn prices. Soybean and wheat prices increased along with that
of corn.  U.S. farmers were forecast to plant 96.4 million acres of
corn this year, the most since 1937, USDA said June 29. Surging
demand and unusual weather in 2011 left U.S. corn stockpiles at
a 16-year low and kept prices at their highest annual average
ever.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$8.03 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today. The price
gained 27 percent last month, as a drought intensified in the
nation’s Corn Belt.  The Environmental Working Group said government-subsidized
crop insurance is distorting farmers’ decisions and inducing
them to plant on “marginally productive land,” according to
the 12-page report.  Grassland replaced by crops threatens the swift fox and
puts at risk species such as the sage grouse, the lesser prairie
chicken and the whooping crane, according to the report, citing
USDA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
