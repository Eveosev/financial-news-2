Germany’s vice chancellor Philipp Roesler opposes  Mario Monti ’s calls on governments to exercise
greater autonomy from national parliaments in taking crisis
decisions, Bild reported, citing an interview.  The control of the government by the parliament is “one of
the foundations of our democracy,” Bild quotes Roesler as
saying, following comments from Italy’s Prime Minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
