Spanish and Italian two-year notes
climbed for a fourth day, outperforming their 10-year
equivalents, amid speculation the  European Central Bank  will buy
the securities in an attempt to calm euro-region turmoil.  German 10-year bunds rose, with yields falling from the
highest in a month, after Italy’s Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
warned of a potential breakup of  Europe . The additional yield
investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year bonds over the nation’s
two-year notes rose to a record. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said
on Aug. 2 any bond purchases undertaken by the bank in unison
with the European Financial Stability Facility would focus “on
the short end of the yield curve.”  “Expectations that the ECB may buy short-dated paper is
bolstering” demand for Spanish and Italian notes, said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  in
London. Rates are “increasingly discounting the likelihood that
 Spain  may request help from the EFSF, which would be a
precondition of any future buying by the ECB.”  Spain’s two-year yield dropped 48 basis points, or 0.48
percentage point, to 3.48 percent at 4:12 p.m.  London  time. The
4.75 percent note due July 2014 climbed 0.9, or 9 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,236) face amount, to 102.38. The 10-year yield
slid 11 basis points to 6.74 percent.  The  yield  spread between Spain’s 10-year bonds and two-year
notes widened to as much as 343 basis points, the most since
Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1993.  Spain Waits  Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has not ruled out
requesting aid, telling ABC newspaper at the weekend that his
country awaits details of the ECB’s bond-buying proposals before
deciding.  The rate on Italian two-year notes slid eight basis points
to 3.05 percent, while the yield on the 10-year security was
five basis points lower at 6 percent.  Monti, in an interview with  Germany ’s Der Spiegel magazine
published yesterday, said disagreements within the 17-nation
euro area are detracting from the policy response to the debt
crisis and undermining the future of the European Union. French
President  Francois Hollande  is pushing Italy and Spain to
request aid, Italian newspaper la Repubblica reported today
without citing anyone.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government backs the ECB
action announced by Draghi last week, spokesman Georg Streiter
said today. Germany has “no doubt” that the ECB is acting
within its mandate, he told reporters at a regular government
press briefing in Berlin today.  Bunds Rise  The yield on German 10-year government bunds fell three
basis points to 1.40 percent after earlier rising to 1.44
percent, the highest since July 5. The securities outperformed
their French counterparts, which were little changed, yielding
2.11 percent.  German debt returned 3.3 percent this year through Aug. 3,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
fell 4.3 percent and  Italy ’s debt rose 8.5 percent.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by Spain and  Belgium , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-year and 10-
year securities and credit-default swaps.  Portuguese two-year yields dropped 1.11 percentage points
to 6.73 percent, while the rate on the nation’s 10-year bond
yield fell 51 basis points to 10.47 percent. The rate has
plunged by about 7 percentage points since late January.  Dutch Sale  Greece’s 10-year bonds advanced after the nation and its
international creditors agreed on the need to strengthen policy
efforts to support the economy and comply with its bailout
terms. The announcement comes after nearly two weeks of talks to
determine whether  Greece  continues receiving funds from the
country’s 240 billion euros of rescue packages.  The yield on Greek government debt due February 2023 slid
65 basis points to 25.16 percent.  The Netherlands sold 1.24 billion euros of three-month
bills at a record-low auction yield of minus 0.051 percent,
versus minus 0.041 percent at a previous sale on July 16.  The nation also sold 1.26 billion euros of six-month bills
at an average yield of minus 0.02 percent. That compares with a
record-low rate of minus 0.029 percent at a sale of similar-
dated securities last month.  France  sold 3.8 billion euros of three-month bills at an
average yield of minus 0.01 percent, unchanged from a previous
sale of similar-dated securities on July 30. That compares with
a record-low auction yield of minus 0.02 percent on July 23. The
nation also sold six- and 12-month bills, at yields of minus
0.01 percent and minus 0.006 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
