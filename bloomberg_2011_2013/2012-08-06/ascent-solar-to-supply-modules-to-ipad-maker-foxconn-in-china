Foxconn Technology Group, the maker
of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and iPads in  China , is planning a rooftop
solar project using panels from Thornton, Colorado-based  Ascent
Solar Technologies Inc. (ASTI)   Ascent’s flexible copper-indium-gallium-selenide modules
may be installed at Foxconn’s new factory in Zhengzhou, China,
within 45 days, Victor Lee, the solar company’s chief executive
officer, said today by e-mail.  The 2-kilowatt to 3-kilowatt pilot system may be followed
by additional sales, Ascent said today in a statement that
didn’t give a price.  “Ascent Solar is hopeful that a successful pilot
application will lead to larger orders from Foxconn in the
future,” according to the statement.  Ascent surged 6.1 percent to $1.22 at the close in New
York. The company has more than doubled since it announced June
6 a solar-powered charger case for Apple’s iPhone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
