U.K. Chief Secretary to the Treasury
Danny Alexander said adopting the right policies for Britain is
more important than the country’s credit rating.  His comments contrast with Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne ’s emphasis on Britain’s top credit grade, which
he has repeatedly cited to justify his fiscal-austerity program.  “The credit rating is not the be-all and end-all,”
Alexander said on BBC Radio 4 today. “What matters is have we
got the right policy mix for the country to get people back into
work, to support economic growth, to deal with the huge problems
in our public finances, and the credit agencies reflect on those
things and the ratings they give are a reflection of the
credibility of that mix.”  When  Standard & Poor’s  reaffirmed Britain’s AAA rating on
July 27, Osborne issued a statement saying the decision was a
vote of confidence in the U.K.  “On the day Britain welcomes the world to our country for
the  Olympic Games , this is a reminder that despite the economic
problems we face, the world has confidence that we are dealing
with them,” the chancellor said.  S&P said that the U.K. economy should begin to recover in
the second half of this year and steadily strengthen, helping to
reduce the  budget deficit . The  economy  shrank 0.7 percent
between April and June, extending the recession to nine months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
