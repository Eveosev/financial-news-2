Peru ’s sol rose for a second straight
day on speculation European and U.S. central banks may take
additional steps to boost economic growth, supporting demand for
emerging-market assets.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.6180 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
That level is the strongest since 1996,  data  from Peru’s
financial regulator indicate.  “As investors perceive liquidity will continue to flow
from developed countries, they look for higher returns in
countries such as Peru that are seen as attractive with
relatively low risk,” Juan Carlos Odar, an economist at Banco
de Credito del Peru in Lima, said in a phone interview.  Global stocks rallied as German Chancellor Angel Merkel’s
government backed the  European Central Bank ’s bond-buying plan
to help bring down borrowing costs in Spain and Italy. The
 Federal Reserve  said Aug. 1 that it “will provide additional
accommodation as needed” to bolster the economic expansion.  The yield on Peru’s 6.95 percent sol-denominated bond due
in August 2031 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 5.25 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price fell 0.18 centimo to 120.21 centimos per sol.  Peru’s central bank said on its website that it didn’t buy
dollars in the  spot market  today. The last time it  intervened  in
the market was July 19, when it purchased $164 million to slow
the sol’s advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
