Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) , maker
of iPads for Apple Inc., climbed the most in almost four years
in Taipei trading after saying it will renegotiate the price of
its planned stake in  Sharp Corp. (6753)   Hon Hai, flagship of the Foxconn Technology Group, jumped
as much as 7 percent to NT$87.30, headed for the biggest
increase since September 2008. Foxconn Technology Co., an
affiliate that also plans to invest in Sharp, jumped by the
daily 7 percent limit to NT$107, while the benchmark Taiex index
rose as much as 1.7 percent.  Foxconn Technology Group companies wrote off NT$6.4 billion
last quarter because of a decline in Sharp’s share price as
investors bet against the Japanese electronics maker’s chances
of a turnaround. Foxconn still plans to proceed with an
investment of at least 9.9 percent in Sharp, while the deal
won’t be for the original price of 550 yen per share, Hon Hai
spokesman Simon Hsing told Bloomberg News Aug. 3.  Hon Hai, the world’s largest contract manufacturer of
electronics, lost 3.8 percent and Foxconn Technology Co. fell by
its daily limit as Sharp’s stock dropped 28 percent on Aug. 3 in
 Tokyo  after widening its full-year loss forecast eight-fold.
Sharp closed at 192 yen that day, 65 percent below the price it
agreed to sell shares. The renegotiation was announced after
both markets closed.  “If Hon Hai Precision manages to renegotiate the purchase
price to the latest Sharp trading price, we will see our Q2 EPS
estimates improve 35 percent, and 2012 EPS improve 5 percent
from our base case,” Alberto Moel, who  rates  the stock
outperform at Sanford C. Bernstein in  Hong Kong , wrote on Aug.
3. Hon Hai’s loss on the deal this quarter could have been
around NT$7.2 billion, he wrote.  Foxconn still plans to proceed with the investment “at the
most appropriate time and most appropriate price” with the deal
to close by the end of March, chairman Terry Gou said yesterday.  Hon Hai traded at NT$86.60 as of 10:34 a.m. in Taipei
trading while  Foxconn Technology Co. (2354)  traded at NT$106.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
