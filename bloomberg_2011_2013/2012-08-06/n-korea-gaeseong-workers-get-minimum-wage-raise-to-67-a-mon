North and  South Korea  agreed to raise
the minimum wage for North Korean workers at the jointly-run
Gaeseong Industrial Park by 5 percent to $67 a month, South
Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung Suk said.  The annual decision by officials from both countries was
made Aug. 3, Kim told reporters today in  Seoul . Five percent is
the maximum amount the wage can be raised at the complex 6 miles
(10 kilometers) north of the border, where more than 120 South
Korean companies employ about 50,000 North Korean workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
