Greece and  Israel  can work together
in many areas, including the energy sector, to the benefit of
both economies, President Karolos Papoulias said at the start of
a dinner with his Israeli counterpart  Shimon Peres  in Athens
today.  “There are significant prospects for cooperation in
investment -- especially within the framework of the state-asset
sales program,” Papoulias said, according to an e-mailed
transcript of his speech. Energy, agricultural development and
technology are some of the sectors the two countries can work
together in, Papoulias said.  Eastern Mediterranean countries can work together as
natural gas from Cyprus and Israel can be transported to Europe
through Greece, Papoulias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
