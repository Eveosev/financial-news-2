German 10-year bonds rose, with
yields falling from the highest in a month, before an industry
report that economists said will show European investor
confidence declined to the lowest level in three years.  Bunds snapped last week’s decline as European stocks
dropped, boosting demand for the region’s safest assets. German
 government securities  slid last week amid bets the  European
Central Bank  will buy the bonds of nations such as Italy and
Spain to help contain the debt crisis. The Netherlands and
 France  will auction bills today.  The German 10-year bund yield fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.40 percent at 8:07 a.m. London time
after rising to 1.44 percent, the highest since July 5. The 1.75
percent bund due in July 2022 gained 0.21, or 2.10 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,236) face amount, to 103.20.  Germany’s Sentix research institute will say its index of
sentiment in the euro-area economy declined to minus 31 in
August, the lowest since July 2009, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  German debt returned 3.3 percent this year through Aug. 3,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
fell 4.3 percent, and Italy’s debt rose 8.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
