Alameda County District Attorney
Nancy O’Malley in Oakland,  California , said her office is
seeking a court order to stop  Walgreen Co. (WAG)  from dumping
hazardous wastes into the environment.  The motion for an order was filed as part of a lawsuit
state prosecutors brought in June, alleging that more than 600
of Walgreen’s California stores improperly disposed of hazardous
wastes and materials including pesticides, bleach, paint,
aerosols, solvents and other toxic, flammable substances,
O’Malley said in an e-mail.  The filing couldn’t be immediately confirmed in electronic
court records.  An investigation found that Walgreen’s employees put
returned or damaged items containing the hazardous substances
into dumpsters rather than sending them to authorized disposal
sites, Ken Mifsud, a senior deputy district attorney in
O’Malley’s office, said in a telephone interview.  The media office of Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
prosecutors’ move for the order.  The case is California v. Walgreens, RG12535137, Alameda
County Superior Court, Oakland, California  To contact the reporter on this story:
