The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 0.5 percent to 644.23 at 6:19 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.5 percent to 1,548.836.  CRUDE OIL  Oil slid from the highest close in two weeks in  New York 
amid speculation that its biggest gain in more than a month was
excessive. Tropical Storm Ernesto slowed as it headed westward
in the Caribbean.  Oil for September delivery slid as much as 77 cents to
$90.63 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $90.68 at 9:18 a.m. in  London . It surged
$4.27 to $91.40 on Aug. 3, the highest settlement since July 20.
Prices are 8.2 percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures fell in New York for a fifth day, the
longest losing streak since March, as forecasts called for a
break in recent heat and signaled reduced demand from  power
plants .  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $20.88, or 38 percent, to $75.63 a metric ton at
5:04 p.m. Singapore time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread , a measure of processing profit,
widened for a second week last week.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rebounded 30
cents to $18.15 a barrel at 2:05 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference,
also known as the crack spread, retraced the previous day’s
losses.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold gained for a second day in London on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will do more to support growth.  Immediate-delivery bullion rose 0.1 percent to $1,605.70 an
ounce by 9:32 a.m. in London. Prices dropped 1.2 percent last
week, the most since June 22. December-delivery futures were
little changed at $1,608.40 on the Comex in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper may fall in London, extending last week’s drop, as a
warning by Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  that policy
disagreements are undermining the European Union added to
concerns about the region’s economic growth.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans declined to the lowest level in more than a week
as rains forecast in parts of the Midwest may help revive
parched crops in the largest U.S. growing region. Corn and wheat
also fell.  Soybeans for November delivery lost as much as 3.3 percent
to $15.7575 a bushel, the lowest price on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade since July 27. They traded at $15.92 at 2:24 p.m.
Singapore time.  Corn  for December delivery slipped as much as 2.3 percent
to $7.8925 a bushel in Chicago before trading at $7.985. Wheat
for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to $8.98 a bushel.  Palm oil  fell on speculation reserves in  Malaysia , the
second-largest producer, probably climbed the most in 10 months
in July as output rose and exports dropped, easing supply
concerns as a drought reduces U.S. soybean yields.  The October-delivery contract  declined as much as 0.3
percent to 2,909 ringgit ($936) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was at 2,912 ringgit at 5:11 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures declined for a fourth week last week.  Rubber rebounded from the lowest level since November 2009
after U.S. payrolls climbed more than forecast and creditors
said  Greece  is making progress on bailout terms, fueling
optimism demand for commodities may increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
