Mortgage closing costs in the U.S.
declined in the past year as lenders competed to attract
qualified borrowers,  Bankrate Inc. (RATE)  said.  Origination and title costs on a $200,000 home loan average
$3,754 nationwide, down 7.4 percent from 2011, according to
Bankrate’s annual  survey  of lenders, conducted in June. New York
State has the highest closing costs for the third straight year,
with an average of $5,435, a 12 percent drop from last year, the
 North Palm Beach , Florida-based financial data provider said
today.  Stricter lending standards are shrinking the pool of
Americans who can obtain a mortgage and forcing banks to vie for
customers with good credit, said  Greg McBride , senior financial
analyst at Bankrate. Borrowers should seek three estimates to
take advantage of competing prices, he said.  “Zero in on the fees that the lenders themselves are
charging,” McBride said. “Base your comparison on that.”  Origination fees, charged directly by the lender, fell 1
percent, while title and closing costs dropped almost 12
percent, Bankrate said.  Texas is the second-priciest state in the U.S. in which to
close a  mortgage . Costs there average $4,619, a 6.6 percent
decline from last year. Pennsylvania was third, at $4,467.  Lowest Costs  The cheapest places for closing costs are Missouri, Kansas
and  Colorado , according to Bankrate. Missouri fees total $3,006,
with Kansas at $3,193 and Colorado at $3,199.  Closing costs include fees charged by lenders, as well as
third-party charges for services such as appraisals and title
insurance. The survey excludes taxes, property insurance,
association fees, interest and other prepaid items.  Bankrate surveyed as many as 10 lenders in each state and
the  District of Columbia  in June and obtained estimates for a
borrower with excellent credit to take out a $200,000 mortgage
on a single-family home with a 20 percent down payment. The
good-faith estimates weren’t necessarily what borrowers actually
paid when their loans closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
