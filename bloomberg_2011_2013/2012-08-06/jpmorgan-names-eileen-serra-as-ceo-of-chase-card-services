JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  named Eileen
Serra chief executive officer of Chase Card Services, replacing
 Gordon Smith , who will co-run consumer and community banking.  Serra, 57, who currently manages Chase’s mass-affluent and
high-net-worth customer businesses, will run all of card
services for New York-based JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Eileen has excelled at every role she’s performed at the
firm,” Smith said in the statement. Serra joined JPMorgan in
2006 from Merrill Lynch & Co., where she was managing director
and head of private-client banking solutions. She worked at
American Express Co. and McKinsey & Co. before that.  Smith was elevated to his new role on July 27 amid a
shakeup of senior managers following a trading loss of at least
$5.8 billion in one of the company’s London units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
