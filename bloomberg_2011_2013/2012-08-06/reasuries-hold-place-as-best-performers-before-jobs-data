Treasury traders increased bets on
inflation to the most in eight weeks after a bigger-than-
forecast jobs gain spurred optimism the economy will pick up.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, widened to as much as 2.21 percentage points. It was the
most since June 11. The average over the past decade is 2.15
percentage points.  “The  U.S. economy  continues to recover,” said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a
unit of  Japan ’s third-largest publicly traded bank by assets.
“The labor statistics are pushing up inflation expectations.
The rally is over” for Treasuries, he said.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  were little changed at 1.56
percent as of 7:07 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The price of the 1.75 percent security due in May
2022 was 101 22/32.  Yields have climbed from the record of 1.38 percent set
July 25. They will rise to 2 percent by year-end, Shimazu said.  Japan’s 10-year rate increased 0.5 basis point to 0.735
percent today. It reached 0.72 percent, the lowest since 2003,
last month. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Inflation Expectations  U.S. five-year inflation swaps, which allow holders to
exchange fixed  interest rates  for returns equivalent to the U.S.
consumer price index, show investors expect prices to rise at
average annual rate of 2.16 percent through August 2017. It was
the highest level based on closing prices in 10 weeks. The
average based on data compiled by Bloomberg that go back to 2004
is 2.32 percent.  The five-year, five-year forward  break-even rate , a measure
of inflation expectations the  Federal Reserve  uses to help guide
monetary policy, climbed to 2.60 percent as of Aug. 1. It was
the most in almost two months and compares to the decade-long
average of 2.75 percent.  Treasuries fell last week as the U.S. employment report on
Aug. 3 reduced speculation the Fed will increase its bond
purchases to spur expansion.  Payrolls increased by 163,000 in July following a revised
64,000 gain in June that was less than initially reported, Labor
Department figures showed. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a July gain of 100,000. The
jobless rate rose to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent.  The U.S. central bank plans to buy as much as $5.5 billion
of Treasuries due from August 2020 to May 2022 today, according
to the Fed Bank of  New York ’s  website . The purchases are part of
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to contain borrowing costs by
swapping short-term Treasuries in its holdings for longer
maturities.  Global Returns  Treasuries have returned 6.8 percent in the 12 months to
Aug. 3, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes,
reflecting demand for  U.S. debt  as a haven amid signs of slowing
economic growth and as European governments struggled to find
ways to pay their debts. An index of bonds around the world
returned 6.5 percent, the bank’s figures show.  U.S. bonds rallied even after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered the
nation’s long-term credit rating one step to AA+ from AAA on
Aug. 5, 2011, benefiting from the flight to quality.  “Yields will stay fairly low for a little bit longer,”
said Roger Bridges, who oversees $15.9 billion as the Sydney-
based head of fixed income at Tyndall Investment Management
Ltd., which is part of Nikko Asset Management Co. in Japan. “I
don’t think we’re quite out of the woods yet.”  Treasury Holdings  Of the 20 companies that own the most Treasuries, 16 bought
more  U.S. government debt  during their most-recent reporting
periods, Bloomberg data show.  Jay Mueller , who manages $3 billion of bonds for  Wells
Capital  Management in  Milwaukee , said he resisted buying
Treasuries for four months, anticipating the Federal Reserve
would drop its pledge to keep interest rates at a record low
through late 2014.  Yet with the economy growing at a 1.5 percent annual pace,
the odds of a recession have risen to 60 percent, making 1
percent yields on 10-year notes a possibility, he said. Wells
Capital’s parent,  Wells Fargo & Co ., boosted its Treasury
holdings 32 percent to $11.5 billion in May alone, according to
the latest data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re in a low-rate environment for a long time, longer
than I had thought,” Mueller said in a July 26 interview at
Bloomberg headquarters in New York. “I’m finally throwing in
the towel.”  So are Pioneer Investment Management Inc., Pacific
Investment Management Co.,  Federated Investors Inc. (FII) , Northern
Trust Global Investments and Columbia Management Investment
Advisers LLC.  Ten-year yields will increase to 1.82 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of financial companies, with the
most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings. The
projection has tumbled from 2.66 percent at the start of the
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
