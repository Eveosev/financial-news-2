Russia ’s government officials set
Aug. 8 to meet and discuss grain supplies.  Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  and Agriculture
Minister Nikolai Fedorov are expected to participate, according
to the government’s press service and Dmitry Bobkov, Agriculture
Ministry spokesman. The grain crop estimate may be lowered to 70
million metric tons because of drought, Interfax reported last
week, citing Alexander Chernogorov, deputy agriculture minister.
Last year, the crop was 94 million tons of grains, according to
state statistics data.  Russia banned exports of grains in 2010-11 after the worst
drought in at least half a century reduced production to 60.9
million tons. In 2011-12, Russia exported a record 27.2
million tons of grains, according to Agriculture Ministry data.
Exports may drop as low as 10 million tons this season in 2012-
13, Dvorkovich said on Aug. 2.  Wheat for December delivery was little changed at $9.04 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
