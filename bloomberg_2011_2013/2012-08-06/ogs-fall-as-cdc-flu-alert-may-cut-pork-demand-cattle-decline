Hog futures fell on speculation that
U.S. pork demand will decrease after the government issued an
alert about an influenza virus related to swine. Cattle also
dropped.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
reported 12 U.S. cases of the H3N2v influenza virus, 11 of which
occurred in people who had attended county fairs where swine
were present. There is no evidence the virus can be transmitted
through properly handled pork, the CDC said. Hog futures tumbled
to the lowest in more than six years in 2009 after an outbreak
of the H1N1 virus, initially dubbed “swine flu.”  “We have some concern that the CDC put out an advisory on
swine flu at county fairs,” said  Rich Nelson , the director of
research for Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois . “So, there’s
also a little concern for U.S. pork demand.”  Hog futures for October settlement dropped 0.9 percent to
75.175 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after earlier falling to 75.1 cents, the lowest since
Dec. 17, 2010.  Cattle futures for October delivery slipped less than 0.1
percent to $1.2435 a pound in Chicago. The price has gained 2.4
percent in 2012. Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement
slid 0.1 percent to $1.4005 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
