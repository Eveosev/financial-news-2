University of Kentucky  royalties from
licensed merchandise sales rose 40 percent in the past year,
helped largely by the school’s eighth college basketball
national championship.  Merchandise royalties at the Lexington-based school, which
won the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
title in April, grew to $6.73 million in the 12 months ended
June 30 from $4.80 million the previous year, according to Jason
Schlafer, the senior associate athletic director for corporate
and university relations.  The Wildcats moved to No. 3 from No. 7 in an annual list of
top collegiate merchandise royalty earners released by the
 College Licensing Co. , a division of IMG Worldwide.  Kentucky ’s
successful season and basketball history helped it move into the
top three, said Cory Moss, a vice president and managing
director for Atlanta-based CLC. The  University of Texas  remained
No. 1 among schools the company tracks.  “The basketball championship is obviously the key
driver,” Moss said yesterday in a telephone interview. “The
size of Kentucky’s alumni, student population and fan base, and
their long tradition of basketball success certainly helped as
well.”  The rankings cover royalties reported from July 1, 2011, to
June 30, 2012, by clients of CLC, which includes about 200
schools, conferences and bowl games. The company doesn’t
represent every major-conference school, with  Ohio State
University  and the University of  Southern California  among those
not on its list.  Texas  topped the list for the seventh consecutive year,
followed by the  University of Alabama , which this year won the
Bowl Championship Series football title.  Texas Football  Texas became CLC’s top-selling school in 2005-06 after
quarterback  Vince Young  led the Longhorns to the national
football championship.  “It was a combination of that all hitting at the same
time,” Moss said. “And it’s not just football when it comes to
Texas, they are successful in other sports, especially
basketball, baseball and track.”  The Wildcats were the top-ranked college basketball team
for the final eight weeks of the 2011-12 season and won their
first title since 1998.  Schlafer said the school benefited by preparing for the
championship with key partners. When the Wildcats beat Kansas to
win the title in April, Kentucky had already worked with  Nike
Inc. (NKE)  to ensure that as soon as the game ended there was
merchandise available commemorating the victory.  Royalty income at Kentucky is split between the athletic
department and the university president’s office, Schlafer said.  “We have one of the premium national brands already,”
Schlafer said. “When we win, there’s just this thirst to buy
our product.”  Industrywide Sales  Industry sales grew to $4.6 billion from $4.3 billion last
year, a typical increase, according to Moss, whose company
recently signed a deal with online flower shop FTD.com, Inc. to
sell dyed roses in the colors of major NCAA universities.  Nike, which this year began a five-year licensing agreement
with the  National Football League , was the top college apparel
licensee, followed by Knights Apparel Inc. and  Gear For Sports .
Nike has held the top spot in 11 of the past 13 years.  Video game maker EA Sports, a unit of  Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) ,
topped the list of non-apparel licensees for the eighth
consecutive year.  Leading the local licensee category was Lexington-based
Kentucky Wholesale Inc., a manufacturer of officially licensed
products for the Wildcats and the  University of Louisville .  *T CLC’s TOP 20 LICENSED MERCHANDISE-SELLING UNIVERSITIES
