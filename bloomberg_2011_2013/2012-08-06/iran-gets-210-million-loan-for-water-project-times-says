The  Islamic Development Bank  approved
a 170 million-euro ($210 million) loan for wastewater plant
upgrades in  Iran ’s capital, the  Tehran Times  reported, citing
 Tehran Water and Wastewater Co. ’s managing director.  The loan will be used to establish a sewage treatment plant
in western Tehran, the executive, Mohammad Parvaresh, said
without elaborating, according to today’s report. The greater
Tehran area has a population of about 12 million.  Iran received a $50 million World Bank loan in October to
help develop wastewater projects in northern Iranian cities, the
paper cited Mehdi Samareh-Hashemi, managing director of the Iran
Water and Wastewater Engineering Co., as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
