U.S. Gulf Coast crudes weakened as
the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent oil shrank
for the second consecutive session.  The difference between the benchmarks narrowed 12 cents to
$17.42 a barrel at 2:15 p.m. in  New York  based on September
prices. When Brent rises at a slower pace than WTI, as it did
today, that typically weakens the value of U.S. grades competing
with foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
narrowed 10 cents to $17.25 a barrel at 12:07 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s
decreased 15 cents to $17.75.  Poseidon’s premium lost 60 cents to $12.20, while Southern
Green Canyon’s decreased 25 cents to $11 a barrel over WTI. Mars
Blend’s premium weakened 85 cents to $12.50.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
lost 75 cents to $16.  Syncrude was unchanged at parity with WTI. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in  Alberta  into
refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount was steady at $18.75 below
WTI. Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $4.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
