Gulf Coast gasoline weakened as
Valero Energy Corp. started units at its Meraux refinery
southeast of  New Orleans .  The crude unit at the 135,000-barrel-a-day plant, shut
after a fire July 22, is expected to be back by the end of the
month,  Bill Day , a Valero spokesman based in San Antonio, said
in an e-mail.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 3.75 cents to 7.25 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:01
p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Prompt delivery fell
4.06 cents to $2.8476 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor strengthened 2.5 cents to
a premium of 3.88 cents a gallon, the highest level since Dec.
