Bahrain Air, the Persian Gulf
country’s first privately owned airline, is “seriously”
considering a merger with local competitor Gulf Air, al-Watan
reported, citing Managing Director Ibrahim Al-Hamer.  Gulf Air Chief Executive Officer Samer Majali said at a
press conference last week that a merger between the two
airlines is possible as the country can’t afford the existence
of both carriers, the daily newspaper  said .  Bahrain Air will need to buy aircraft to meet contract
terms of operating a 12-plane fleet should it win a license to
operate in  Saudi Arabia , al-Watan cited Alhamer as saying.  Bahrain Air and Gulf Air, which are both based in Manama,
were among seven airlines shortlisted last month to bid for a
license to offer domestic routes in the neighboring kingdom.
Calls to Bahrain Air and Gulf Air’s press offices weren’t
answered after the close of business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
