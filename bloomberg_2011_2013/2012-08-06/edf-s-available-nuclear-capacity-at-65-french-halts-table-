Electricite de France SA halted its
Paluel-2, Fessenheim-2 and Cruas-3 nuclear reactors on Aug. 4
for maintenance, grid operator Reseau de Transport d’Electricite
said on its website.  EDF’s 1,330-megawatt Penly-2 unit was scheduled to start
yesterday but tripped and is not generating, RTE data show.  EDF, the world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator, has
38 reactors online, representing 65 percent of available nuclear
capacity, the lowest since June 25, RTE data show. EDF’s 58
atomic plants generate about 78 percent of the country’s power.  The following table lists EDF’s nuclear units that are out
of  service , their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
stopped and the expected return date, if known, according to
RTE. Two asterisks highlight an unplanned halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
