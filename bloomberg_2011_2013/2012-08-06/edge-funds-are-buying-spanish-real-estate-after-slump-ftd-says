Hedge funds  and private-equity firms
are buying Spanish real estate after prices slumped, Financial
Times Deutschland reported, citing Adolfo Ramirez-Escudero, the
head of investment at CBRE Group Inc.â€™s Spanish business.  Ramirez-Escudero advised on four property deals valued at
more than 100 million euros ($124 million) that were completed
in recent months, the newspaper said. His clients are in talks
about another 1.8 billion euros of transactions, more than twice
as much as a year ago, FTD said.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argenta (BBVA)  SA, a Bilbao-based bank, sold
2,500 properties in the first half, 40 percent more than a year
ago, according to FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
