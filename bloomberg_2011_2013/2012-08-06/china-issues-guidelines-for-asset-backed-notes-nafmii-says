China  issued guidelines for sales of
asset-backed notes in its  interbank market , the National
Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors said.  Companies can choose to sell the notes publicly or via
private placements direct to investors, NAFMII said in a
 statement  on its website today. The funds raised should be used
in accordance with the law and the demands of the country’s
policies, according to the statement.  Banks were permitted to begin selling asset-backed
securities again after the regulator suspended an issuance
program in 2008 in the wake of the financial crisis, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a report on June 11.  China Development Bank Corp. and  China Construction Bank
Corp. (939)  sold 7.2 billion yuan ($1.13 billion) of asset-backed
bonds in December 2005 in the first such deal for financial
institutions in the country.  Financial institutions sold 17.8 billion yuan of asset-
backed bonds in 2007, according to data from Chinabond, a
website run by the nation’s biggest debt clearing house.  For publicly issued asset-backed securities, at least two
ratings companies must be hired to produce credit ratings on the
borrower, NAFMII said in its statement today. NAFMII was set up
by the central bank to regulate interbank bonds, the largest
part of the fixed-income market in China.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
