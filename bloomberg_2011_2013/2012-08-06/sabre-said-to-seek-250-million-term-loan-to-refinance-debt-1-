Sabre Inc., the online travel-booking
company owned by TPG Capital and  Silver Lake  Partners LP, is
seeking a $250 million covenant-lite  term loan  to refinance
debt, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The debt, due in December 2017, will pay interest at 6
percentage points to 6.25 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the terms are private. Libor, a rate banks
say they can borrow in dollars from each other, will have a 1.25
percent floor.  Sabre is proposing to sell the loan at 99 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the debt during the first year,
said the person.  Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc, Natixis and Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. are arranging the financing and asking
lenders to respond by Aug. 9, according to the person.  Silver Lake and TPG purchased the Southlake, Texas-based
company in April 2007 for about $5 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Pam Wong, a spokeswoman for Sabre, and  Owen Blicksilver , a
spokesman for TPG, declined to comment.  Covenant-lite debt doesnâ€™t carry typical lender protection
such as financial-maintenance requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
