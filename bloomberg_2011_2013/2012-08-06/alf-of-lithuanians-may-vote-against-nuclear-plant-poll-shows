Almost half of Lithuanians will
probably vote against the construction of a new nuclear power
plant in a non-binding referendum in October, according to a
survey by Prime Consulting for magazine  Veidas .  Forty eight percent of Lithuanians may vote against the
nuclear plant in Visaginas, while 19 percent support the
construction, Veidas said.  The poll, conducted in the country’s largest cities among
500 people on July 16-17, didn’t provide a margin of error.
Lithuania will hold the referendum on Oct. 14 along with general
election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
