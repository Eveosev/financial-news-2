The euro may be poised to reverse its
yearlong drop against the British pound, according to  Bank of
America  Corp., citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation shared currency may rise to 80.18 pence and
beyond after breaking a key resistance level at 0.7916-to-0.7919
pence,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and interest-
rates technical strategy in  New York  at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, wrote in a note to clients today. A move above 81.41
pence would confirm a “base and turn,” he wrote.  “Evidence continues to build for a turn in trend of the
yearlong decline,” Curry wrote. “Momentum has reached bearish
extremes not seen since August 1997.” Curry didn’t immediately
respond to a call for further comment.  The euro rose 0.3 percent to 79.46 pence at 12:58 p.m. New
York time after touching 79.63, the strongest level since July
6. It has fallen from a 16-month high of 0.90835 pence reached
on July 1, 2011.  The euro is the biggest decliner this year among 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes, falling 5.1 percent, while the pound has risen
0.1 percent.  Resistance is a level on a chart where sell orders may be
clustered. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study
