Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR) , the
second-biggest luxury goods company, said it expects fiscal
first-half profit to rise 20 percent to 40 percent as currency
shifts boost revenue.  Operating profit in the six months through September will
probably also increase within that range, the Geneva-based
company said today in a statement. The  median  of two analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg is for an 18 percent gain in
operating profit.  Sales rose 24 percent in the first four months of
Richemont’s fiscal year, the company said. Excluding currency
effects, revenue rose 13 percent. Richemont, which reports in
euros, said it made the announcement because the Swiss stock
exchange requires companies to say when they expect a
significant deviation in profit from the year-ago period.  “At the start of the year Richemont was being cautious on
its operating margin assumptions,” said Jon Cox, head of Swiss
research at Kepler Capital Markets in Zurich. “I suspect
consensus operating profit estimates for the year could come up
by 10 percent.”  Richemont gets about half of its revenue from the Asia-
Pacific region and  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
