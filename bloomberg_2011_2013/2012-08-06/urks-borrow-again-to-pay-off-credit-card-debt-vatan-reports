One in four credit-card users in
 Turkey  fails to pay off card debt quickly and a 30 percent
increase in consumer loans shows people borrow again later to
pay it, Vatan newspaper said.  The newspaper cited a report by Istanbulâ€™s Chamber of
Accountants and Financial Advisers which says consumer loans
jumped 154 percent over the past five years, to 172 billion
liras ($97 billion). Click here for web link  To contact the reporters on this story:
