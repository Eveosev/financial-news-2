Silver Lake  Resources Ltd., an
Australian gold producer, offered to buy  Integra Mining Ltd. (IGR)  for
A$426 million ($450 million) in shares to expand output.  Silver Lake is offering 1 new share for every 6.28 of its
target, or 45.2 cents a share, Perth-based Silver Lake said
today in a statement. That’s a 44 percent premium to Integra’s
last closing price on Aug. 3.  Acquiring Integra may double Silver Lake’s annual output to
as much as 250,000 ounces this fiscal year from operations in
close proximity to each other in Western  Australia  state. Gold
prices, up 2.5 percent in 2012, are gaining for a 12th
consecutive year.  “The strategic and financial logic of the combination is
clear, driven by the complementary nature of the two companies’
projects and the strong organic growth profile of the combined
business,” Les Davis, Silver Lake’s managing director, said in
the statement.  Silver Lake slumped 8.5 percent to A$2.60, the most since
May 15 at the close of trading in Sydney. Integra rose 27
percent.  Integra’s directors recommended the deal in absence of a
higher offer. Integra shareholders will have a 40 percent stake
in the enlarged Silver Lake.  There have been $5.9 billion of gold mining deals this year
with an average premium of 22 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 2011 total of $39
billion at an average premium of 24 percent, the data shows.  RBC Capital Markets  is financial adviser to Silver Lake and
Macquarie Capital (Australia) Ltd. is advising Integra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
