Daniel Pinto, co-head of  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s (JPM)  newly expanded corporate and investment bank
division, holds $19.6 million of restricted and unrestricted
stock.  Pinto, 49, has $8.7 million of the New York-based bank’s
shares directly and through a trust, as well as $10.9 million in
restricted-stock units that vest in installments through 2015,
according to a filing today to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Pinto was elevated to run the division with Mike Cavanagh
as part of a senior-management shakeup last month, following at
least $5.8 billion in losses on a London unit’s trades. The pair
replaced Jes Staley, who gave up day-to-day operational duties
as head of the investment bank to become chairman of the
expanded unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
