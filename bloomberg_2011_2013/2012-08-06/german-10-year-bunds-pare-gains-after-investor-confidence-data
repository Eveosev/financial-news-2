German 10-year bunds pared an advance
as a report showed investor confidence in the euro area fell
less than economists forecast in August.  The  bund yield  was three basis points lower at 1.40 percent
at 9:31 a.m. London time, after dropping as much as five basis
points to 1.38 percent.  Germany ’s Sentix research institute said its index
measuring sentiment in the region’s economy fell to minus 30.3
from minus 29.6 in July. Economists forecast a decline to minus
31, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
