MPVI Zrt.,  Hungary ’s state-owned
mobile service provider, is looking to build its market share to
as much as 25 percent within five to six years, news website
 Index  said, citing a feasibility study it obtained from the
company.  The new company, which hasn’t started operations yet, is
planning to come to the market with lower prices than its
competitors and “very aggressive discounts,” according to the
Budapest-based news website.  The new service provider, owned jointly by electricity
wholesaler Magyar Villamos Muvek Zrt., postal service Magyar
Posta Zrt. and state-owned investment bank MFB Zrt., won the
country’s fourth mobile frequency earlier this year, Index said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
