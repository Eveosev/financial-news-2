China’s stocks  rose, driving the
biggest gains for the benchmark index in five weeks, after
regulators broadened measures to boost investor confidence and a
report showed American payrolls climbed more than forecast.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362) , the biggest Chinese producer of the
metal, climbed 5.1 percent on the prospect of higher commodities
demand.  Xiamen Tungsten Co. (600549)  jumped by the 10 percent daily limit
after the Shanghai Securities News said it will play a leading
role in the consolidation of the rare-earth industry in  Fujian
province . Shanghai Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park Development Co.
surged the most in a year after the government approved the
expansion of an over-the-counter stock market.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1 percent to 2,154.92 at
the close, its biggest gain since June 29. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
climbed 1.4 percent to 2,385.61. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, added 2 percent on Aug. 3.  “More listed companies and their employees are likely to
buy their own shares as stocks are pretty attractive in terms of
valuations and have long-term investment values,” said Wu Kan,
a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “Though the securities regulator is
hammering out a spate of measures to support equities, the
market focus is still on when economic growth will bottom and
pick up.”  The Shanghai index has dropped 2 percent this year on
concern about a deepening slowdown after the economy grew 7.6
percent in the second quarter, the slowest pace since 2009. The
People’s Bank of China cut  interest rates  twice since early June
and lowered lenders’ reserve requirement ratios three times
starting in November as part of the government’s efforts to spur
credit growth and support the economic expansion.  CSRC Measures  China plans to let workers choose for as much as 30 percent
of their wages to be paid in the shares of their publicly traded
employers. The stock used to pay employees must be acquired from
the secondary market, according to draft rules posted on the
 China  Securities Regulatory Commission’s website yesterday.
Employees who receive shares as salaries or bonuses would have
to hold them for at least 36 months.  The securities regulator, in the week following a July 31
pledge by the Communist Party’s Politburo to continue adjusting
policies to ensure growth, has cut trading fees for stocks and
expanded a trial for over-the-counter exchanges.  The measures signal intensifying government efforts to
bolster equities after the Shanghai Composite tumbled 13 percent
through Aug. 3 from this year’s high on March 2 amid concern the
economic slowdown is deepening. The index is valued at 9.7 times
 estimated profit , compared with the 17.5 average since Bloomberg
began compiling the data in 2006.  Commodity Stocks  A measure of material stocks in the CSI 300 advanced 3.1
percent today, the most among the 10 industry groups.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal,
added 5.1 percent to 21.50 yuan. The company said it plans to
offer its shareholders cash dividends of no less than 10 percent
of the annual attributable profit from 2012 to 2014.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the listed unit of nation’s
biggest maker of the lightweight metal, gained 1.9 percent to
6.05 yuan. Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co., China’s biggest producer
of refined zinc, surged 10 percent to 8.15 yuan.  UBS AG says the Shanghai Composite, this year’s worst
performer in the largest  emerging markets , will jump as much as
20 percent by year-end, while Haitong Securities Co. expects the
measure to keep tumbling as economic growth slows.  UBS, Haitong Views  At least one more interest-rate cut by Chinese policy
makers in the third quarter will help the Shanghai Composite
rebound, Chen Li, UBS’s head of China equity strategy, said in
an Aug. 3 interview.  Chen Ruiming, an equity strategist at Haitong Securities,
China’s second-biggest brokerage by market value, said he
expects the Shanghai Composite to fall below 2,000 this year, as
exports slump and government measures to curb property prices
hurt the industry. That’s equal to a drop of more than 6 percent
from the Aug. 3 close.  China’s statistics bureau is due to release July economic
data including industrial production and inflation on Aug. 9.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  jumped 1.4 percent after U.S. payrolls
increased 163,000 last month following a revised 64,000 rise in
June. Economists projected a gain of 100,000. Unemployment rose
to 8.3 percent.  Rare Earth  The U.S. is China’s second-largest export market, making up
about 17 percent of the nation’s overseas shipments, according
to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Xiamen Tungsten surged by 10 percent to 41.87 yuan. The
company was asked by Fujian province to play a leading role in
rare earth industry consolidation, the Shanghai Securities News
reported today, citing a local government plan. The government
will give financial support to Xiamen Tungsten, it said.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel  Rare-Earth  Hi-Tech Co., China’s
biggest producer of rare earth, rose 9.4 percent to 41.46.
Rising Nonferrous Metals Share Co. advanced 7.1 percent to 62.86
yuan.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 14.3
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.7. About 5.3
billion shares changed hands in the gauge on Aug. 3, 35 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  Shanghai Zhangjiang Hi-Tech climbed 9.7 percent to 8.13
yuan, the biggest gain since July 18, 2011.  Tianjin Hi-Tech
Development Co. (600082)  jumped by 10 percent to 4.48 yuan. Wuhan East
Lake High Technology Group Co. surged 10 percent to 7.26 yuan.  The State Council has approved the expansion of OTC market
trials to the cities of Shanghai, Wuhan and Tianjin from just
Beijing, the China Securities Journal reported Aug. 3, citing
the CSRC. Beijing’s OTC market trial began in 2006, according to
the city government.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
