What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents higher on
speculation that the Russian crop is deteriorating because of
dry weather, Louise Gartner, the owner of Spectrum Commodities
in Beavercreek,  Ohio , said by telephone.  -- Soybean futures are called to open steady after a government
report showed U.S. crop conditions were unchanged from a week
earlier, snapping eight weeks of declines, Gartner said.
Soybean-oil futures may open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound
higher, and soybean-meal futures may open steady to $1 higher
per 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures may open steady as the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said 23 percent of the crop was rated good to
excellent as of yesterday, meeting analysts expectations,
Gartner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
