Japanese  stocks  gained, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rising the most in more than three
months, after better-than-forecast jobs data in the U.S. eased
concern growth is slowing in the world’s largest economy.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  gained after beating profit estimates.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets almost 30 percent of
its sales from the U.S., climbed 3.5 percent. Toyota rose 2.5
percent. Sharp Corp. extended its drop to a 37-year low on a
report Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. plans to renegotiate its
investment in the electronics company.  The Nikkei 225 gained 2 percent to 8,726.29 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , the biggest gain since April 18. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index rose 1.6 percent to 735.73, with more than three
shares advancing for each that declined.  The jobs data “was quite good and is fueling investor
confidence,” said Yoshihisa Okamoto, a  fund manager  at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees about $34 billion.
“Investors in the Japanese market care more about the  U.S.
economy  than European issues.”  The Topix has rebounded 5.8 percent since this year’s low
in June as central banks around the world eased policy to
support growth. The price of shares on the gauge stood at 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The gauge
surged 1.9 percent on Aug. 3 after a Labor Department report
showed U.S. payrolls climbed more than forecast even as the
jobless rate unexpectedly rose. Shares also advanced after
 service industries  expanded at a faster pace in July.  Canon, Honda  Canon climbed 3.5 percent to 2,788 yen. Honda Motor Co., a
carmaker that gets more than 40 percent of its sales from  North
America , increased 2.8 percent to 2,470 yen.  Toyota rose 2.5 percent to 3,140 yen, the heaviest
contributor to the Topix’s gain, after reporting its highest
quarterly net income in four years. Profit climbed to 290.3
billion yen ($3.7 billion), 14 percent higher than the average
of seven analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Energy companies gained after crude oil for September
delivery jumped 4.9 percent to $91.40 a barrel in New York on
Aug. 3, the biggest gain since June 29.  Inpex Corp., Japan’s top oil explorer by market value,
jumped 4.1 percent to 445,500 yen after boosting its earnings
forecast. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., the No. 2, rose 2.3
percent to 2,912 yen.  Asahi Glass Co. gained the most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , soaring
7.3 percent to 472 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc. raised its
investment rating to buy from neutral, saying European markets
for sheet and liquefied crystal display glass have bottomed.  Sharp lost 5.7 percent to 181 yen, the lowest close since
November 1974. The stock fell after Hon Hai said it plans to
renegotiate its 550 yen per share investment in the electronics
maker. The Japanese TV maker plunged 28 percent on Aug. 3 after
widening its loss forecast.  -- With assistance from Adam Haigh in Sydney. Editor:  Jim Powell   To contact the reporter on this story:
