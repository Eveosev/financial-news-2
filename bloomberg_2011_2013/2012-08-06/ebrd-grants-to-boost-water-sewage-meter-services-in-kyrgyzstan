The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development said 6.3 million euros ($7.8 million) in loans,
grants and special funding is being allocated to help modernize
water and wastewater treatment capacities in a  Kyrgyzstan  city.  The development bankâ€™s support is designed to improve water
supplies to Kara-Balta, one of the largest industrial and
transport hubs in northern Kyrgyzstan, as well as rehabilitate
and upgrade water and sewage networks, the London-based EBRD
said.  Kara-Balta Water Co. will conduct much of the improvements
to bring the city closer to compliance with European Union
standards, the EBRD said in a statement. Project financing
includes $3 million from the EBRD Shareholder Special Fund and a
$2 million loan to the water company. It also includes plans to
install meters to help provide a management tool for leakage
detection and to replace depleted water pumps, the EBRD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
