Czech Industrial output declined for
a second month in June, bolstering the case for an interest-rate
cut as the economy struggles to exit a recession.  Industrial production  fell 2.2 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 2.4 percent drop in May, the Prague-based Czech
Statistics Office said in a statement on its website today. The
reading was worse than the median forecast of a 2 percent
decline in the Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts.  After cutting the benchmark two-week repurchase rate to a
record low in June, the central bank’s board was split last week
on whether to lower borrowing costs further as the economic
outlook worsens. Two policy makers sought a cut to 0.25 percent,
while the other four present at the meeting took a “wait-and-
see approach,” Vice-Governor  Vladimir Tomsik  said.  The Czech economy fell 0.8 percent in the first quarter
from the final three months of 2011, the second contraction in
as many quarters, as households curbed spending in response to a
worsening economic outlook across  Europe . The economy relies on
demand for cars, auto parts and electronics goods from the
European Union, the market for about 80 percent of Czech
exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
