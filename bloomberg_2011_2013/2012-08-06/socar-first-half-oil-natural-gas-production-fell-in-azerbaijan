State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan  pumped
less crude oil and natural gas in the first half.  Oil output fell 2.6 percent to 4.1 million metric tons from
the same period a year earlier and gas declined 3.2 percent to
3.4 billion cubic meters, the Baku-based company known as Socar
said today on its  website  without giving a reason.  Azerbaijan’s total oil production in the first six months
of the year fell 7.1 percent to 22.2 million tons, the State
Statistics Committee said last month. Gas production expanded
8.6 percent to 8.8 billion cubic meters.  Most was pumped from the BP Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli
and Shah Deniz fields in Azerbaijan’s section of the  Caspian
Sea . The nation, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped 45.6 million
tons of oil and 25.8 billion cubic meters of gas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
