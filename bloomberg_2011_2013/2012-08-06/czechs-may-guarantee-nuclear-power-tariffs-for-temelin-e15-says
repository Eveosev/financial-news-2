Czech officials may guarantee power
prices for  CEZ AS (CEZ)  to support its plan to build two new reactors
at its Temelin nuclear plant,  E15  reported, citing a state
energy-strategy proposal by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  The long-term strategy still has to be cleared by other
ministries before it goes for approval to the government, the
news website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
