Russia ’s southern Rostov region, the
country’s third-biggest grain grower, harvested 5.6 million
metric tons of grain so far this year.  The estimate for grains and legumes excludes corn, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said on its website today. Winter wheat was
4.5 million tons, spring barley 790,000 tons and peas 172,000
tons, it said. Rostov’s total crop may exceed 6 million tons, it
said. Last year, Rostov harvested 7.7 million tons of grains,
according to the state statistics data.  Drought damaged almost 200,000 hectares (494,211 acres) of
planted area, the ministry said, citing Rostov’s Governor Vasily
Golubev. The total area is 2.5 million hectares. Eighty percent
of this year’s crop is comprised of the third-grade and fourth-
grade milling wheat, the varieties that are most often exported,
according to the statement. Krasnodar and Stavropol are the
biggest grain growing regions in Russia.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 0.8 percent to $8.97 a
bushel today on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have climbed
24 percent this year, partly because of Russia’s drought  Editors: Claudia Carpenter,  John Deane   To contact the reporter on this story:
