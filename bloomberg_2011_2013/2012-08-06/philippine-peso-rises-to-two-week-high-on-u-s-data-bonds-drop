The Philippine peso rose, snapping a
three-day slide after U.S. payrolls climbed more than forecast
and the local central bank signaled it’s prepared to do more to
support growth.  The currency reached the highest level since July 19 as
regional stocks rallied after a Labor Department report on Aug.
3 showed American employers added 163,000 jobs last month,
compared with 64,000 in June. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has
room for policy action as needed to spur growth, Governor Amando
Tetangco told senators in  Manila  today.  Government bonds  dropped
before an inflation report tomorrow.  The peso gained as much as 0.4 percent to 41.68 per dollar
before closing at 41.84 in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was little changed at 6 percent.  “The peso benefited from the global positive sentiment,”
said Fernando Mangalindan, a bond trader at  Philippine Savings
Bank (PSB)  in Manila. “There is very strong support near 41.75.”
Support refers to a level on a price graph where technical
analysts anticipate orders to buy an asset.  Overseas funds were net buyers of $59 million of local
stocks last week, exchange data showed. Policy actions have
helped the economy grow and remittances and fund inflows will
sustain the peso’s gains, Tetangco said today. The central bank
cut its overnight rate to a record low 3.75 percent on July 26.
The $225 billion economy expanded 6.4 percent in the first three
months of 2012, the most in six quarters.  The yield on the Philippine government’s 6.375 percent
bonds due January 2022 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.85 percent, according to Tradition Financial
Services.  A government report tomorrow may show annual inflation
quickened to 3.1 percent in July from 2.8 percent in June,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
