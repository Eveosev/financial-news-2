The U.S. will give wind- and solar-
energy companies access to 16 million acres of federal land
previously set aside for military testing and training.  The Interior and Defense departments agreed to encourage
energy development on the public lands, which may contribute to
the generation of 10,000 megawatts of solar power in the U.S.
Southwest, Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat,
said today a conference call.  “This agreement is going to help save the taxpayers
billions of dollars in fuel costs, increase our national
security and help protect the environment,” Reid said.  President  Barack Obama  is supporting alternative energy as
a way to diversify away from oil and reduce the need for crude
imports from the Middle East. Republicans including presidential
candidate  Mitt Romney  criticized the administration for slowing
energy development on federal land.  To contact the reporter on this story:
