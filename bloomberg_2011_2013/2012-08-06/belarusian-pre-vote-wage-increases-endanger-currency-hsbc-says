Belarus risks undermining economic
stability by raising wages before elections,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
 said .  Wage indexation threatens to widen the current-account gap,
as a result of which the ruble may need to depreciate to 9,500
per dollar by year-end from 8,350 at end-2011, HSBC wrote today
in an e-mailed report. The economy may grow 3 percent this year
before slowing in 2013 as competitiveness falls and imports
increase, according to the report.  “Our initial hopes for the authorities’ attempt to achieve
subdued economic growth and curb inflation in 2012 have been
disappointed,” HSBC wrote.  Belarus is recovering after a balance-of-payments crisis
last year that caused inflation to soar to 108.7 percent as the
ruble depreciated 64 percent against the dollar. Voters in the
former Soviet republic will elect a new parliament in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
