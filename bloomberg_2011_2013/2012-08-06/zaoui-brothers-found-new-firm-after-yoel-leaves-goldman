Michael and Yoel Zaoui, former M&A
bankers at  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
respectively, are starting a new firm.  Zaoui Capital LLP was incorporated on July 26, according to
documents filed with the U.K.’s Companies House. The documents
list Michael, 55, and Yoel, 51, as officers of the company,
which is registered to the London offices of U.S. law firm
Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP.  Yoel Zaoui resigned as co-head of global mergers and
acquisitions at Goldman Sachs in April, while Michael ran
European M&A at Morgan Stanley until he retired in 2008.  The pair, who are French citizens, attracted attention in
the late 1990s for being on the opposite sides of some of the
era’s biggest takeover battles, including the $58 billion deal
that created French energy giant Total SA and  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD) ’s $137 billion hostile bid for Mannesmann AG.  Yoel has been among potential candidates to lead  Vivendi
SA (VIV) , the French media and telecommunications group that ousted
Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Bernard Levy  this year as it began
a review of its wide-ranging corporate structure, people
familiar with the deliberations said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
