Mauritius will announce  consumer-
inflation data  for July today.  Inflation in the Indian Ocean island nation was little
changed at 3.9 percent in June, remaining below the central
bankâ€™s target rate of 4 percent to 6 percent for the fourth
month. The central bank will probably keep its benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged for the rest of the year,  PluriConseil ,
a Port Louis-based advisory firm, said last month.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  continues her visit
to African countries that has so far included Senegal, Uganda,
 South Sudan  and  Kenya .
