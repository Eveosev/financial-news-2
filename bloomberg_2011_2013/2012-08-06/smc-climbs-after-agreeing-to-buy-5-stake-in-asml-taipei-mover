Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) 
climbed to its highest in a month after agreeing to invest 1.11
billion euros ($1.38 billion) in  ASML Holding NV (ASML) , the world’s
largest chip-equipment maker, and cooperate on research.  TSMC gained as much as 2.1 percent to NT$81.50, the highest
since July 3, before trading at NT$81 as of 12:41 p.m. in Taipei.
The benchmark  Taiex (TWSE)  index, of which TSMC is the largest member,
rose 1.2 percent.  TSMC will spend 838 million euros to take a 5 percent stake
in Veldhoven, Netherlands-based ASML and pay a further 276
million euros over five years for next-generation manufacturing
technology, it said yesterday. The Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company
joins  Intel Corp . in co-customer investment in ASML to secure
access to chipmaking technologies including extreme ultraviolet
lithography.  “It is a long-term positive for TSMC to join ASML’s co-
customer investment program since it highlights the availability
of extreme ultraviolet technology and equipment,” Patrick Liao
and Jason Ho, technology analysts at Nomura Holdings Inc., said
in a note today. TSMC’s investment implies it will have “joint
intellectual property rights of the critical lithography R&D in
the future,” they said. The analysts rate the stock buy with a
target price of NT$105.  The agreement with TSMC brings the amount of customer co-
investment to 20 percent of equity and the chip gear maker is in
talks with other customers to bring the total to 25 percent,
ASML said in a statement.  TSMC, which sold NT$18.9 billion ($631 million) of bonds at
the end of June, had a total of NT$178 billion in cash as of
June 30, according to its second-quarter  cash flow statement .
The proceeds from the last bond sale will be added to its
balance sheet during the current period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
