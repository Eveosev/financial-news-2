Noesis Energy Inc., a closely held
provider of energy-management services, received  $8 million  to
expand sales and marketing operations.  Black Coral Capital led the  Series B  financing, which also
included Austin Ventures, which contributed $6.5 million in
 Series A  financing last year.  Noesis, based in Austin,  Texas , uses a so-called
“freemium” business model where it provides for free a web-
based platform to monitor energy use and then charges for
additional premium services. Noesis also generates revenue from
sponsorships with companies including  KMC Controls Inc.  and  MSi
Solid-State Lighting.   “The ’freemium’ model makes us a bit unusual in the
space,” Chief Executive Officer  Scott Harmon  said today in a
telephone interview. “It allows people to use our basic
functionality on an unlimited basis in as many buildings and
meters as possible.”  The Noesis desktop product is used in more than 3,500
buildings by at least 300 customers, Harmon said. The company
plans to add sales and marketing personnel to a staff of 27.  “We don’t have any sales people at all,” Harmon said.
“We’ve done all marketing through the Internet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
