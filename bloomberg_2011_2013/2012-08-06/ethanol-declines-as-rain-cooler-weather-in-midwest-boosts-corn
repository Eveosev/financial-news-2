Ethanol futures fell in  Chicago  as
rain and cooler weather in the U.S. Midwest provided some relief
to drought-withered corn crops.  Futures tumbled after rain over the weekend improved the
prospects for corn, the primary ingredient used to produce
ethanol in the U.S. Distillers have responded to higher corn
prices brought about by drought by cutting output by 16 percent
to 809,000 barrels a day from a record 963,000 on Dec. 30.  “The weather has been moderating here a little bit,” said
Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in
Galena,  Illinois . “You had corn off here and kind of losing a
bit of steam. Corn’s the weak link and continues to drive the
market.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 1.1 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $2.578 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have advanced 17 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast slumped
4.5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.755 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 4 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.545, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  sank 2.5 cents to $2.64 a gallon and in
the U.S. Gulf the biofuel fell 2 cents to $2.615.  Corn for December delivery slipped 2.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $8.05 a bushel in Chicago.  Assuming one bushel of the grain distills into at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol, companies stand to lose 48 cents on
every gallon produced, based on the December contracts for the
commodities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Everybody’s pushed back on run rates and reduced
production,” Babler said. “It’s still a tough environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
