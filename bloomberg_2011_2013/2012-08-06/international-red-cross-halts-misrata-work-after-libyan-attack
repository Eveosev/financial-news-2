The  International Committee of the
Red Cross  said it has suspended work in the Libyan cities of
Misrata and Benghazi after one of its residences was attacked,
the latest incident of violence before the country’s newly-
elected legislature takes power.  The ICRC’s building in Misrata was heavily damaged in the
attack, the organization said in a  statement  on its website,
adding it was the fifth such incident directed against its
workers in less than three months in Misrata and the eastern
city of Benghazi. None of the seven staff members inside were
injured, the statement said.  In two days’ time, the new 200-seat National Congress takes
power from the National Transitional Council that has ruled
 Libya  since  Muammar Qaddafi  was ousted and killed last year. The
assembly, elected last month, inherits a country racked with
unrest, its economy limping and where security is a continuing
concern as the national council struggles to exert control over
militia forces.  Libyan security forces killed three people yesterday during
a raid aimed at seizing explosives, NTC spokesman Saleh Daroub
told reporters. Five members of the security forces were injured
in the raid on a farm on the outskirts of Tripoli, he said,
adding that those killed were believed to be behind seven failed
plots to carry out attacks.  Assailants have targeted several government buildings
around the country over the past few months, either using
explosives or launching armed assaults. In addition, foreign
diplomatic compounds and convoys have also been attacked.  To contact the reporter on this story:
