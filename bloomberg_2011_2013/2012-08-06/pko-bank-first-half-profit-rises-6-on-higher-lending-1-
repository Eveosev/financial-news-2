PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , Poland’s largest
bank, said first-half net income rose 6 percent as higher
revenue from loans helped mitigate increased provisions for bad
credit.  Profit increased to 1.95 billion zloty ($590 million) from
1.84 billion zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said
today in a statement. That met the 1.93 billion-zloty average
prediction of eight  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Bad loan
provisions rose to 1.1 billion zloty from 881.4 million zloty.  Earnings may slow in the second half, according to Chief
Executive Officer Zbigniew Jagiello.  “Taking into account that the economic growth in the
second half of this year will slow compared to a year earlier,
earnings in this period will also decelerate,” Jagiello said
today. “Still, full-year profit will be at a similar level as
last year.”  Polish banks face weaker earnings as a slowing economy cuts
demand for credit and prompts lenders to increase provisions for
bad loans. Their combined profit rose 3.1 percent to 8.04
billion zloty in the first half compared with a 37 percent
increase for the whole of 2011, the country’s central bank said
in a report on Aug. 1. At  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , Poland’s largest
lender, six-month profit rose 3.7 percent.  PKO’s net interest income, a measure of revenue from
lending, rose 13 percent to 4 billion zloty, the bank said.  The bank, which plans to work on a three-year strategy in
the fourth quarter, expects to keep its cost-to-income ratio
below 45 percent and post a “double digit” return on equity, a
measure of profitability, through 2015, Jagiello told reporters.
PKO’s costs were 39 percent of income in the first half, while
ROE was 17.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
