Russell Investments, the asset
manager and creator of global indexes bearing its name, is
reviewing its direct U.S. exchange-traded fund business and will
scale back the team dedicated to those funds.  Russell will focus on its core role of providing multiasset
solutions to investors and advisers, the firm said in a
 statement  posted today on its website.  The firm, whose direct ETF team works mostly in  San
Francisco  and  New York , will cut about 30 jobs between the two
offices, Steve Claiborne, a spokesman for Seattle-based Russell,
said in a telephone interview. The ETFs provided by the firm
have about $300 million in assets.  Russell manages about $152 billion in assets for 2,400
institutional investors and works with more than 500 financial
advisers and distributors to sell investment products to
individuals, according to its website.  The company, founded in 1936, is also the creator of the
Russell global indexes. Russell will remain the underlying index
provider for ETFs holding more than $80 billion in assets, the
firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
