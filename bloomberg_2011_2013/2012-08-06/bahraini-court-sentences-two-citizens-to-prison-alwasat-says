Bahrain’s Appeal Court lowered prison
sentences today on two citizens who were accused for different
charges related to the country’s political unrest, Alwasat
reported.  The court sentenced Younis Achouri, 63, the manager of
Muharraq maternity hospital, to one year in prison instead of
three for stealing oxygen cylinders from the hospital and
transferring it to Pearl Roundabout during last year’s riots,
the newspaper  said .  The court also lowered a 3-year prison sentence on another
citizen to 18 months for being involved in the killing of a
police officer, the daily  said , without giving the name of the
citizen. The court cleared both citizens from incitement
charges, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
