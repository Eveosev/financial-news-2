Celgene Corp. (CELG) , the maker of cancer-
fighting drugs Istodax and Abraxane, sold $1.5 billion of bonds
in its first offering in about two years.  The biopharmaceutical company issued $500 million of 1.9
percent, five-year notes to yield 130 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $1 billion of 3.25 percent, 10-
year debt at a relative yield of 170 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Celgene last sold debt in a three-part offering in October
2010, issuing $500 million each of 2.45 percent, five-year debt
and 3.95 percent, 10-year bonds and $250 million of 5.7 percent
30-year securities, Bloomberg data show.  The new bonds may be rated Baa2, the second-lowest level of
investment grade, by Moodyâ€™s Investors Service, according to a
person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
identified because the terms are private.  Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan
Stanley managed the sale for the Summit, New Jersey-based
company, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
