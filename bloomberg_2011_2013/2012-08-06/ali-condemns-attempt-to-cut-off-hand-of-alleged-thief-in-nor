Maliâ€™s government condemned an
attempt by Islamists in the northern city of Gao to cut off the
hand of a man accused of being a thief, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  Residents in the city protested the planned amputation,
Kader Toure, a trader in Gao, said by phone.  The Islamist groups, Ansar ud-Din and MUJAO, decided not to
go ahead with the punishment in order to halt the protests,
Oumar Hamaha, a spokesman for the organizations, said by phone.
He denied that they were re-thinking a plan to implement Shariah
law, which includes amputations as penalty for stealing, in the
region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
