Consumer prices in Ecuador rose a the
fastest pace in four months in July, led by increases in alcohol
and food costs, the country’s statistics agency said today.  Prices in the Andean country, which uses the U.S. dollar as
its official currency, gained 0.26 percent in the month, while
annual inflation accelerated to 5.09 percent from 5 percent, the
National Statistics and Census Institute said in a report on its
 website .  Ecuador’s government, faced with falling revenue as oil
prices decline, requested a $515 million loan from the Latin
American Reserve Fund last month to shore up liquidity.
President  Rafael Correa , a self-described socialist and ally of
Venezuela’s President  Hugo Chavez , last month also increased
taxes on imports of alcohol, vehicles and some other items to
reduce capital outflows.  Prices rose the fastest in Manta, jumping 6.78 percent in
July from the previous year, while inflation quickened to 4.57
percent in Guayaquil, the nation’s largest city, the agency
said. Ecuador, the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, subsidizes fuel costs and the
domestic use of natural gas.  Producer prices climbed 0.69 percent from the previous
month and rose 2.99 percent from July 2011, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
