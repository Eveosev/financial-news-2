Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA)  and
 Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  are forming a joint venture to
combine previously announced projects into a single crude-oil
pipeline in South Texas.  The 140-mile (225-kilometer) conduit will have the capacity
of 350,000 barrels a day and will carry oil and condensate from
Texas’s Eagle Ford Shale field to  Corpus Christi , the Houston-
based companies said in a statement today. The proposed project
has long-term commitments from shippers totaling 210,000 barrels
a day.  The companies had planned separate pipelines with
capacities of 300,000 and 350,000 barrels through the same area,
Rick Rainey, an Enterprise spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. Combining the projects “allows more efficient use of
our capital,” he said.  Plains will operate the system, which is expected to open
in the fourth quarter.  Plains said second-quarter earnings rose to $378 million,
or $1.85 a share, from $225 million, or $1.13 a share, a year
earlier, according to a separate statement. The results were 19
cents higher than the average of four analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Plains’ shares rose 1.4 percent to close at $87.35 in New
York. Enterprise climbed 1.3 percent to $53.63.  To contact the reporter on this story:
