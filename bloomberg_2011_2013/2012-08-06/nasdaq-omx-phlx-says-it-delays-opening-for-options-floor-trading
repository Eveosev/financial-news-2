Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  said it delayed
the opening for floor trading on the Nasdaq OMX PHLX because of
an issue with the floor-based systems.  The alert that trading was suspended went out at 9:48 a.m.
 New York  time, according to an e-mail from the company.
Electronic trading is “functioning normally,” the New York-
based company said.  Nasdaq OMX PHLX accounted for 19 percent of U.S. options
trading, including indexes, last month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Rob Madden, a spokesman for Nasdaq,
declined to comment beyond the company’s notice.  To contact the reporters on this story:
