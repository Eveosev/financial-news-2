U.K.  retail sales  rose in July as the
start of the Olympics at the end of the month helped to boost
food and drink sales, the British Retail Consortium said.  Sales at stores open at least 12 months, measured by value,
rose 0.1 percent from a year earlier, the London-based trade
group said in an e-mailed report today. It added that sales of
big-ticket items continued to struggle.  With the recession deepening in the second quarter,
officials are looking to the London Olympic Games that started
on July 27 to provide a boost to the economy. GfK NOP Ltd. said
July 31 that its gauge of  consumer confidence  was unchanged last
month at minus 29.  “There was a boost for food retailers toward the end of
the month as the sunshine came out and shoppers started getting
in party food and drink ahead of the Olympics, but it wasn’t a
significant help,” BRC Director General Stephen Robertson said.
“With only the opening couple of days of the  Olympic Games 
covered by these statistics we’ll have to wait a while to assess
the overall impact on retail sales.”  Including stores open less than 12 months, the value of
retail sales rose 2 percent in July from a year earlier,
according to the BRC. In the three months through July, food
sales increased 0.9 percent from a year earlier on a like-for-
like basis, while non-food sales rose 1 percent.  -- Editors: Fergal O’Brien, Craig Stirling  To contact the reporter on this story:
