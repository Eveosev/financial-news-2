Best Buy Co.’s (BBY)  credit rating was cut
to junk by  Standard & Poor’s  because of the prospect that a
buyout by the retailer’s founder would add debt.  The rating was cut one level to BB+, the first level below
investment grade, Jayne M. Ross, an analyst for S&P, said today
in a statement. The Richfield, Minnesota-based company’s rating
remains on watch negative, which means it may be reduced
further.  Best Buy founder Richard Schulze, who resigned as chairman
in June, today offered to take the electronics retailer private
at $24 to $26 a share. Such a transaction would add a
“significant amount of debt,” S&P said, without providing a
specific amount.  Best Buy’s $650 million of 5.5 percent bonds due in March
2021 rose 2.5 cents to 94 cents on the dollar at 2 p.m. in  New
York , according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt, which yields
6.4 percent, has risen from 89.8 cents on July 25.  The company is rated investment grade at Moody’s Investors
Service and Fitch Ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
