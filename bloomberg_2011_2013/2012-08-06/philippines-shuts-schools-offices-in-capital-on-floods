The Philippines shut schools and
government offices in the capital and several provinces in the
main island of  Luzon  after sustained rains caused flooding.  President  Benigno Aquino  ordered the suspension of work and
classes at all levels today, Abigail Valte, a presidential
spokeswoman, said in an interview on local radio station DZMM.  Heavy rains in past days caused rivers and dams near the
capital to rise, Office of Civil Defense Director Susana Cruz
said yesterday. Thousands have been evacuated.  Damage caused by typhoons and other calamities reached 59.2
billion pesos ($1.4 billion) in 2011, Economic Planning
Secretary Arsenio Balisacan told lawmakers yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
