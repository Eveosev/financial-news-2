Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index rising to its highest level in a month, after
better-than-forecast data for U.S. employment and the services
industry eased investor concern that growth is slowing in the
world’s largest economy.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a maker of toys and clothes that gets 60
percent of its sales in the U.S., climbed 4.1 percent in  Hong
Kong .  Asahi Glass Co. (5201)  jumped 7.3 percent in Tokyo after Nomura

profit outlook.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest miner,
gained 2.2 percent in Sydney after commodity prices advanced.

widening its loss forecast.  All major indexes in the Asia-Pacific region advanced. The
benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.7 percent to 119.02
as of 8:24 p.m. in Tokyo, its highest level since July 5. Almost
five stocks rose for each that fell. The gauge declined last
week after the  European Central Bank  failed to deliver immediate
action to stem the region’s debt crisis and as the U.S. Federal
Reserve refrained from adding stimulus.  “The U.S. payrolls data was a delightful surprise,” said
George Boubouras, Melbourne-based head of investment strategy at
UBS AG’s Australian wealth management unit. The Swiss bank has
about $1.5 trillion in assets under management. “The U.S.
economic momentum has a pulse. Despite no central bank action
last week, it looks clear that both the Federal Reserve and the
ECB will act and they have adjusted their language to be able to
intervene.”  Nikkei, Kospi  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , which lists some stocks from
emerging markets, gained 7.3 percent from this year’s lowest
level in June through Aug. 3 amid speculation central banks from
the U.S. to China and Europe would step up efforts to stimulate
economic growth.  The regional benchmark traded at 12 times estimated
earnings, compared with 13.5 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 11.4 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average and South Korea’s  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  both rose 2 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51) 
increased 1.2 percent, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.4 percent.  Singapore’s Straits Times Index advanced 0.7 percent, while
Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 1.7 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index added 1 percent after the nation’s regulators
encouraged employees to buy shares in their own companies to
bolster equities.  Europe Debt  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent today. The gauge
climbed 1.9 percent on Aug. 3 after a Labor Department report
showed U.S. payrolls climbed more than forecast even as the
jobless rate unexpectedly rose. Growth in the services industry
accelerated in July from the month before.  The rally in stocks gained strength as members of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition parties signaled they won’t
stand in the way of European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi ’s bond plan to relieve the region’s debt crisis.  Li & Fung rose 4.1 percent to HK$15.32 in Hong Kong.  Mazda
Motor Corp. (7261) , a Japanese automaker that gets almost three-
quarters of its revenue overseas, jumped 5.6 percent to 94 yen

percent drop on Aug. 3 after the company widened its loss
forecast.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) , the world’s largest
contract manufacturer of electronics and a flagship of Foxconn
Technology Group, gained 7 percent to NT$87.30 in Taipei after
saying it plans to renegotiate the price of its investment in
Sharp to less than the 550 yen per share it had agreed to in
March.  Foxconn Technology Co. (2354) , an affiliate of Hon Hai that also
plans to invest in the Japanese company, surged 6 percent to
