Guatemala will withdraw a proposal to
change the constitution that would have allowed the state to
acquire stakes of as much as 40 percent in natural resource
companies, the government said in a statement.  The proposals had prompted concern among foreign investors,
Fernando Carrera, the general secretary of government planning
at the presidency, said in the statement.  The government may be able to push through the changes
without changing the constitution, Carrera said.  The stock price for Reno, Nevada-based mining company  Tahoe
Resources Inc. (TAHO) , which operates the Escobal silver mine southeast
of Guatemala City, tumbled 24 percent on June 28 after reports
of the proposal surfaced.  The remaining constitutional reform package, which will
seek to diversify  tax revenue  and strengthen the Guatemalan
justice system, is expected to be presented to congress this
month, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
