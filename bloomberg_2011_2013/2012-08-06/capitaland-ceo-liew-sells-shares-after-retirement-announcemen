CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) ,  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest developer, fell for the first time in 11 days after
Chief Executive Officer Liew Mun Leong divested a portion of his
stake after announcing his retirement about a month ago.  Leong sold 1 million shares for S$3.08 a piece, according
to a  statement  to the  Singapore  Stock Exchange yesterday. Liew’s
holdings after the transaction fell to 2.55 million, or 0.06
percent of the issued capital, according to the statement.  The shares dropped 1.9 percent to S$3.07 as of 11:59 a.m.
in Singapore trading, the first decline since July 23. The stock
climbed 39 percent this year, and Liew sold the shares after the
gains made CapitaLand the second-best performer on the benchmark
 Straits Times Index. (FSSTI)   “There was a ’Liew Mun Leong’ effect that used to be
talked about in the past when he sells, typically three to six
months on there is some weakness,” said Vikrant Pandey, an
analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte in Singapore. “It’s more that now
that he is planning for retirement. I don’t see any fundamental
reason for selling the stock.”  Liew, who helped create CapitaLand almost 12 years ago,
will retire on June 28, 2013, when he turns 67, the company said
June 22.  “The sale of shares is part of Mr. Liew’s personal
financial management,” the company said in an e-mail yesterday.  In the past year, the developer named a new chief financial
officer and swapped the jobs of senior managers including the
head of its serviced apartment unit.  Under Liew, CapitaLand expanded beyond the limited
Singapore market with a population of 5.2 million. China made up
41 percent of CapitaLand’s S$33.4 billion of assets as of June,
exceeding Singapore’s 31 percent, according to data from
CapitaLand.  Australia  contributed 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
