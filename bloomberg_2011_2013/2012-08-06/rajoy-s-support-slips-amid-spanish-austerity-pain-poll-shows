Support for Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy ’s party has slipped 8 percentage points in as many
months, a poll showed today, as the deepest budget cuts on
record failed to shield the nation from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The ruling  People’s Party  would win 36.6 percent of the
vote if elections were held now, compared with 40.6 percent in
an April poll and 44.6 percent in the Nov. 20 election, the
state-run Center for Sociological Research said today. The
opposition Socialists would win 29.9 percent, compared with 29.6
percent in April and 28.8 percent at the election.  Rajoy was graded 3.33 out of 10, while Socialist leader
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba was rated 3.8 in the survey. Rosa Diez,
the leader of  Union, Progress and Democracy , a five-year-old
party with five of the 350 seats in Parliament, was rated
highest with 4.36. Her party would win 6.6 percent of the vote.  Rajoy, who has an outright majority in Parliament, has
broken election pledges on taxes, benefits and health care in
his efforts to prevent  Spain  needing a full international
bailout. Even as he implements more than 100 billion euros ($124
billion) of budget cuts and laws designed to lower the 25
percent jobless rate, the continued surge in borrowing costs
forced him last week to say he may consider external help.  The government, in power since December, agreed to a
European rescue for its banks in June of as much as 100 billion
euros as its access to financing narrowed. The  yield  on the
benchmark 10-year bond rose to a record of 7.75 percent on July
25, and traded at 6.789 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
