Merck & Co.,  Sangamo Biosciences Inc. (SGMO) 
and researchers searching for an AIDS cure will benefit from
grants worth more than $70 million as the U.S. government
strives for an end to the world’s deadliest infectious disease.  The  National Institutes of Health  awarded more than $14
million a year for five years to three groups of scientists to
advance research aimed at curing AIDS, the Bethesda, Maryland-
based agency said in a  statement  on its website today.  The biggest grant, of $6.3 million in the first year, will
go to a group of 19 laboratories led by David Margolis, a
professor of medicine at the University of  North Carolina  in
 Chapel Hill . He’s working with Merck to develop a line of drugs
aimed at purging HIV from cells where it hides out, evading AIDS
treatments and condemning patients to a lifetime of popping
pills.  “The NIH has said for a while that it’s one of the top
three priorities in AIDS research,” Margolis said in a
telephone interview. “Now they’re putting their money where
their mouth is.”  About 2.6 million people became infected with HIV in 2009,
and more than 1.8 million people died with AIDS-related causes,
according to the Joint  United Nations  Programme on HIV/AIDS.  The NIH awarded $4.2 million to scientists led by Steven Deeks at the  University of California , San Francisco, who are
also working with Merck, and $4.1 million to researchers led by
Keith Jerome at the Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, who are working with Richmond, California-based Sangamo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
