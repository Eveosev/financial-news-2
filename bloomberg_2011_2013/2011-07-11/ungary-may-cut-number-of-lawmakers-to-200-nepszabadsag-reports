Hungaryâ€™s governing party plans to
cut the number of lawmakers to about 200 from 386, abolish the
second round of voting and end the system of compensating for
votes cast for runner-up candidates,  Nepszabadsag  reported.  The ruling Fidesz party also plans to allow Hungarian
citizens living outside the country to vote, the newspaper said,
citing Janos Ader, a European lawmaker from Fidesz. Ader was
asked by Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  to prepare an overhaul of
the electoral system.  Fidesz, which last year secured the two-third of seats
needed to change the constitution after getting 53 percent of
votes, would have won as many as three-quarters of seats if the
system of compensating parties for votes cast for runners-up was
abolished, Nepszabadsag said.  According to the draft plan, ethnic minorities without an
elected lawmaker would be guaranteed a representative who could
participate in debates without voting, the newspaper reported.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
