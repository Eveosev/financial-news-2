The forint retreated for a second
day against the euro amid concern the Europe Union’s debt crisis
may spread to  Italy .  The Hungarian currency depreciated as much as 0.6 percent
to 265.59 per euro, its lowest intraday rate since July 1, and
traded down 0.5 percent as of 10:49 a.m. in Budapest, tied along
with Romania’s leu as the second-worst performer against the
euro, after the Polish zloty, among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  A European bailout fund may have to be doubled to 1.5
trillion euros ($2.1 trillion) to cover a crisis in Italy, the
ECB said, according to the German newspaper Die Welt. The
Financial Times cited unidentified senior officials as saying
European leader are prepared to accept that  Greece  should
default on some of bonds as part of a new bailout plan for the
country.  The euro region is the biggest export market for  Hungary .  To contact the reporter on this story:
