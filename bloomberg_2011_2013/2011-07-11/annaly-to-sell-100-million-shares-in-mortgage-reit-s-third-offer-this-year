Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NLY) , the
largest U.S. mortgage real estate investment trust, said it
plans to sell 100 million shares in its third public stock
offering this year.  The proceeds will be used to buy mortgage-backed
securities, the New York-based company said in a statement
today. Annaly has sold 150 million shares this year for a total
of about $2.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The REIT, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Michael Farrell, in recent years has expanded from investing in
government-backed mortgage bonds to overseeing distressed-debt
buyers and a securities firm. Annaly also started financing
middle-market companies and home lenders, and entered ventures
to make commercial real estate loans, after the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression curbed sources of lending.  Mortgage REITs led by Annaly and  American Capital Agency
Corp. (AGNC)  raised almost $6 billion through stock sales in December,
January and February, helping to bolster the market for
mortgage-backed securities. Investment companies including
Pacific Investment Management Co., Avenue Capital Management and
Angelo, Gordon & Co. are creating mortgage REITs and also are
selling shares.  Annaly shares fell 42 cents to $17.90 as of 5:13 p.m. in
 New York . The stock has gained 2.2 percent this year in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, compared with a 0.2 percent
decline in the BBREIT Mortgage index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
