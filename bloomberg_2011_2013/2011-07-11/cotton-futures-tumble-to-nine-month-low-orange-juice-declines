Cotton prices fell to the lowest in
almost nine months as the dollar’s rally reduced the appeal of
exports from the U.S., the world’s largest shipper.  Orange juice 
dropped the most since April.  The greenback rose to a six-week high against a basket of
six major currencies, and the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials fell as much as 1.3 percent as
European-debt concerns escalated. Cotton has tumbled 50 percent
from a record $2.197 a pound on March 7 as demand dwindled in
 China , the world’s biggest buyer.  “There’s a good bit of bearishness regarding economic
activity, whether that’s on economic performance in the EU or
manufacturing demand in China,” said Chris Kramedjian, a risk-
 management consultant  at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville,
Tennessee. “Managed-money and commodity bulls are licking their
wounds and reevaluating their positions.”  Cotton for December delivery tumbled by the exchange limit
of 5 cents, or 4.4 percent, to settle at $1.0888 at 2:42 p.m. on
ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . That’s the lowest for a most-
active contract since Oct. 18.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery fell 4.2 cents,
or 2.2 percent, to settle at $1.8695 a pound on ICE, capping the
biggest decline since April 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
