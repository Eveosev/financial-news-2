California , the most populous U.S.
state, collected 3.7 percent more revenue in June than
projected, a gain of $440.5 million, as the economy expanded,
the controller reported.  Personal income taxes were 6.8 percent, or $410 million,
higher than projected in May, Controller John Chiang said in a
statement. Sales taxes were 0.8 percent above estimates, or
$21.8 million, while corporate taxes were up 7.2 percent, or
$156 million.  Still, June revenue was $350 million less than the $1.2
billion in additional revenue on which Governor  Jerry Brown  and
Democrats based their new budget, Chiang said. That $86 billion
spending plan signed into law June 30 filled what remained of a
$26 billion deficit with $12 billion in spending cuts and a
forecast of an equal amount in higher  tax revenue  from a
recovering economy.  “The latest report shows many positive signs,” Chiang
said in the statement. “The state is spending less than it took
in, we are borrowing less cash, and all three major sources of
revenue show signs of growth. But the success of the newly
adopted state budget will depend on continued economic expansion
throughout the year.”  The budget plan includes $2.5 billion in automatic
additional cuts that will be triggered in January if receipts
fall short.  To contact the reporters on this story:
