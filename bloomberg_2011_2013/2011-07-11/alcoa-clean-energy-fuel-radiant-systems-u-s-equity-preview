Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 4 p.m. in New York.  Semiconductor-related shares declined after  Microchip
Technology Inc. (MCHP)  , a maker of analog chips, said
earnings in the quarter ended June missed its forecast, and
 Novellus Systems Inc. (NVLS)  , a maker of machinery used in
semiconductor production forecast third-quarter profit that fell
short of analysts’ estimates.  Microchip tumbled 12 percent to $32.93 for the biggest
retreat in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Novellus dropped 11
percent to $31.75.  Intel Corp. (INTC)   slid 1.8 percent to $22.45 for the
second-biggest retreat in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
index.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)   slid 4.9 percent to
$6.43.  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN)   erased 3.7 percent to
$31.25.  Teradyne Inc. (TER)   sank 4.7 percent to $13.74.  Maxim Integrated Products Inc. (MXIM)   lost 6.7 percent
to $23.71. The maker of computer chips was cut to “neutral”
from “buy” at UBS AG.  Ann Inc. (ANN US) fell 6.1 percent, the most since July
2010, to $25.25. The women’s clothing retailer had its 2011
earnings estimate lowered at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which
cited a “deceleration” at the company’s Ann Taylor Stores
division.  Boeing Co. (BA)   declined 1.9 percent to $71.93, the
biggest retreat in the Dow average. The U.S. airplane maker’s
bigger rival, Airbus SAS, plans to ramp up jetliner production
“progressively” as orders climb, the head of the French
company’s parent, European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., said
today.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)   gained 1.1 percent to $15.60
for the biggest increase in the Dow average. The largest
networking-equipment company may cut as many as 10,000 jobs, or
about 14 percent of its workforce, to revive profit growth, two
people familiar with the plans said.  Clean Energy Fuel Corp. (CLNE US) surged 15 percent, the
most since March 2010, to $15.08. The builder and operator of
natural-gas fueling stations is receiving a $150 million
investment from Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK US) as part of the
most-active U.S. natural gas driller’s $1 billion fund to invest
in companies that develop infrastructure or technology to
increase the use of gas as a motor fuel.  General Cable Corp. (BGC)   gained 4 percent, the most
since June 21, to $42.75. The Highland Heights, Kentucky-based
cable maker was added to the Standard & Poor’s MidCap 400 Index,
replacing  SRA International Inc. (SRX)   after July 15.  MBIA Inc. (MBI)   rose the most in the Russell 1000 Index,
rallying 6.9 percent to $9.04. The bond insurer agreed with Bank
of America Corp. (BAC US) to dismiss a lawsuit over protection
sold against mortgage-debt defaults, prompting speculation that
the two firms are near a wider settlement of claims tied to
soured subprime home loans.  Radiant Systems Inc. (RADS)   surged 30 percent to $27.99
for the second-biggest advance in the Russell 2000 Index. The
maker of software for retailers was acquired by  NCR Corp. (NCR)   for $28 a share.  Trex Co. (TREX US) declined 15 percent, the most since
March 2009, to $20.45. The maker of composite decking and
fencing materials said second-quarter sales were about $78
million, missing its earlier projection. The result was also
lower than the average analyst estimate of $114 million in a
Bloomberg survey.  Wolverine World Wide Inc. (WWW)   slipped 6.7 percent, the
most since Feb. 3, to $39.73. The shoemaker posted second-
quarter profit that beat the average analyst estimate by the
smallest percentage since the fourth quarter of 2009, Bloomberg
data show. Taposh Bari, analyst at Jefferies & Co, said
investors would sell Wolverine after the report to take
advantage of gains in the stock. The shares had surged 19
percent since June 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
