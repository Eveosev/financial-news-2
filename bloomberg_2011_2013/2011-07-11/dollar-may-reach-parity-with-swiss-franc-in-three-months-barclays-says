Barclays Plc advised investors to
bet the dollar will strengthen to parity with the  Swiss franc  in
three months as  Europe ’s worsening sovereign debt crisis
increases the refuge appeal of the U.S. currency.  “At this stage, we favor being long dollar-franc,”
London-based strategist Sara Yates wrote in a research note
today. “Assuming that prospects do improve within the euro
area, the franc’s value as a hedge will diminish. If, however,
euro area events get much worse, we think it would become an
increasingly important problem for global financial markets. In
which case, even given the weak payrolls data, the dollar looks
best placed to benefit.”  Barclays recommended buying the dollar at 83.50 centimes
and placing a so-called stop loss order at 79 centimes. The
dollar was last worth more than the franc on Dec. 2, 2010.  The greenback weakened 0.1 percent to 83.56 at 4:20 p.m. in
 New York , from 83.66 on July 8. The dollar has weakened 10.5
percent this year against the franc.  Italian bonds plunged and the country’s stocks fell to the
lowest in two years today as euro-area finance chiefs failed to
convince investors that the region’s second-most indebted nation
will avoid following Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  in needing a
bailout.  The yield on the nation’s 10-year bond rose 42 basis
points, or 0.42 percentage point, to 5.68 percent, the highest
in more than a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
