Ghana ’s cedi gained to the strongest
intraday level in more than a month against the dollar as mining
companies sold the U.S. currency to finance their operations.  The cedi appreciated for the first day in three, adding as
much as 0.7 percent to 1.5055 per dollar today, its strongest
since June 7, before trading less than 0.1 percent up at 1.5155
as of 12:10 p.m. in Accra, the capital.  “Mining firms were in the market today to sell dollars,”
Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the local unit of  Barclays
Bank Plc , said in a telephone interview today.  The central bank of Africa’s second-biggest gold producer
monitors the currency market on daily basis and gives liquidity
support when it sees the need for it, Collins Antwi, assistant
director at the treasury department of the central bank, said on
July 7.  South Africa’s  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Greenwood
Village , Colorado-based Newmont Mining Corp. have mines in the
West African nation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
