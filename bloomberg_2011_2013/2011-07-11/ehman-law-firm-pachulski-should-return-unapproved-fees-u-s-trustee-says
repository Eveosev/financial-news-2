A  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) 
adviser should “disgorge” at least $8,750 in fees paid by the
defunct firm without court approval, the U.S. Trustee said.  Tracy Hope Davis, the U.S. Justice Department official who
supervises bankruptcies in the  New York  region, said in a court
filing today that she opposed Lehman’s move to expand the
services provided by law firm Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones LLP,
which “appears” to have been paid more than $6 million through
September 2010.  At the law firm, Richard Pachulski and Dean Ziehl didn’t
immediately respond to calls or e-mails seeking comment. Lehman
has paid its managers and advisers $1.3 billion since its 2008
bankruptcy.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
