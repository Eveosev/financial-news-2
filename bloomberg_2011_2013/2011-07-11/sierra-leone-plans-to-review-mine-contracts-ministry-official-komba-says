Sierra Leone  will review all
mining contracts with major companies, Emmanuel Tamba
Komba, deputy secretary of the mines ministry, said.  “The review process is to ensure all parties are
fairly treated, especially those living in the mining
communities,” he said in an interview today.  The government has already completed a review with
Koidu Holdings SA, a diamond company partly owned by
Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz.  African Minerals Ltd. (AMI) , which is developing an iron ore
deposit in Sierra Leone, won’t be affected because its
license was awarded after the decision was made to conduct
the reviews.  Sierra Rutile Ltd. mines rutile in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
