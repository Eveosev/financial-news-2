Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  is offering
to pay margin and fees for a so-called all-in payment of 174
basis points more than the London interbank offered rate to
lenders contributing the most to its $1.09 billion facility,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Proceeds from the five-year  term loan  will be used to
refinance dollar denominated debt borrowed in 2006, the person
said, asking not to be identified as details are private.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
