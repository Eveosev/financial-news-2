Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
narrowed, signaling reduced losses for refiners turning oil into
residual products. Gasoil’s crack spread widened.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian benchmark Dubai crude narrowed
31 cents to $8.95 a barrel at 11:30 a.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. On June 8, the
difference was the biggest since May 13.  High-sulfur fuel oil swaps for August gained 50 cents to
$667 a metric ton, PVM said. Prices climbed for a fourth day,
the longest rising streak since May 27. The premium of 180-
centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade rebounded 50 cents
to $9.25. This viscosity spread last week narrowed 20 percent,
the most this year, meaning bunker, or marine fuel, advanced
more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude increased
55 cents to $18.93 a barrel, according to PVM. This crack
spread, a measure of refining profit, was the widest since June
22.  August gasoil swaps rose 52 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$130.50 a barrel, the highest since June 15, PVM said. Jet
fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged for a third day at $1.05.
This regrade climbed 5 percent last week, indicating it was more
profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
up $4.67 at $97.92 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread was the widest since June 24.  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
second-half August delivery were bid at $982.50 a ton against
offers at $985.50, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte, a
broker. Prices rose every day last week to close at $984.75, the
highest since June 1.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha was at $18.50 a barrel on
July 8, from $20 at the end of the previous week, based on
Bloomberg calculations. A narrowing reforming margin shows motor
fuel has become less profitable to produce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
