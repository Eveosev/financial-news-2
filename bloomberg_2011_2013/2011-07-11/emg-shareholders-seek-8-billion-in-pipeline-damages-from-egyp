Shareholders of East Mediterranean
Gas Co. will take legal action against  Egypt , seeking more than
$8 billion in damages for interruptions in natural gas supply
through a cross-border pipeline, a company official said.  The shareholders from Israel, the U.S. and  Thailand  agreed
on the action in the wake of three explosions in the past five
months that damaged the pipeline, which carries gas from Egypt
to Israel, Nimrod Novik, a member of the EMG board, said today.
The company will pursue the claims through the International
Court of Arbitration, a dispute resolution service run by the
Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce.  “The lawyers have advised the government of Egypt as well
as the United States and other relevant governments that this
process is under way,” Novik said in a telephone interview from
his office in Herzliya, north of  Tel Aviv  .  Egypt restored gas exports to Israel last week at 20
percent of contracted amounts after a July 4 explosion disrupted
the network. Among the shareholders in EMG are Egypt National
Gas Co., Israeli businessman Yossi Maiman, U.S. billionaire Sam Zell and  PTT Pcl (PTT) , Thailand’s biggest energy company.  Ampal American Israel (AMPL)  Corp., which owns a 12.5 percent
stake in the pipeline, declined 0.2 percent to 3.10 shekels at
the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The stock has fallen 63 percent
since the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
