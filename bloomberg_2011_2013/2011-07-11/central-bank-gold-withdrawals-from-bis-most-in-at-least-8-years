Central banks withdrew about 632
metric tons of gold from deposits at the  Bank for International
Settlements  in the year ended March 31, the most in at least
eight years.  Gold deposits at the BIS fell to about 729 tons, from
1,360.7 tons the previous year, according to its annual report.
That’s the most since the year ended March 2004, when the bank
began stating gold deposits in millions of special drawing
rights. This year’s withdrawal compares with a deposit increase
of about 194.1 tons in the year ended March 2010, according to
BIS reports.  “Potential explanations include a resumption of central
bank lending to the private sector as the balance sheets of
commercial banks have improved and the fact that current low
lease rates are giving little incentive for central banks to
deposit their gold with the BIS,” said  Edel Tully , a London-
based analyst at UBS AG.  Gold deposits placed with the Basel, Switzerland-based bank
originate entirely from central banks, it said in the report. It
acts as a bank for central banks. Gold for immediate delivery
traded at $1,546.78 an ounce by 4:43 p.m. in London, 2 percent
below a record reached in May.  The cost of borrowing gold in London slipped about 87
percent since October 2008. The 12-month lease rate fell to 0.32
percent today, from 0.42 percent a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate, which was at 0.88 percent two
years ago, is derived by subtracting the gold forward offered
rate from the  London  Interbank Offered Rate.  Some of the decline in deposits may have been a shift into
off-balance sheet deposits, or if central banks pledged the
metal as collateral to other central banks, Tully said.  The Financial Times reported last week that central banks
withdrew the most gold from deposits at the BIS in at least a
decade. The BIS wasn’t able to confirm when deposit withdrawals
were last this big.  To contact the reporter on this story:
