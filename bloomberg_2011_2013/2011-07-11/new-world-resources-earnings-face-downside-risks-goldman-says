New World Resources Plc’s earnings
face “downside risks” after the largest Czech coking-coal
producer’s first-quarter profit missed estimates and the price
of the commodity peaked, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The U.S. bank rated NWR shares “neutral” with a 12-month
price estimate of 1,060 pence, analysts led by Vasily Nikolaev
in Moscow wrote in a report to clients dated today.  While coking-coal imports to  China , India and  Latin America 
help keep “tight” supply, the “price momentum is reversing as
the impact of floods in Australia is easing,” the analysts
said. Profit in the three months through March was 3 million
euros ($4.2 million), NWR said in May, missing the 21.5 million-
euro average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We do not view favorably the company’s high leverage to
coal prices, given healthy but softening seaborne coking-coal
prices,” the Goldman analysts wrote. “We see downside risks to
its 2011 earnings after weak first-quarter results.”  The stock dropped 1.8 percent to 866 pence at its 4:30 p.m.
close in  London . In Prague, NWR’s home market, it also retreated
1.8 percent to 237 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
