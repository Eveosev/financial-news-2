U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  will fall short of his deficit-reduction target
as weak economic growth fails to lift tax receipts, the Center
for Economics and Business Research said.  The London-based group said the  budget deficit  will be 54
billion pounds ($86 billion) in the fiscal year through March
2016 rather than the 29 billion pounds forecast by the
government’s budget office. Economic growth will average 1.8
percent a year by 2015, below the 2.6 percent forecast.  “I am still not sure that either the prime minister or the
chancellor fully appreciates how precarious is the country’s
economic situation in today’s changed world,” Douglas
McWilliams, chief executive of CEBR, said in an e-mailed
statement in  London  today.  CEBR said weak bank lending, slower exports and sluggish
 consumer spending  will weigh on the economy. Prime Minister
David Cameron’s Conservative-led government has staked its
reputation on being able to eliminate a structural budget
deficit within the current parliament. The cuts involve the loss
of more than 300,000 public-sector jobs and 18 billion pounds of
welfare reductions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
