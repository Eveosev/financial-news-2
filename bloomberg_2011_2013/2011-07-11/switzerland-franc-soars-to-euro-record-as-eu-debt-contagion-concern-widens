The Swiss franc strengthened to a
record against the euro as demand grew for the safest assets
amid doubts that euro-area finance ministers can calm concern
over the spreading debt crisis.  Switzerland ’s currency advanced versus all but one of 16
major peers tracked by Bloomberg as Italian bond yields jumped
to the highest since November 2000. Die Welt reported that the
 European Central Bank  is seeking to expand a fund so it could
aid Italy, while the Financial Times said European leaders may
accept a Greek default on some bonds. Equity markets fell, with
the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropping 0.9 percent.  “Realistically, euro-Swiss can go as low as it needs,”
said  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London.
There is “ongoing concern over the periphery crisis.”  The Swiss currency appreciated 1.8 percent to 1.1723 per
euro as of 4:22 p.m. in  London  after reaching 1.1672 against the
17-nation common currency. It strengthened 0.1 percent against
the dollar to 83.57 centimes and climbed as much as 1.3 percent
versus the pound to 1.3254 francs.  The franc’s appreciation against the euro has caused a
“phase of overvaluation,” the Swiss government said in a
statement on July 6. The central bank may intervene if the
strength of the currency damages economic output, it said.  Intervention in the currency market by the Zurich-based
 Swiss National Bank  is “possible, not probable,” said Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank
International in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
