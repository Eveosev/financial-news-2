The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index fell 0.4 percent to 36,359.49.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, tumbled 2.4 percent to 9.50 pesos. Cemex had its
recommendation cut to “underperform” from “outperform” at
Credit Suisse Group AG, according to an e-mailed research note.  Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB MM), the Mexican
producer of over-the-counter drugs, climbed 0.3 percent to 27.07
pesos. The stock’s 5 percent drop in the previous session wasn’t
backed up by any change in the company’s outlook and created an
“attractive buying opportunity,” Banco Santander SA wrote in
an e-mailed research note.  Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO)  , the world’s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, dropped 2.1 percent to 53.86
pesos. The company’s broadcast division reported a 5.9 percent
decline in sales in the second quarter to 5.48 billion pesos
($458 million). Second-quarter net income was 1.8 billion pesos,
even with a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
