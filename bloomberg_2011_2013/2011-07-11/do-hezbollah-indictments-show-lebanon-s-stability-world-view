Commentators in the Mideast are clashing sharply over the meaning and possible consequences of the recently issued indictment by the UN-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon established to try those responsible for the 2005 murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The indictment was sealed when sent to Lebanese officials, but according to leaks, arrest warrants were issued for four men said to be members of the powerful militant movement Hezbollah. The Shiite group successfully has raised doubts in the public's mind about the credibility of the tribunal and deflated the shock value of its alleged involvement by predicting it would be indicted. Still, the naming of Hezbollah members has sparked dire predictions that Lebanon is yet again on the brink of combustion. In an  editorial,  the London-based, Palestinian-owned Al-Quds al-Arabi, a daily generally sympathetic to Hezbollah, wrote: Hitting on a theme widely advanced by critics of the tribunal, the editorial questioned the timing of the indictment. Prosecutors first submitted an indictment in mid-January for review by a pre-trial judge and amended it three times. The final charge arrived a few days after the formation of a new Lebanese government led by billionaire Prime Minister  Najib Mikati  and just before the government was expected to release a statement of its founding principles. This “gives the impression there are international sides -- especially the  United States  and  France  -- that do not want this government to succeed,” Al-Quds al-Arabi wrote. If this proves the case, Al-Quds al-Arabi wrote, Hezbollah,  Syria  and  Iran , Hezbollah’s other backer, may be “forced to become involved in a war on Lebanese soil in particular, considering that the two countries will definitely not stand by and watch if Hezbollah is the object of an attack aimed at liquidating it as an influential power in Lebanon.” Ibrahim al-Amin,  editor-in-chief of the Beirut-based Al-Akhbar, whose commentaries are generally viewed as a reliable means of divining Hezbollah’s thinking, saw Israeli influence behind the indictment. Other commentators, however, were less exercised about the tribunal's action.  Rajeh Khoury , a columnist with Lebanon's An-Nahar daily, questioned the fuss over the timing of the indictment. Cabinet members knew that delegates from the tribunal had arrived from  The Hague  to deliver the indictment, he wrote, and so they accelerated their work on the new government's founding principles. “This means that the cabinet statement was in fact timed according to the indictment rather than the indictment chasing the statement,” he said. Elias Harfoush , a columnist in the London-based Al-Hayat, a daily owned by a leading member of the Saudi royal family, noted that accusations of bias against Lebanon's special tribunal were nothing new. The accused, he wrote, “might temporarily feel empowered over justice, but the accusations will remain. The accused will not be freed by a party, a sect or a family, only by an attorney and the judiciary." Writing in the pro-monarchy, Saudi-based Al-Watan, columnist  Muhammad Ali Al-Bridi  decried a statement by the head of Hezbollah,  Hassan Nasrallah , that none of its members would ever be brought before the tribunal. “This alone would constitute immunity for all those who belong to the party, as though they were God’s chosen ones on earth," Bridi wrote. Nasrallah, he noted, accused the tribunal of wanting to generate sectarian strife between Shiites and Sunnis, since the assassinated Hariri was an important Sunni figure. This, Bridi wrote, means anyone who disagrees with Nasrallah "is definitely an obnoxious sectarian person or an Israeli and American agent." Given the relatively healthy debate in parliament that followed the indictment and preceded the new government's (eventually successful) vote of confidence, columnist  Nabil Bou Mounsef  argued that despite the bluster of Hezbollah's supporters, Lebanese democracy might finally be strong enough to weather such an event. Writing in An-Nahar, a daily defined by its regular criticism of Hezbollah and the Syrian government, he said: Noting that such exercises in the past have triggered protracted periods of violence, not least during the 1975-1990 civil war years, Bou Mounsef argued that Lebanon now finds itself in a different place. Of course, so far the warrants for the four Hezbollah men have not been executed. The accused remain at large. What might happen if any of them are actually arrested is the subject of another tale.
