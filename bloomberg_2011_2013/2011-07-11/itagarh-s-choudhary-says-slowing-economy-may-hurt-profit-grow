Umesh Chowdhary, managing director
at  Titagarh Wagons Ltd. (TWL) , comments on the outlook for sales and
profit growth in the year ending March 31. He spoke in a phone
interview from Kolkata today.  “Our business is directly linked to the economy and if the
economy doesn’t grow then the requirement for transportation
doesn’t grow. Slow economic growth will also reduce overall
sales and profit growth. So we have to look at other options
like increasing market share or supplying more to the private
sector, which is again easier said than done.  ‘‘For passenger coaches, we have participated in some
tenders and are expecting substantial growth. There is some
delay happening in the finalization of Indian Railways’ tenders
and that is delaying the whole process.  ‘‘We have an order book of 5 billion rupees ($112.5
million) as of March 31 and at least 80 percent will be
delivered this financial year. About 60 percent to 70 percent of
our production every year goes to  Indian Railways  and remaining
to private container chain operators and third-party container
operators and logistics providers.  ‘‘Our endeavor is to maintain the same growth rate as last
year.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
