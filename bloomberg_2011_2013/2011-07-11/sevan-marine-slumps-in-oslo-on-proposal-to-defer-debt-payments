Sevan Marine ASA (SEVAN) , a Norwegian maker
of floating oil-production and storage vessels, fell the most in
six weeks in Oslo trading after proposing to defer debt interest
payments to stave off bankruptcy.  Sevan Marine slumped 28 percent to 0.48 krone at the 5:30
p.m. close, the biggest one-day decline since May 25. The stock
has dropped 93 percent this year as maintenance costs overshot
the budget.  The company plans to defer interest payments on secured
debt until at least September and convert unsecured bonds to
equity, Arendal-based Sevan Marine said today in a statement.
“The company continues to be under serious short-term liquidity
pressure,” it said.  Sevan Marine failed to complete a rights offer in May that
would have helped fund maintenance costs at its cylindrical
floating production and storage vessels, which the company
expects to reach as much as $170 million, compared with the $135
million it previously forecast.  Sevan Marine will seek to raise at least $200 million in a
share sale aimed at bondholders and a rights offer for existing
shareholders, the company said today. “No assurance can be
given that a viable global solution can be found in a timely
manner, failing which the board will be required to file for
bankruptcy,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
