RWE AG (RWE)  Chief Executive Officer
 Juergen Grossmann  told German town councils, who own about 16
percent to 20 percent of the company’s shares, that he expects
“particularly difficult” years ahead and that the government’s
decision to quit nuclear power by 2022 rather than 2036 would
cause “several billion” euros of “unexpected financial
burdens” over the coming years, the Financial Times reported,
citing Grossman speaking at a private meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
