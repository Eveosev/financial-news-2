A “special announcement”
concerning  Tiger Woods  will be made on  Golf Channel  today, the
network said on its  Twitter feed  without disclosing specifics.  Woods, 35, will sit down for an interview with Golf
Channel’s Kelly Tilghman at 11 a.m. New York time, NBC Sports
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The winner of 14 major golf championships hasn’t played in
a tournament in two months. Woods said last week that he’d skip
this week’s British Open, the season’s third major, as he
recovers from knee and ankle injuries. He said he wouldn’t
return to competition until he’s 100 percent.  Woods hasn’t won a tournament since November 2009, one
month after he claimed the last of his 71 U.S. PGA Tour
victories. He’s fallen to No. 19 in the  Official World Golf 
Ranking after holding the top spot for a record 281 weeks.  Woods has also been in the news recently because his former
doctor, Anthony Galea, pleaded guilty on July 7 to bringing
steroids and other illegal substances into the U.S. from  Canada .
Woods, treated by Galea while recovering from knee surgery in
2008, has said that he didn’t receive any performance-enhancing
drugs from the Canadian doctor.  Steve Williams , Woods’s caddie, worked for Australia’s  Adam Scott  during the  U.S. Open  and AT&T National, and is set to
carry Scott’s bag again at the July 14-17 British Open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
