Colombia ’s peso fell, ending a
three-day winning streak, as mounting concern that the euro-
region debt crisis will reduce demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  The peso slipped 0.4 percent to 1,767.71 per dollar at 9:54
a.m. New York time, from 1,760.23 on July 8. The peso has jumped
2.9 percent in the past three months, the best performance among
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The noise surrounding  Italy  is leading to declines in
currencies, including the peso, as they absorb the stress in
external markets,” said Andres Munoz, head currency trader at
financial services holding company Corp. Financiera Colombiana
in Bogota.  Austria’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said Italy will be
discussed today at the monthly gathering of euro-area finance
ministers. The regular meeting of European Union President
Herman van Rompuy and Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso 
was enlarged to include ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet,
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  and European
Economic Commissioner Olli Rehn amid speculation Italy may be
engulfed by the crisis and divisions on how to structure aid for
Greece.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.75 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price declined 0.141
centavo to 118.046 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
