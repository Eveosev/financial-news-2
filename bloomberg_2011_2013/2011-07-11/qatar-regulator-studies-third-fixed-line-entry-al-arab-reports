Qatar’s information and
communications technology regulator is studying the introduction
of a third fixed-line phone operator for the Gulf state within a
year,  Al Arab  newspaper reported, citing the agency.  The Regulatory Authority of the Supreme Council of
Information and Communication Technology, known as ictQATAR,
doesn’t see any need for a third mobile-phone operator in the
coming year, the newspaper said.  A third fixed-line operator would help improve market
competition, the newspaper said, citing the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
