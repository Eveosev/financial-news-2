The Australian dollar may fall to a
three-month low against the yen after failing to hold above a
key technical level, Gaitame.Com Research Institute Ltd. said,
citing trading patterns.  The so-called Aussie retreated from a two-month high after
the upper Bollinger band limited its upward momentum on July 8,
said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher at the unit of  Japan ’s
largest foreign-exchange margin company in  Tokyo .  “The Bollinger band has capped the Aussie’s advance and
pushed it lower,” Kawabata said. “The currency’s ascent seems
to have peaked out for now.”  The currency may drop to 84 yen, he said. That’s a support
level that the currency failed to drop below in June.  Australia’s dollar fetched 85.62 yen at 7:19 a.m. in Tokyo
from 85.53 yen in  New York  yesterday, when it fell below the 20-
day moving average. The currency reached 87.80 yen on July 8,
the most since May 11. It last traded below 84 yen on March 29.  Bollinger bands are designed to alert investors when a
security rises too high or falls too low by comparing its price
to the average level over the past 20 days. The system of
analysis was created in the 1980s by  John Bollinger . Support is
a level where analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
