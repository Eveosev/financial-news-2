Wheat and corn futures dropped as
weather conditions improved in the U.S. and parts of  Europe ,
aiding crop development, and on expectations that the U.S.
government will raise its estimates on global grain supply.  September-delivery wheat lost 1.8 percent to $6.3925 a
bushel in Chicago at 4:14 p.m. Singapore time, after a 6.4
percent rally last week. December-delivery corn slipped 0.8
percent to $6.3175 a bushel, after a 6.7 percent jump last week.  The northern plains in the U.S. may have warm temperatures
and some rain showers in the 10 days from July 8, benefiting
corn and spring-wheat crops, according to a Telvent DTN Inc.
forecast. Key corn areas of southeast Europe, south and east of
 Ukraine  and south Russia will have hotter weather this week,
after recent rains, favoring crops, it said.  “There’s a little improvement in the weather situation,”
 Michael Pitts , a commodity sales director at National Australia
Bank Ltd., said by phone from Sydney today. That may have
prompted investors to cash in gains from last week, he said.  Hedge funds  and other money managers cut their net-long
corn position by 16 percent in the week to July 5 to 190,817
futures and options contracts, the lowest in a year, according
to U.S. government data tracked by Bloomberg. Net-long positions
are the difference between bets on price advances and declines.  Global Inventories  Global corn inventories will probably be 121.77 million
metric tons before the next U.S. harvest, higher than the 117.44
million ton forecast by the Department of Agriculture last month,
according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Wheat stockpiles will probably total 187.73
million tons, compared with USDA’s 187.12 million ton forecast.  The U.S., the world’s largest corn and wheat exporter, is
forecast to produce about 39 percent of the global corn harvest,
and is estimated to ship about 23 percent of the global trade in
wheat in 2011-2012, according to the USDA.  Russia ’s wheat exports may reach 10.5 million tons of wheat
in the marketing year that began May 1, up from an estimated 4.2
million last year during a drought, according to the  Foreign
Agricultural Service  of the USDA. That’s higher than the 10
million tons estimated in last month’s report of the USDA’s
World Agricultural Outlook Board last month.  The USDA board, which approves the monthly world
agricultural supply and demand report, will release its latest
forecast tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Soybeans for November delivery gained as much as 0.8
percent to $13.5675 a bushel in Chicago, before declining 0.5
percent to $13.4025 a bushel.  -- With assistance from Jeff Wilson and Whitney McFerron in
