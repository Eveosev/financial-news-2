Italian and Spanish bonds tumbled
and German bund yields sank to a more than seven-month low as
contagion from  Greece ’s debt crisis threatened to spread to
bigger economies, stoking demand for the safest assets.  Ten-year Italian yields soared to the highest in 10 years.
The spreads investors demand to hold Italian, Portuguese and
Spanish debt over bunds widened to euro-era records. German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said “there’s no discussion
whatsoever” of doubling the European Union’s rescue facility
after Die Welt reported yesterday that the European Central Bank
is seeking to increase the pool to 1.5 trillion euros ($2.11
trillion) to cover an Italian crisis.  “There’s pronounced risk-off sentiment,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income analyst at WestLB AG in London. “You
can clearly see the market is worried. We are seeing a self-
fulfilling prophecy, where yields increase due to contagion and
then the market gets worried about the high funding costs, as do
the rating agencies.”  Yields on 10-year Italian bonds increased for a sixth day,
climbing 41 basis points to 5.71 percent, the most since 2000.
The spread over German bunds widened to 303 basis points, a
euro-era record. Spanish 10-year yields climbed 36 basis points
to 6.04 percent, expanding the spread over German debt to as
high as 339 basis points.  Record Spread  Portugal ’s 10-year yield climbed 46 basis points to 13.39
percent, sending the spread over German bunds to as much as
1,071 basis points, or 10.71 percentage points.  Ten-year bund yields were 15 basis points lower at 2.68
percent as of 4:56 p.m. in London, after touching 2.65 percent,
the lowest since Nov. 26, as investors sought the safest assets.
Two-year German note yields declined 19 basis points to 1.26
percent after reaching 1.24 percent, the least since Jan. 25.  European stocks fell for a second day, the euro sank to a
seven-week low against the dollar and 10-year Treasuries yielded
the least this month as investors favored the safest assets.  “Contagion risk is increasing rapidly,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole SA in
London. “The market’s concern is that if  Europe  can’t display
unity on Greece, then how is it going to manage to deal with
Italy, which has a much larger debt burden? The current rescue
package is nowhere near big enough to cover an economy the size
of Italy.”  Ministers Clash  European finance chiefs clashed over how to get private
bondholders to maintain their exposure to Greek debt in a way
that doesn’t prompt credit-rating companies to declare a formal
default. A new package for Greece on top of the 110 billion
euros pledged last year hinges on the EU finding a formula for
getting investors to roll over Greek debt holdings so that
governments don’t have to pick up the tab when bonds come due
between 2012 and 2014.  Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter told reporters
before a crisis meeting in Brussels today that forcing
bondholder participation would be “fatal.” A lunchtime crisis-
management session including European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy ,  European Central Bank  President  Jean-Claude Trichet  and
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  preceded the
regular ministerial meeting.  EU leaders are prepared to accept a Greek default on some
obligations, the Financial Times said yesterday citing unnamed
senior officials.  Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps protecting Italian bonds rose 28.5
basis points to an all-time high of 279.5, while contracts on
Greece climbed 102 basis points to 2,275, Ireland increased 52
basis points to 972 and Portugal surged 40 basis points to
1,080, also records, CMA prices show.  Two-year Italian yields rose to a more-than two-and-a-half
year high as the nation’s financial-market regulator moved to
curb short selling after the benchmark FTSE MIB index plunged
3.5 percent on July 8. The slide was led by UniCredit SpA and
other bank shares, which are among the largest holders of
 Italy ’s debt.  The gap between Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields
narrowed to 35 basis points, the least since November. The
spread was 49 basis points a week ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on two-year Spanish bonds surged 48 basis points to
4.25 percent, the first time the yield has exceeded 4 percent
since September 2008. The spread, or yield difference, between
Belgian 10-year bonds and similar maturity German bunds widened
34 basis points to a euro-era record of 161 basis points.  Greek Yields  Greek 10-year bond yields increased 16 basis points to
17.02 percent, widening the spread or yield difference over
similar maturity German bunds to as much as 1,437 basis points.
Two-year Greek yields surged as much as 124 basis points to a
euro-era record of 31.62 percent.  Irish 10-year bonds fell for a fourth straight day, lifting
yields as much as 47 basis points to a euro-era record of 13.38
percent. Two-year Irish note yields also climbed to a record
18.44 percent.  The  ECB  is seeking advice from banks on what to do in the
event of a sovereign default in the euro area,  Handelsblatt 
reported, without saying where it got the information. The
newspaper said the ECB has written to “more than five”
financial institutions in recent days, requesting that they
apply to act as advisers.  Italy is the euro region’s biggest bond market, with 1.8
trillion euros of outstanding debt as of Dec. 31, compared with
1.1 trillion euros of German debt outstanding on March 31,
according to websites from the nations’ debt agencies.  The Mediterranean country plans to sell securities maturing
in 2016, 2017, 2023 and 2026 on July 14. It hasn’t said how much
it plans to sell. Greece will auction 1.25 billion euros of 26-
week Treasury bills on tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
