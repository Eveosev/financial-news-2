Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s son,
Saif al-Islam, said his father’s government is in talks with
 France , the Algerian El-Khabar newspaper said today.  The Libyan regime is negotiating with France and not with
rebels, who are battling the Libyan leader, El-Khabar quoted
Qaddafi’s son as saying in an  interview .  Qaddafi also said that a Libyan envoy to Paris had received
a message from French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  saying that once
an agreement had been forged between France and his father’s
administration, the French would then force the rebel’s National
Transitional Council to agree to a ceasefire, El-Khabar said.  If France wants to sign oil deals with Libya and wants its
companies to return to the country, then it would have to talk
to the Qaddafi government, El-Khabar cited Qaddafi’s son as
saying. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization started military
strikes against Qaddafi’s forces in late March to aid rebels
seeking to topple him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
