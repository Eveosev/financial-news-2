Japanese stocks fell by the most in
two weeks as U.S. unemployment unexpectedly increased, clouding
the outlook for the global economic recovery and for earnings at
the country’s exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which counts  North America  as its
largest market, dropped 0.7 percent after U.S. payrolls grew at
the slowest pace in nine months.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
gets more than 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan, slipped
1.4 percent after the yen strengthened.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) 
plunged 13 percent on record trading volume after the maker of
memory chips said it will sell 79.7 billion yen ($987 million)
in shares and convertible bonds.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.7 percent to 10,069.53
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index slid 0.5
percent to 870.16. Both gauges fell by the most since June 27.  “The unemployment data was pretty bad and it was a shock
to the market,” said Takashi Aoki, who helps oversee about $2.2
billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo .  The Topix rose eight times out of the past 10 trading days,
recovering about two-thirds of its losses since the March 11
earthquake, as manufacturers including Toyota restart factories
ahead of schedule. In the last month, the Topix has been the
best performer among the world’s 10 biggest stock indexes,
rising 6.5 percent.  Stocks also declined following a report showing inflation
in  China , Japan’s biggest export market, accelerated to a three-
year high of 6.4 percent in June. Some analysts said price gains
may moderate in the second half of the year.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.7 percent
today. The index dropped 0.7 percent on July 8 as the weakest
U.S. job growth in nine months hurt companies most-closely tied
to the economy.  U.S. Payrolls  U.S. payrolls increased by 18,000 in June, less than the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists, which called for growth of 105,000 on average. The
jobless rate rose to a 2011 high of 9.2 percent.  Toyota fell 0.7 percent to 3,420 yen. Honda Motor Co.,
Japan’s second-largest carmaker, slid 0.3 percent to 3,250 yen.
Canon dropped 1.4 percent to 3,865 yen.  Declines were limited ahead of a second-quarter earnings
season in the U.S. that starts today with  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , a
bellwether for the global economy. Profit at the world’s largest
aluminum producer probably increased to 34 cents per share in
the three months ended June 30, up from 13 cents a year earlier,
buoyed by higher aluminum prices, according to analyst estimates.  Cautious Stance  “The argument has been that, although the job market is
weak, earnings have been good, so it will be a shock if we get
negative news in the earnings department, as well,” Mizuho
Asset Management’s Aoki said. “Some investors are going to be
cautious right now.”  Trading volume was thin in Tokyo ahead of U.S. earnings
reports. The value of stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange’s first section totaled 1.01 trillion yen, less than
this year’s full-day average of 1.45 trillion yen.  U.S. corporate profits are forecast to have grown by 13
percent in the second quarter, the smallest increase in two
years, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Japanese exporters declined today after the yen appreciated
to 80.51 against the dollar, compared with 81.27 at the close of
 stock trading  in Tokyo on July 8. Against the euro,  Japan ’s
currency strengthened to 114.40 from 116.55, a level not seen
since June 27. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters because
it cuts the value of overseas sales.  Elpida Plunges  The euro fell to a two-week low against the yen amid
concern  Italy  may be engulfed in the region’s sovereign debt
crisis. The  European Central Bank  is seeking to expand the euro-
rescue fund to include help for Italy, Die Welt reported, citing
unidentified “high-ranking” people at central banks.  Elpida, Japan’s sole maker of computer-memory chips,
plummeted 13 percent to 787 yen, the steepest slide since
September 2009. The company plans to raise as much as 52.2
billion yen selling shares and 27.5 billion yen through
convertible bonds, according to filings with Japan’s finance
ministry today. Elpida will use the money to fund investments
and pay off debt, according to a document. Reuters earlier
reported the company was preparing to announce the sale.  Tokyo Electron, Seiko  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035)  sank 2.9 percent to 4,435 yen after
saying orders declined. Bookings for tools used to make
semiconductors and flat-panel screens fell 34 percent to 120
billion yen in the three months ended June from in the preceding
quarter.  Seiko Epson Corp. (6724) , a maker of printers and watches,
retreated 2.5 percent to 1,352 yen. Operating profit fell 60
percent to about 4 billion yen in the April-June period, as
production of ink-jet printers and electronic parts slumped
after the earthquake disaster in March, the Nikkei newspaper
reported without citing anyone.  Among stocks that advanced, Tokyo Electric Power Co. rose
7.3 percent to 441 yen after the Wall Street Journal reported
Japan’s government has shelved a plan to sell the utility’s
transmission assets to avoid panicking financial markets and to
maintain the utility as a viable company.  Ryohin Keikaku Co., operator of the Muji retail chain,
leapt 6.9 percent to 4,185 yen, after the company raised its
first-half profit forecast by 55 percent.  K’s Holdings Corp. (8282) , an electrical appliance shop operator,
advanced 4.6 percent to 3,885 yen, a record high since moving
its listing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange in February 2001. The
company had its share-price target boosted to 4,100 yen from
3,700 yen at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
