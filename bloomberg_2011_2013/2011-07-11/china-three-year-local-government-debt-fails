China ’s finance ministry failed to
sell all of the three-year debt offered at an auction on behalf
of local governments as a cash crunch curbed demand.  The ministry sold 23.9 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) of bonds
at a yield of 3.93 percent on behalf of 11 provinces and
municipalities, falling short of its 25 billion yuan target,
said a trader at a  finance company  required to bid at the
auction. The  Shanghai  interbank offered rate, or Shibor, for
three-month yuan loans, was fixed at 6.24 percent today, near a
record high of 6.46 percent reached on June 28.  “While the interbank borrowing cost is so high, investors
won’t spend money on local government debt,” said Huang Yanhong,
a bond analyst at Bank of Nanjing Co. in Nanjing. “Demand is
low also because the debt’s secondary-market trading isn’t
active. After you buy it, you can only hold it till maturity.”  Demand for debt is also cooling after the central bank
raised its benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates last
week for the third time this year to help stem gains in consumer
prices. Inflation accelerated to a three-year high of 6.4
percent in June, from 5.5 percent in May, the statistics bureau
said on July 9.  Last week, the  finance ministry  failed to sell all of the
bonds offered at an auction of 182-day bills. The ministry also
sold less debt than planned at a June 17 auction of one-year
notes, and sales of 182-day bills and one-year bonds on May 13.  Local Government Debt  The central government will sell 200 billion yuan of bonds
on behalf of local authorities this year. Today’s auction was
the first involving this type of debt in 2011 and 25.4 billion
yuan of five-year notes were sold at a yield of 3.84 percent.  The finance ministry in January published a list of 59
underwriters required to bid at its debt sales, including
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,
China Citic Bank Corp., Postal Savings Bank of China, Industrial
Bank Co., Guotai Junan Securities Co. and BOC International
