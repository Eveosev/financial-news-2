Gold climbed to a two-week high,
topping $1,550 an ounce, on demand for a store of value amid
escalating concerns that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes will
widen.  European equities tumbled the most in seven weeks, led by
banks and insurers, as contagion from Greece’s debt crisis
threatened to spread to Italy and Spain. Gold priced in euros
and the U.K. pound climbed to records. The metal gained 4
percent last week on signs that U.S. interest rates will remain
low.  “Concerns over unresolved debt issues in the monetary
union continue to haunt investors,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in  London , said in a report. “A
prolonged period of ultra-low currency yields and persistently
dovish tone from the  Federal Reserve  will likely be supportive”
for gold, he said.  Gold futures for August delivery rose $7.60, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $1,549.20 at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the commodity reached $1,557.60, the highest
price since June 22. The metal climbed to a record $1,577.40 on
May 2, partly on demand for a hedge against accelerating
inflation.  The  European Central Bank  on July 7 increased its benchmark
interest rate to the highest since March 2009 to stem inflation.
In June, consumer prices in  China  rose the most in three years.  “Inflation will continue to be a big problem globally and
this will keep gold prices supported,” said Chi Duofeng, an
analyst at Bohai Futures Co. in Changchun, China. “We remain
bullish on gold for at least the rest of the year as the global
macro-economic picture isn’t encouraging.”  Silver, palladium and platinum, which have wider industrial
uses, dropped as copper and other base metals slid.  On the Comex, silver futures for September delivery dropped
84.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $35.698 an ounce.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell $11.50, or
1.5 percent, to $767.45 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Platinum futures for October delivery dropped $5.10,
or 0.3 percent, to $1,728.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
