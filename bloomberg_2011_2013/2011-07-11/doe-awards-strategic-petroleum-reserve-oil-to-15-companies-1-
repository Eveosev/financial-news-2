The Energy Department awarded 28
contracts to 15 companies for the purchase of 30.64 million
barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
according to an e-mailed statement.  The Energy Department is coordinating with the companies,
the Maritime Administration and the Department of  Homeland
Security  to “streamline deliveries, including those for
companies that have requested early delivery of the crude oil in
July 2011,” the government said.  About 25 million barrels of SPR crude were awarded for
delivery by vessel. A buyer of the oil who wants to store it or
send it to refineries on the East Coast may require a waiver of
the Jones Act that restricts the shipment of goods between U.S.
ports to American-flagged vessels, which are in short supply.  Refiners that were awarded oil included  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) ,  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) , Shell Trading Company,  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) ,  Murphy
Oil Corp. (MUR)  Marathon Petroleum Co., Exxon Mobil Corp.,
ConocoPhillips and  BP Plc. (BP) , according to a  list  on an Energy
Department website.  Contracts were also granted to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
trading companies Trafigura AG and Hess Energy Trading Co., and
terminal and pipeline operator  Plains All American Pipeline LP. (PAA)   The companies were named on July 1 in a listing of
“apparently successful” offers. The “offerors” were then
required to provide a letter of credit within five business days
as a guarantee of performance and payment, according to an
Energy Department document outlining the sales process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
