Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  won’t sell its
stake in  News Corp. (NWS)  after the media company shut a newspaper
amid phone-hacking claims.  “My confidence in  News Corp. (NWSA) , in  Rupert Murdoch  and James
Murdoch is unshaken completely,” Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al
Saud said in a telephone interview today. “We will sell
nothing. We are standing by our friends.”  Kingdom holds a 7 percent stake in News Corp., making the
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia-based company the second-largest
shareholder after the Murdoch family. News Corp. shares have
declined about 10 percent since the decision to close the News
of the World was announced on July 7.  Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. published the final issue of
the 168-year-old Sunday tabloid on July 10, after allegations
that its journalists listened to voice mails of murder victims
and their families and paid police officers for stories.  “In a media empire like this, which is in five continents
of the world, inevitably you will have sometimes issues and
problems,” Alwaleed said. “This problem is really at the level
of News of the World newspaper only. We can’t have this be
contagious and affect all the empire. The reputation was
affected, but it was not affected irreparably.”  The prince’s backing was reported earlier today by Reuters.
