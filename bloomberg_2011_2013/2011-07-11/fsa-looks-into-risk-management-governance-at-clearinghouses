Clearinghouses are likely to see
greater scrutiny of their risk-management governance and
organizational structure as the U.K. financial regulator seeks
to cut the risks they pose to the financial system.  The U.K. Financial Services Authority is looking into the
model central counterparties use to calculate the funds traders
must give them as a buffer, the regulator  said  today on its
website.  The FSA, which previously said it will adopt “a more
intrusive approach” is reviewing credit risk management
practices at central counterparties as their use grows. Scrutiny
of clearinghouses has mounted even as European and U.S.
regulators promote greater transparency in the over-the-counter
 derivatives market .  “The clearing market is undergoing a period of substantial
change,” the FSA wrote in its guidance paper. “Both
market participants and regulators have indicated a desire to
increase the scale and scope of financial instruments cleared
through central counterparties. Further, increased industry
competition and consolidation continues to play a fundamental
role in defining the shape of the clearing industry.”  By acting as the central counterparty to every buy and sell
order they process, a clearinghouse reduces the risk that could
result if a trading firm defaults on its obligation in a
transaction. Clearinghouses are funded by their members, who
must meet  capital requirements  and pass operational and
technology tests.  To contact the reporters on this story:
