U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May
reduced the official threat level from international terrorism
to “substantial” from “severe.”  “This means that a terrorist attack is a strong
possibility and might well occur without further warning,” May
said in an e-mailed statement today. “The change in the threat
level to substantial does not mean the overall threat has gone
away -- there remains a real and serious threat against the
 United Kingdom  and I would ask the public to remain vigilant.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
