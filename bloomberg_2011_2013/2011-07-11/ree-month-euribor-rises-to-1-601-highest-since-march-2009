The rate at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for three months rose to
the highest level in more than two years, according to the
European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, advanced for a
tenth consecutive day, adding 0.8 basis point to 1.601 percent
today, EBF data showed. That’s the highest level since March 18,
2009.  The  European Central Bank  raised borrowing costs on July 7
for the second time this year, increasing its main refinancing
rate by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent. That’s the highest since
March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
