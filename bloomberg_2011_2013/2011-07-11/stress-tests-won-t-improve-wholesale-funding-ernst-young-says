Europe ’s stress tests on banks won’t
reassure lenders enough to improve wholesale funding because the
“adverse” scenario they apply doesn’t include a potential
sovereign default, Ernst & Young said.  The tests “will not significantly dampen  risk aversion  in
wholesale funding markets,” Ernst & Young said in a report
released today by e-mail. The results are unlikely to drive a
wide-scale recapitalization of southern banking systems that
would reassure investors, it said.  European regulators will try to end the region’s banking
crisis by forcing 91 institutions to publish details of capital
shortfalls on July 15 and giving them six months to plug any
gaps. The European Banking Association has toughened the review
from last year’s round of tests by tightening its definition of
bank capital and forcing firms to disclose more about their
holdings of  government bonds .  “It appears that the tests will largely be conducted on
the same basis” as last year’s, said Ernst & Young.
“Crucially, the ‘adverse’ scenario still does not consider a
European sovereign debt default,” it said.  The bank-by-bank basis of the methodology overlooks the
potential for negative interactions between banks and the
broader economy, as reduced lending weakens growth, in turn
deteriorating the quality of banks’ assets, Ernst & Young said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
