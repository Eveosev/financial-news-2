Thomas A. Doyle, a convicted art
thief, pleaded guilty to one count of  wire fraud  in connection
with the purchase of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot’s “Portrait of
a Girl” painting, U.S. prosecutors said.  Doyle, 53, pleaded guilty today to one count of wire fraud
in a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz in New
York, according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney’s office in
 Manhattan .  Prosecutors said Doyle told an investor that they would buy
the painting together for $1.1 million. The investor contributed
$880,000, more than the $775,000 Doyle actually paid, according
to prosecutors. Doyle kept the additional $105,000, which he
used to buy a Ferrari, according to the charges filed against
him in January.  Doyle faces as long as 20 years in prison when he’s
sentenced Oct. 11.  In a written plea agreement, both sides said federal
sentencing guidelines, which aren’t binding, call for a term of
30 months to 37 months in prison. Doyle pleaded guilty in 2007
to stealing a sculpture by Edgar Degas.  As part of the plea agreement, Doyle will forfeit his
interest in the Corot painting and a red 1993 Ferrari Mondial T
Cabriolet.  Donald DuBoulay, a lawyer for Doyle, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment after regular
business hours.  The case is U.S. v. Doyle, 11-cr-00036, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
