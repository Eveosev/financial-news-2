Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) , a
Nigerian lender bailed out two years ago, rose the most in four
months after agreeing with  Access Bank Plc (ACCESS)  on terms “to create
one of  Africa ’s largest financial institutions.”  The stock gained 5 kobo, or 5 percent, the most since March
14, to 1.06 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, reducing its
decline this year to 51 percent. Access Bank shares were
unchanged at 7 naira.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  has approved an implementation
plan worked out by both parties, the lenders said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “Consequently, the parties will now commence the process
of a scheme of arrangement” that will be subject to approval by
shareholders, regulators and the courts, the lenders said.  Intercontinental Bank is one of eight lenders bailed out by
the central bank in 2009 with the injection of 620 billion naira
($4.1 billion) following a financial crisis that threatened the
country’s banking industry. Eight of the lenders’ chief
executive officers were fired and the central bank called for
interested parties to bid for stakes in the banks. The central
bank has set a deadline of Sept. 30 for the recapitalization of
the banks.  The announcement is “positive” for Nigeria’s banking
sector, Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based analyst with  Renaissance
Capital , said in an e-mailed note to clients today. “The
deadlines are in place and we want to see mergers and
acquisitions going through and this is moving closer to being a
fact.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
