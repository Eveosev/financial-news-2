Middle East crude for sale to  Asia 
fell on signs that supplies may be ample as  Saudi Arabia  kept
their long-term exports unchanged for August and  China ’s June
imports declined.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped 20 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $110.91 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September fell 0.4 percent to $110.45. Murban
declined 0.4 percent to $114.75.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s largest state-owned oil
company, will supply full contracted volumes of crude to Asian
refiners in August, according to three refinery officials. Saudi
officials pledged to provide more oil to refiners after a June 8
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
failed to agree to raise output.  Extra supplies of oil may also be available as data
released by the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed
net crude imports fell 10 percent in June from the month before.
The country took in about 4.7 million barrels a day, the lowest
since October.  Oman futures for September delivery declined $1.23 to
$111.22 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:37 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,236 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $108.91 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, widened 3
cents to $6.33 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined-products broker in  London .
The exchange for swaps for September fell 3 cents to $5.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
