South African bonds fell before
tomorrow’s debt auction, snapping a five-day rally as concern
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis may spread sapped demand for
high-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  will auction 1.5 billion
rand ($220.3 million) of 7.25 percent notes maturing in 2020 and
600 million rand of 7 percent securities due 2033 at its weekly
sale, it said in an announcement on Bloomberg. The 2020 bonds
dropped 38 cents to 93.53 rand today, raising borrowing costs by
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.327 percent by
3:57 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Italian and Spanish bonds tumbled and German bund yields
sank to a seven-month low as contagion from  Greece ’s debt crisis
threatened to spread to bigger economies, stoking demand for the
safest assets. The extra yield investors demand to buy South
African 10-year bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  widened 13 basis
points to 5.44 percentage points.  Given “generally higher levels of  risk aversion , local
bonds may struggle in the week ahead,” Tradition Analytics
researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw said in
a research note. “This could translate into a lower cover ratio
and weaker demand” at tomorrow’s auction, they wrote.  Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.,  South Africa ’s state-owned
electricity company, is auctioning 300 million rand of 12- and
15-year debt on July 13, which may also sap demand for
government debt, Tradition wrote.  Forward-Rate Agreements  Foreign investors were net buyers of 4.6 billion rand of
South African bonds last week, helping spur a five-day rally
that drove yields to the lowest in more than a month, as traders
pared bets the central bank will raise  interest rates  this year
to tame inflation prompted by rising fuel and food prices. The
country’s consumer price index rose to 4.6 percent in May, from
4.2 percent the previous month, Statistics South Africa said on
June 22.  Forward-rate agreements starting in December, which
investors use to lock in borrowing costs, dropped two basis
points today to 5.90 percent, indicating that traders see less
chance of an interest-rate increase in November. The contracts
have declined from this year’s high of 6.23 percent reached on
May 23.  Tomorrow’s auction starts at 11 a.m. and results will be
announced at about 11:30 a.m., the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
