The Securities Investor Protection
Corp. opposed a request by the owners of the  New York  Mets
baseball team to dismiss a $1 billion suit by the trustee
liquidating Bernard Madoff’s firm.  The trustee,  Irving Picard , is suing Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz and their firm, Sterling Equities, seeking the return of
$700 million in principal and $300 million in profit from
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Picard claims the team’s owners had a
duty to investigate “red flags” warning of possible fraud.  SIPC today asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in
Manhattan to let the suit go forward, arguing that Picard has
the legal authority to pursue the claim.  Rakoff agreed this month to review the case, which Picard
filed last year in  bankruptcy court . He said judges have
struggled with the duty of inquiry into fraud for more than half
a century and the duty may not have applied to the Mets owners.  The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
