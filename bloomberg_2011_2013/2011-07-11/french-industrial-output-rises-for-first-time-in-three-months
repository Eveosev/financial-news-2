French industrial output rose for
the first time in three months in May, national statistics
office Insee said.  Output from factories, mines and utilities climbed 2
percent from April, when it fell a revised 0.5 percent, Paris-
based Insee said today. Economists forecast a 0.5 percent
increase, according to the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. Insee originally reported that April output dropped
0.3 percent.
