Chicago gasoline rose as  BP Plc (BP) ’s
Whiting refinery in Indiana reported a leak and  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
kept its Wood River, Illinois, plant at reduced rates.  Conoco’s 380,900-barrel-a-day refinery remains at lower
production levels following a June 25 power disruption, Rich Johnson, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail today.  BP’s Indiana plant reported a pinhole-sized leak yesterday,
said Elijah Cole, deputy director of the Lake County Emergency
Management Agency. The hole caused a light  oil spill  at the
420,000-barrel-a-day refinery, he said.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
narrowed 0.13 cent to 8.13 cents a gallon versus futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:35 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) ’s Coffeyville refinery in Kansas had a
compressor shut down July 6, according to a city official.  The refinery expected to receive a replacement part for the
compressor today, said the official, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
