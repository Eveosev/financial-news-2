Paranapanema SA, a Brazilian copper
smelter, fell the most since December 2010 in Sao Paulo as
speculation diminished that miner  Vale SA (VALE3)  will make a new
takeover bid.  Paranapanema dropped 7.3 percent to 5.45 reais at the 4:15
p.m. New York time close. The stock had surged 30 percent in the
two weeks ended July 8 amid bets Vale would make a new offer,
after a failed September bid of 6.75 reais a share.  Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, said in a
filing today it had agreed to abandon its offer for African
copper miner Metorex Ltd., paving the way for a rival bid to win
control. Investors may be betting that Vale is now seeking fewer
acquisitions, damping the prospects for a deal with
Paranapanema, said  Pedro Galdi , an analyst at Sao Paulo-based
brokerage SLW Corretora.  “There’s a connection: maybe if it gives up on Metorex,
it’s going to give up on Paranapanema -- it’s all speculation,”
Galdi said in a telephone interview. “The valuable assets for
Vale are in mining, though a smelter would also be useful.”  Vale, in an e-mailed statement, declined to comment on the
possibility of a new takeover bid. A press official at an
outside agency representing Paranapanema said in an e-mail that
the company doesn’t comment on market speculation and is unaware
of anything that could justify an unusual share move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
