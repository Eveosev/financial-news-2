Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s largest
drugmaker, accused Apotex Inc. in a lawsuit of infringing two
U.S. patents for the nerve-pain drug  Lyrica .  Apotex, based in Toronto, plans to market a generic version
of Lyrica before the newest patent expires in 2018, Pfizer said
in a complaint filed July 8 in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware. Pfizer claimed it “will be substantially and
irreparably harmed” by the alleged infringement.  Lyrica generated more than $800 million in sales in the
first quarter for New York-based Pfizer, which is selling units
and trimming jobs in preparation for pending loss of patent
protection for its best-selling drug Lipitor, used to control
cholesterol.  Elie Betito, a spokesman for closely held Apotex, didn’t
immediately return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the filing.  Pfizer fell 3 cents to $20.13 at 9:44 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 15 percent
this year before today.  The case is Pfizer Inc. v. Apotex Inc., U.S. District
Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 6,197,819 and 5,563,175.  To contact the reporter on this story:
