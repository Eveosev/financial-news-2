Taiwan ’s bonds gained and the
currency declined as weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs growth added
to signs the global economic recovery is losing traction,
boosting demand for government debt and the greenback.  Taiwan’s dollar extended last week’s decline after Labor
Department data showed payrolls increased by 18,000 in June,
less than the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey for
105,000. Foreign investors sold $214 million more Taiwanese
shares than they bought today, the most since June 16, according
to exchange data.  “The U.S. job data was quite disappointing, some investors
were buying safer assets such as bonds,” said Ivy Leung, a
Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Polaris Securities Co.  The yield on Taiwan’s 2 percent government bonds due July
2016, the most-traded of the securities, was at 1.163 percent as
of 4:40 p.m. in Taipei from 1.167 percent on July 8, prices from
Gretai Securities Market show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. The government will auction NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of
five-year debt on July 15.  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.2 percent to NT$28.866 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, was at 0.370 percent, little changed from July 8,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
