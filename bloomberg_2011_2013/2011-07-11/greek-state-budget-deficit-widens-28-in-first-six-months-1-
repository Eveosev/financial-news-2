Greece ’s central-government deficit
widened 28 percent in the first half of the year as both revenue
and spending missed targets set out in the 2011 budget plan.  The shortfall, which excludes outlays by state-owned
institutions and companies, increased to 12.8 billion euros ($18
billion) from 10 billion euros a year earlier, preliminary data
released today by the Athens-based  Finance Ministry  showed.  Ordinary spending increased 8.8 percent between January and
June to 33.2 billion euros, compared with a budget target of
31.9 billion euros, the ministry said. Net revenue decreased 8.3
percent to 21.8 billion euros, missing the budget plan’s goal by
3.3 billion euros.  The ministry blamed the drop on a deeper-than-forecast
recession that hit revenue and an increase in rebates to people
who paid too much tax in 2010.  Final central-government data are due on July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
