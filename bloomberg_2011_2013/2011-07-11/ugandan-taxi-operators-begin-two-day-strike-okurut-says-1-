Ugandan taxi operators have started
a two-day strike in the capital, Kampala, over high duties,
bringing transportation to a standstill, said Information
Minister Mary Karooro Okurut.  Leaders representing drivers and conductors backtracked on
an agreement last night to call off the strike ahead of talks
with Vice President Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi and a separate
meeting with President Yoweri Museveni tomorrow, Okurut said in
a telephone interview from Kampala today.  The taxi operators are protesting high duties levied by the
Uganda Taxi Operators and Drivers Association, a private entity
contracted to manage commuter taxi operations in Kampala, Okurut
said. The Ugandan government is taking the strike seriously and
is seeking to restore transportation because the taxis are
widely used for travel in the capital, said Okurut.  Retail traders went on strike last week in Kampala over the
impact that accelerating inflation and a weakening currency are
having on their businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
