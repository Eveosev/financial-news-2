What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that a slump
in Chinese imports and an increase in U.S. unemployment indicate
lower demand, said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Wheat futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as  India  and Russia increase exports, Grow said.
The dollarâ€™s rally also reduced investment demand for
commodities, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago as imports by China decline, Grow said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound lower
amid rising Malaysian palm-oil inventories, and soybean-meal
futures may open down $2 to $3 per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
