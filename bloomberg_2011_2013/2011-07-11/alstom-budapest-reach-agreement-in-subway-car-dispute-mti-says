Alstom SA (ALO) , the world’s second-
largest trainmaker by revenue, reached an agreement with
Budapest in a dispute over a 70 billion forint ($373 million)
contract to supply subway cars for the Hungarian capital,  MTI 
reported without citing anyone.  The Budapest city council will discuss the agreement on
July 14 and the two sides may sign the agreement next week, the
state-funded news service said.  The Levallois-Perret, France-based company won the contract
for 44 new air-conditioned, 100-meter (328 feet) subway trains
in 2006. Alstom failed to obtain a regulatory permit for the
vehicles after the cars didn’t meet requirements for the quality
of braking systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
