Rory McIlroy will be paired with
three-time major winner Ernie Els and American Rickie Fowler in
the first two rounds of golf’s  British Open .  The trio will start the July 14 first round at Royal St.
George’s in Sandwich, England, at 9:09 a.m. local time and will
tee off at 2:10 p.m. the next day.  McIlroy will be playing for the first time since winning
last month’s U.S. Open, where he set 12 tournament records. The
22-year-old from  Northern Ireland  finished tied for third last
year at St. Andrews, Scotland, eight shots behind winner  Louis Oosthuizen  of South Africa.  Els won the 2002 Open at Muirfield in Scotland and has
finished in the top 10 at golf’s oldest major championship 12
times since his professional debut in 1992.  Oosthuizen will play his first two rounds with four-time
major winner  Phil Mickelson , whose best finish at the tournament
was third in 2004, and U.S. PGA Champion Martin Kaymer of
Germany.  England’s Luke Donald, No. 1 in the  Official World Golf
Ranking  and the winner of last week’s Scottish Open on the
European Tour, will be paired with Spain’s Sergio Garcia and Ryo Ishikawa of Japan.  Second-ranked Lee Westwood of England will be grouped with
American Steve Stricker, who won his third straight title at the
U.S. PGA Tour’s John Deere Classic yesterday, and Masters winner
Charl Schwartzel of South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
