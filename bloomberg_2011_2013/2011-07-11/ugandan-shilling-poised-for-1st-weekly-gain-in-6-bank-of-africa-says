Uganda ’s shilling is poised for its
first weekly gain versus the dollar in six as companies prepare
to make their monthly value-added tax payments to the
government, Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd. said.  “Corporates are expected to pay VAT” this week, Ahmed
Kalule, a trader at the bank, said in an interview from Kampala,
the capital, today. “They are forced to sell dollars to meet
their tax obligation.”  The shilling weakened for a fifth day, declining 0.2
percent to 2,615 per dollar as of 3:34 p.m. local time, erasing
an earlier advance of as much as 0.2 percent. The currency has
retreated 12 percent against the dollar this year, the biggest
drop of any African currency, as inflation surged to a 17-year
high.  Foreign buyers could also buy shillings if they participate
in a 75 billion-shilling ($29 million) sale of Treasury bills by
the central bank on July 13, Kalule said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
