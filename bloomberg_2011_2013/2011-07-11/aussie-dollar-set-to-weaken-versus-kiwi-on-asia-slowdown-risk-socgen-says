Australia ’s dollar is poised to
weaken against its New Zealand counterpart because the so-called
Aussie is “particularly at risk of an Asian slowdown,” Societe
Generale SA said.  “Rate expectations in New Zealand have already adjusted
following the Christchurch earthquake, while the same is yet to
happen in Australia,”  Sebastien Galy , a foreign-exchange
strategist in London, wrote in an investor report today.  The Australian dollar was little changed versus the so-
called kiwi dollar, at 1.2818 as of 12:18 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
