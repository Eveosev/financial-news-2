Carlyle Croup, the Washington-based
private-equity firm gearing up for an initial public offering,
received a commitment of as much as $750 million from the
Municipal Employees’ Retirement System of  Michigan .  MERS, which has more than $6.5 billion in assets under
management, will allocate as much as $250 million to Carlyle and
$500 million to AlpInvest Partners NV, the Dutch  money manager 
Carlyle agreed to buy in January, the companies said in a
statement today. The five-year pledge makes the Lansing,
Michigan-based pension AlpInvest’s first U.S. client, according
to the statement.  “AlpInvest has demonstrated an ability to access all
aspects of the private-equity market and achieve top-quartile
performance over multiple market cycles,” Jeb Burns, chief
investment officer for MERS, said in the statement. “As one of
The  Carlyle Group ’s managed accounts we gain access to various
sector and geographically diverse funds.”  Carlyle is aiming to take advantage of more stable stock
markets to join U.S.-listed rivals  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , KKR &
Co. and Apollo Global Management LLC. Blackstone, the world’s
largest private-equity firm, has gained 17 percent this year in
New York trading and KKR has risen 3.9 percent. Apollo has
declined 13 percent since its March 29 offering.  Carlyle had $107.6 billion under management as of March 31,
and AlpInvest oversees more than 42 billion euros ($59 billion),
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
