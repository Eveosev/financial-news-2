Chelsea midfielder Michael 
Essien had “successful” surgery on his right knee today and
may be out of action for six months, the Premier League soccer
club said on its website.  Essien sustained the injury in training last week and had
the operation to repair a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament
and meniscus, the Blues said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
