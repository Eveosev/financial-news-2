Cash premiums for U.S. corn and
soybeans shipped in July to export terminals near  New Orleans 
rose relative to Chicago futures as farmers slowed sales and
hot, dry weather threatened Midwest yields.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month advanced to 89 cents to 97 cents a bushel above September
futures from 89 cents to 92 cents on July 8, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. There was no comparison for soybeans
delivered this month as exporters rolled basis from July to
August. Bids for August delivery jumped as much as 10 cents.  “Farmers are scared to sell any more bushels with the hot
weather in the forecast,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst
for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis .
“Domestic feed manufactures and food and fuel producers are
bidding more and that’s keeping supplies out of the export
market.”  Corn futures for September delivery rose 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to close at $6.43 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The contract gained 5.9 percent last week on increased
Chinese demand for imports and expectations that hot, dry
weather will hurt crops in the U.S., the world’s largest
exporter.  Soybean futures for August delivery slipped 0.25 cent to
$13.465 a bushel after rising 2.6 percent last week, snapping a
four-week decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
