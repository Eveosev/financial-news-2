Egyptian Gulf Bank (EGBE) ’s investments in
Egyptian government securities grew 13 percent at the end of
June from year-end 2010,  Al Mal  reported.  The bank increased its holdings of government notes by 120
million Egyptian pounds ($20 million) to 1.07 billion pounds to
take advantage of rising yields and as lending slowed amid
political unrest, the Cairo-based newspaper said, citing
Mohamed Mehrem, the bank’s senior assistant general manager for
treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
