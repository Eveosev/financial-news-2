EcoSynthetix Inc., a renewable
chemicals company, plans to sell about C$100 million ($103
million) of shares in an initial public offering to finance
research and development and expand production facilities.  The Burlington, Ontario-based company aims to sell 9.1
million to 11.1 million shares for between C$9 and C$11 each,
according to sale documents obtained by Bloomberg News. The IPO
is expected to be priced in the week of July 25, and the stock
will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol
ECO.  EcoSynthetix specializes in biomaterials that can be used
in industrial manufacturing to make products such as paint,
paper and adhesives, according to a July 5 regulatory  filing .
The company said it developed processes that make lower-cost
“green” alternatives to petroleum-based products using corn,
potato, tapioca and other natural feedstocks.  The company was formed to buy a stake in Michigan-based
EcoSynthetix U.S., which owns the assets including a research
and development facility in Burlington and plants in  Tennessee 
and The Netherlands.  UBS Securities Canada, Canaccord Genuity Corp. and  RBC
Capital Markets  are leading a group of six banks on the sale.
The underwriters have the option to sell another 15 percent
after the sale closes.  A telephone message left with EcoSynthetix Chief Executive
Officer John van Leeuwen wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
