INC Research Inc.’s $300 million
term loan to support its acquisition of  Kendle International
Inc. (KNDL)  rose in initial trading, according to information provider
Markit Ltd.  The seven-year debt for the operator of global clinical
development programs, sold to investors at 97 cents on the
dollar, began trading at 98.5 cents, Markit said.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  arranged the Raleigh, North Carolina based
company’s loan with an interest rate 5.75 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate and a 1.25 percent floor
on the lending benchmark, according to a person with knowledge
of the transaction, who declined to be identified because the
terms are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
