Conrad M. Black, the former
Hollinger International Inc. chairman and chief executive
officer sentenced to serve an additional year in prison, must
report by Sept. 6, a federal court in  Chicago  said.  Black’s original 6 1/2-year term was reduced to 3 1/2 years
last month by U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve after the
former newspaper publisher successfully appealed two of three
mail fraud counts of which he was convicted in 2007.  St. Eve, in an order dated July 5 and posted on the court’s
electronic docket today, recommended that Black, 66, be returned
to the low-security prison at  Coleman ,  Florida , where he spent
29 months before being granted bail last year.  Hollinger International was once the world’s third-biggest
publisher of English-language newspapers. Its publications
included the U.K.’s  Daily Telegraph ,  Canada ’s National Post and
the Jerusalem Post.  Black was originally found guilty for his role in the theft
of $6.1 million from the Chicago-based company now known as Sun-
Times Media Group Inc. Convictions overturned on appeal reduced
the total value of the theft to $600,000.  Each court reviewing the case upheld the jury’s finding
that Black obstructed justice when he removed boxes from his
Toronto office that prosecutors said contained documents sought
by the U.S. government.  The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has final say on where Black
will serve the remainder of his punishment.  The case is U.S. v. Black, 05-cr-00727, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
