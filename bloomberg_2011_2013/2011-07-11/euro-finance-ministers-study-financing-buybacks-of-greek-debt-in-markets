Euro-area finance ministers are
studying the possibility of financing the purchase of Greek
bonds in secondary markets as one option to help the country
sustain its debt, said Luxembourgâ€™s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers.  Finance chiefs are also considering lowering  interest rates 
on Greek bailout loans and extending maturities of existing
bonds, Juncker said at a press conference in Brussels.  Private investors will also be asked to shoulder part of
the burden of a second rescue for Greece, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
