David Einhorn , the hedge-fund
manager who agreed in May to buy 33 percent of the  New York 
Mets, survived the first round of the  World Series of Poker ’s
main event.  Einhorn, who finished 18th in the $10,000 buy-in tournament
in 2006, has 94,400 chips following his first day of play this
year and is among 4,521 entrants left, according to the
tournament’s  website . The event, officially titled the No-Limit
Hold’em World Championship, pays $8.7 million to the winner.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Einhorn, confirmed the
tournament entry and declined further comment in a telephone
interview. The 42-year-old Einhorn sits down for second-round
action today in Las Vegas.  Einhorn, the president of Greenlight Capital Inc., agreed
to buy a stake in the Mets for $200 million from the club
owners, who are trying to pay off debt and resolve a $1 billion
suit by the trustee representing people who lost money in the
 Ponzi scheme  run by Bernard L. Madoff. The deal between Einhorn
and the Mets has yet to be completed.  This year’s  World Series  of Poker at the Rio All-Suite
Hotel & Casino brought in a record prize pool of $192 million,
which includes the main event, the 58th and final tournament in
the series.  A record 75,672 people participated in the World Series.
Before the tournament, there were questions over how the turnout
would be affected by the April indictments of the founders of
Internet gambling companies PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and
 Absolute Poker , alleging circumvention of a 2006 U.S. law
barring banks from processing payments to offshore gambling
websites.  Large Field  The main-event field of 6,865 players is the third-highest
for any live poker tournament, trailing the main events of 2006
(8,773 players) and 2010 (7,319).  Players, split into four Day 1 groups, started the main
event with 30,000 in chips. Einhorn’s current total is more than
double the 45,555 average stack of chips for the entrants
remaining. The leader is Fred Berger of  Las Vegas , with 209,000.  The tournament is scheduled to play down to nine by July
19. Those players will compete at the final table on Nov. 7 to
crown a champion.  Jonathan Duhamel, who won $8.9 million with his main-event
victory last year, has 41,150 in chips after Day 1.  Other top poker pros still playing include Phil Hellmuth
(11,800 in chips), Johnny Chan (34,000) and Daniel Negreanu
(41,175).  Celebrities still competing include the  Boston Celtics ’
 Paul Pierce  (63,000), and actors Jason Alexander (63,150) and
Brad Garrett (59,775). Singer Nelly, actor Ray Romano and
actress Jennifer Tilly were eliminated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
