(Corrects spelling of Sao Paulo in headline.)  Brazil’s two biggest cities,  Rio de
Janeiro  and Sao Paulo, are among the highest climbers in a list
of the world’s most expensive cities to live in, as the nation’s
economic growth continues to outpace Europe and the U.S.  Sao Paulo jumped to 10th place in the list of 214 cities,
from 21st last year, while Rio de Janeiro surged to 12th from
29th, according to a report today from consulting firm  Mercer .
Luanda in Angola remained the world’s most expensive city as
accommodation prices hit a record. Tokyo retained second spot,
while Geneva, at 5th, and Zurich at 7th, were Europe’s only top
10 entries. No U.S. city made the top 10. Moscow was fourth.  Brazil ’s economy grew by 7.5 percent last year, the most in
two decades, and consumer prices are estimated to rise 6.3
percent this year, according to the median forecast in a July 8
central bank survey of about 100 economists published today. The
 U.S. economy  grew at 2.9 percent last year while the U.K.’s
economy grew by 1.4 percent.  The rise in the Brazilian Real against the dollar caused
the country’s “cities to rise in the ranking,” Nathalie
Constantin-Metral, a senior researcher at Mercer, said in the
report. “In most European cities the cost of living for
expatriates has remained relatively stable.”  Singapore moved to 8th from 11th while  New York City 
dropped to 32nd spot from 27th and  London  slipped one place to
18th. Dublin moved to 58th most expensive city from 42nd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
