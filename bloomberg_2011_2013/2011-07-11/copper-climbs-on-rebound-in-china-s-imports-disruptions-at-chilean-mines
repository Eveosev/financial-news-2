Copper in  London  dropped for a
second day as the weakest U.S. jobs growth in nine months and
concern that rising inflation in China may prompt Beijing to
continue tightening monetary policies dimmed the demand outlook.  Three-month copper fell as much as 0.5 percent to $9,613.50
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and traded at $9,645
at 4:11 p.m.  Shanghai  time. The metal for delivery in September
on the Comex in  New York  dropped 0.6 percent to $4.3840 a pound.  “The U.S. employment data disappointed the market,” said
Jia Zheng, a trader at Shanghai East Asia Futures Co. “There is
also a growing concern that the elevated inflation may not come
down in the next couple of months, so the tightening policies
may continue, adding pressure to the market.”  American employers added jobs at the slowest pace in nine
months in June, increasing payrolls by 18,000 workers, less than
the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists, which called for growth of 105,000. The  unemployment
rate  unexpectedly climbed to 9.2 percent.  China’s consumer prices rose to a three-year high of 6.4
percent in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said on July
9, exceeding the 6.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 19 economists. The world’s second-biggest economy is
already cooling after the government curbed lending by boosting
lenders’ reserve requirements to a record and raising  interest
rates  five times since September, most recently on July 6.  The nation’s gross domestic product may have risen 9.3
percent in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, down from 9.7 percent the
previous quarter. The data scheduled for release on July 13 may
show the economy grew the least in almost two years.  China  Demand  Copper imports by China gained 10 percent to 280,009 tons
last month from 254,738 tons in May, the General Administration
of Customs said on its website yesterday. This was the first
increase in three months as buying from overseas became
profitable and supply tightened after consumers drained local
stockpiles in the world’s largest consumer.  Scrap copper imports in June totaled 420,000 tons, up from
400,000 tons in May, customs data showed.  Copper for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange closed 0.6 percent lower at 71,470 yuan ($11,053).  Aluminum in London fell 0.9 percent to $2,513 a ton, zinc
dropped 0.3 percent to $2,348 a ton, and lead slid 1 percent to
$2,692.25 a ton. Nickel dropped 0.5 percent to $23,770 a ton,
and tin was little changed at $26,825 a ton at 4:14 p.m. in
Shanghai.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
