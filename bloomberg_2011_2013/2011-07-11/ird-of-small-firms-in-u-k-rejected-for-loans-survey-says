A third of U.K. firms with less than
10 employees are rejected when applying for loans, a  survey  by
BDRC Continental, U.K’s biggest independent research agency,
shows.  More than half of these companies hadn’t applied for a loan
in the last 12 months because they expected to be turned down,
according to the survey released today. The report is based on
5,000 interviews with British businesses with sales of as much
as 25 million pounds ($40 million) from March to May.  “The very smallest businesses are the ones bearing the
brunt of a contraction in bank lending,” John Walker, national
chairman of Federation of Small Businesses, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Lending to U.K. non-financial companies contracted for a
22nd month in April, the  British Bankers Association  said in
May. The five biggest banks have missed their lending targets
for the first quarter this year, according to figures published
by the Bank of England in May. Banks including  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  agreed in February to make 76
billion pounds in credit available to aid the economic recovery.
The deal must be kept or the banks may face new taxes, Prime
Minister David Cameron told a House of Commons committee May 17.  Companies aren’t borrowing because they were either put off
or feel discouraged by banks, the BDRC report said. They are
also concerned about the cost and time involved, it said.  “Banks are committed to providing SME’s with greater and
easier access to finance,” BBA said in a  statement  on the
report on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
