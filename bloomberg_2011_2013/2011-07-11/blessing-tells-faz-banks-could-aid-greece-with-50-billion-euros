Commerzbank AG (CBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Blessing  said private investors could provide
more than 50 billion euros ($70 billion) in Greek aid by
forfeiting repayments and interest to stem the country’s crisis.  Greece needs to “significantly” lower its sovereign debt,
ensure liquidity and cut its interest payments to get out of the
crisis, Blessing wrote in a commentary to be published in
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  tomorrow and released by the
newspaper in advance. The best way to achieve that is through a
so-called “haircut” and by extending bond maturities and
lowering interest payments, he said.  “Without the support of the partner countries, Greece is
faced with financial collapse,” Blessing wrote in the newspaper.
“There is no democratically enforceable savings program that
will allow the country to return to the capital markets in a
foreseeable future and repay its debt with interest.  Greece 
needs a rescheduling in terms of a partial debt relief.”  An offer could be made to creditors to exchange their
existing bonds with a 30 percent haircut for new 30-year bonds
with an interest rate of 3.5 percent that are guaranteed by
eurozone countries, he said. This would require investors to
forfeit 30 percent of their claims in exchange for liquid notes
maturing in 30 years that would reduce Greece’s debt, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
