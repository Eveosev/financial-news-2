Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  will resume
flights from London’s Gatwick airport after a two-decade absence
as the German carrier seeks to feed its expanding  Frankfurt  hub.  Lufthansa will offer a twice-daily service from Gatwick
beginning Oct. 30, expanding its operations between the U.K.
capital and Frankfurt to 111 flights a week, including trips to
London City airport and its main British base at Heathrow.  Europe ’s second-biggest airline will commence the flights
nine days after Frankfurt airport opens a fourth runway, lifting
capacity to 700,000 aircraft movements a year by 2020, 236,000
more than took place in 2010, according to owner Fraport AG.  “Available capacity at Frankfurt will increase and Gatwick
offers another catchment area in the southeast U.K.,” London-
based Lufthansa spokeswoman Gudrun Gorner said. “Heathrow is
very much up to capacity and it’s not easy to get slots there.”  Frankfurt airport last year handled 53 million customers,
compared with 66 million at Heathrow and 31 million at Gatwick.
Gatwick’s passenger count rose 5.2 percent last month to 3.2
million, according to a statement today. Heathrow, where the
runways are operating at 99 percent of capacity, lured 6.1
million, a 6.3 percent increase, as carriers used bigger planes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
