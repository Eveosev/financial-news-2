Chilean pension funds had a total
$153 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2011, an
11 percent increase from a year ago, Chilean pension fund
regulator Superintendencia de Pensiones said in a statement
posted on its website.  The pension funds, known locally as AFPs, had $66.1 billion
invested outside the country, a 6.7 percent advance from a year
earlier, and $22.8 billion in local shares, 13 percent more than
in June 2010, the regulator said.  Funds managed by the pension funds posted negative returns
in June mostly due to the decline in value of local stocks, the
regulator said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
