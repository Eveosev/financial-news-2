     July 11 (Bloomberg) --Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said euro-area finance ministers’ talks on a private-
sector role in any second rescue for  Greece  remain based on a
proposed voluntary rollover.  “We need to find a way to have some guidelines today about
the private-sector involvement and the solution for Greece,”
Reynders told reporters in Brussels before a meeting of euro-
area finance ministers.  Asked if  Germany ’s call for a debt swap by private
investors is back on the table, Reynders said the basis of the
talks is the alternative voluntary rollover of Greek debt.  “We want to go to a solution, and first of all it’s a
rollover,” he said. “But we will see what are the proposals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
