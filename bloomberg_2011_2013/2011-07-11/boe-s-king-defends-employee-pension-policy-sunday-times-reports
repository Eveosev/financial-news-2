Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
has defended the central bank’s retirement plan which gives its
retired staff bigger annual pension increases than other civil
servants, the Sunday Times reported.  In a letter to lawmakers King said the central bank
“should honor the commitments it made to its pensioners” and
continue to link their pensions to the retail prices index,
which stands at 5.2 percent, rather than the consumer prices
index, which stands at 4.5 percent, the newspaper said.
