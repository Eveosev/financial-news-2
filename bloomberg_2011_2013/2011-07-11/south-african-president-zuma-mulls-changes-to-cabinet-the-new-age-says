South African President  Jacob Zuma 
may make changes to his Cabinet, The New Age said, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Zuma may use an extended sick leave by Cooperative
Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Sicelo Shiceka to
push for changes, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, without
citing anyone. The Presidency didn’t respond to the newspaper’s
requests for comment.  Zizi Kodwa, a spokesman for the presidency, couldn’t be
reached on his mobile phone, which wasn’t taking messages, when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
