The shootout victory by the U.S.
over  Brazil  in the Women’s World Cup quarterfinals drew the
largest big-market audience for a tournament game in 12 years,
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN said.  Yesterday’s game, won by the U.S. 5-3 on penalty kicks
after it tied the game in the 122nd minute, was watched in 2.6
percent of homes in the 56 biggest U.S. media markets, ESPN
spokesman Mac Nwulu said today in an e-mail citing  Nielsen Media
Research .  The overnight ratings are the highest since the 1999
tournament, hosted and won by the U.S., and the second-highest
in network history, Nwulu said. The U.S. team’s 2-0 semifinal
victory over Brazil on July 4, 1999, was watched on ESPN by 3.2
percent of U.S. households. Its shootout victory over  China  in
the final drew a 13.3 overnight rating on ABC, according to the
 Associated Press .  The audience for yesterday’s game also almost doubled that
for the Americans’ 3-0 win over Colombia in the group stage on
July 2, which drew a 1.4 rating, at the time the most-watched
game since 1999, according to an e-mailed release from ESPN.  The U.S. scored on an own-goal by Brazil in the second
minute yesterday in Dresden, Germany, and fell behind 2-1
following a pair of goals -- a penalty shot in the 68th minute
and an overtime volley -- from forward Marta. U.S. forward Abby Wambach tied the game on a header with one minute remaining in
overtime to force the shootout.  The U.S has advanced to the semifinals in all six women’s
 World Cup  tournaments. The team, which won championships in 1991
and 1999, plays  France  on July 13 for a berth in the final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
