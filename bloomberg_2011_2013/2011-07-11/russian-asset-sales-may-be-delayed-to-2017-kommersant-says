Russia’s privatization program may
be delayed until 2017, beyond the original deadline of 2015,
 Kommersant  reported, citing unidentified sources who attended
meeting hosted by Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Shuvalov .  The participants at the meeting on July 8 also discussed
the introduction of “golden shares” for state-owned companies
including OAO Rosneft, OAO RusHydro and OAO Zarubezhneft. A
golden share gives the state special rights, such as the right
to veto strategic decisions by a company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
