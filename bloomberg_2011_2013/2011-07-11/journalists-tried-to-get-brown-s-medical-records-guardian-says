Journalists from U.K. newspapers
owned by  Rupert Murdoch  tried to gain access to medical, legal
and bank records of former Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  and his
family,  the Guardian reported , without saying where it got the
information.  Both the Sunday Times and the Sun obtained private files,
the Guardian said. Previously only the News of the World, which
published its final edition yesterday, was implicated in a
scandal triggered by allegations that reporters hacked into the
voicemail of crime victims.  The Sun obtained details of the private medical files of
Brown’s son Fraser, while someone working for the Sunday Times
acquired legal records and tried to gain access to bank records,
the Guardian said.  News Corp. (NWSA)  declined to comment on the Guardian story.  To contact the reporter on this story:
