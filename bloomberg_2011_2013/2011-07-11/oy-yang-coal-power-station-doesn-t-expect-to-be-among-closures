Loy Yang Power, owner of the biggest
power station in  Australia ’s Victoria state, said it doesn’t
believe it will be among coal-fired generators paid to
close under Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s plan to cut
emissions.  While there are “good aspects” to the proposal to reduce
greenhouse gas pollution, “there’s a degree of uncertainty
around subsequent years,” Ian Nethercote, Loy Yang chief
executive officer, told reporters on a call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
