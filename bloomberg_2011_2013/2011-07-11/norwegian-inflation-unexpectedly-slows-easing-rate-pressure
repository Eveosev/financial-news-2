Norwayâ€™s inflation unexpectedly
slowed in June, easing pressure on the central bank to raise
interest rates.  Annual underlying inflation slowed to 0.7 percent from 1
percent in May, Oslo-based  Statistics Norway  said in a statement
today. The rate was expected to be 1.0 percent, according to the
median estimate of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Overall
inflation was an annual 1.3 percent.  The central bank in May raised its benchmark interest rate
for the first time in a year, and last month said it would raise
rates at least twice more this year as growth accelerates and
unemployment has dipped below 3 percent. The bank targets an
inflation rate of 2.5 percent.  Consumer price declines in June were led by a drop in
electricity costs and falling food prices, the statistic agency
said.  The krone weakened 0.11 percent to 7.7308 per euro as of
10:16 a.m. in Oslo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
