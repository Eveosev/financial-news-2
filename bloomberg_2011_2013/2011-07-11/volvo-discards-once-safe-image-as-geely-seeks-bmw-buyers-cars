Volvo Cars wants to expand beyond
consumers like Frances Wong, a would-be mom in China who is
considering trading in a Golf from  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  for a bigger,
safer model from the Chinese-owned Swedish brand.  “I looked at many cars, and Volvo’s cars offer value for
money and good safety features,” said Wong, 30, a partner at an
information technology services firm in Shanghai, as she was
taking a close look at a Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle.  Volvo, which built a reputation around security and
reliability, aims to broaden its appeal, especially with Chinese
consumers, by adding user-friendly comforts and a touch of
luxury. The goal is to more than double sales to 800,000
vehicles and challenge German premium leaders  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW) , VW’s Audi and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz.  The shift in image was instigated by Chief Executive
Officer  Stefan Jacoby . The former VW executive was brought in by
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. after purchasing Volvo from
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  last August for about $1.5 billion.  The 53-year-old executive determined that safety
advancements throughout the  auto industry  meant Volvo’s
reputation was a diminishing asset. The main message now is
user-friendly, simple luxury, Doug Speck, Volvo’s sales and
marketing chief, said in an interview.  “People haven’t flocked to Volvo because most customers are
looking for safety-plus,” said  Alexander Edwards , head of the
automotive unit for researcher Strategic Vision in  San Diego .  Shrinking Share  The outmoded image has led Volvo to drop off the radar
screen for many Americans. Just 15 percent of U.S. auto buyers
would consider a Volvo, compared with 22 percent for Toyota
Motor Corp.’s Lexus and 21 percent for BMW, said Edwards. Still,
the brand has “great potential” if it boosts marketing,
because consumers “trust” the company, he said.  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175) , the Hong Kong-listed unit
of Zhejiang Geely, fell as much as 5.5 percent and was trading
4.3 percent lower as of 2:31 p.m. local time. The stock has
risen 1.6 percent since its parent acquired Volvo on Aug. 2,
versus a 2.1 percent increase in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   Geely, whose best-selling car is the $14,355 Emgrand EC7
sedan, is the eighth-largest auto manufacturer in China with a
market share of 3.7 percent.  Much of Volvo’s ambitions rest on the Chinese market. Volvo
plans to produce a new car designed for China in 2013. In
February, it selected Chengdu in the southwest for a new auto
plant and may build a second as well as an engine factory with a
capacity of 200,000 to 300,000 motors, Freeman Shen, head of
Volvo’s Chinese operations, said in an interview in  Shanghai .  The mainland looks set to overtake the U.S. as the
company’s biggest market as early as next year.  ‘Second Home’  China “is going to be our largest single market in the
world,” Speck said by telephone from  New Jersey . “It’ll be
where we grow our volume more than any other market, and it’s
where we’ll have significant infrastructure. We’re establishing
China as a second home market.”  The carmaker, whose models include the four-door S60 sports
sedan and C70 convertible, increased sales by about 24 percent
to 44,700 cars last month, marking the best June in its 84-year
history. The company should “comfortably” deliver at least
425,000 cars this year, up 14 percent from 2010, Speck said. The
figure is still shy of its 2007 record of 458,323, as BMW, Audi
and Mercedes target new best marks this year.  Luxury Symbols  Volvo may also continue to lag behind its German
competitors. BMW’s sales will probably grow by about 482,000
vehicles through 2014, compared with Volvo’s expected gain of
140,000, according to data from IHS Automotive. Audi is
projected to pad sales by 400,000 and Mercedes by 490,000 in
that period.  Volvo is also trailing in  China . Sales rose 36 percent to
21,028 vehicles in the first six months of 2011, while BMW
gained 61 percent to 121,614. Audi, the luxury-car leader in
China, delivered 140,699 vehicles, a gain of 28 percent.
Mercedes jumped 52 percent to 92,174.  “It will be very hard for Volvo to shake the market
position of BMW, Audi and Mercedes” in China, said  John Zeng , a
Shanghai-based analyst at J.D. Power & Associates. “The three
are very strong brands, and they sell large volumes.”  Audi, Mercedes and BMW have traditionally been regarded as
luxury symbols in China, Zeng said. Volvo has the opportunity to
win customers from brands such as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus and
Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti, because of its better brand
perception, Zeng said.  Still Safe  The Swedish automaker aims to boost Chinese deliveries by
at least 60 percent to 50,000 cars this year, said Shen. By
2015, the goal is 200,000 by targeting buyers who “don’t want
to show off” but rather “want to have a feeling of simple
luxury,” he said.  Even with the shift, Volvo isn’t losing sight of safety.
Last year, it introduced in the S60 sedan technology that warns
drivers of a potential collision with a pedestrian. Now, the
company is developing a system that will automatically brake for
 animals .  --Ola Kinnander in  Stockholm  and Liza Lin in Shanghai. Editors:
