Arsenal agreed to sign striker
Gervinho from French soccer champion Lille as the Gunners try to
improve their fourth-place finish last season.  The north London team made the announcement of the signing
of the Ivory Coast national team player on its website. His
arrival is still “subject to a regulatory process,” the
statement said. Media reports said the transfer fee is about 11
million pounds ($17.6 million).  Gervinho, 24, arrives a week after left-back  Gael Clichy 
left for Manchester City for a reported transfer fee of 7
million pounds. Today in  Asia , where Arsenal is on tour, manager
 Arsene Wenger  said two other players linked to leaving the team,
Samir Nasri and Cesc Fabregas, will remain with the club this
season.  Nasri has been linked to City while Fabregas may return
soon to Barcelona, news reports say, in what would be a blow to
Wenger’s prospects of winning a first trophy since the F.A. Cup
in 2005.  The Gunners, a 13-time English champion, haven’t won the
Premier League since 2004.  Ivory Coast national team player Gervinho had said he
wanted to play in the Premier League after scoring 15 goals in
Lille’s advance to its first French league title since 1954.
Formally known as Gervais Yao Kouassi, he previously played for
Beveren and  Le Mans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
