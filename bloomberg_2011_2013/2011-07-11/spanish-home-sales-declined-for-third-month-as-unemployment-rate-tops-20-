Spanish home sales declined for the
third month in May as austerity measures and  Europe ’s highest
 unemployment rate  crimped demand for homes.  The number of transactions fell 18.3 percent from a year
earlier, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today.
In April, transactions declined 29.7 percent from a year earlier
in the steepest drop since May 2009.  Spain, which has a 21 percent unemployment rate after a
three-year slump, is working through an excess of housing stock
left over from the decade-long construction boom. Prices have
fallen 15 percent since the peak, and the government estimates
there are almost 700,000 new homes that remain to be sold.  To clear the backlog, the government scrapped a tax rebate
on mortgage payments of as much as 1,352 euros ($1,957) a year,
giving buyers a year’s warning to encourage them to bring
forward purchases. The measure prompted a surge in sales before
the tax breaks expired at the end of 2010, and transactions have
since plunged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
