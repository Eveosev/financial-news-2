Zambia ’s main opposition party, the
Patriotic Front, wrote to the Law Association of Zambia to call
for a public enquiry to determine where President Rupiah Banda
and his parents were born, according to a copy of the letter
reproduced in the Post newspaper.  Zambia’s constitution bars people whose parents were born
abroad from contesting the presidency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
