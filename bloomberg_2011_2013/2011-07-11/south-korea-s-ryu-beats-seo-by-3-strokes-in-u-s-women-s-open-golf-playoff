So Yeon Ryu won the U.S.  Women’s
Open , defeating Hee Kyung Seo by  three shots  in a playoff, the
fourth South Korean winner of the title in seven years.  Ryu, 21, played the three holes of the playoff in 2-under
par, making birdies on the 17th and 18th holes at the
 Broadmoor Resort  in  Colorado  Spring, Colorado.  She is the golf tournament’s third-youngest winner, behind
South Koreans In Bee Park, who was 19 in 2008, and Se Ri Pak,
who was 20 in 1998.  The completion of the final round of the season’s third
major championship was delayed until today after thunderstorms
soaked the course yesterday. Seo completed her final round
before play was halted.  Ryu, the fifth South Korean to win the title, forced the
playoff when she birdied the par-4 18th today to finish her
final round.  After both players parred the first playoff hole, Seo
bogeyed the par-5 17th when she hit her tee shot into a fairway
bunker, setting Ryu up for the victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
