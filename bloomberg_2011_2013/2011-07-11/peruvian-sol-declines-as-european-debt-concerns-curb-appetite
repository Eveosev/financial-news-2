Peru’s sol fell for the first day in
five as concern the European debt crisis will worsen curbed
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  Latin American currencies weakened along with the euro
before of a monthly gathering of euro-area finance ministers,
who are meeting amid speculation  Italy  may be engulfed by the
crisis and divisions about how to structure aid for Greece.  “The trend today in the region is for a weaker currency
pressured by what is happening in  Europe ,” said  Hugo Perea , the
chief economist at BBVA Banco Continental in Lima. “The sol is
relatively stable amid the external noise.”  The sol declined 0.1 percent to 2.7450 per  U.S. dollar  at
3:30 p.m. New York time, from 2.7435 on July 8, according to
prices from Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.28 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.17 centimo to 110.71 centimos
per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
