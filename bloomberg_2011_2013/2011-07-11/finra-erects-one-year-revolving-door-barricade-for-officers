Former officers of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority will be banned from making client
appearances or testifying as experts in Finra cases within one
year of leaving the regulator, according to a proposed  rule .  The rule, which would be effective July 2, 2012 if approved
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is meant to “uphold
a high degree of fairness in disciplinary and similar
proceedings that take place before FINRA hearing panels and
other FINRA adjudicators,” the industry-funded brokerage
regulator wrote in its filing with the SEC today.  “One reason we took a look at this was that the revolving-
door issue was raised during the Dodd-Frank process,” said
Nancy Condon, a Finra spokeswoman, referring to last year’s
regulatory overhaul. “We felt it was an issue that we should
address at this time.”  Another self-regulating organization overseen by the SEC,
the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board , has a similar
revolving-door provision in place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
