The number of Ethiopians in need of
humanitarian assistance has risen to 4.57 million, 40 percent
more than estimated in April, said State Minister for
Agriculture Mitiku Kassa.  The government needs $398.4 million to fund food relief for
victims of a drought that has afflicted much of the Horn of
 Africa , according to a humanitarian assessment report handed to
reporters.  “Today is the beginning” of fundraising, Mitiku told
reporters in the capital,  Addis Ababa , today.  Ethiopia is one of five countries suffering from the
drought that is affecting as many as 10 million people, the
United Nations World Food Programme said last week. The WFP is
40 percent short of the $477 million it says it needs for the
rest of the year.  The number of people facing famine may be underestimated by
the government, Jason Fraser, the acting head of the U.S. Agency
for International Development in Ethiopia, told reporters today.
While the government says a quarter of a million people are
affected in the southern region, the U.S. Agency put the figure
at closer to 750,000.  Separate from the victims of the recent drought, another
7.8 million Ethiopians receive food or cash assistance, WFP said
in April.  The UN is unable to cope with the influx of about 1,700
refugees from Somalia driven every day by conflict and drought
into  Ethiopia ’s Dollo Ado area camps, its refugee agency said
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
