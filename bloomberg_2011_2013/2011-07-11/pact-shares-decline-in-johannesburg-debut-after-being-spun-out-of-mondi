Mpact Ltd., the South African
packaging company spun off from Mondi Group, fell as much as 15
percent from its opening price of 16 rand on its debut on the
 Johannesburg Stock Exchange  today.  The stock fell as low as 13.65 rand and traded at that
level as of 11:21 a.m., giving the company a market value of
about 2 billion rand ($296 million).  “The listing seeks to help the strategic focus and the
company’s growth on the packaging side,” Chief Executive
Officer Bruce Strong said in an interview today in Johannesburg
where the company is based.  Strong said today the company is constantly looking for new
opportunities in acquisitions and greenfield operations. No
opportunities have been yet identified, he said.  The company will continue to expand its rigid plastics
business, “thereby diverging from further from Mondi’s core
strategic focus,” it said in a pre-listing statement on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
