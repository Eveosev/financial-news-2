Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR) 
agreed to buy the 54 percent of  Encore Energy Partners LP (ENP)  it
doesnâ€™t already own in all-stock deal that values the oil and
natural-gas producer at about $998 million.  Encore shareholders would receive 0.75 common units of
Vanguard for each unit held, the Houston-based companies said
today in a statement. Based on July 8 closing prices, the
agreement values Encore at $21.94 a unit, a 20-cent premium.
Vanguard on March 25 announced it had offered 0.72 units for
Encore, which at the time amounted to $23.20 each, or $1.05
billion.  Consolidation will reduce operating costs and eliminate a
$6.5 million annual payment from Encore to Vanguard. Vanguard
already controls Encore through ownership of its general
partner, according to the statement. Vanguard bought its stake
in Encore in December from Denbury Resources Inc. for about $380
million.  The announcement was made before regular trading on U.S.
markets. Vanguard fell 2 cents to $29.25 in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading on July 8. Encore Energy fell 18
cents to $21.74.  To contact the reporter on this story:
