U.S. stocks slid, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest two-day drop since
March, as concern grew Europe’s debt crisis will spread and
American lawmakers failed to agree on cutting the deficit.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  fell more
than 3.2 percent, driving financial shares in the S&P 500 down
the most since June 1, as Italian and Spanish government bonds
sank.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  tumbled 2.9 percent before the aluminum
producer started the earnings season after the market close. All
10 S&P 500 industries slumped, falling at least 0.7 percent.  The S&P 500 retreated 1.8 percent to 1,319.49 at 4 p.m. in
 New York , its lowest level since June 29. The gauge fell 2.5
percent over two sessions, the most since March 16. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  declined 151.44 points, or 1.2 percent,
to 12,505.76 today.  “It’s a combination of a worsening of the debt crisis in
 Europe , and deficit and debt uncertainty in the U.S.,” said
Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which manages $4 billion. “The
markets will remain under pressure until the debt crisis in
Europe is perceived to be better contained.”  The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent to 1,343.80 last week,
extending its climb from June 24 through July 8 to 5.9 percent.
That’s the biggest two-week increase since October 2009.
Equities have rebounded in July after the S&P 500 tumbled 3.2
percent in May and June. The index was 10.39 points away from
its April 29 close, which was the highest level in almost three
years, before retreating at the end of last week as the nation
added 83 percent fewer jobs in June than economists forecast.  Bailout Funds  Euro-area countries may have to double their bailout fund
to 1.5 trillion euros ($2.1 trillion) to cover a crisis in
Italy, the  European Central Bank  said, according to German
newspaper Die Welt, citing unidentified “high-ranking” people
at central banks. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
dismissed the report. The Financial Times cited unidentified
senior officials as saying European leaders are prepared to
accept that  Greece  should default on some of its bonds.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said today he will continue to
press congressional leaders for “the largest possible deal” on
a package of significant deficit cuts.  “Now is the time to deal with these issues,” Obama said
at a news conference before resuming talks this afternoon with
bipartisan congressional leaders toward a compromise on reducing
deficits and raising the $14.3 trillion federal debt ceiling
before the government exhausts its borrowing authority on Aug.
2. “If not now, when?”  Financial Companies  Financial companies led losses among 10 groups in the S&P
500, dropping 2.8 percent collectively. Bank of America
retreated 3.3 percent to $10.35, its lowest price since May
2009, and JPMorgan fell 3.2 percent to $39.43.  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
lost 3.2 percent to $21.58 and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  slipped 5.3
percent, the most since January, to $39.79.  The KBW Bank Index fell 2.8 percent as all 24 of its stocks
retreated. Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home lender, dropped
2.5 percent to $27.59.  Stocks will rise 15 percent over the next year, in part
because investors are able to look past the European debt crisis
and a U.S. unemployment rate stuck over 9 percent, Laszlo Birinyi said.  “Yes, we are aware that there are economic issues, there
are concerns and fears, but somehow to say that is to say the
market doesn’t know that. But the market does,” said Birinyi,
the president and founder of Westport, Connecticut-based
research and money management firm Birinyi Associates Inc.
“What I worry about are situations that the market doesn’t
understand,” he said. “Things like Greece and employment and
so forth, these are well within the scope of the market to
understand and discount.”  Alcoa Reports  Alcoa was the first Dow-average company to release second-
quarter results after-hours today. The largest U.S. producer of
the metal retreated 0.4 percent to $15.84 in trading following
the close of regular trading. The stock fell 2.9 percent to
$15.91 during normal hours as metal prices dropped on the London
Metal Exchange and  Australia  announced a new carbon tax. Twelve
companies in the benchmark S&P 500, including JPMorgan,
Citigroup and Google Inc., will publish their earnings this
week.  ‘Undervalued Assets’  While S&P 500 companies are poised to report the smallest
quarterly earnings increase since the equity bull market began
in 2009, growth for the measure is climbing back to its average
since the 1960s as valuations are stuck near credit-crisis
levels. David Kelly, who helps oversee about $445 billion as
chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds, says that means
stock investors are buying an “undervalued asset.”  Energy companies lost 2 percent as oil dropped after
Austria’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said euro-area finance
ministers would discuss Italian debt issues.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. oil company, slumped
1.4 percent to $104.41 as crude for August delivery fell 1.1
percent to settle at $95.15 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest level since July 1.  Caterpillar Inc., the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, dropped 2 percent to $108.16. Raw-materials producers
in the S&P 500 lost 2.1 percent as a group, the second-most in
the benchmark index.  GM retreated 2.6 percent to $30.75 as European carmakers
declined after Renault forecast that its sales this year will
drop as much as 2 percent in Europe.  News Corp. had the biggest retreat in the S&P 500, sliding
7.6 percent to $15.48. U.K. political leaders pressed Rupert
Murdoch to drop  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s bid to take full control of British
Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY LN) as the clamor over reports
of phone hacking at the News of the World newspaper intensified.  Further Declines  Arch Chemicals Inc. (ARJ)  soared 12 percent to $47.37 after Lonza
Group AG, the world’s biggest maker of drug ingredients, agreed
to pay $47.20 per share for the maker of products that kill
micro-organisms. Lonza said it will pay $1.2 billion in cash.
Including debt, the acquisition values Arch at $1.4 billion.  The S&P 500 may extend its drop to about 1,275, which is
near the gauge’s average level over the last 200 days, a level
monitored by analysts who study charts to make forecasts,
according to  Katie Stockton , MKM Partners’ chief market
technician.  “The market was extremely overbought from a short-term
perspective going into this week,” Stockton said in an
interview from Greenwich,  Connecticut . “We probably have a few
more days of downside to go,” she said. “There’s support for
the  S&P 500  at around 1,275, which is the 200-day moving, so I’m
looking for a deeper pull-back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
