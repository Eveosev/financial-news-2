Thailand ’s baht fell, retreating
from a one-month high, on concern the central bank will
intervene to slow appreciation that threatens export growth.  The currency declined as data suggesting the global economy
may be slowing dimmed the outlook for overseas sales and curbed
demand for emerging-market assets. U.S. payrolls increased by
18,000 in June, less than the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of 105,000, data from the Labor Department showed on July
8. China’s customs bureau said yesterday import growth slowed in
June.  “Intervention is more likely now that there is concern
about external demand on data from China and the U.S.,” said
Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “A sharp gain in the baht is not
desirable.”  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 30.27 per dollar as of 8:24
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency strengthened 1.9 percent last week and reached 30.17 on
July 8, the strongest level since June 6, after the Phue Thai
party, led by Yingluck Shinawatra, won a majority in a July 3
election, without triggering any political violence. The baht
may weaken to near 30.50 this week, Nishihama said.  Data from the monetary authority released on July 8 showed
foreign-exchange reserves rose 0.3 percent in the week ended
July 1 to $184.90 billion, the first gain in four weeks.  China ’s imports expanded 19.3 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with a 28.4 percent pace the previous month,
data released yesterday showed. The Asian nation is Thailand’s
biggest export market accounting for 11 percent of the total
shipments in the first quarter and the U.S. is the third-
largest, buying 9.4 percent.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, was little changed at 3.45
percent. The yield on the 5.25 percent bonds due May 2014 held
at 3.78 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
