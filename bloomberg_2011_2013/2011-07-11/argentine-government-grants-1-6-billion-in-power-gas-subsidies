Argentina  will give 6.78 billion
pesos ($1.64 billion) in subsidies to energy companies after a
nationwide cold snap led to rationing for industrial users.  The national treasury will transfer 2.04 billion pesos to
the state-owned energy company known as Enarsa and 4.73 billion
pesos to wholesale energy administrator  Cammesa , according to
the governmentâ€™s official gazette today.  Cammesa pays power generators such as Buenos Aires-based
 Pampa Energia SA (PAMP)  for energy delivered to distributors and also
sets the spot-market power price. Enarsa imports gas and others
fuels to cover domestic demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
