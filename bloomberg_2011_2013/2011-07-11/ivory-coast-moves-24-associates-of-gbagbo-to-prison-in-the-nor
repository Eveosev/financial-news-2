Ivory Coast  transferred 24
associates of former President  Laurent Gbagbo  to a prison in the
northern town of Boundiali, Justice Minister Jeannot Ahoussou
said today.  Those moved to jail include former Prime Minister Gilbert
Ake N’Gbo, ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs Alcide Djedje and the
former governor of the regional central bank, Philippe Henri
Dacoury-Tabley, Ahoussou said by phone today.  All of them have been held at the hotel La Pergola in the
commercial capital, Abidjan, since Gbagbo’s capture on April 11.
They were charged with crimes including embezzlement and harming
state authority on June 26.  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, is
emerging from a 4 1/2-month political crisis that followed a
disputed November presidential election. Gbagbo, who lost the
vote to  Alassane Ouattara , clung to power until he was captured
in Abidjan. Ouattara was sworn into office on May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
