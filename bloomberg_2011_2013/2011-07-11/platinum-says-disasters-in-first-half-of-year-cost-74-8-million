Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd. (PTP) 
said losses tied to natural disasters in the first half of the
year cost the company $74.8 million in the second quarter.  U.S. storms in April and May resulted in losses of about
$28 million after tax, the Bermuda-based insurer said today in a
statement distributed by PR Newswire. The remaining $46.8
million comes from revised estimates of losses from first-
quarter events including a New Zealand earthquake, a Japan
earthquake and flooding in  Australia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
