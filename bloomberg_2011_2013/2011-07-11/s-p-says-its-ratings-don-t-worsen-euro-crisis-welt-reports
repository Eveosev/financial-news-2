Torsten Hinrichs, the head of
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services’ German unit, said S&P’s
ratings of sovereign debt doesn’t make the debt crisis in the
euro area worse,  Die Welt  newspaper reported, citing Hinrichs.  Credit ratings work like a fever thermometer for a flu

influence it, Hinrichs said, according to a preview of an
article that will be published in the German newspaper tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
