Mutuelle d’Assurances du Corps de
Sante Francais, a mutually owned insurer serving health-care
professionals, is acquiring Chateau Lascombes, one of the
biggest Bordeaux vineyards, for 200 million euros ($284 million)
from  Colony Capital LLC , a U.S. buyout firm, the Financial Times
reported, citing Colony Capital’s Jean-Romain Lhomme.  The private-equity firm bought the 118-hectare (292-acre)
vineyard, which produces 550,000 bottles of wine a year, for 77
million euros a decade ago and has invested more than 10 million
euros in it, replanting 25 acres of vines, the newspaper said.  While some Asian buyers were interested in Chateau
Lascombes, Lhomme told the FT that Colony sought a French buyer
with a “long-term vision” for the vineyard, “to ensure it
stayed in good hands.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
