ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Ukraine unit said
steel production declined 26 percent in June from a year earlier
as a blast furnace functioned erratically.  Output declined to 358,100 metric tons, from 485,700 tons,
Alexander Ioskov, who heads the production department at
ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Malfunctions at the blast furnace have been corrected and
production will match last year’s from this month, Ioskov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
