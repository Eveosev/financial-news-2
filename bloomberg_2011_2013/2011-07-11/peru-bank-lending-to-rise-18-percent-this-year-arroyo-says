Peruvian bank lending growth will
slow in the second half of the year as the central bank takes
measures to cool domestic demand, said Enrique Arroyo, general
manager of the Andean countryâ€™s banking association.  Outstanding bank loans, which grew 22 percent through May
31, will rise 18 percent this year after the central bank
increased its benchmark rate to a two-year high in May and
increased reserve requirements, Arroyo told reporters in  Lima .
Corporate lending may slow as companies invest less while they
wait to see what economic policies the new government will
implement, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
