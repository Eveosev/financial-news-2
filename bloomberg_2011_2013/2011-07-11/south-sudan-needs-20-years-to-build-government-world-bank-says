The Republic of South  Sudan  will
need about 20 years to build a properly functioning government,
the  World Bank ’s acting country director for Sudan, Ian Bannon,
told reporters today in the southern capital, Juba.  “We’ve found that countries that went through this post-
conflict transition took about 20 years to have ministries that
function OK,” Bannon said.  South Sudan became independent on July 9, six years after
the end of a two-decade civil war with the north that killed as
many as 2 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
