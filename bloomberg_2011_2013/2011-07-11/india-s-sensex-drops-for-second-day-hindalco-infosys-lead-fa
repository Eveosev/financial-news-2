India ’s benchmark stock index fell
for the second day as the weakest growth in U.S. jobs in nine
months and concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread to
 Italy  dimmed the outlook for the global economy.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the nation’s second-largest
aluminum producer that controls Atlanta-based Novelis Inc., fell
the most in three months after the environment ministry referred
the allocation of the Mahan coal block in central India to a
panel of ministers, pending ecological clearance. Infosys Ltd.,
the second-largest software services provider, dropped 1.7
percent ahead of its earnings announcement tomorrow.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
142.94, or 0.8 percent, to 18,715.10, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The measure rose 0.5
percent last week, its third weekly gain. The S&P CNX Nifty
Index fell 0.8 percent to 5,616.90 and its July futures settled
at 5,620.25. The BSE 200 Index shed 0.8 percent to 2,312.18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
