Orient Green Power Co., the first
renewable-energy company to list in  India , plans to increase
capacity by 38 percent as demand for cleaner electricity grows.  Operating capacity for wind-power and biomass projects will
rise to 342 megawatts in the financial year through March 2012,
the Chennai-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
That compares with 248.5 megawatts now, it said.  India is seeking investment in renewables to counter the
rising cost of oil imports. The country, the worldâ€™s third-
largest market for wind parks behind  China  and the U.S.,
requires power distributors and industrial users to get as much
as 14 percent of their electricity from renewable sources.  Orient Green Power has completed its latest 18.7-megawatt
wind farm in Tamil Nadu state and expects to start operating an
additional 40 megawatts over the next few weeks, it said today.  The company, a unit of Shiram EPC Ltd., raised 9 billion
rupees ($202 million) in an initial public offering in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
