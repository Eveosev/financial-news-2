Foxconn Technology Group, the
world’s largest contract manufacturer of electronics, plans to
sell shares of its retail unit in Taipei, founder and chairman
Terry Gou said today.  Cybermart International Holding Co., which operates
electronics shopping malls in major Chinese cities such as
 Shanghai , plans to spend 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion) over
five years to expand, Chairman Steve Chang said in an interview
today following a groundbreaking ceremony at Taipei’s Guanghua
electronics market.  Chang declined to give a timeline for the listing. Guo, who
spoke at the same event, also didn’t elaborate.  Foxconn, whose flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.
assembles Apple Inc. iPads and iPhones, is expanding into retail
after cutting its long-term sales growth target. Gou is also
considering nanotechnology, biotechnology and media content as
growth areas for the company, he said in an interview last year.  Cybermart has 35 shopping malls and plans to add 20 more
over five years, Chang said today. The company also has three
Apple-branded stores and will operate 20 by the end of this
year, he said.  Annual revenue will climb to NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion)
within three years, he said without providing current sales
figures.  Hon Hai won a NT$3.7 billion bid in April last year to
build the Guanghua market and operate it for 50 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
