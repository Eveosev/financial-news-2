BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  Credit Agricole
SA (ACA) , France’s largest banks by assets, fell the most in a year as
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis threatened to spread to Italy,
where both have operations.  BNP Paribas dropped 3.37 euros, or 6.8 percent, to 46.46
euros in Paris trading, the biggest decline since June 29, 2010.
Credit Agricole tumbled 7.7 percent, while  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,
France’s No. 3 bank, declined 5.7 percent.  “French banks are loaded with Italian sovereign debt, and
two French banks, Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas, have large
banking operations in Italy,” said Christophe Nijdam, an
analyst at AlphaValue in Paris who has an “add” rating on BNP
Paribas. “Investors are making an unjustified analogy with what
happened in  Greece .”  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian and
Spanish 10-year bonds instead of German bonds rose today to the
highest since the euro was introduced in 1999 amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis will spread.  French financial institutions had $97.6 billion at risk
from Italian public-sector debt at the end of last year,
according to data from the Bank for International Settlements.
That compares with $51.2 billion held by German financial firms.
The French financial firms’ total claims on Italy amounted to
$392.6 billion at the end of December, according to the BIS.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
