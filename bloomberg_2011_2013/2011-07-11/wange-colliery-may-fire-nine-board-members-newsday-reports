Hwange Colliery Co. will likely fire
as many as nine board members in a bid to restructure the
company,  Newsday  said, citing company documents.  The Zimbabwean government owns 37 percent of Hwange,
 Zimbabwe â€™s biggest coal miner, while British millionaire
Nicholas Van Hoogstraten holds about 26 percent, the Harare-
based Newsday said on its website. Both government and Van
Hoogstraten will nominate new board members, Newsday reported.  Hwange has delayed its annual general meeting to Aug. 3
from June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
