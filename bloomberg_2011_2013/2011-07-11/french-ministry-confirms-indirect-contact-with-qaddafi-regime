The French government has had
indirect contact with Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
government, though there haven’t been any direct talks, Foreign
Ministry spokesman  Bernard Valero  said today.  “We are passing him messages in liaison with the National
Transitional Council and our allies,” Valero said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Qaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam, said earlier that his
father’s government was in talks with France and not with the
rebels who are battling the Libyan leader, according to an
interview published in  El-Khabar , an Algerian newspaper, today.  He also said that a Libyan envoy to Paris had received a
message from French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  saying that once
an agreement had been forged between France and his father’s
administration, the French would force the rebel National
Transitional Council to agree to a ceasefire, El-Khabar said.  France  must talk with Qaddafi’s government if it wants to
sign oil agreements with Libya and see French companies return
to the region, El-Khabar cited Qaddafi’s son as saying.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization started military
strikes against Qaddafi’s forces in late March to aid rebels
seeking to topple him.  To contact the reporters on this story:
