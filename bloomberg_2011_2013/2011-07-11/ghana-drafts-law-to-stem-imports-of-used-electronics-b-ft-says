Ghana  is drafting a law to restrict
the import of used electronic equipment for recycling, the
Business and Financial Times said, citing Shirley Ayittey,
minister of environment, science and technology.  The draft law is in its final stage, Ayittey said,
according to the Accra-based newspaper.  Ghana  imported 31,400 metric tons of used electronic
equipment in 2010, a 75 percent increase over the year before,
the newspaper said, citing data from the  Ghana Shippers
Authority .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
