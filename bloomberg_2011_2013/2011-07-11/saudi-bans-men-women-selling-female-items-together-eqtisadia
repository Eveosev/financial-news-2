Saudi Arabia  has banned men and
women from working together in single stores selling goods
intended for women,  al-Eqtisadiah  reported on its website,
citing Labor Minister Adel Faqih. Department stores are the
exception, the newspaper cited Faqih as saying.  The minister told reporters in Jeddah today that lingerie
stores have been given a six-month grace period to replace male
workers with females, while cosmetics stores have been given a
12-month period to do the same, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
