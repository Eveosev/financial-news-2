Czech stocks sank the most in almost
three months as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread drove
investors from riskier assets worldwide.  The PX gauge of companies slid 1.4 percent, the most since
April 12 and its fourth day of declines, to 1,202.2 at the 4:28
p.m. close in Prague. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , which has a
20 percent weighting in the index, tumbled 3.8 percent to 816
koruna, its biggest retreat in nearly eight months.  Equities fell worldwide, the euro weakened 1.8 percent to
the dollar and Italian and Spanish bonds slid amid speculation
Italy may be engulfed by the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis
and divisions in the region on how to structure aid for  Greece .  “It’s been a negative start to the week, as European debt
issues continue to weigh on sentiment and the financial
markets,” emerging-market strategists lead by  Nick Chamie  at
 RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto wrote in a report dated today.  New World Resources Plc fell 1.8 percent to 237 koruna
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the earnings of the biggest
Czech supplier of coal to steelmakers face “downside risks.”
 CEZ AS (CEZ) , the largest power utility, and  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the
Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, both retreated 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
