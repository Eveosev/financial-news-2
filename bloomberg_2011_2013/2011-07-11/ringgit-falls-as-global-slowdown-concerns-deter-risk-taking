Malaysia ’s ringgit dropped the most
in two weeks as the weakest U.S. jobs growth in nine months
fueled concern the global economic recovery is losing steam,
cooling demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency retreated from a two-month high after a
government report today showed Malaysia’s industrial production
fell for a second month in May. The central bank unexpectedly
refrained from raising its overnight policy rate on July 7,
citing higher downside risks to growth. Malaysian police
detained 1,697 people on July 9 as demonstrators rallied against
what they call unfair voting practices in the biggest protest
since 2007.  “Concern over the global slowdown and a pause in Malaysian
interest-rate rises contributed to the weakening of the
ringgit,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of financial markets at
Alliance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “There’s no impact from the
street protest over the weekend.”  The ringgit fell 0.5 percent to 3.0075 per dollar as of
4:05 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 2.9865 on July 8, the strongest level
since May 12.  Industrial output slid 5.1 percent from a year earlier in
May following a 2.2 percent decline the previous month. The fall
was steeper than the median estimate for a 2.7 percent drop in a
Bloomberg poll of 15 economists.  U.S. payrolls rose by 18,000 in June, less than the most
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, which
called for growth of 105,000 on average, data from the Labor
Department showed on July 8. Gross domestic product in  China ,
Malaysia’s biggest export market, probably rose 9.3 percent in
the second quarter, the least since September 2009, a separate
poll showed before the figures are released on July 13.  Malaysia’s 4.262 percent bonds due September 2016 fell
before the treasury’s planned sale of 4 billion ringgit ($1.33
billion) more of the notes on July 13. The yield rose two basis
points to 3.53 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
