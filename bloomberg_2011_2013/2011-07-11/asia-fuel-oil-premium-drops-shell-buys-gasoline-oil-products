Asia  fuel oil ’s premium fell as
 Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. (933)  sold its 10th cargo this month
in Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading center. Royal
Dutch Shell Plc bought gasoline.  Fuel Oil  Brightoil sold 20,000 metric tons of fuel oil to Westport
Petroleum Inc. at 50 cents a ton over benchmark quotes,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window. That’s a reduced premium from
$2 on July 8. Hong Kong-based Brightoil has sold 244,000 tons so
far this month.  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian benchmark Dubai crude narrowed
48 cents to $8.79 a barrel at 3:08 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. The difference
widened 48 percent last week, the most since February 2010,
indicating growing losses from turning oil into residual
products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade gained 50 cents to $9.25, rebounding from the lowest since
Jan. 19, PVM said. A narrow viscosity spread signals bunker, or
marine fuel, has advanced more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Shell, the biggest buyer of 97-RON gasoline in  Singapore 
this month, bought three cargoes at $130.27 to $130.30 a barrel,
the survey showed. Vitol Group, Total SA and Trafigura Beheer BV
each sold 50,000 barrels. Morgan Stanley sold 50,000 barrels of
95-RON to Shell at $128 a barrel.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline traded at 124.70 a barrel after
Morgan Stanley sold 50,000 barrels to Vitol, according to the
survey. Buyers on July 8 paid $126.10 a barrel.  Naphtha for delivery to  Japan  in the first half of
September traded at $962 to $963 a ton, based on the survey. BP
Plc bought 25,000 tons each from Shell and Noble Group Ltd.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $102.82 a ton at 5:30 p.m. Singapore time from $97.40 at the
end of Asian trading July 8, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude climbed 20
cents to $18.58 a barrel at 3:08 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM. This crack spread, a measure of refining profit, is the
widest since June 22.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged for a third day
at $1.05 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade rose 5 percent last
week, showing it’s more profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
