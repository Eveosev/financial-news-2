Peruvian’s President-Elect Ollanta Humala’s proposed mining windfall tax won’t make the Andean
country less competitive for investment capital, said central
bank president Julio Velarde.  The suggested tax on  Peru ’s mining industry, the world’s
third-largest copper and zinc producer, should be “carefully
studied,” said Velarde. Humala, who takes office July 28,
pledged to raise taxes after copper and gold prices surged to
record levels this year.  “If the mining tax regulation that’s introduced allows the
industry to remain competitive, mining investment will continue,
albeit with delays,” Velarde said today at an event in  Lima .
“Clear signals are needed for confidence to recover.”  Investment has slowed over the past three months in Peru
amid concern over Humala’s proposals, Peru’s National Society of
Mining, Petroleum & Energy said July 7. As much as $42 billion
in investment that aims to quadruple copper output by 2020 may
be shelved if Humala changes investment rules, the group’s
president Pedro Martinez said.  Velarde has said he will “think about it” if asked to
stay on in his position after Humala takes office.  Peru’s mining export revenue rose 27 percent to a record
$21 billion last year as copper tripled from 2008 and gold
jumped 76 percent. Copper futures for September delivery fell
4.4 cents, or 1 percent, to $4.368 a pound on the Comex in  New
York . Gold for August delivery gained $7.60, or 0.5 percent, to
$1,549.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
