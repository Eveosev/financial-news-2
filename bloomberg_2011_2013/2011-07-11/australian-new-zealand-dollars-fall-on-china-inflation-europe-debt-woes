The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell on speculation China will increase efforts to tame
inflation and cool growth, sapping demand for riskier assets.  Australia’s currency slid versus the yen amid concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis may spread to  Italy  as policy makers remain
split on how to structure aid for Greece. The New Zealand dollar
snapped three days of gains versus the greenback as stocks and
commodities slumped after reports showed the U.S. unemployment
rate rose for a third month.  “Fears of a possible slowdown in China and also the U.S.
are spurring  risk aversion  and driving the Aussie lower,” said
Jim Vrondas, a manager at the online currency dealer OzForex
Ltd. in Sydney. The  China  data “coming out above expectations
makes it more likely that officials will keep tightening
policy.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.8 percent to $1.0666 at 12:53
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0755 in New York on July 8. It dropped
1.2 percent to 85.68 yen from 86.70 yen, after earlier touching
86.19, its lowest level since June 30.  New Zealand’s currency slipped 1 percent to 82.96 U.S.
cents from 83.79 cents and slid 1.3 percent to 66.45 yen from
67.55 yen.  China’s government is forecast to report July 13 gross
domestic product rose 9.3 percent from a year before, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, down from 9.7
percent the previous quarter. The country’s consumer price index
rose 6.4 percent in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said
on July 9, exceeding the 6.2 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Australia’s dollar dropped for the fifth time in six days
against Japan’s currency after Austria’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said Italy will be discussed today at the monthly
gathering of euro-area finance ministers.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19  Raw Materials 
fell 1 percent in New York. The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index
fell 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
