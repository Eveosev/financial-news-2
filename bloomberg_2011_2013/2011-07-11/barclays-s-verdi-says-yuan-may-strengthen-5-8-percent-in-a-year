Nick Verdi, a Singapore-based
currency strategist at  Barclays Capital , comments on the outlook
for the Chinese yuan in a telephone interview today after the
nation’s trade surplus widened to a seven-month high.  The bank predicts the yuan will strengthen 3 percent to
6.28 per dollar by year-end and 5.8 percent to 6.11 in 12 months.  “For the time being, the pace of appreciation will help
lean against inflationary pressures but at the same time not
materially impact the export competitiveness of  China .”  The strengthening of the local currency will make the
Chinese economy “less dependent on investment as a means of
economic growth” in the medium to long term, said Verdi.  “Despite some of the wider risks that we are seeing
globally, particularly from the U.S. and  Europe , Asian
currencies will continue appreciating this year notwithstanding
substantial risks because some of the dynamics that we have seen
in China are happening in the rest of the region as well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
