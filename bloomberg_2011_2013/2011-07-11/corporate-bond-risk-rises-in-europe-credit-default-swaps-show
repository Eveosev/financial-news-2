The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 12
basis points to 426, according to Markit Group Ltd. at 7:30 a.m.
in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals deteriorating
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 3 basis points to 114 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers climbed 5 basis points to 166 basis
points and the subordinated index was up 8.5 at 292.5, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
