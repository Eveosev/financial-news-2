South Korea ’s elite soccer league
will double players’ pay and introduce lie-detector tests after
more than 50 team members were indicted for match fixing.  The K-League is also revising regulations to strip teams of
the right to compete in the Asian  Champions League  if players
are found guilty of match fixing, the Seoul-based soccer
competition said today in a statement on its  website .  Players’ minimum annual salary will rise to 24 million won
($22,700) starting next year, the K-League said. The league,
which began in 1983 as the Korean Super League, will also adopt
a promotion-relegation system from 2013.  South Korean prosecutors on July 7 indicted 46 players from
six of the K-League’s 16 teams on charges they accepted bribes
to influence games.  Most of the indicted players had been forced by colleagues
and gang members to take part in match fixing, the prosecutors’
office in Changwon, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast
of  Seoul , said in a statement. Prosecutors didn’t name any of
the players in their statement.  Prosecutors also indicted another 11 former players and
gang members for attempting to influence the outcome of 15 K-
League games between June and October last year, according to
the statement.  The indictments follow similar charges against nine more
players and six other people on June over similar allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
