North Sea  Brent crude’s premium to
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, narrowed after
reaching $22.49 a barrel earlier today.  The spread between the two front-month contracts decreased
to $21.07 a barrel as of 2:30 p.m. London time from $22.13 at
settlement on July 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Disappointing non-farm payroll figures showing job
increases of just 18,000 as opposed to the expected 125,000 put
immediate pressure on WTI, the U.S. domestic crude,”  Glen Ward ,
head of retail derivatives at London Capital Group Ltd., said in
a note. “Brent remained firm on the ongoing Middle East North
Africa troubles.”  The U.S. Labor Department’s July 8 report also showed the
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed to 9.2 percent.  Brent crude for August delivery traded down $2, or 1.7
percent, at $116.33 a barrel as of 2:35 p.m. on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. WTI fell 1.2 percent to $95.06.  “The price of Brent is currently being distorted upwards”
by supply shortfalls caused by oil-field maintenance in the
North Sea, said  Carsten Fritsch , a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Commerzbank AG, in a note. The jobs numbers “are fuelling
doubts that demand for oil in the U.S., the world’s largest oil
consumer, will recover to any great extent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
