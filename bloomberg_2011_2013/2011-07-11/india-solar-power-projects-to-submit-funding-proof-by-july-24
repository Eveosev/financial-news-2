Companies awarded permits in  India ’s
first national auction of rights to build solar  power plants 
have until July 24 to submit documentation to prove they’ve
arranged funding, an official said.  The companies must show they secured funding on or before
July 9, said Anil Kumar Agrawal, chief executive officer of NTPC
Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd., or NVVN, the state-run power trader
that’s overseeing the solar program.  “Those deadlines are sacrosanct,” Agrawal said by
telephone from  New Delhi . “There will not be any extension.”  The December auction granted licenses for 620 megawatts of
solar projects to companies including billionaire Anil Ambani’s
 Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  and  Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI)   According to auction rules, developers that don’t arrange
funding in time must forfeit their permits and bank guarantees
they have posted to back their bids. Guarantees are valued
between 91.5 million rupees ($2.1 million) and 1.8 billion
rupees, the rules show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
