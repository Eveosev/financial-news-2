Bannerman Resources Ltd. (BMN) , an
Australian uranium developer, said it received an initial A$143
million ($153 million) cash takeover proposal from  China ’s
Sichuan Hanlong Group.  Hanlong offered 61.2 cents a share through its Hanlong
Mining Investment Pty unit, the Perth-based company said today
in a statement. That’s 59 percent more than its closing price on
July 8.  Buying Bannerman would give Hanlong stakes in two uranium
properties in  Namibia , including its 80 percent owned Etango
project located south west of Rio Tinto Group’s Roessing uranium
mine. Bannerman said the proposal appeared timed to take
advantage of the drop in its share price following the nuclear
disaster in  Japan .  “Bannerman controls one of the largest undeveloped uranium
resources in the world and, despite recent events, there is no
doubt that nuclear power will continue to play a key role in
meeting the world’s growing energy needs as well as alleviating
greenhouse gas emissions,” Bannerman Chairman  David Smith  said
in the statement.  Shares of Bannerman surged the most in more than two years
when trading resumed this morning. The stock climbed 34 percent
to 51.5 cents in Sydney at 11:04 a.m. local time, trimming
losses this year to 31 percent.  The company has been in talks with a number of “large and
well-funded parties” about financing, development and operation
of the Etango project, according to the statement.  Bannerman is being advised by Macquarie Group Ltd. and
Cutfield Freeman & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
