The 18-month U.S. recession that
ended in June 2009 has so far cost more than $7,300, or about
$175 a month, per person in lost consumption, said a researcher
at the  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco .  The $7,300 figure reflects the period from December 2007 to
May 2011, and was calculated by comparing the path of real
personal consumption expenditures to pre-crisis levels, senior
economist Kevin Lansing wrote in a paper released today. Per
capita consumption is still 1.6 percent below its pre-recession
peak, he said  “The extensive harm of this episode raises the question of
whether policy makers could have done more to avoid the
crisis,” Lansing said in the paper.  Fed officials are attempting to avert a repeat of the
crisis that began with the collapse of the subprime-mortgage
market. Using interest-rate policy to burst asset bubbles “may
have a distinct advantage” over regulatory actions because
“central bankers can deploy it against bubbles regardless of
the regulatory environment,” Lansing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
