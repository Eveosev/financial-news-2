Chile ’s peso weakened the most in
seven weeks as fears that the European debt crisis might engulf
 Italy  damped investor appetite for riskier assets and caused
copper prices to tumble.  The peso dropped 1 percent to 467.34 per dollar at 2:56
p.m. New York time, from 462.84 on July 8. It was the biggest
one-day fall since May 23.  “The decline we are seeing is driven by external
factors,” Matias Madrid, the chief economist at Banco Penta,
said in a phone interview from Santiago. “The European markets
and copper are falling, people are worried about Italy, and it’s
having an effect on the peso.”  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell as
much as 1.7 percent today on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
its largest decrease in three weeks. Italy was the world’s
seventh-biggest copper user in 2010, according to London-based
researcher CRU.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.71 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
