Derek Jeter ’s 3,000th career hit
highlighted the first half of the Major League Baseball season,
which featured tight races in all six divisions and the lowest
combined earned run average by pitchers in almost two decades.  Jeter two days ago became the 28th player in history to
collect 3,000 hits and the first to reach the milestone with the
 New York Yankees , the record 27-time World Series champions.
Jeter got there on the next-to-last day before the All-Star
break with a home run against the  Tampa Bay Rays .  “It’s a number that has meant a lot in the history of the
game, because not too many people have done it before,” Jeter,
the Yankees’ 37-year-old captain and shortstop, said two days
ago. “To be the only Yankee to do anything is pretty special.”  While Jeter provided the season’s most memorable hit before
the halfway point, pitchers had their most dominating start in
19 years. The league’s combined earned run average is  3.85 , the
first time it’s been under 4.00 since dropping to  3.77  in the
opening half of 1992, the year before  Barry Bonds  won his first
home run title.  Justin Verlander of the Detroit Tigers is among 19 starting
pitchers with an ERA under 3.00 and his 12 wins are one behind
the Yankees’ CC Sabathia for the major-league lead.  “Looking back at the first half, it’s pretty doggone
good,” said Verlander, who has a 2.15 ERA. “You can’t be
satisfied with just a good first half though.”  Baseball’s All-Star Game is scheduled for tomorrow at Chase
Field in Phoenix and the second half of the major-league season
begins July 14.  Best Record  Entering the All-Star break, the  Philadelphia Phillies  have
baseball’s best record at 57-34 and the biggest lead of the six
division frontrunners. The Phillies head the Atlanta Braves by 3
1/2 games in the National League Eastern Division.  The  New York Mets , who in May reached an agreement in
principle to sell a 33 percent stake to Greenlight Capital Inc.
President  David Einhorn  for $200 million, are 11 games behind
the Phillies at 46-45.  The defending World Series-champion San Francisco Giants
(52-40) lead All-Star host Diamondbacks (49-43) by three games
in the NL West.  No team has more than a one game lead in the other four
divisions, with the closest race in the NL Central, where
Milwaukee and St. Louis are tied at 49-43, one game ahead of the
Pittsburgh Pirates. At 47-43, the Pirates are above .500 at the
All-Star break for the first time since 1992 and are seeking to
snap a streak of 18 straight losing seasons.  “Everybody in here understands that we’re going day-to-
day, we’re going series-to-series,” said Pirates pitcher Paul Maholm, who has a 2.96 ERA. “If we keep winning series, then
other stuff will take care of itself.”  Baseball’s regular season ends Sept. 28.  AL East  The  Boston   Red Sox  (55-35) lead the Yankees (53-35) by one
game in the American League East after winning nine of their
final 10 games before the All-Star break.  The Tigers (49-43) have a half-game lead over the Cleveland
Indians (47-42) in the AL Central, while the  Texas Rangers 
(51-41) are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Angels (50-42) in
the AL West.  The  Houston Astros  have a MLB-worst 30-62 record at the
All-Star break, yet the  Los Angeles Dodgers  may be having the
most challenging season of any team.  The six-time  World Series  champions are 41-51 even though
they ended the first half of the season with a four-game winning
streak. Off the field, the Dodgers filed for  bankruptcy
protection  on June 27 after baseball commissioner Bud Selig
rejected a proposed $3 billion television-rights deal with News
Corp.’s Fox Sports, leaving team owner  Frank McCourt  unable to
make payroll.  ‘On the Outskirts’  “When the season started I thought we’d be in the mix and
at this point we’re on the outskirts,” Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said.  One bright spot for the Dodgers has been the play of
outfielder Matt Kemp, who is vying to become baseball’s first
Triple Crown winner since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. Kemp is tied
for second in the NL with 22 home runs, is sixth with a .313
batting average and has a third-best 67 runs batted in.  Jose Bautista of the Toronto Blue Jays leads the majors
with 31 homers after topping all players with 54 last season.
Yankee teammates  Mark Teixeira  and Curtis Granderson are tied
for second with 25 homers.  Adrian Gonzalez leads the AL with a .354 batting average
and 77 RBI after joining the Red Sox with a seven-year, $154
million contract. While Gonzalez has thrived in Boston, Adam Dunn is hitting .160 for the  Chicago White Sox  after signing a
four-year, $56 million deal and Dan Uggla is batting .185 in his
first season with the  Atlanta Braves .  Jeter signed a three-year, $48 million extension with the
Yankees in the offseason and was hitting a career-low .257
before reaching the 3,000-hit milestone with his 5-for-5 day on
July 7. He joined Wade Boggs as the second player to slug a home
run for hit No. 3,000 and will take a career total of 3,004 into
the second half of the season.  “Any time you’re feeling good, you look forward to getting
back out there trying to keep it going,” Jeter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
