Former International Monetary Fund
chief  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  filed a complaint with Paris
prosecutors accusing a French woman of slander over allegations
that he attempted to rape her in 2003, according to her lawyer.  The claim against Tristane Banon shows Strauss-Kahn’s
“judicial survival instinct,” said her attorney, David Koubbi,
in an interview today. “In a moment when anybody would have
apologized to the victim, he files claims against her.”  Banon’s accusations came after Strauss-Kahn, 62, was freed
from home confinement in  Manhattan  during a criminal probe of
allegations by a 32-year-old hotel maid there. The employee of
New York’s Sofitel hotel alleged the ex-IMF chief attempted to
rape her in May. Strauss-Kahn, who stepped down from his post
after being charged in  New York  state court, has denied any
wrongdoing in both cases.  Henri Leclerc, a lawyer for Strauss-Kahn, didn’t return
calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecution
didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  Earlier today, Banon met with Paris police investigating
her complaint, which isn’t a public document under French
procedure. She claimed in an interview published in the July 6
issue of L’Express magazine that Strauss-Kahn assaulted her in
February 2003 when she met him at an apartment in Paris for an
interview related to a book she was researching.  Strauss-Kahn called Banon’s claims “imaginary” in a
statement by his lawyer last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
