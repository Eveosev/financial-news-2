Australian home-loan approvals rose
for a second straight month in May as construction of new
dwellings and demand from investors increased.  The number of loans granted to build or buy houses and
apartments gained 4.4 percent from April, when they increased a
revised 4.6 percent, the statistics bureau said in Sydney today.
That compares with the median estimate for approvals to rise 4.5
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 15 economists.  The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  earlier this month held the
official cash rate target at 4.75 percent, the seventh straight
meeting of inaction. Floods disruptions across Queensland state
and in parts of New South Wales in the first three months of the
year have subsided, allowing housing projects to be restarted,
economists said.  “Cheaper homes and a stable rate outlook are enticing
buyers back into the market after sitting on the sidelines” in
the first quarter of the year, said Roland Randall, an economist
at TD Securities Inc. in Singapore, in a report before today’s
data were released.  The total value of loans increased 2.9 percent to A$20.5
billion ($21.9 billion) in May, today’s report showed.  The value of lending to owner-occupiers advanced 2.2
percent, the report showed. The value of loans to investors who
plan to rent or resell homes rose 4.4 percent.  First-home buyers accounted for 15.4 percent of dwellings
that were financed in May, down from 15.8 percent in April and
lower than 16.5 percent a year earlier, the report showed.  To contact the reporter for this story:
