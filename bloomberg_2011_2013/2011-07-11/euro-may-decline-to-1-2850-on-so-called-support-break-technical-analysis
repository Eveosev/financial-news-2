The euro may decline as low as
$1.2850 should it breach a key support level, according to
Market Securities, citing technical indicators.  “Euro-dollar at $1.3900 is the key line in the sand,”
said Paul Day, chief strategist at Market Securities in  London ,
today. “A qualified break there may target a move toward
$1.2850 over the next three months.”  The $1.3900 support represents “a TD propulsion momentum
level on the weekly charts,” Day said in a telephone interview.
“If we get a qualified break there, it suggests we get down to
the exhaustion level, which is $1.2859.”  The Tom DeMark Propulsion Momentum Target is a technical
indicator that operates on the premise that repetitive price
movements in the same direction have a tendency to replicate one
another.  The euro depreciated 1 percent to $1.4126 as of 11:34 a.m.
in London. It fell to $1.4109 earlier, the lowest level since
June 27. The  currency pair  reached $1.2867 on Jan. 10, the
lowest level since Sept. 14, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  A support level is an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency and its related
instruments. The stronger the support, the more selling is
needed to drop below that level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
