Stillwater Mining Co. (SWC) , a platinum
producer in  Montana , fell 22 percent after agreeing to pay $487
million in cash and shares to buy  Peregrine Metals Ltd. (PGM) , owner
of a copper and gold project in Argentina.  Stillwater will acquire all outstanding shares of
Vancouver-based Peregrine by exchanging 0.08136 of a share of
Stillwater common stock and $1.35 in cash for each share of
Peregrine stock, the companies said in a joint statement.  The deal is expected to close in 90 days. Peregrine must
pay Stillwater $13.4 million if the deal collapses, said the
statement.  “This transaction will transform Stillwater into a leading
American mid-cap diversified mining company with a unique
precious metal and copper production profile,” Francis McAllister, chief executive officer of Stillwater, said on a
conference call.  Peregrine’s Altar project, a mine in western  Argentina , has
the potential to produce an average of about 280 million pounds
(127 million kilograms) of copper a year and may contain 1.5
million ounces (43 million grams) of gold, McAllister said.
Stillwater plans to invest $75 million in Altar over three
years.  Stillwater, based in Billings, Montana, dropped $5.26, or
22 percent, to $18.46 at 4:15 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, while Peregrine more than tripled in
Toronto trading to C$2.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
