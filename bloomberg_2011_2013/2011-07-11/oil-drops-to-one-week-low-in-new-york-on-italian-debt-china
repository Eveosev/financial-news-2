Oil fell to the lowest level in a
week in  New York  as concern that the European debt crisis will
spread to  Italy  caused the euro to tumble against the dollar and
a report showed Chinese imports slumped.  Oil dropped 1.1 percent as the euro slid to a seven-week
low against the dollar after  Germany ’s Die Welt said the
European Central Bank is forecasting a regional bailout fund may
have to double to cover a crisis in Italy. Data showing a 10
percent decline in Chinese imports stoked concern that fuel
demand in the biggest crude-consuming countries will wane in the
wake of a U.S. employment report on July 8.  “There’s some pressure on oil from concerns in the euro
zone,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc. in New York. “The euro got hit pretty good. The
negative jobs data in the U.S. from last week has cast a
negative cloud over the market, and there continues to be some
signs of slowing in  China .”  Crude for August delivery fell $1.05 to settle at $95.15 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest level
since July 1. Prices have risen 25 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement declined $1.09, or 0.9
percent, to $117.24 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $22.09 a barrel to U.S. futures, 20 cents below the
settlement record of $22.29 from June 15.  European Bailout Fund  Euro-area countries may have to double their bailout fund
to 1.5 trillion euros ($2.1 trillion), according to Die Welt,
which cited unidentified “high-ranking” people at European
central banks.  A meeting of EU and European Commission chiefs today was
expanded to include  European Central Bank  President  Jean-Claude Trichet , Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  and
European Economic Commissioner Olli Rehn.  The euro dropped 1.7 percent to $1.4017 at 3:12 p.m. in New
York. Earlier, it touched $1.3987, the lowest intraday price
since May 23. A weaker euro and stronger dollar curb the appeal
of commodities as an alternative investment to the U.S.
currency.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
tumbled 0.9 percent, the most in more than two weeks, to 679.56.
Nineteen of the commodities fell.  Chinese Imports  Government reports in China showed net oil imports shrank
10 percent in June to the lowest level in eight months,
according to Bloomberg calculations, while inflation surged to a
three-year high. The U.S. Labor Department reported July 8 that
the  unemployment rate  rose to the highest level this year in
June.  The U.S. and China are the two largest oil-consuming
countries.  China imported 19.7 million metric tons and exported
270,000 tons of crude, customs data showed. Net imports of fuel,
including gasoline and diesel, rose to 1.36 million tons in June
from 930,000 tons in May, according to the data. Net purchases
reached a 29-month high of 2.07 million tons in December.  “We have a confluence of factors today, weak U.S. payroll
data, Italian bank concerns and the Chinese trade data,” said
Serene Lim, a commodity strategist with Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore .  U.S. payrolls increased by 18,000 in June, the Labor
Department data showed July 8. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a gain of 105,000. The jobless
rate rose to 9.2 percent.  U.S. Equities Slip  U.S. equities also tumbled on the Italian concern and
Chinese inflation report. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell
1.8 percent to 1,319.49 at 4:03 p.m. in New York. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  dropped 151.44 points, or 1.2 percent, to
12,505.76.  Oil futures in New York have fallen 3.6 percent since
settling at a three-week high of $98.67 on July 7.  Net-long bets on crude gained by 12,343 futures and options
combined, or 8.1 percent, to 165,491, in the seven days ended
July 5, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report released late July 8.  On the ICE Futures Europe exchange,  hedge funds  and other
money managers increased their net-long Brent crude position in
the week ended July 5. Speculative bets that prices will rise,
in futures and options combined, outnumbered short positions by
67,782 contracts, the London-based exchange said today in its
weekly Commitment of Traders report. Net long positions rose by
24,474 contracts from a week earlier.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 510,728
contracts as of 3:14 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 692,799
contracts July 8, 0.8 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.53 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
