Kenya’s All-Share Index declined for

p.m. close in Nairobi, the lowest since March 2010.  Mauritius’s SEMDEX Index retreated for a second day,
retreating 0.5 percent, the biggest decline since May 23, to
2,089.37 by the 1:30 p.m. close in  Port Louis . The Nigerian
Stock Exchange All-Share Index weakened for a second day,
slumping 0.5 percent to 24,181.57 by the 2:30 p.m. close in
Lagos, according to an e-mailed statement from the bourse.
Namibia’s FTSE/ Namibia Overall Index (FTN098)  declined for the second
day, sliding 1.1 percent to 844.36 at the 4 p.m. close in
Windhoek, the lowest level since June 29. The Ghana Stock

than 0.1 percent to 1,185.01 by the 3 p.m. close in Accra, the

excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON)  , a Nigerian lender
bailed out by the  central bank  in 2009, gained 5 kobo, or 5
percent, the most since March 14, to 1.06 naira, after the
 Central Bank of Nigeria  approved an acquisition implementation
plan worked out by Access Bank Plc and Intercontinental.  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC KN), a Kenyan fuel retailer with
operations in nine African countries, dropped 15 cents, or 1.3
percent, to 11.85 shillings, retreating from a 4 1/2-year high
on speculation its gains were overdone. The company’s 14-day
relative strength index has been above 70, a signal to some
analysts that the stock price is poised to drop, since June 15.  “This was to be expected,” George Bodo, an equity
strategist at Nairobi-based Apex  Africa  Ltd., said by phone
today.  “When it hit 12 shillings it was a trigger for people
to start taking gains and there is going to be further downward
correction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
