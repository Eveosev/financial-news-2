The number of foreign direct
investment projects in the U.K. declined for a second year,
falling 11 percent in the year ended March 31.  The U.S. remained the single largest investor in Britain,
with 388 out of 1,434 projects, according to U.K. Trade and
Investment, the body that promotes British business abroad. The
projects generated 94,500 jobs, little changed from a year
earlier.  “The international context remains quite a difficult
one,” Business Secretary Vince Cable told reporters. “There’s
been a big fall in mergers and acquisitions activity generally.
That has a significant impact on the numbers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
