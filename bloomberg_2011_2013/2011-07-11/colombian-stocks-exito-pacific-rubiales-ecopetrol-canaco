The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:25 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1.8 percent to 13,499.24, the lowest
since August, while the Colcap Index dropped 1.8 percent to
1,626.82 as global stocks sank on concern Europe’s debt crisis
will spread.  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  , Colombia’s biggest publicly
traded retailer, fell 2.2 percent to 22,500 pesos, a six-month
low. The company dropped for a fourth consecutive day after
Exito shareholders approved plans to raise as much as $1.4
billion by selling new shares and to buy a stake in Uruguayan
supermarkets from majority shareholder Casino Guichard-Perrachon
SA, according to a July 6 regulatory filing.  Oil companies fell as crude dropped and as investors free
up funds to buy offerings such as last month’s share sale by
Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA CB), Colombia’s largest food producer,
and planned sales by  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR) 
(GRUPOSUR),  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)   and Exito, said Juan David Pineros, analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s largest brokerage.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based

to 44,440 pesos, the lowest in almost 10 months.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL CB), Colombia’s biggest  oil company ,
