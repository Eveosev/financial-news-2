Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to a
two-week low, wiping out its gains since the central bank raised
the overnight lending rate on June 29 to halt its retreat, as
companies bought dollars.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy lost as much
as 0.4 percent to 90.45 against the dollar, and traded down 0.3
percent at 90.35 per dollar by 3:35 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at
this level would be the weakest since June 27 and leaves the
currency 0.2 lower than it was when the bank lifted lending
rates.  “The shilling is under pressure with residual demand from
businesses, which had expected it to strengthen due to the tight
liquidity in the market,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at
Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today. He
expects a trading range of 89.75 to 90.50 per dollar.  The shilling strengthened 2 percent from June 29, when the
Central Bank of Kenya raised its overnight lending rate, through
to July 4. The overnight lending rate increase was aimed at
reining in inflationary expectations and curbing speculative
trade in the shilling, which reached the weakest in 17 years on
June 22. The central bank also blocked the use of funds borrowed
from the overnight window to trade in the foreign-exchange
market.  “The money market was tight during the week with
commercial banks borrowing 97.73 billion shillings ($1.07
billion) from the central bank overnight compared with 102.22
billion shillings in the previous week,” the central bank said
in its weekly statement on July 8.  The overnight rate, which is reviewed daily, remained at 8
percent today, according to the Nairobi-based bank’s website  To contact the reporter on this story:
