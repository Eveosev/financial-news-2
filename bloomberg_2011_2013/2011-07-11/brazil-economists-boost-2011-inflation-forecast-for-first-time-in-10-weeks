Economists covering the Brazilian
economy raised their 2011 inflation forecast for the first time
in 10 weeks after prices rose faster than expected in June.  Consumer prices will rise 6.31 percent this year, according
to the median forecast in a July 8  central bank survey  of about
100 economists published today. The figure was up from 6.15
percent the previous week.  Economists also raised their prediction for 2012 inflation.
Prices, as measured by the IPCA index, will rise 5.20 percent
next year, the survey found, compared with a forecast of 5.10
percent the previous week. The June inflation number increased
doubts that the central bank will hit its targets, said Pedro Tuesta, a Washington-based economist for  Latin America  at 4Cast
Inc.  “The market has started to talk about how the central bank
isn’t going to make it,” Tuesta said in a telephone interview.
“More and more people are thinking that inflation inertia,
especially on service prices, will push 2012 inflation up.”  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini told a Senate
hearing last week that inflation will peak in August. Tombini
reiterated that he expects to achieve his goal of 4.5 percent
inflation by 2012, and said that steps already taken by the bank
to cool the economy will take time to be fully felt.  Benchmark Rate  Policy makers raised  interest rates  for a fourth
consecutive meeting last month, boosting the benchmark lending
rate a quarter-point to 12.25 percent.  Economists expect the bank to raise the rate to 12.75
percent by the end of this year, from a week earlier forecast of
12.50 percent, the survey found.  Consumer prices rose 6.71 percent in June from a year ago,
led by increases in food and fuel costs. Consumer prices rose
0.15 percent in June from May, while service prices rose 0.67
percent. Commodities prices rose 31.65 percent in June from a
year ago, according to an index published by the central bank.
The government targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus
two percentage points.  Economists held their forecast for 2011 economic growth at
3.94 percent, and their 2012 growth forecast at 4.1 percent.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, was unchanged
at 12.710 percent at 8:07 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
