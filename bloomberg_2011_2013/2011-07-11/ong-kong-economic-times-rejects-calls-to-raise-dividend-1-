Hong Kong Economic Times Holdings
Ltd. (423)  has rejected an investor’s demand to increase dividend
payments and said it will need cash to face rising competition
in the media.  H Partners Management LLC, which holds a 14.8 percent stake
in the company, said in a newspaper notice that the publisher
should raise ordinary dividend payments and give a special
dividend.  Hong Kong Economic Times ’s policy on dividends is
“fair” and “prudent,” the company said in a statement to the
 Hong Kong  stock exchange today.  The Hong Kong-based publisher’s full-year net income almost
doubled last year as the city’s growing economy helped sales
rebound to the level before the financial crisis in 2008. The
company needs cash reserves for development and to stave off
increased competition, particularly from new media, Economic
Times said.  New York-based H Partners said the publisher doesn’t need
to retain its cash holdings of HK$500 million. The company’s
cash level is not “unreasonably high,” Economic Times said in
the filing today.  Economic Times advanced 7.7 percent to HK$3.49 in Hong Kong
trading as of 2:12 p.m., the highest level since March 2008. The
stock has gained 25 percent this year, outperforming the city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)  H Partners values the shares at
HK$6.64 each, according to the notice.  Hong Kong’s gross domestic product increased 7.2 percent in
the first three months of this year, compared with a year
earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
