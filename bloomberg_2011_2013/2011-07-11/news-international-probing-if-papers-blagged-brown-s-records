News International, the Rupert
Murdoch-owned publishers of the Sun, the Times and the Sunday
Times newspapers, said it will investigate whether its
journalists broke the law to obtain the bank, medical and legal
records of former Prime Minister  Gordon Brown .  The Guardian reported  that both the Sunday Times and the
Sun obtained files using techniques known as “blagging,” where
people impersonate someone over the phone in order to access
private information. Previously, only the News of the World,
which published its final edition yesterday, was implicated in a
scandal triggered by allegations that reporters hacked into the
voicemail of crime victims.  The Sun obtained details of the private medical files of
Brown’s son Fraser, while someone working for the Sunday Times
acquired Brown’s legal records and tried to gain access to bank
records, the Guardian said.  “We note the allegations made today concerning the
reporting of matters relating to Gordon Brown,” the company
said in an e-mailed statement. “So that we can investigate
these matters further, we ask that all information concerning
these allegations is provided to us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
