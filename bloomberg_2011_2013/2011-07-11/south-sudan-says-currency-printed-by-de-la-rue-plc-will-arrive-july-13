South  Sudan ’s new currency, printed
by  De La Rue Plc (DLAR) , the world’s biggest printer of banknotes, will
arrive on July 13, Finance Minister David Deng Athorbei said.  The South Sudan pound will be equal in value to the Sudan
pound, Athorbei told reporters today in Juba, the newly
independent nation’s capital. The Sudanese pound currently
trades at about 2.67 to the dollar, according to the  Central
Bank of Sudan , while on the parallel market it sells at about
3.3 to the greenback.  The Bank of  Southern Sudan , the central bank, will keep any
Sudanese pound notes it receives and will start issuing the new
currency when withdrawals are made, Athorbei said.  South Sudan became independent on July 9, six years after
the end of a two-decade civil war with the north that killed as
many as 2 million people. The country of 8 million people now
controls about 75 percent of Sudan’s daily production of 490,000
barrels of oil, pumped mainly by China National Petroleum Corp.,
 Malaysia ’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and India’s Oil & Natural Gas
Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
