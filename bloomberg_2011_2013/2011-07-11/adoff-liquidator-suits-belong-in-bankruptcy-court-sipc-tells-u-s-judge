The Securities Investor Protection
Corp. opposed a move by investors in Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi
scheme to seek a U.S. district judge’s review of lawsuits by the
Madoff firm’s liquidator, who is seeking to recapture so-called
fictitious profits.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in  Manhattan  agreed last
month to review so-called clawback actions against James Greiff
and other investors. Their lawyer, Helen Chaitman, said the
suits violate investor protection and securities laws. SIPC said
the profits belong to other investors, and the job of taking
them back should be handled in  bankruptcy court .  “The motion is an unwarranted attempt to remove to this
court matters within the bankruptcy court’s core jurisdiction
and competence,” SIPC told Rakoff in a court filing today.  The case is Picard v. Greiff, 11-cv-3775, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
