Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as the biofuel’s discount to gasoline and the
possible elimination of a blender’s tax credit buoy demand.  The gasoline alternative was steady as refiners use more of
the additive to capture ethanol’s 35.75-cent discount to the
motor fuel and the 45-cent tax credit for each gallon of the two
blended together. A group of U.S. senators is seeking to end the
incentive July 31.  “We’ve been continuing to see a lot of strong demand for
ethanol, whether it’s from people getting out ahead of
legislation, the blender’s spread or potential exports,” said
Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management Inc. in
Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 0.6 cent to
settle at $2.713 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures
have gained 70 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast gained
7.5 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.915 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive increased 1.5 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.775,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slipped 0.5 cent to $2.855 a gallon and
in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel lost 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.745.  To contact the reporter on this story:
