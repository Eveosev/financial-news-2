House Speaker  John Boehner  said he
agrees that the U.S. debt limit must be raised and the
government can’t be allowed to default on its debts, but he also
said Democrats are not serious enough about trimming entitlement
programs.  Boehner, an Ohio Republican, reiterated to reporters that
the Republican-dominated House won’t pass a tax increase as part
of a deficit-cutting plan. He spoke before heading to the White
House for today’s negotiating session with President  Barack
Obama  and other congressional leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
