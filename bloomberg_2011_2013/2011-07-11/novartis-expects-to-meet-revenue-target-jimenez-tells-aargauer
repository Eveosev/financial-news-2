Novartis AG (NOVN)  expects to meet its goal
of increasing revenue at least 10 percent in 2011 and improving
its profitability, assuming constant exchange rates, Chief
Executive Officer Joe Jimenez told  Aargauer Zeitung .  The company is interested in further acquisitions, Jimenez
said in an interview published today by the Aarau, Switzerland-
based newspaper. Novartis’s priority is to reduce its debt after
buying a stake in Alcon Inc., Jimenez was quoted as saying. The
drugmaker should be able to do that “quickly” via its strong
 cash flow , the CEO added, according to Aargauer Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
