Turkey ’s benchmark ISE National 100
Index fell the most in almost three weeks, losing 686.68, or 1.1
percent, to 62,909.49 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Gozde Finansal Hizmetler AS (GOZFN)  , the financial
services company owned by Yildiz Holding, jumped 53 kurus, or 15
percent, to 3.99 liras, a record high. Gozde had dropped 7.1
percent on June 8 after Yildiz registered shares in the company
for sale. The shares were listed for procedural reasons and
Yildiz has no plans to sell them, it said in a statement over
the weekend.  Trabzonspor Sportif Yatirim & Futbol Isletmeciligi TAS
(TSPOR TI), the second-place finisher in last year’s Turkish
soccer league, plunged the most in more than a year, retreating
3.15 liras, or 15 percent, to 17.85 liras. Sadri Sener, chairman
of the club, was detained in a probe into a match-fixing
scandal, state-run Anatolia news agency reported today.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  , Turkey’s biggest
lender by market capitalization, lost 16 kurus, or 2.1 percent,
to 7.38 liras. Turkey’s ballooning current-account deficit more
than doubled to $7.8 billion in May from a year earlier, the
central bank said in a statement on its website today. The
central bank says it wants to control the deficit by attacking
Turkey’s domestic lending boom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
