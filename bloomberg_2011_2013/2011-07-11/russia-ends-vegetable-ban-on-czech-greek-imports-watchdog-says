Russia will accept vegetable imports
from  Czech Republic  and Greece, and review an import ban from
other European countries, which was set up in response to an E.
coli outbreak, according to the country’s consumer safety
watchdog’s website.  Russia prohibited all fresh-vegetable imports from the 27-
nation EU on June 2 after the E. coli outbreak began in Germany.
At least 4,023 people across  Europe  have been infected and 44
died of the disease.  Vegetables from Czech Republic and Greece can be imported
to Russia providing they meet safety requirements, according to
the watchdog’s website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
