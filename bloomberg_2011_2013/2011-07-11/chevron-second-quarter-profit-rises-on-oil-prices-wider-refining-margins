Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said second-quarter profit rose from the
prior period on higher  oil prices  and wider refining margins.  Oil and natural-gas production increased to the equivalent
of 2.733 million barrels a day in April and May, a 1.3 percent
increase from a year earlier, based on full-quarter results, 
the  San Ramon , California-based company said in a statement. 
Chevron earned $6.21 billion in the first three months of this 
year.  The company is expected to report $7.1 billion in net
income for the April-to-June period, according to the average
estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Chevron is
scheduled to disclose full second-quarter results on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
