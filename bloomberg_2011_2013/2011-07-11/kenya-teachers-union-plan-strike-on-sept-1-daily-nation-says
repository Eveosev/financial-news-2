The Kenya National Union of Teachers
plan to strike on Sept. 1 if their requests, including the
hiring of new teachers, arenâ€™t met, the  Daily Nation  reported,
citing chairman  Wilson Sosion .  The union canceled a strike on July 1 after holding talks
with the Teachers Service Commission and Treasury, which
promised to resolve the issues within two weeks, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said.  The union wants 8.4 billion shillings ($93 million)
reallocated for hiring teachers, 4.4 billion shillings to move
contract teachers to permanent positions with pension payments,
and 3.6 billion shillings for hiring 10,000 new teachers this
year, the Daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
