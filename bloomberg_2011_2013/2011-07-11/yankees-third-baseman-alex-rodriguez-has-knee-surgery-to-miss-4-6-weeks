Alex Rodriguez  of the  New York
Yankees  had arthroscopic knee surgery that will keep him out of
action for four to six weeks.  The All-Star third baseman had the surgery today at the
University of Miami in Florida to repair a torn meniscus in his
right knee. The procedure went as expected and there were no
complications, Yankees spokesman Michael Margolis said in an e-
mail.  Lee Kaplan performed the surgery and will oversee the
initial rehabilitation in Miami, according to Margolis.  Rodriguez, 35, was injured in a road game against the
Chicago Cubs on June 19. The No. 6 player on the  all-time  home-
run list with 626, Rodriguez hasn’t hit a homer in 85 at-bats,
the longest single-season drought of his career.  Eduardo Nunez  may fill in at third base in the American
League’s three-time Most Valuable Player’s absence. Nunez, 24,
hit .339 while starting 17 games at shortstop while Derek Jeter
was on the disabled list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
