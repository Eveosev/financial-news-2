European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said encouraging  Greece  to
implement fiscal reforms is of the essence.  “Currently, it is surely important to demand extreme
discipline and observance of contract terms from a country like
Greece,” Nowotny said in a speech in Vienna today. At the same
time,  Mexico  has shown that “the recipe for success in such
crises is having time. Tough structural changes can’t be
implemented from one day to the next but need to be observed
over a longer period of time.”  Nowotny also said rating companies’ assessment of a
country’s creditworthiness can have “dramatic pro-cyclical
effects” and is seen “critically” by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development. “Now is the time to act
with a clear head, clear perspectives and a calm hand.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
