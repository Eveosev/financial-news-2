Canadian natural gas rose as
forecasts for above-normal temperatures in the U.S. Midwest
signaled stronger demand for exports of the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , rose 2.6
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland,
predicted the U.S. Midwest will have hotter-than-normal weather
until at least July 22.  “Probably most of what you’re seeing is the heat causing
the market to rise,”  Michael Rose , director of energy trading
at Angus Jackson Inc. in  Fort Lauderdale , Florida, said in a
telephone interview. “There are a lot of people who are short
this market into what’s normally not a very good short period,
which is the  hurricane season , so there’s a propensity to have a
little bit of a bid to the market.”  Alberta gas for August delivery gained 8.75 cents to C$3.48
per gigajoule ($3.44 per million British thermal units) as of
2:25 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. September gas advanced 7.25 cents to C$3.45. Gas traded
on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and is
priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas on the Nymex rose 8.3 cents, or 2 percent, to
settle at $4.288 per million Btu.  Cooling Demand  Cooling demand will be 37 percent higher than normal in
Chicago and 79 percent above normal in Denver until at least
July 18, said Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  The high in Des Moines, Iowa, today may be 92 degrees
Fahrenheit (33 Celsius), 6 degrees above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. of  State College , Pennsylvania.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, and
industrial consumers account for about 28 percent, according to
Energy Department estimates.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.2 billion cubic
feet as of 11 a.m. in  New York .  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.85 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.77 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 672 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.66 billion cubic feet today, about 71 percent of its
capacity of 2.34 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
gained 19.87 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $4.4628 per million Btu
as of 1:22 p.m. New York time today on the Intercontinental
Exchange. Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas jumped 16.44 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $4.1256.  To contact the reporter on this story:
