Tikehau Investment Management , a
French asset manager, said it will start three new funds by the
end of the year after adding 300 million euros ($424 million)
under management in the first half.  The funds will include investments in mezzanine debt and
sustainable commercial real estate, according to a statement
from Paris-based Tikehau. The group said it aims to boost assets
under management to more than 1 billion euros in 2012 from about
600 million euros currently across seven funds.  Tikehauâ€™s strategy focuses on credit markets, investing in
bonds, loans, and private debt, according to the statement.
Mezzanine debt is used to finance leveraged buyouts, ranking
behind senior debt and sometimes offered with equity stakes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
