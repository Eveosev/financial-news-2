ITRI Ltd. , a tin industry group,
will work with Burundi to implement the ITRI Tin Supply Chain
Initiative to help stem purchases of tin used to fund conflict.  The initiative, also known as iTSCi, is aimed at improving
transparency of the tin supply chain from high risk or conflict
affected areas to eradicate “conflict minerals” from the tin
industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
