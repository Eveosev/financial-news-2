Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
Toronto-based oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia ,
said its Meta Petroleum Corp. subsidiary was granted
environmental permits for northern and southwest parts of the
Quifa field.  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Pantin spoke in a phone
interview from Bogota today. Rubiales has slid 8 percent since
July 5, when the government said it was investigating
whether Meta began building an encampment and an area for waste
disposal without submitting an environmental management plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
