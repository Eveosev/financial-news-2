Bralirwa SA, a locally listed
Rwandan unit of  Heineken NV (HEIA) , will raise the price of its
biggest-selling beers to compensate for the rising cost of
importing corn, malt and sugar into the country.  The Kigali-based company will increase the price of a 720
milliliter bottle of its Primus brand by 17 percent to 700
Rwandan francs ($1.16) and a 650 milliliter bottle of its Mutzig
brand 13 percent to 900 francs,  Alexander Koch , the company’s
commercial director, told reporters in Kigali today.  The two brands account for more than 50 percent of
Bralirwa’s sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
