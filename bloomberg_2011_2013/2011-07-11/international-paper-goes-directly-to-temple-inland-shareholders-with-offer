International Paper Co. (IP) , the world’s
largest pulp-and-paper maker, is taking its $3.31 billion
takeover bid for  Temple-Inland Inc. (TIN)  directly to shareholders
with a tender offer for all outstanding shares.  The $30.60-a-share proposal, which follows International
Paper’s all-cash buyout bid on June 6, begins tomorrow and
expires on Aug. 9 at 5 p.m. New York time, the Memphis,
Tennessee-based company said today in a statement.  International Paper said its offer is backed by committed
finance from UBS AG. Temple-Inland, an Austin, Texas-based rival
maker of containerboard used in shipping boxes, has said the
takeover bid undervalued the company.  “Temple-Inland’s price expectations are unrealistic and
their unwillingness to engage in any meaningful discussions with
respect to value has left us with no alternative but to make our
offer directly to Temple-Inland shareholders,” International
Paper Chief Executive Officer John Faraci said in the statement.  Temple-Inland’s directors will review the tender offer and
make a formal recommendation to shareholders within 10 business
days, the company said in a statement. Temple-Inland advised the
shareholders to take no action until the board has completed its
review.  International Paper’s tender offer was announced after the
close of regular trading on U.S. markets. Temple-Inland rose 5
cents to $30.60 at 5:13 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
