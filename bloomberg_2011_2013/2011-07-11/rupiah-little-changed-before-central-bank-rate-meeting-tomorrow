Indonesia ’s rupiah declined,
snapping a two day rally, as lingering doubts about the ability
of European nations to repay debt damped appetite for riskier
emerging-market assets.  The currency fell the most in almost a week after the
Jakarta Composite Index dropped 0.2 percent, ending two days of
gains. Regional stocks fell on speculation overseas investors
are paring holdings of emerging-market assets on concern the
 European Central Bank  will seek financial assistance for Italy
as well as Greece. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares
declined 1.2 percent.  “The crisis in  Europe  isn’t over yet,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta.
“That’s driving the negative sentiment.”  The rupiah lost 0.2 percent to 8,534 per dollar as of 4:42
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the biggest one-day drop since July 6.  All 14 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predict the
central bank will keep its key lending rate unchanged for a
fifth month at 6.75 percent.  Bank Indonesia  raised its  reference
rate  by 25 basis points in February, the only move this year.  Ten-year benchmark bonds fell, ending eight days of rally,
the longest winning streak since October. The yield on 8.25
percent notes due July 2021 climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.28 percent, according to prices from the
Inter- Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
