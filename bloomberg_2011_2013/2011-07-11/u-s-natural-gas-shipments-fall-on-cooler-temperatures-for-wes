Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators fell on forecasts for cooler
temperatures in the West that would reduce demand for the fuel
to power air conditioners.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments dropped 2.6 percent to 20.3
million dekatherms (19.7 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in
California dropped 6 percent.  Below-normal temperatures are forecast for the West Coast
from July 12 to July 16, MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg,
Maryland, said in a note to clients.  Cooling demand in  San Francisco  and Seattle will be zero
until at least July 18, said Weather Derivatives, based in
Belton, Missouri. Power plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The high in  Los Angeles  today may reach 77 degrees
Fahrenheit (25 Celsius), 6 degrees below normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. of  State College , Pennsylvania.  Scheduled gas shipments for U.S. residences fell 2 percent
to 21.9 million dekatherms after a 13 percent drop yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the SoCal Border hub, where gas is
delivered to California, advanced 18.17 cents, or 4.3 percent,
to $4.4242 per million British thermal units on the
 Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
rose 15.98 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $4.353 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
