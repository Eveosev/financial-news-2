CME Group Inc., the world’s largest
futures exchange, said it will start yuan contracts to meet
rising demand among global investors for products denominated in
the Chinese currency.  Trading of the futures, which will be listed on the CME
exchange, is due to begin Aug. 22 for September 2011 settlement,
the Chicago-based group said in a statement released in
 Singapore  yesterday. The contracts will be quoted in interbank
terms, reflecting the number of yuan per dollar, it said.  “We see the success of these new contracts following a
similar pattern to that of our other emerging-markets products
such as Russian ruble and Brazilian real,” Roger Rutherford,
London-based managing director of foreign-exchange products at
CME, said in the statement. “Given the yuan’s movement toward
greater convertibility and the growing offshore trade of the
currency in  Hong Kong ,” the products will enable customers to
manage  currency risk , he said.  Futures contracts in the ruble and real have seen year-to-
date growth of 350 percent and 450 percent respectively, the
statement said. CME foreign-exchange volumes averaged 930,000
contracts per day in 2010, up 49 percent versus 2009, reflecting
average daily notional value of $120 billion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
