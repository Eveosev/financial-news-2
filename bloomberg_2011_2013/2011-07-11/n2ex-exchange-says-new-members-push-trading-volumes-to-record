N2EX, the U.K. power market
exchange, said weekly traded volume rose to a record because of
a boost from its recent members.  “We are very satisfied to see a firm increase in liquidity
on the  N2EX  total auction volume, as new members are joining the
marketplace and activity increases as a result,” Oslo-based
Hans Randen, director European integration, Nord Pool Spot AS,
said in an e-mailed note.  N2EX is a joint venture between Nasdaq Group Inc. and Nord
Pool Spot AS. The exchange opened in 2010 and has 31 members
trading on its platform. It handled 258.14 gigawatt-hours last
week and 4,547.14 gigawatt-hours this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Sarah Halls in London at in London at
