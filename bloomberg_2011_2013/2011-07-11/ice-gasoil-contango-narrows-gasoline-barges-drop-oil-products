The gasoil contango, or price spread
between first- and second-month contracts, narrowed to the least
in a month on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. BP Plc sold
jet fuel barges to Vitol Group.  Gasoil futures gained on ICE, paring earlier losses.
Gasoline for immediate delivery dropped.  Light Products  Gasoline in northwest Europe traded from $1,032 to $1,044 a
metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts
pricing window.  That’s down from the lowest trade of $1,047 on July 8 on
the barge market, where lots are for 1,000 or 2,000 tons. Those
prices are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added before
being sold to motorists.  Premium grade traded from $1,039 to $1,046 a ton, the
survey showed.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent, or crack, widened to $7.84 a
barrel as of 4:51 p.m. local time, according to PVM Oil

or 0.6 percent, to $968.50 a ton as of 4:54 p.m.  London  time.

little as $952. Gasoil is mainly is used in heating.  The gasoil contango narrowed. A market is described as
being in contango when contracts closest to expiry trade at less
than later-dated contracts. A shrinking contango usually signals

today from $3.75 at the end of last week. August’s
discount to September narrowed to $1.75 from $2.25 at the end of
last week.  Heating oil barges traded at premiums from $26.50 to $27 a
ton, the survey showed. Those prices are for fuel with no more
than 50 parts per million of sulfur.  Jet fuel dropped as BP sold to Vitol at $1,047 a ton the
survey showed. Vitol bought a barge at $1,055 on July 8.  Residues  Low-sulfur fuel oil traded from $684 to $688 a ton, while
its more polluting equivalent traded from $633 to $634.50 a ton,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Low-sulfur fuel oil is used to power ships and generate
electricity while the high-sulfur grade is only used in
shipping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
