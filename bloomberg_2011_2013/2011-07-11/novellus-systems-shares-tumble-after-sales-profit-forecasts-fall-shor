Novellus Systems Inc. (NVLS) , a maker of
machinery used in semiconductor production, dropped in extended
trading after forecasting third-quarter sales and profit that
fell short of analysts’ estimates.  Profit before certain costs in the current period will be
60 cents to 75 cents a share, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Rick Hill said on a conference call with analysts today.
That compares with the average analyst estimate of 84 cents,
based on a Bloomberg survey. Sales will be $300 million to $340
million, Hill said, while analysts had predicted $360.7 million.  Chipmakers are showing a more cautious tone in orders from
San Jose, California-based Novellus, and may hold off purchases
until 2012, Hill said on the call.  Novellus shares fell as much as 6.3 percent to $33.50 in
extended trading following the forecast. They had declined 20
cents to $35.77 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
