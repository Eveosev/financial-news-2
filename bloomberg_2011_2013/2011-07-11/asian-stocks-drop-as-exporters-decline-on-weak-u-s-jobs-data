Asian stocks fell, with the regional
benchmark index headed for its biggest drop in three weeks, as
U.S. unemployment unexpectedly increased, dimming the outlook
for the global economic recovery and exporters’ earnings.  Samsung Electronics Co., which gets about 22 percent of
sales from America, slid 2.3 percent in  Seoul  as U.S. nonfarm
payrolls rose at the slowest pace in nine months.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) ,
a supplier of toys and clothes that counts the U.S. as its
biggest market, sank 3.8 percent in  Hong Kong .  MacArthur Coal
Ltd. (MCC) ,  BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL)  and  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  led declines
among Australian companies after the government announced the
country’s first tax on greenhouse-gas emissions.  “After the recent rally, structural problems are still
there,” said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-based  fund manager  at
Schroders Plc, which oversaw $323 billion as of March 31. “Jobs
data in the U.S. continue to point to anemic growth. While
 Greece ’s debt problems have been pushed out, eventually it will
come back to haunt us.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 1.2 percent to 136.77
as of 6 p.m. in  Tokyo , headed for its steepest drop since June
16. Three stocks fell for each that rose on the measure. The
gauge last week extended its rally to a third week as European
Union leaders hammered out proposals to roll over debt to
prevent Greece from defaulting and after reports showed retail
sales in the U.S. increased in June, and initial claims for
unemployment benefits declined.  Australia  Leads Drop  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average slid 0.7 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 1.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index declined 1.7 percent.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index
gained 0.2 percent, erasing losses of as much as 0.6 percent, on
speculation inflation is peaking.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index sank 1.6 percent after Prime
Minister Julia Gillard said yesterday polluters in Australia
will pay A$23 ($24.74) per metric ton of carbon emissions. The
country relies on coal to generate 80 percent of its electricity.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.9 percent
today. The index dropped 0.7 percent on July 8 as the weakest
American job growth in nine months hurt companies most-closely
tied to the economy.  U.S. payrolls increased by 18,000 in June, less than the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists, which called for growth of 105,000 on average. The
jobless rate rose to a 2011 high of 9.2 percent.  ‘Risk Off’  “Investors had high expectations for the U.S. employment
data, but they were disappointed by the result,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “Investors
will be looking to take some risk off the table.”  Samsung Electronics, South Korea’s No. 1 exporter of
consumer electronics, dropped 2.3 percent to 865,000 won in
Seoul. Li & Fung, the biggest supplier of toys and clothes to
Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., sank 3.8 percent to
HK$14.26 in Hong Kong.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , the largest
seller of home siding in the U.S., slumped 4.6 percent to A$5.80
in Sydney.  Australian coal mining companies and steelmakers dropped
after the government said it will require about 500 businesses
to pay tax on greenhouse-gas emissions, raising A$27.8 billion.  MacArthur Coal declined 2.8 percent to A$11.08. BlueScope
Steel, the No.2 producer of the metal in Australia by market
value, dropped 6.7 percent to A$1.26. Qantas Airways Ltd.,
Australia’s largest airline, fell 3.3 percent to A$1.935 after
saying the tax will cost as much as A$115 million in the year
ending June 30, 2013.  Hastening the ‘Inevitable’  “Companies that are uncompetitive on a global basis are
going to suffer the most,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage
about $1.7 billion at Platypus Asset Management. “Even after
the initial subsidies for certain industries, the carbon tax
will bring forward the inevitable for some, which may be closure
or withdrawal from the industry.”  Separately, Qantas pilots voted in favor of industrial
action, which may include a strike, the Australian and
International Pilots Association said today in Sydney. The
pilots are seeking pay increases and limits to the use on non-
Qantas crewmembers on Qantas-branded flights.  Raw material producers dropped after crude oil and metal
futures fell. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining
company, lost 1.5 percent to A$44.30. Rio Tinto Group, the
second-largest mining company by sales, slid 1.4 percent to
A$83.20. Cnooc Ltd., China’s No. 1 offshore oil and gas producer,
fell 1.5 percent to HK$18.22 in Hong Kong.  Crude oil for August delivery declined 2.5 percent to
settle at $96.20 a barrel in  New York  on July 8, the biggest
drop since June 23. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices
for six metals including copper and aluminum dropped 1.1 percent.  Sportswear, Semiconductors  China Dongxiang Group Co. (3818) , a sportswear retailer, tumbled
16 percent to HK$1.75, the biggest decline on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. The company predicted sales may have dropped by
about 45 percent in the six months ended June 30, compared with
a year earlier.  Competitors also declined. Anta Sports Product Ltd. slumped
8.2 percent to HK$12.48 after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its
rating to “neutral” from “overweight.” Peak Sports Products
Ltd. fell 5.7 percent to HK$4.96.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , the world’s third-largest maker of
computer-memory chips, plunged 13 percent to 787 yen in Tokyo.
The company said it plans to raise 79.7 billion yen ($987
million) selling shares and convertible bonds to fund
investments and pay off debt. Reuters earlier today reported the
sale plan.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.5 percent this year
through July 8, compared with a gain of 6.9 percent by the  S&P
500  and a drop of 0.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
