Canadian stocks fell for a third day
as  crude oil  dropped after analysts in a Bloomberg survey
forecast higher U.S. gasoline supplies and financial shares
declined as U.S. lawmakers failed to agree on deficit reduction.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , the owner of  Canada ’s largest pipeline
system, lost 0.7 percent as crude retreated for a third day.
 Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by assets,
decreased 0.5 percent as U.S. politicians remained unable to
reach a deal to raise the country’s debt ceiling. Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc. advanced 1.5 percent after the U.S. boosted
its corn-stocks forecast by less than most analysts in a
Bloomberg survey had estimated.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 12.81
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,166.94 at 9:46 a.m. in Toronto.
Among stocks in the index, 82 advanced, 165 declined and 13 were
unchanged.  The S&P/TSX dropped the most in five weeks yesterday as
investors speculated the European crisis will spread to  Italy 
and oil and base metals fell. Energy and raw-materials companies
make up 49 percent of Canadian stocks by market value, according
to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
