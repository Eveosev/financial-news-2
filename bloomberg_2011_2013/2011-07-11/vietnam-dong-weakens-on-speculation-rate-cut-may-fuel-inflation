Vietnam ’s dong weakened on
speculation last week’s cut in borrowing costs could fuel
inflation and reduce investor confidence.  The State Bank of Vietnam dropped its benchmark interest
rate by one percentage point on July 4, even after year-on-year
inflation reached 20.8 percent in June, the highest among 17
Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg.  “We see a heightened risk of domestic capital flight,”
Christian de Guzman, a Singapore-based assistant vice president
at Moody’s Investors Service, wrote in a research note released
today. “This will further unhinge inflation expectations and
renew downward pressure on the currency.”  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,590 per dollar as of
4:04 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at
20,608 today, compared with 20,613 on every day last week,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to fluctuate
by as much as 1 percent on either side of that rate.  Government bonds  rose, with the yield on the benchmark
five-year notes declining one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 12.43 percent, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact reporter on this story: Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen in Hanoi
