Gasoline slid to the lowest level in
four weeks after an industry group said that inventories of
products and oil rose last week. Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures fell following the American Petroleum Institute
report that  gasoline  supplies gained 1.94 million barrels last
week,  distillates  increased 3.11 million barrels and  oil
stockpiles  added 4.4 million. Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI
narrowed 27 cents to $24.12 a barrel. July gasoline’s  premium 
over July Brent fell 34 cents to $14.75 at 9:20 a.m.  “The API report pushed the market down,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It was a surprisingly bearish report,
just reaffirmation that weak fundamentals are weighing on the
market.”  Gasoline for June delivery declined 3.34 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.7696 a gallon at 9:18 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.7577, the lowest intraday
level since May 2. Trading volume was 22 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm
of the Energy Department, is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 11 a.m. today in  Washington , a day later than
usual because of the May 27 U.S. Memorial Day holiday. The
report will probably say that gasoline supplies declined 500,000
barrels, distillates fell 450,000 barrels and oil stocks dropped
500,000 barrels, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
in a survey by Bloomberg.  Awaiting EIA  “The market opened lower on the back of bearish API stats
and will look toward the EIA for confirmation of builds across
the board,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.2 cent to
$3.619 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization said today on its website. Prices
have declined for eight consecutive days and are 0.7 cent below
a year earlier.  ULSD for June delivery dropped 3.38 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $2.8357 a gallon on trading volume that was 2 percent below
the 100-day average.  July ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI crude oil narrowed 37
cents to $26.82 a barrel. July ULSD’s  premium over Brent  fell 35
cents to $17.54 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
