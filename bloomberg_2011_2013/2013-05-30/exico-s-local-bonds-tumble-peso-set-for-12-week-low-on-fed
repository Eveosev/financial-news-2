Mexico ’s local bonds tumbled, pushing
yields to a four-month high, as demand for emerging-market
assets waned amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will curtail
U.S. monetary stimulus.  Yields on peso-denominated benchmark debt due in December
2024 rose for a 10th day, increasing nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 5.41 percent at 10:17 a.m. in Mexico City,
the highest level on a closing basis since Jan. 16, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso depreciated 1 percent to
12.7792, the weakest level on a closing basis since March 6.  “It’s positioning risk,”  Siobhan Morden , head of Latin
America fixed-income strategy at Jefferies Group LLC, said in an
e-mailed response to questions. Mexico is the “most vulnerable
as the main destination of the local market flows” as
speculation mounts that the Fed will pare back stimulus.  The peso earlier touched 12.8420 per dollar, the weakest
intraday level since March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
