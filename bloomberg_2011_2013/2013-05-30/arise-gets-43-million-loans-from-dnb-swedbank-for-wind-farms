Arise Windpower AB (AWP) , a Swedish
developer, won 280 million kronor ($43 million) in loans from
 DNB ASA (DNB)  and  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  for three onshore wind farms.  DNB, based in Oslo, provided 150 million kronor for one
project and Swedbank supplied 130 million kronor for two further
plants, Halmstad-based Arise said today in a statement.  The plants with 15 turbines in total will be commissioned
later this year, according to the statement. Sweden, seeking to
curb its dependence on the nuclear and hydropower which supply
most of its electricity, aims to get at least 50 percent of its
energy from renewables by the end of the decade, according to
the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
