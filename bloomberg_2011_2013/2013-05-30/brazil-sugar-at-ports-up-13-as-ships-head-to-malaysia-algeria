The amount of sugar awaiting loading
at ports in top producer  Brazil  rose 13 percent in a week as
vessels head for Malaysia,  Algeria  and Egypt, according to
Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Sugar waiting to be loaded onto ships at Recife, Maceio,
Paranagua and Santos, the country’s biggest port, totaled 1.53
million metric tons, figures e-mailed yesterday from the Recife,
Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That compares with about
1.35 million tons a week earlier.  Vessels scheduled to go to Malaysia were set to take
139,000 tons of the sweetener, while those bound for Algeria
would carry 117,999 tons, the data show. Ships headed for Egypt
were set to take 101,000 tons and China would get 80,200 tons,
according to the shipping agency.  China  was the world’s biggest raw sugar importer last
season and  Indonesia  is forecast to be the top buyer this year.
Muslim nations usually stock up sugar before Ramadan, when
people fast during the day and sweet treats are common at night.  Raw sugar for delivery in July was up 0.3 percent to 16.72
cents a pound by 6:10 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
