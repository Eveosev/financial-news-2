Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. said brokerages
including  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and BNP Paribas SA will join
its European derivatives market when the new venue starts
operations tomorrow.  Marex Spectron Group, Getco Europe Ltd., Nomura Holdings
Inc., Newedge Group SA and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc will
also be involved, Nasdaq OMX said in a statement today. The
London-based market, known as NLX, will offer six products
initially, including futures on the German bund, Euribor
contracts and short sterling.  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ’s London-based Liffe currently dominates the
market for short-term interest-rate derivatives. Frankfurt-based
Eurex, Europe’s largest futures exchange and a unit of  Deutsche
Boerse AG (DB1) , is the main venue for trading long-term products.  CME
Group Inc. (CME)  also plans to open a market in  London  this year,
starting with currency futures.  “NLX brings competition to interest rate derivatives in
Europe,” Mike du Plessis, global co-head of ETD agency
execution at UBS, said in the statement. “With new regulations
coming into force globally, we are keen that market
infrastructure evolves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
