Canadian  stocks  advanced as gold
producers climbed on rising bullion prices, offsetting losses
among lenders after  Royal Bank of Canada  reported weaker-than-estimated earnings.  Detour Gold Corp. and Barrick Gold Corp. jumped at least
6.9 percent as the metal touched a two-week high on speculation
the U.S. central bank will maintain its bond-purchasing program.

forecasts. Talisman Energy Inc. advanced 1.5 percent after
saying it may reduce its stake in some properties.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 13.94

gained 2.5 percent this year. Trading volume was 11 percent
higher than the 30-day average.  “Gold has sparked a nice couple-day comeback,”  Barry Schwartz ,  fund manager  with Baskin Financial Services Inc., said
from Toronto. He helps manage C$500 million ($485 million) with
the firm. “It’s not a no-growth or negative growth environment,
which is how they are being priced,” he said, referring to bank
earnings. “They’re being priced as if we’re headed into some
kind of nasty, negative downturn.”  Demand for gold as a store of value increased on
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain the pace of
stimulus after data today showed the world’s largest economy
expanded less than previously estimated and jobless claims grew
more than forecast. The Fed has said it could slow its $85
billion of monthly debt purchases if the economy shows sustained
improvement.  Miners Rally  Raw-materials producers in  Canada  paced  gains  in the
