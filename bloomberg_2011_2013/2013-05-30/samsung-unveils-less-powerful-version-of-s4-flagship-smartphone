Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  unveiled a
smaller and less powerful version of its flagship Galaxy S4
handset as the world’s largest smartphone maker looks to widen
its lead.  The Galaxy S4 mini features a 4.3-inch screen, 1.7
Gigahertz dual-core processor and 8-megapixel camera, the Suwon,
South Korea-based company said in a statement yesterday, without
specifying a retail price or when it will be available. The
 Galaxy S4 , which went on sale last month, has a 5-inch screen,
1.9Ghz quad-core processor and 13-megapixel camera.  Samsung’s new handset may help the company maintain
momentum after selling 10 million units of the S4 in half the
time of the previous Galaxy model. Described by Samsung as a
“powerful yet compact” version of the S4, the mini’s release
comes as much as three months before  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  may release a
low-cost version of its iPhone.  Samsung, which is also the world’s largest maker of flat-panel displays and memory chips, has advanced 1.5 percent this
year to close at 1.54 million won in  Seoul  yesterday. Apple’s
stock has lost 15 percent in 2013.  Apple has contracted Taipei-based Pegatron Corp. to
manufacture a low-cost, plastic-cased iPhone for release around
the end of next quarter, according to analysts at Fubon
Financial Holding Co. and Yuanta Financial Holding Co. That
device may sell for about $300 to $350 and have less expensive
components than the iPhone 5, Arthur Liao, an analyst at Fubon,
said yesterday.  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple, declined to comment on supplier relationships.  Average Price  Samsung and Apple are also competing against  LG Electronics
Inc. (066570) ,  HTC Corp. (2498) ,  ZTE Corp. (000063)  and Huawei Technologies Co. in the
$294-billion global smartphone market. Apple, which usually
releases one new phone a year, sells its smartphones at an
average of $689 each, compared with  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s $419 average
price and HTC’s $414, according to IDC data compiled by
Bloomberg Industries.  Customers can choose from two colors for the S4 mini, which
will have versions that run on fourth-generation long-term
evolution, or LTE, networks as well as 3G. The full-size Galaxy
S4 will be available in six colors as new iterations are added,
the company said last week.  Introduced at a Broadway-style event at New York’s Radio
City Music Hall on March 14, the Galaxy S4 went on sale in South
Korea on April 26 and reached the 10-million sales mark in 27
days, compared to the S3’s 50 days, Samsung said last week.  The mini version will be demonstrated at a company event in
 London  on June 20, with availability of different versions
determined by market, Samsung  said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
