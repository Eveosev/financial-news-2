South African credit growth
accelerated for the first time this year to 9.1% percent in
April.  Growth in  borrowing  by households and companies advanced
from a revised 7.9 percent in the previous month, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said on its website today. The median
 estimate  of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 8.8 percent.  The South African Reserve Bank has kept its benchmark
 interest rate  at 5 percent since a 50 basis-point cut in July.
Inflation has accelerated to near the top of the bankâ€™s 3
percent to 6 percent target range, giving the bank little room
to provide further stimulus even as economic growth slowed to an
annualized 0.9 percent in the first quarter, the slowest pace
since a recession in 2009.  The broad M3 measure of  money supply  rose 10 percent in
April from a year earlier compared with a revised 8.5 percent in
March, the central bank said. The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg
survey was 9.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
