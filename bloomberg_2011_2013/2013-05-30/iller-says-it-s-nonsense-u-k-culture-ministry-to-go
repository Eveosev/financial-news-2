U.K. Culture Secretary Maria Miller told an opposition  Labour Party  lawmaker that suggestions her department may be scrapped under plans to cut  government spending  are “nonsense.”  In an exchange on Twitter Inc.’s social-networking site, Dan Jarvis, a Labour culture spokesman, posted: “well placed sources in Whitehall saying that #CSR13 may scrap @DCMS -with Culture, Media & Sport going to other Govt depts.”  Jarvis was referring to the spending review that Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is currently undertaking, seeking to save a further 11.5 billion pounds ($17 billion) from departmental budgets. Whitehall is the London street on which many ministries have their headquarters. Osborne will announce his plans to lawmakers on June 26.  Miller replied today on Twitter, saying that Jarvis is talking “absolute nonsense” about her department, whose planned expenditure for the financial year ending in March 2015 is 1.1 billion pounds.  Under the previous culture secretary,  Jeremy Hunt , the department oversaw the running of the 2012 London  Olympic Games . Hunt was also responsible for deciding whether to approve News Corp.’s 2010 takeover bid for British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc, which collapsed amid the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World newspaper. He had to fend off calls from Labour for his resignation for allegedly favoring the offer.
