U.S. homeowners eligible for loan
modifications under the federal Home Affordable Modification
Program will have until the end of 2015 to apply for assistance,
the Treasury Department said today.  “Extending the program for two years will benefit many
additional families while maintaining clear standards and
accountability for an important part of the mortgage industry,”
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in a statement.  HAMP, which was scheduled to expire at the end of this
year, allows certain borrowers with loans originated before Jan.
1, 2009, to change the terms of their mortgages so their monthly
payments are lowered. Treasury pays lenders an incentive fee for
participating.  By the end of March, 1.1 million homeowners had obtained
permanent loan modifications through HAMP, far fewer than the 3
million to 4 million projected by President  Barack Obama ’s
administration when the program began in 2009. Only about $4.7
billion of the $29 billion originally allocated for the program
has been spent.  In April, the auditor overseeing the disbursement of funds
for HAMP said homeowners participating in the program were re-defaulting on their loans at an “alarming rate.”  Between 30
percent and 40 percent of homeowners who obtained modifications
in 2010 have re-defaulted, the special inspector general for the
Troubled Asset Relief Program said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
