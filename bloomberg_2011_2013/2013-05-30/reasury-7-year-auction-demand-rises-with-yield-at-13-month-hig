Treasury’s sale of $29 billion of
 seven-year  notes attracted the most interest from non-primary
dealer investors since December as yields at the highest levels
in more than a year bolstered demand.  Indirect and direct bidders combined to win about 61
percent of yesterday’s offering, compared with an average of
about 56 percent at the 10 previous auctions. The notes were
sold at what is known as a  high yield  of 1.496 percent, the most
for a seven-year security at an auction since March 2012.  “Directs and indirects were very solid versus the last
couple of auctions,” Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist
BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that are
obligated to bid at U.S. government debt auctions. “It helps
that this is the highest yield we’ve had since March 2012.”  The Treasury’s sale of $35 billion of  five-year  notes on
May 29 attracted the most interest from non-primary dealer
investors since at least 2003.  That followed the Treasury’s $35 billion sale of two-year
debt on May 28, which attracted the  fewest  bids for the
securities since February 2011. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 3.04, compared with an average of 3.72
for the past 10 sales.  Market Prices  The current seven-year note yield was little changed at
1.49 percent yesterday in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. The 1.125 percent note due April 2020 traded at 97
20/32. The yield reached 1.60 percent May 29, the highest level
since April 5, 2012.  At the seven-year auction, the  bid-to-cover  ratio was 2.70,
compared with an average of 2.67 for the previous 10 sales. The
yield was below the 1.522 percent by a Bloomberg News survey of
eight primary dealers before the offering.  Primary dealers bought 38.5 percent of the securities
compared with an average 43.7 percent at the 10 prior sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  40.8 percent of the notes, the
most since July and compared with 39.3 percent of the seven-year
notes auctioned last month. The average for the past 10
offerings is 38.3 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 20.7 percent of
the notes, the most since December and compared with 19.7
percent at the April sale. The average at the past 10 sales is
18 percent.  Investors have bid $2.98 for each dollar of the $905
billion in Treasury notes and bonds sold at auction so far this
year compared with a record bid-to-cover ratio of $3.15 set in
2012.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index have fallen 1.5 percent in May, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004. Treasuries have tumbled 1.8
percent in May as of yesterday, the most since December 2009,
according to the indexes. Treasuries have lost investors 1
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
