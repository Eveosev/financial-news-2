Rangers International Football Club
Plc (RFC)  said an investigation found no evidence that  Craig Whyte ,
the owner of the 54-time Scottish soccer champion before it went
into liquidation last year, had any involvement with the company
that bought the business from the administrators.  There was no evidence that Whyte invested in Rangers
Football Club Ltd. or Rangers International FC directly or
indirectly or that he had any involvement with Sevco Scotland
Ltd., the company behind the purchase, the Glasgow-based club
said in a statement on the London Stock Exchange today.  The investigation, carried out by law firm Pinsent Masons
LLP and overseen by Roy Martin, was set up after Whyte said he
colluded with Charles Green, who headed the group that acquired
the club for 5.5 million pounds ($8.3 million) from the
administrators, to buy its assets.  Green resigned as chief executive officer of the club after
Whyte’s allegations became public. Rangers will make a “robust
response” to a letter sent two days ago by Whyte, the club said
in the statement.  Rangers shares were unchanged at 56.5 pence at 8:47 a.m. in
London trading.  Rangers went into liquidation last year over unpaid tax
bills of more than 93 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
