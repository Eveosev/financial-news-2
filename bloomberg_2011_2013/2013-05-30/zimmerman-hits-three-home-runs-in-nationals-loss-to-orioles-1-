Ryan Zimmerman  hit three home runs
and ended up on the losing team as the Washington Nationals blew
a 6-2 lead against the  Baltimore Orioles .  Zimmerman drove in four runs in his first three at-bats
last night in the Nationalsâ€™ 9-6 defeat at Oriole Park at Camden
Yards in Baltimore.  Sixteen Major League Baseball players have hit four home
runs in a single game, with Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia
Phillies in 1896 and Bob Horner of the Atlanta Braves in 1986
achieving the feat and ending up on the losing team.  The latest player to hit four home runs in a game was  Josh Hamilton  for the  Texas Rangers  on May 8, 2012. The most recent
National League player to hit four homers in a game was Shawn Green of the  Los Angeles Dodgers  on May 23, 2002.  Zimmerman hit solo home runs in the first and fourth
innings and had a two-run homer in the fifth as the Nationals
took a 6-2 lead.  The Orioles, who got a home run from Chris Davis in the
fourth inning, also had a home run by Nick Markakis in the sixth
and homers by Steve Pearce and Davis in the five-run seventh
inning.  Davis, who has a MLB-best 19 home runs this season, went 4-for-4 to raise his batting average to .359.  To contact the reporter on this story:
