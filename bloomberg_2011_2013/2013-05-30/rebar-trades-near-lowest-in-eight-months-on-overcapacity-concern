Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near the lowest level in more than eight months on
concern that overcapacity at Chinese mills means supply will
exceed demand.  Rebar for October delivery on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange
fell to as low as 3,422  yuan  a ($558) a metric ton, the lowest
for a most-active contract since Sept. 10. It traded at 3,436 at
9:58 a.m. local time. Futures have lost 4.6 percent in May and
are set for a fourth monthly decline.  China ’s steel output rose by 20.09 million tons in the
first four months of this year, Wang Xiaoqi, deputy head of
China Iron and Steel Association, said in conference in Shanghai
yesterday. About 54 percent of that additional output has become
inventory sitting in warehouses, Wang said.  “The rebar market seems to be on track to decline further
as prices breached a series of lows in the past few sessions
while investors added to their short positions,” Zheng Ge, an
analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing. Lower
 iron ore  prices also contributed to rebar’s fall, Zheng said.  Iron ore for immediate delivery at the Tianjin port in
China fell 4.2 percent to $112.90 a dry ton yesterday, according
to the Steel Index Ltd.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.7 percent to 3,495
yuan a ton yesterday, the lowest since September, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
