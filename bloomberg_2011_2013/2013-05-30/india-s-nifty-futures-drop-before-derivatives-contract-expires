to  emerging markets .  “We have seen the worst of the earning cycle downgrade,”
 Adrian Mowat , chief Asian and emerging-market strategist at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., told Bloomberg TV  India  today. “It’s
pretty typical for markets to turn three-to-six months before
earnings downgrades turn.”  Mahindra & Mahindra jumped 4.5 percent to 1,004.65 rupees,
a record. India’s largest maker of sport-utility vehicles and
tractors said  net income , excluding units, increased to 8.89

emerging economies. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said May 14 the
latest data showing inflation eased to a 41-month low in April
will be factored into the next review scheduled for June 17.  ‘Sweet Spot’  “We had a period of time where Indian growth was poor and
inflation was high, and now that poor growth is translating into
less inflation the central bank has a lot of flexibility to cut
rates,” JPMorgan’s Mowat said. “We’re entering a sweet spot.”  ITC, India’s largest cigarette company which has the
highest weighting on the Sensex, surged 3.4 percent to 354.3
rupees.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the nation’s biggest
