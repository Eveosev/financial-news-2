Jockey Frankie Dettori has
been cleared to return to racing by French regulatory body
France Galop after a six-month ban for failing a drug test,  Sky
Sports  reported.  Dettori was suspended after testing positive for cocaine at
Longchamp, Paris, in September.  His expected return to action last week had been delayed
by what the British Horseracing Authority called an
“irregularity” in a subsequent test, and this issue has now
been resolved. It’s not clear if he will have any rides at the
Epsom Derby meeting, starting tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
