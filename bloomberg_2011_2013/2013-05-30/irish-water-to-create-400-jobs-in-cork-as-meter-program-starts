Irish Water is opening a call center
in Cork in southwest Ireland starting in July that will employ
400 people by mid-2014 as part of a metering program rollout.  The Dublin-based company said the center will employ as
many as 100 when it opens and will assist 1.6 million domestic
and public water users. It will be operated by Abtran Ltd. as
part of a five-year contract, Irish Water said in a statement.  The center “will support the start of the national
metering program this summer as well as the development of an
Irish Water customer database in advance of the start of
domestic billing,” John Tierney, managing director of
Irish Water, said in today’s e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
