Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  will roll out a
rapid-charging network for its electric cars that will allow
drivers to travel to New York from Los Angeles, according to
Elon Musk, Teslaâ€™s chief executive officer and biggest
shareholder.  Tesla is expanding a network of fast-charging stations to
major U.S. and Canadian metropolitan areas to make its Model S a
more viable alternative to gasoline-fueled cars, Musk said in an
onstage interview at the D: All Things Digital conference in
 Rancho Palos Verdes , California.  Tesla needs an expanded network of charging stations to
appeal to customers beyond California and the Northeast U.S.,
where it now has fueling spots.  Tesla had scheduled an announcement on the superchargers
tomorrow for a conference call at 1:30 p.m. New York time. 
Nine stations currently provide free electricity for Model S 
owners, and the company plans to have 100 along U.S. and
Canadian highways by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
