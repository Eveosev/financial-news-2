Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. (8309) 
fell in  Tokyo  trading after the Japanese bank said it will raise
94 billion yen ($932 million) in an overseas share sale to fund
strategic investments and asset expansion.  Shares of the Tokyo-based lender declined 5.3 percent to
432 yen at 9:36 a.m. local time.  Japan ’s fourth-biggest bank by
market value will sell 217 million treasury shares to foreign
investors for 433 yen each, it said in a statement today. That’s
a 5 percent discount on yesterday’s close of 456 yen.  The sale follows Sumitomo Mitsui Trust’s repurchase of
467.3 million shares from the government in March to complete a
bailout repayment plan. It said then that it will cancel 250
million of those shares and keep the remainder as treasury stock
for the time being.  “The sale is essentially equity financing and will result
in dilution,” Toyoki Sameshima, an analyst at BNP Paribas SA in
Tokyo, wrote in a report yesterday.  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust expects net proceeds from the share
sale of 89.8 billion yen, it said in the statement to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. Shares of the bank have climbed 44 percent this
year, outpacing a 34 percent gain in the benchmark  Topix Index (TPX) ,
which dropped 2.3 percent this morning.  The company was formed from the combination of Chuo Mitsui
Trust Holdings Inc. and Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co. in April
2011. Chuo Mitsui received the taxpayer bailout after being
crippled by bad loans in the 1990s following the collapse of the
country’s  asset bubble .  To contact the reporter on this story:
