Ascendas Hospitality (ASHT)  Trust is
planning to raise at least S$200 million ($158 million) in
 Singapore  to help fund the purchase of the Park Hotel Clark Quay
it agreed to buy earlier this month.  The business trust plans to sell 161.9 million new shares
through a private placement to raise about S$143.3 million, it
said in a statement to the Singapore stock exchange today. The
Singapore-based trust will also raise another S$56.7 million
from a preferential offering of two new stapled securities for
every 25 units held in Ascendas Hospitality Trust, it said.  Ascendas Hospitality declined 2.6 percent to 92.5 Singapore
cents in Singapore trading yesterday, bringing its year-to-date
decline to 1.6 percent. The company requested a trading halt
today before the announcement.  The trust agreed to buy the Park Hotel for S$300 million,
adding to the trust’s portfolio of 10 hotels spread across
 Australia , China and  Japan . Its parent Ascendas Pte manages
Singapore’s biggest industrial real estate investment trust, and
operates in 33 cities with S$14 billion of assets, according to
its website.  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Standard Chartered Plc have
been appointed the joint global coordinators for the equity
fundraising, Ascendas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
