The  New York  Mets scored five runs in
the first inning and defeated the New York Yankees 9-4 for their
third win in as many nights in the crosstown series.  The Mets (21-29), who have won four Major League Baseball
games in a row for the first time all season, will try to
complete a sweep of the four-game Subway Series tonight at
Yankee Stadium.  Yankees starting pitcher David Phelps lasted one-third of
an inning last night, allowing all five first-inning runs.  Ike Davis , who came into the game batting .152, had a two-run single
and Daniel Murphy hit a run-scoring double in the inning.  Marlon Byrd added a solo home run in the third inning to
make it 6-0, and  Lucas Duda  doubled home two more runs in the
fourth. Rick Ankiel had a run-scoring single in the ninth.  Brennan Boesch drove in two runs for the Yankees (30-22)
with a solo homer and a run-scoring infield single. Jayson Nix
and  Robinson Cano  added RBI singles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
