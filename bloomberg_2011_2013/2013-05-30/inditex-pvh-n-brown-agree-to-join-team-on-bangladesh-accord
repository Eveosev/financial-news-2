Inditex SA (ITX) , Calvin Klein-owner  PVH
Corp. (PVH) , U.K. clothier  N Brown Group Plc (BWNG)  and three other companies
will team up with union members to oversee the implementation of
the Bangladesh fire and building safety accord.  A representative from each of the companies will work with
six members from the IndustriAll union for garment workers, the
UNI global union representing retail workers and two non-governmental organizations, IndustriAll general secratary Jyrki Raina said. A separate steering committee to oversee governance,
transparency and disputes is still to be decided.  More than 40 companies have now signed the accord, which
commits to improving worker safety at Bangladesh’s 5,000 garment
factories. The deal requires signatories, including the two
largest clothing retailers,  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB)  and Zara-owner
Inditex, to continue orders with suppliers for two years while
also potentially funding factory upgrades.  The so-called design committee, which will meet June 3, has
until July 8 to hire the safety inspector to lead factory
inspections, work on training coordinators and to identify high-risk facilities. It will also look at how the signatories set up
the steering committee and how they elect their representatives.  “There is a clear will and mechanism for rapid
implementation,” Raina said.  Other members of the design committee include Otto Group, a
German online retailer, European clothing chain C&A, and hard-discounter Aldi.  A separate delegation of union officials arrived in Dhaka
May 26 to meet with government officials, unions and employers
group the  Bangladesh  Garment Manufacturers and Exporters
Association to agree on how the pact will work, Raina added.
