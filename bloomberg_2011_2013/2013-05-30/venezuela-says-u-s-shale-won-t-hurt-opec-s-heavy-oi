The rising supply of U.S. shale oil
doesn’t affect exporters of medium and heavy crudes such as
Venezuela, the Latin American country’s oil minister told
reporters before an OPEC meeting tomorrow.  “Shale is a production of light crude and that doesn’t
affect us as being big producers of medium and heavy crudes,”
 Rafael Ramirez  said in Vienna, where ministers from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are gathering.
“We have a big capacity to place our crudes, including the U.S.
market.”  The prospect of growing U.S. energy independence has come
to the fore amid a reduction in U.S. crude imports from some
OPEC nations, notably those in  Africa , over recent months. At a
time of weak economic growth and rising U.S. production, OPEC
nations risk a price decline unless they cut supply themselves,
according to Societe Generale SA and the Centre for Global
Energy Studies.  Five months ago, after OPEC’s mid-December meeting, the
group’s secretary-general, Abdalla el-Badri, fended off
questions about burgeoning U.S. shale oil supply, saying:
“We’re not really concerned. I don’t see that big a quantity.”  Venezuela ’s Ramirez said diversification avoids competition
with the growing supply of lighter oil from shale deposits.  “Long time ago we decided to diversify our markets and
good for us we did it,” he said. “We sell to China,  Japan ,
countries that have sustained growth like  India  with the
capacity to process heavy crude.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
