Treasury yields may climb after 2-,
5-, 10- and 30-year rates surpassed key technical levels, Bank
of America Corp. said, citing trading patterns.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  may climb to 2.292 percent in the
weeks ahead and potentially reach 2012’s high of about 2.4
percent,  MacNeil Curry , a technical strategist for the company
in  New York , wrote in a note yesterday. Rates may rise after
breaking through 2.151 percent, the level that results by
drawing a trend line connecting recent highs in yields and
extrapolating it out to today, according to the report.  Ten-year  yields  rose one basis point today to 2.12 percent
as of 2 p.m. in  Tokyo , based on Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 1.75 percent note due in May 2023 fell 1/32, or 31 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 96 22/32. Rates reached 2.23 percent on
May 29, the highest level since April 2012. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  “We look for the selloff to continue,” Curry wrote.  Five-year yields may rise to 1.182 percent from 1.02
percent today, and 30-year rates may climb to 3.461 percent from
3.26, according to the report.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
