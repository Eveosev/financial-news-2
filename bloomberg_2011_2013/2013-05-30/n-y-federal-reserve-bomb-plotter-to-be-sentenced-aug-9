Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis
Nafis, the Bangladeshi man who admitted trying to bomb the New
York  Federal Reserve  Bank, will be sentenced Aug. 9, a federal
judge said.  Nafis, 21, pleaded guilty in February in Brooklyn, New York,
to attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. U.S. District
Judge Carol Bagley Amon set the sentencing date today.  Federal agents helped Nafis with the bomb plot as part of an
undercover operation. He was arrested in October after trying to
detonate what he thought was a 1,000-pound bomb at the Fed in
 Lower Manhattan , according to prosecutors. The device was a
fake.  He faces a possible sentence of 30 years to life in prison
under an agreement with the government.  Prosecutors alleged Nafis came to New York from  Bangladesh 
on a student visa and wanted to engage in a suicide bombing or
other violent attack. In July, he made contact with an informant
for the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  who referred him to
agents posing as members of al-Qaeda, according to court papers.  The case is U.S. v. Nafis, 1:12-cr-00720, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
