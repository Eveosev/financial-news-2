A lawyer representing more than two
dozen people who say they were sexually abused at the elite
 Horace Mann  School in  New York  called the school’s decision not
to conduct an independent investigation “a cause for further
shame.”  School officials issued an  apology  on May 24 for decades of
alleged abuse of students by teachers and administrators without
consenting to an inquiry sought by victims. The abuse is alleged
to have happened between 1962 and 1996.  “Such institutional deception and ongoing bad faith has
served only to exacerbate and reopen the deep anxieties and
feelings of those who are the victims and continue to struggle
every day to survive the abuse that altered their lives,”
 Gloria Allred , the lawyer, wrote today in a statement.  Horace Mann, in a statement late today, said Allred
“seriously misstates what has transpired.”  The school stands by its May 24 letter and the “good faith
actions it has taken in an attempt to help those hurt by former
teachers and administrators at Horace Mann School in the 1960s
through 1990s, and to make sure these kind of things cannot
happen again,” the school said.  Bronx District Attorney Robert T. Johnson said last month
the alleged sexual abuse of students took place too long ago to
be prosecuted. Horace Mann is located in the Riverdale section
of the Bronx.  To contact the reporter on this story:
