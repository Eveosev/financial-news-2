The euro may drop to $1.20 next year
as  Europe  struggles to revive economic expansion and U.S. growth
forecasts beat expectations, according to Davis Hall, head of
foreign exchange at Credit Agricole Private Banking.  The common currency is vulnerable to declines because of
continued economic weakness in  Italy , Portugal and  Spain  and the
need to provide “export relief” for the region’s companies,
Hall said yesterday in an interview in Dubai.  The European Central Bank yesterday said weakness in the
euro-area economy and the fragility of the region’s banks may
end what it describes as the calmest period in financial markets
since 2011. By contrast, the U.S. Commerce Department is likely
to say today the world’s biggest economy grew at an annualized
2.5 percent pace in the first quarter, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “The euro must fall,” Hall said in Dubai. “Italy,
Portugal and Spain are still on their knees and nothing’s going
to change over the summer ahead of the elections in  Germany .”  The currency may dip to $1.25 by the end of the year and to
$1.20 by December 2014. The continent may also need to relax
austerity measures to promote growth, Hall said. The longer it
takes for the euro to fall, the further it will have to drop to
stimulate the region, he said.  The euro strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.2973 at 9:25 a.m.
