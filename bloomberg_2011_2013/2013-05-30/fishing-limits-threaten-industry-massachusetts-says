New U.S. fishing regulations threaten
to drive the industry into extinction,  Massachusetts  said in a
lawsuit against federal agencies.  The state sued the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration , the  U.S. Commerce Department , the National
Marine Fisheries Service and the individuals who run them,
according to a complaint filed today in federal court in Boston
by Massachusetts Attorney General  Martha Coakley .  Massachusetts claimed that new federal rules, called
Frameworks 48 and 50, have reduced by 77 percent the amount of
certain fish that can be caught in New England. The state said
the regulations are “threatening the extinction of an
industry” and violate the  Magnuson-Stevens Act , which governs
fishing management.  “The devastating impact of the Frameworks on the families
and small businesses that earn their living fishing groundfish,
and on the communities where they reside, is beyond dispute,”
the state said in its complaint.  The Commerce Department, which administers the  National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , had no immediate
comment.  The case is Commonwealth of Massachusetts v.  Rebecca Blank ,
13-cv-11301, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
