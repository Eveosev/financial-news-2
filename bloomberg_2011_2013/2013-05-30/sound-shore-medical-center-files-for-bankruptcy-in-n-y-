Sound Shore Medical Center of
Westchester, an affiliate of New York College of Medicine
serving patients in the New Rochelle area, filed for  bankruptcy
protection  planning a sale to Montefiore Health System.  The company, with about 2,000 employees, listed assets of
$159.6 million and debts of $200 million in papers filed
yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in White Plains, New York.  “As is true with many community hospitals serving a
working-class constituency, the medical centers have been beset
by the financial pressures caused by cuts in Medicare and
Medicaid funding, declining indigent pool payments, and changing
demographics,” Chief Executive Officer John Spicer said in
court papers.  Sound Shore said in a statement yesterday it will continue
business as usual pending the sale to Bronx, New York-based
Montefiore by the end of the year, subject to court approval.  The center was formed in 1997, when Mount Vernon Hospital,
Sound Shore Medical Center, Dorothea Hopfer School of Nursing
and Schaffer Extended Care Center affiliated to create one of
the largest private health-care systems between  New York City 
and Albany, according to the company.  The case is In re Sound Shore Medical Center of
Westchester, 13-22840, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District
of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
