Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
rebounded from the lowest level in four weeks, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Stockpiles of gasoil, or diesel, and kerosene climbed
246,000 barrels, or 2.6 percent, to 9.5 million in the seven
days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the first gain in four weeks.  Residual-fuel inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen rose 348,000 barrels, or 1.7
percent, to 21 million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies
increased for the fourth time in five weeks.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate fell 607,000 barrels, or 5.8 percent, to 9.8
million, according to the data. That’s the third decline in four
weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
