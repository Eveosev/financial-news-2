New York  Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada,
whose .209 batting average ranks 160th of 171 Major League
Baseball players, was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a
right quad strain.  The Mets called up Omar Quintanilla from Triple-A Las Vegas
of the Pacific Coast League to take Tejadaâ€™s roster spot, the
team said in a news release.  Tejada, 23, and first baseman Ike Davis, whose .160 batting
average ranks 169th among qualified major-league hitters, both
are in jeopardy of being demoted, CBS Sports reported yesterday,
citing unidentified people close to the situation.  Quintanilla, a 31-year-old who was hitting .333 with two
home runs and 18 runs batted in during 47 minor-league games,
will be available tonight at Yankee Stadium when the Mets try to
complete a four-game sweep of the cross-town Yankees.  Quintanilla has a .220 batting average in 292 major-league
games for the Mets,  Baltimore Orioles ,  Texas Rangers  and
 Colorado Rockies .  The Mets are 21-29, nine games behind the division-leading
Atlanta Braves in the National League East, and have won their
last four games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
