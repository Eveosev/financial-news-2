U.S. stocks rose, extending a monthly
rally, as reports indicated the American economy is growing at a
pace that won’t hasten the end of Federal Reserve stimulus.
Japanese  stock futures  climbed after shares plunged in the
regular session, while the dollar weakened.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4 percent to
1,654.41 and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index increased 0.4 percent

going to continue to be a bias to keep QE in place,”  Matthew Kaufler ,  fund manager  at Federated Investors Inc. in Rochester
New York, said by telephone. The firm manages about $380
billion. “As long as that perception exists, it’ll be positive
for financial assets. That’s why you’re seeing the tilt upward
in prices.”  Monthly Gain  The  S&P 500  advanced 3.6 percent this month, poised for a
seventh straight monthly gain for its longest rally since 2009.  NV Energy Inc. surged 23 percent, the most in a decade,

today, the most since September 2011, and the  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in  Hong Kong  sank

that the nation’s public pension fund may boost its equities
holdings and as the  International Monetary Fund  was said to

percent to 13,810 in Osaka, having earlier surged as much as 2.8
