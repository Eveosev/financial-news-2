Natural gas futures fell for a fourth
day on forecasts for cooler weather that would reduce demand for
electricity to power air conditioners.  Gas for July delivery slid as much as 0.4 percent to $4.166
per million British thermal units in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $4.171 at 11:38 a.m.
Singapore time. The contract dropped 1 percent to $4.184 per
million Btu yesterday, while the June futures, which expired,
declined 0.6 percent to $4.148.  Temperatures will be below normal in the eastern half of
the U.S. from June 3 through June 7 after hotter-than-average
readings this week, said MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland . The high in  New York  on June 6 may be 66 degrees
Fahrenheit (19 Celsius), 11 degrees lower than usual, according
to AccuWeather Inc. The high in  Washington  that day may be 71
degrees Fahrenheit, 11 less than average, AccuWeather said.  Power generation accounts for 33 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
