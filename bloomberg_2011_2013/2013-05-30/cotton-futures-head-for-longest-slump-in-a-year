Cotton prices fell, heading for the
longest slump in a year, as U.S. government reports spurred
economic concerns. Orange-juice futures extended a rally to the
highest in 13 months.  The  U.S. economy  expanded less than forecast in the first
quarter, and more people filed claims for unemployment-insurance
payments last week, separate reports showed today. The price
slide started on May 20, partly on speculation that demand will
ease in China, the world’s biggest user, amid estimates for
slower economic expansion.  “Since cotton is a little more sensitive to what’s going
on economically, that might explain why it’s down,”  Sharon Johnson , a senior cotton specialist at Knight Futures in
Roswell, Georgia, said in a telephone interview.  Cotton for July delivery dropped 1 percent to 79.92 cents a
pound at 1:33 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price
fell for the eighth straight session, the longest slide since
mid-May 2012. Earlier, the commodity touched 79.87 cents, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 23. The fiber
headed for the biggest monthly drop in a year.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1.54 a pound. Earlier, the price reached $1.5575, the highest
since April 9, 2012.  Yesterday, the commodity jumped 3.2 percent, the most in
three weeks, on concern that crops in  Florida  may be threatened
during the  Atlantic hurricane season  that starts June 1.  Brazil  is the biggest orange grower, followed by Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
