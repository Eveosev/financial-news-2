Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said that the country’s beef farmers are being given full
access to Chile’s market.  The wider access could be worth C$10 million ($9.7 million)
a year to Canada, Harper said in a statement today from Ottawa
where he is meeting Chilean President Sebastian Pinera. Canadian
shipments had been restricted following an outbreak of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
