Basler Kantonalbank (BSKP) , one of 14 Swiss
financial firms under investigation by the Department of
Justice, said a proposed Swiss framework to settle a dispute
over untaxed assets will help its talks with the U.S.  “As is known, we have been cooperating for a while with
the U.S. authorities in compliance with Swiss law,” the bank’s
spokesman Michael Buess said in an e-mailed statement. “We are
confident that the proposed solution for various banks will also
positively influence our individual negotiations with the U.S.
authorities and that we will succeed finding a solution.”  Switzerland’s government yesterday proposed a bill that
authorizes the nation’s banks to cooperate with the U.S. and
transfer information on their transactions with U.S. taxpayers
while safeguarding their interests. The bill, which goes before
the Swiss Parliament as early as next week, may come into force
July 1.  The bill, which applies to all banks that had U.S.
customers and not only for those under investigation by the
U.S., “creates a clear legal basis to solve possible legacy
issues of the U.S. business in a structured process,” Buess
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
