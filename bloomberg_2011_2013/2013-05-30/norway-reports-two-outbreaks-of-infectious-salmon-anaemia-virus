Norway, the worldâ€™s biggest producer
of Atlantic salmon, reported two separate outbreaks of
infectious salmon anaemia, a contagious viral illness that has
wiped out fish farms from the Arctic to  Chile .  An outbreak in the Helgeland district in Nordland county
that started on May 28 killed about 3,000 salmon from a farm
with 385,000 fish, the first occurrence of the disease in the
area, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority reported in a
 notification  to the World Organisation for  Animal Health  today.  In Troms, to the north of Nordland, the virus killed 50,000
salmon out of a population of 1.22 million susceptible fish, and
138,500 salmon were destroyed, the food-safety authority
reported in a  separate notice .  To contact the reporter on this story:
