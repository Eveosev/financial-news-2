U.S. municipal yields climbed to the
highest in more than a year as local bonds joined a decline in
fixed-income securities on speculation a growing economy will
lure investors to riskier assets.  The  interest rate  on benchmark munis maturing in 10 years
rose about 0.25 percentage point to 2.17 percent as of 2 p.m. in
 New York , data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s the highest
yield since April 2012. The 0.43 percentage point  jump  in May is
the biggest for a month since October 2009.  State and local bonds have followed  Treasuries (USGG10YR)  in slumping
this week amid signs of an expanding economy. The S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values rose 10.9 percent from March
2012, the most since 2006, the data showed this week.
Separately, the Conference Board’s  sentiment index  rose to 76.2,
the highest since 2008.  Yields have risen because of “a lack of customer
interest,” said David Manges, muni trading manager at BNY
Mellon Capital Markets LLC in Pittsburgh. Yields move inversely
to prices.  States and cities are poised to sell $3.8 billion in debt
this week, the smallest supply wave since March,  data  compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
