Axa SA (CS) ’s annual property-and-casualty
premiums in Asia’s emerging markets will climb to almost 2
billion euros ($2.6 billion) in 2015, double last year’s level,
said Gaelle Olivier, head of the insurer’s Asia P&C business.  “It is clearly a transformational journey,” Olivier said
in a presentation to reporters near Bordeaux yesterday. She
oversees Axa property-and-casualty’s activities in countries
from  Indonesia  to China.  By 2015, the business should generate about 100 million
euros in annual operating profit, excluding the effects of the
Tian Ping acquisition in China, she said.  Axa’s Asian P&C premiums increased 22 percent last year,
excluding acquisitions, and are growing at least 15 percent this
year, Olivier said. Axa in 2011 set financial targets for 2015,
which included a doubling of Asian P&C premiums.  Axa,  Europe ’s second-largest insurer, agreed last month to
acquire a 50 percent stake in Shanghai-based auto insurer Tian
Ping in a deal valued at 485 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
