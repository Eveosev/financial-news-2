Copper declined for a second day in
 London  as the Grasberg mine in  Indonesia  re-started some
operations and after the International Monetary Fund cut its
forecast for China’s economic growth.  Metal for delivery in three months dropped as much as 0.5
percent to $7,227.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,252.50 at 9:30 a.m. Shanghai time. The
benchmark copper price has gained 2.9 percent so far this month,
set for the first monthly advance in four.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  has restarted some
operations at its Grasberg complex in Indonesia, the world’s
second-largest copper mine, after a May 14 accident that killed
28 and halted output, the Phoenix-based company’s local unit
said yesterday. The IMF said China’s economy will expand 7.75
percent this year and next, down from an April forecast of 8
percent for 2013 and 8.2 percent in 2014.  “We feel the sentiment-driven market will likely remain
focused on China’s macro data for direction near-term,”
analysts led by  Mark Pervan  at Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. said in a report today.  China’s statistics bureau will release May manufacturing
data on June 1, as economists’ median forecast stood at 50.0 in
a Bloomberg News survey. This compared with 50.6 in April.  Copper for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 52,330  yuan  ($8,541) a ton. The
July futures contract on the Comex declined 0.3 percent to
$3.2860 per pound.  On the LME, nickel also fell. Lead gained as aluminum and
zinc were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
