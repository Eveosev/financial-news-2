Ethanol production in the U.S. fell
1.4 percent to 863,000 barrels a day last week and stockpiles
dropped to the lowest level in 31 months, the Energy Information
Administration said.  Output slipped for the first time in three weeks while
stockpiles tumbled 0.8 percent to 16 million barrels, the lowest
level since Oct. 15, 2010, the Energy Departmentâ€™s analytical
arm said in a report today.  Inventories have slumped five consecutive weeks and are
down 25 percent from a year earlier. Imports averaged 27,000
barrels a day, the first time the U.S. has made foreign
purchases of the fuel since April 19, EIA data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 96 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, the highest since May 3, the report showed.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery slipped 0.5 cent to
$2.69 a gallon at 11:46 a.m.  New York  time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices have gained 33 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
