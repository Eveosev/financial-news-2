Indonesia’s rupiah fell for a ninth
day, the longest losing streak since 2004, on concern a delay in
cutting fuel subsidies will worsen the current-account deficit
amid central bank efforts to support the currency.  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 9,813 per dollar as of
9:52 a.m. in Jakarta, after earlier dropping as much as 1
percent to 9,900, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. It reached 9,905 yesterday, the weakest level since Sept.
15, 2009, and has lost 0.9 percent this month.  Bank Indonesia  is “consistently guiding” the rupiah,
Assistant Governor Hendar said yesterday in a mobile-phone text
message. The government announced on Jan. 7 that it may adjust
the subsidized fuel price, while President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono last month made any increase conditional on parliament
approving a compensation package for the poor.  “We hear that BI is attempting to smooth the volatility,”
said Khoon Goh, a senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group in  Singapore . “They won’t be able to stop the
rupiah from depreciating but are trying to ensure depreciation
is orderly.”  The government proposed increasing the cost of subsidized
gasoline by 2,000 rupiah to 6,500 rupiah a liter and diesel by
1,000 rupiah to 5,500 a liter starting next month, Finance
Minister Chatib Basri said in parliament on May 22. The
adjustment would save 42 trillion rupiah ($4.2 billion),
provided it takes effect in June, Coordinating Minister for the
Economy Hatta Rajasa said the same day.  ‘Frustrate Investors’  Indonesia ’s current-account deficit, the broadest measure
of trade, was $5.27 billion in the first three months of the
year, the sixth consecutive quarterly shortfall.  Goh said the bank doesn’t have a positive view on the
rupiah because of the current-account shortfall and as the
“delay in fuel reforms continues to frustrate investors.”  Standard Chartered Plc lowered Indonesia’s economic growth
forecast to 6.2 percent from 6.5 percent for 2013, and the 2014
projection to 6.5 percent from 6.8 percent.  One-month non-deliverable forwards in the rupiah rose 0.3
percent to 9,991 per dollar, 1.8 percent weaker than the spot
rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts fell as
much as 1.2 percent to 10,038 yesterday, also the weakest since
September 2009.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 10 basis points,
or 0.10 percentage point, to 7.59 percent.  Government bonds  fell. The yield on the 5.625 percent notes
maturing in May 2023 rose one basis point to 5.97 percent,
according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.
That’s 47 basis points higher than on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
