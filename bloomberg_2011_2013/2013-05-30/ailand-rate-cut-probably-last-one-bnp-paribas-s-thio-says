An anticipated pick-up in  Thailand ’s
exports and a robust domestic economy mean the country’s central
bank won’t be cutting rates any further, Thio Chin Loo, a senior
currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA in Singapore, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  On Bank of Thailand’s key interest rate cut:  It “will probably be the last one, because if growth
prospects in the U.S. improve and if China engineers a soft
landing for the economy, then the prospect for exports to pick
up is still there.  ‘‘Exports have been the weakest bone in the Thai economy,
but domestic drivers are still quite strong.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
