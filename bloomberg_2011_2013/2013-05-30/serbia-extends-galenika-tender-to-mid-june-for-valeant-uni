Serbia extended its tender for the
Galenika AD drug company for a fourth time, giving a unit of
Canadaâ€™s  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)  until June
14 to file a bid, the  Finance Ministry  said on its website.  The government first called for bidders on Jan. 15, seeking
a partner among drugmakers with operating revenue of at least
200 million euros ($$259.5 million) in 2011.  Galenika cut its 2012 loss to 5.6 billion dinars ($65.2
million) from 13.5 billion dinars a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
