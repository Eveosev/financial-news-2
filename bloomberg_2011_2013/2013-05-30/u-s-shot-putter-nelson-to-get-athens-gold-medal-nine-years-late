Almost a decade after losing out on
an Olympic title, U.S. shot putter Adam Nelson will receive the
gold medal from the 2004 Olympics.  The International Olympic Committee Executive Board
 approved  the medal’s transfer to Nelson at a meeting today in
 St. Petersburg ,  Russia , after the event’s Ukrainian winner
tested positive for drug use.  “It has been a long wait for Adam, but we are thrilled to
see him justly rewarded,” Max Siegel, the chief executive
officer of USA Track & Field, said on the website of the sport’s
national federation.  Nelson, 38, was one of three athletes to receive medals
from the Athens Games after the original winners were found
positive for illegal substances. Yurij Bilonog of Ukraine was
stripped of the shot put gold in December after his retested
sample revealed steroid use.  Bilonog and Nelson, who is now retired from competition and
living in Athens,  Georgia , finished with the same distance on
their best throws, at 69 feet, 5 1/4 inches (21.16 meters).
Bilonog was declared the winner with a second-best attempt
longer than Nelson’s.  With Nelson moving up to gold,  Denmark ’s Joachim Olsen will
receive the shot put silver medal and Spain’s Manuel Martinez
receives the bronze.  In men’s 77 kilogram (170 pounds) weightlifting, Turkey’s
Reyhan Arabacioglu will receive the bronze medal, which was
stripped from Russia’s Oleg Perepetchenov.  The women’s discus bronze medal will be transferred to Vera
Pospisilova-Cechlova of the  Czech Republic  from Iryna Yatchenko
of Belarus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
