Wheat in Chicago fell, headed for the
biggest monthly loss since February, after  Japan  suspended
imports from the U.S., where the government discovered an
unapproved, genetically modified strain growing in an  Oregon 
field.  Japan, the biggest buyer of U.S. wheat behind  Mexico ,
suspended imports of western-white wheat and feed wheat from the
U.S., said Hiromi Iwahama, the director for grain trade and
operation at the agriculture ministry. Scientists said the rogue
wheat in Oregon was a strain tested from 1998 to 2005 by
 Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s top seedmaker. Japan also canceled a
purchase of 24,926 metric tons of white wheat.  The finding may hurt U.S.  export prospects  at a time when
the U.S. Department of Agriculture is expecting record global
production, boosted by a 48 percent increase in Russian output
and a 40 percent gain from Ukraine. Exports from the U.S.
probably will fall 9.8 percent to 25.2 million tons in the year
that starts on June 1, according to the USDA.  “This is not something we need to see when exports are
suffering anyway,” Darrell Holaday, the president of Advanced
Market Concepts in Wamego,  Kansas , said in a telephone
interview. “It’s a negative story during a negative export
time, and if the Black Sea keeps getting rain it’s going to be a
tough, competitive wheat market.”  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 0.6 percent to settle
at $6.9875 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price is down 4.4 percent this month, partly because the
USDA on May 10 forecast global growers would harvest 701.1
million tons.  Import Estimate  Japan is Asia’s largest wheat buyer after  Indonesia , with
imports forecast at 5.89 million tons in the 2012-2013 season,
little changed from the previous period, according to the
London-based International Grains Council.  Japan imported 5.62 million tons of milling wheat last
fiscal year, of which 3.26 million tons, or 58 percent, were
from the U.S. Canada was the second-largest supplier to Japan,
with 1.32 million tons, while  Australia  was the third with 1.03
million. Japan imported 867,000 tons of western-white wheat from
the U.S. in the year ended March 31, data from the Agriculture
Ministry showed.  “If there really are major concerns and Japan continues to
cancel and buy elsewhere, that could weigh on Chicago,” said
Paul Gaffet, an analyst at Offre & Demande Agricole in Bourges,
 France , which advises 5,000 farmers on crop sales.  The USDA said yesterday it was investigating how the
unapproved seeds were growing nine years after St. Louis-based
Monsanto ended its wheat program.  European Imports  The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, contacted
Monsanto seeking a method to detect its modified wheat and
advised member countries to test imports of soft-white wheat,
according to an e-mailed statement. The soft white variety makes
up 80 percent of annual EU purchases of U.S. wheat, it showed.  Spain imported 477,946 tons of U.S. wheat last year costing
105 million euros, while  Italy  bought 379,689 tons for 120
million euros, EU trade figures show.  “This raises doubts,” said Arnaud Saulais, a grain broker
at Starsupply Commodity Brokers in Nyon, Switzerland. “At the
start of things like this, it’s hard to say whether it will be
big. It’s like bird flu. You don’t know if it will stay local or
go worldwide.”  The EU in September 2009 quarantined most Canadian linseed,
or flax seed, after the discovery of cargoes contained a
genetically modified variety known as Triffid that was never
released for commercial production. Exports to the EU failed to
recover, slumping to 14,828 tons in 2012 from 336,844 tons in
2008, trade data show.  Beef Demand  Japan banned imports of  U.S. beef  in 2003 after a case of
mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was found
in an animal in Washington state. It eased restrictions last
year, nearly a decade later, allowing imports of beef from
cattle less than 30 months of age as of Feb. 1. Prior to that
date, it only allowed meat from animals 20 months or younger.  “Japan may say some things publicly, but they have good
qualitative and quantitative arrangements with farmers for that
type of wheat,” Advanced Market Concepts’ Holaday said. “We
have experience with Japan, and it took them a long time to see
the light on the BSE side of things.”  Corn futures for delivery in December fell 0.5 percent to
$5.6275 a bushel in  Chicago , the first drop since May 17.
Soybean futures for delivery in July slid 0.4 percent to
$14.9575 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporters on this story:
