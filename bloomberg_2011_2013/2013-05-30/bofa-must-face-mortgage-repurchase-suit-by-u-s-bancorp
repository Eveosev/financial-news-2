Bank of America Corp.  must face a
lawsuit filed by a mortgage-bond trustee that seeks the
repurchase of home loans backing $1.75 billion of securities, a
judge ruled.  Justice Eileen Bransten of  New York  State Supreme Court in
Manhattan said the lawsuit filed by a U.S. Bancorp unit could
proceed, while dismissing part of the case, according to a
decision dated yesterday.  U.S. Bank , the trustee for HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust
2005-10, sued Bank of America and its Countrywide Financial unit
in 2011, claiming loans underlying the securities didnâ€™t live up
to their promised quality and should be repurchased.  Bransten dismissed a claim seeking repurchase of all the
loans in the pool, while allowing U.S. Bank to make a new
argument for proceeding on the claim. A second claim seeking
repurchase of 495 loans can move forward, according to the
decision.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment about the
decision.  The case is U.S. Bank v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc.,
652388-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
