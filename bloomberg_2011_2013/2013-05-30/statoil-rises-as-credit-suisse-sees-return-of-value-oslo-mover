Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s biggest energy
company, rose the most in almost a month in Oslo as Credit
Suisse Group AG raised its rating on the stock after a sell-off
created value.  Shares in the Stavanger, Norway-based company rose as much
as 1.5 percent, the most since May 3, and were up 1 percent at
133.9 kroner as of 11:47 a.m. in the Norwegian capital. More
than 1.3 million shares traded so far today, about 38 percent of
the three-month average daily volume.  “Statoil is no longer an expensive stock,” Kim Fustier,
Andrey Aleev and Thomas Adolff, analysts at Credit Suisse, said
in a note. Production will improve in the fourth quarter after
continuing to show “negative production momentum” the next two
quarters, said the analysts, who raised their rating on the
stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘underperform.’  Statoil, which operates about 80 percent of  Norway ’s oil
and natural gas production, has slid 3.5 percent since European
authorities this month opened up a probe of the company, along
with other producers, for a possible manipulation of oil prices.  The stock’s recent underperformance “now fairly reflects
the company’s key challenges,”, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
