The Pentagon, to provide support for
military victims of sexual assault, has set up a telephone hot
line and a system for secure online chat sessions, according to
a spokesman.  The new  SafeHelpline.org  program is part of the Pentagon’s
effort to aid victims, hold perpetrators accountable and prevent
assaults. The phone line will be open round-the-clock, Colonel
Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters today. Two-hour chat-room sessions will be held twice a week.  “This new service allows victims of sexual assault to
participate in group chat sessions to connect with and support
one another in a moderated, secure, online environment,” Warren
said.  Congress is considering proposals to to change the way the
military investigates and prosecutes sexual attacks after the
Defense Department released results of a survey estimating
26,000 cases of sexual assaults last year. The survey was
released amid an uproar over reported attacks that President
 Barack Obama  has described as “shameful and disgraceful.”  The military is pursuing three cases in which officers who
worked in sexual-assault prevention programs were accused of
wrongdoing including assault, mistreatment of subordinates and
inducing prostitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
