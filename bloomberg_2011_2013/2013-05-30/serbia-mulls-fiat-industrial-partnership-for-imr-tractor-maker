Serbia will offer  CNH Global NV (CNH) , a
unit of  Fiat Industrial SpA (FI) , the chance to form a partnership
with Industrija Motora Rakovica AD, a state-controlled maker of
engines and farm machinery, a government minister said.  A “joint project” between CNH Global and the unprofitable
Serbian company known as IMR may be modeled after  Fiat
Automobili Srbija , the car-making venture between  Fiat SpA (F)  and
the Serbian government, Finance and Economy Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said during a parliamentary debate in Belgrade today.  Contacts on a possible investment in IMR are also being
held with a company from Belarus, Dinkic said without
specifying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
