OAO Novatek advanced the most on
 Russia ’s benchmark stock index as the nation’s second-biggest
natural-gas producer prolonged its share buyback program until
next year.  The stock increased as much as 2.6 percent before trading
1.4 percent higher at 324.27 rubles by 1:31 p.m. in Moscow. The
amount of shares traded was equivalent to about 65 percent of
the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Global depositary receipts  surged 2.5 percent to
$113.10 in  London . Novatek has the seventh-biggest weighting out
of 50 companies on the Micex, which fell 0.3 percent today.  The company extended its share buyback program to June 7,
2014, it said in a regulatory statement today. Novatek said in
June it would buy back as much as $600 million of stock within
the next 12 months. The stock purchased under the program may be
used for financing operations or in employee compensation and
incentive programs, Novatek said that month.  “The fact that the company is buying stock is positive,”
 Oleg Maximov , an analyst at Sberbank CIB, said by phone from
Moscow. “So far they have bought back quite a small stake,
about 10 percent.”  As of May 27, 5,517,510 ordinary shares, including those in
the form of GDRs, have been bought on the open market as part of
the program, Novatek said today. The stock has declined 6.3
percent  this year,  compared with a 17 percent drop for  OAO
Gazprom (GAZP) , Russia’s biggest company and natural gas export
monopoly, and a decrease of 7.8 percent for the Micex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
