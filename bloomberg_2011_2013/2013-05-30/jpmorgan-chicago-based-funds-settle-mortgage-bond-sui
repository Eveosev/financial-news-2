JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and a Chicago-based group of funds agreed to settle a lawsuit in which the
funds claimed JPMorgan gave faulty information involving
residential mortgage-backed securities.  AMF Funds sued JPMorgan in New York State Supreme Court in
 Manhattan  in February 2012, accusing the bank of making
“material representations and omissions” on underwriting
standards used to make  mortgage loans  pooled into $515.6 million
of securities purchased from May 2003 to May 2007.  The two sides have reached an agreement in principle to
settle the suit, according to letters filed by both sides in the
past week. Watertown Savings Bank, a Massachusetts lender and
former shareholder of AMF Funds, has asked to intervene in the
case, which both sides oppose.  AMF Funds, managed by Shay Assets Management Inc., had
about $590 million in  assets  under management in 2011, according
to its website. Mark Arisohn, an attorney with Labaton Sucharow
LLP representing the funds, and  Darrell S. Cafasso , a lawyer
with Sullivan & Cromwell LLP for JPMorgan, didn’t immediately
return telephone calls seeking comment on the letters.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  The case is Asset Management Fund v. JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
650320/2012,  New York  State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
