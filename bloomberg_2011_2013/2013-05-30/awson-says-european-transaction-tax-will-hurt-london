Former Chancellor of the Exchequer
 Nigel Lawson  said the proposed European financial-transaction
tax will damage  London  even though the U.K. isn’t participating.  Lawson, who said earlier this month he’d concluded Britain
should leave the European Union, was writing in the introduction
to a pamphlet attacking the tax from the  Centre for Policy
Studies . The U.K. is opposed to the tax, to which 11 EU members
have signed up.  The EU estimates the tax, which could be collected
worldwide, might raise 30 billion euros ($39 billion) to 35
billion euros a year. The plan would charge a 0.1 percent rate
for stock and bond trades and 0.01 percent for derivatives
transactions, with some exemptions for primary-market sales and
trades with the  European Central Bank .  “Designed both to punish the bankers and to raise money
for the EU budget, its principal effect will be to drive
financial business away from the EU (including the UK) to more
hospitable jurisdictions elsewhere,” Lawson said. “There are
only two world-class financial centers: London and  New York .
That it should be considered in the interests of Europe to drive
business away from London to the benefit of New York is both
perverse and unacceptable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
