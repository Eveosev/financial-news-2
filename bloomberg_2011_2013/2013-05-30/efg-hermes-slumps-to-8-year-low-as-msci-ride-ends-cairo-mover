EFG-Hermes Holding SAE,  Egypt ’s
biggest investment bank, fell to the lowest level in eight years
after its exclusion from the MSCI Egypt Index prompted selling.  The  stock  declined 1.4 percent to 8.75 Egyptian pounds at
the close in Cairo, the lowest since June 2005. Today’s traded
volume of 31 million shares was 14 times the three-month daily
average and the highest in 11 months, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The benchmark EGX 30 Index advanced 1.9 percent.  EFG-Hermes has slumped 12 percent since MSCI Inc. said it
will  remove it  from Egypt’s country index. That compares with a
0.3 percent decrease for the EGX 30. The company is cutting
staff as part of a plan to reduce costs by about a third next
year, two people familiar with the matter said this week. An
attempted takeover by Qatar’s QInvest LLC. fell through earlier
this month.  “The drop from MSCI triggers an automatic sell for
investors that track the index,” said Teymour El-Derini, Cairo-based director of  Middle East  and North Africa sales trading at
Naeem Brokerage. “Still, we saw at least one big buyer that
took about 10 million shares, so obviously there’s still
interest in the company.”  Egyptian Kuwaiti Holding, the Cairo-based private equity
firm also eliminated from the North African country’s MSCI
Index, was suspended from trading today, having lost 21 percent
since MSCI announced the rebalancing of its indexes May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
