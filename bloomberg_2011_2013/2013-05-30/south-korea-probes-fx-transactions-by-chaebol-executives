South Korea’s Financial Supervisory
Service will investigate all people named in a media report that
alleges suspected  tax evasion , Lee Gyeong Su, an official at the
FSS’s foreign exchange investigation team, says by phone.
*“We will investigate every one of them. When doing capital
transactions, they’re required to report to the authorities
prior to the trades so now we are investigating whether they
violated the law”: Lee
*NOTE: The Korea Center for Investigative Journalism has
published the names of individuals at or formerly at South
Korean conglomerates who set up paper companies in  tax havens 
including the British Virgin Islands.
*NOTE: Prosecutors yesterday searched the residence of CJ Group
Chairman Lee Jay Hyun, according to a CJ Group official who
