Estonia ’s credit rating was affirmed
by Fitch Ratings, which cited the Baltic country’s balanced
economic recovery and strong public finances.  Fitch kept Estonia’s long-term government bond rating at
A+, the fifth-highest investment grade, on par with Slovakia and
Malta. The ratings company left the outlook at stable.  Estonia, which adopted the euro in 2011, has weathered
Europe’s debt crisis as Swedish and Finnish demand for its
electronics and wood products helped the economy recover from a
20 percent-slump in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
2008 demise. The $22 billion economy expanded 3.2 percent last
year, the European Union’s third-fastest pace, helped by exports
and public construction spending.  “Euro membership has reduced the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis, simultaneously raising the profile of Estonia’s
key rating attributes: fiscal conservatism, economic flexibility
and underlying political and institutional strengths,” Fitch
said today in an e-mailed statement from  London .  Estonia had a preliminary budget deficit of 0.3 percent of
gross domestic product last year after becoming the only euro-area member to run surpluses in 2010-2011. It had the lowest
public debt among the region’s 17 members at the end of 2012 at
10.1 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
