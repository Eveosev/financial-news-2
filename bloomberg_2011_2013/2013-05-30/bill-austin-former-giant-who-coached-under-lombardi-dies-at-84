Bill Austin , a former National
Football League lineman who helped  Vince Lombardi  develop what
became known as the Green Bay Packers’ power sweep offense, has
died. He was 84.  Austin died this week at his home in Las Vegas, the  New
York Giants  said in a statement without disclosing the cause of
death.  An  offensive lineman  on the Giants’ 1956 National Football
League championship team, Austin played seven seasons for the
team, from 1949 to 1950 and 1953 to 1957. He was a Pro Bowl
guard in 1954.  William Lee Austin was born Oct. 18, 1928, in San Pedro,
California. He grew up in Oregon and played football at Oregon
State University before being drafted in the 13th round by the
Giants in 1949.  Austin became the Packers’ offensive line coach under
Lombardi in 1959, keeping the job for six seasons.  The power sweep, in which the guards would pull around the
offensive line and block for the running backs, was the
signature play of Lombardi’s offense, helping the team to five
NFL titles in the 1960s, including wins in the first two Super
Bowls after the 1966 and 1967 seasons.  Austin left Green Bay prior to the Super Bowl wins,
becoming coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1966 to 1968. He
led the Steelers to an 11-28 record before being replaced by
 Chuck Noll .  Austin also joined Lombardi’s staff with the  Washington
Redskins  in 1969 and was promoted to head coach when Lombardi
was diagnosed with cancer in 1970. He led them to a 6-8 record
in his lone season.  He also had assistant coaching stints with the Giants, from
1979 to 1982; the Los Angeles Rams; the Chicago Bears; the St.
Louis Cardinals; and the  New York  Jets.  Austin was married to Goodrun Austin for 56 years and had
four daughters, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.  To contact the reporter on this story:
