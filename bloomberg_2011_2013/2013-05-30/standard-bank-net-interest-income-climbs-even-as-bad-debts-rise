Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) ,  Africa ’s
largest lender, said net interest income increased in the first
four months of this year even as bad debts rose.  “Despite credit impairments increasing, net interest
income after impairments represents pleasing growth over 2012,”
the Johannesburg-based lender said in a trading update today
without giving further details. “Fees and commissions and
trading income have recorded positive growth. Costs continue to
be affected” by rand weakness, it said.  South African banks, including  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  and
 African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) , have also said bad debts are
rising this year. Economic growth slowed to an annualized 0.9
percent in the first quarter from 2.1 percent in the preceding
three months, Statistics South Africa said on May 28. The rand
has slumped 15 percent against the dollar this year to the
lowest in more than four years.  Standard Bank, the second-worst performing bank stock on
the six-member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index this year after  Absa
Group Ltd. (ASA) , gained 1.6 percent to 111.70 rand in Johannesburg
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
