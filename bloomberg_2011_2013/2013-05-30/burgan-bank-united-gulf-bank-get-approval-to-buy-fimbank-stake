Burgan Bank SAK and United Gulf Bank,
units of Kuwait Projects Co., obtained regulatory approvals to
purchase stakes in Malta-based FIMBank Plc.  The Maltese Financial Services Authority approved Burgan’s
bid to buy 25 percent of FIMBank, the Kuwaiti lender said in a
statement to the Kuwait Stock Exchange. Bahrain-based United
Gulf Bank was given approval by Bahrain’s central bank and
Malta’s FSA to buy as much as 43.7 percent with expected
investment reaching as much as $125 million, according to a
separate statement.  Kuwait Projects is the country’s biggest privately owned
investment company with consolidated assets of $25.6 billion.
Burgan Bank last year raised $356 million from a bond sale as it
seeks financing to bolster its capital base amid expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
