Paul O’Connell will lead the British
and Irish Lions in their rugby tour opener against the
Barbarians in Hong Kong after squad skipper Sam Warburton was
left out to recover from a knee injury.  Ireland lock O’Connell, who captained the combined team on
its 2009 tour of South Africa, was one of six former Lions
included in a 23-man roster for the June 1 game at Hong Kong
Stadium. The others are Adam Jones,  Mike Phillips , Jamie
Roberts, Alun Wyn Jones and  Jamie Heaslip .  “I’m really excited by the first selection of the tour,”
