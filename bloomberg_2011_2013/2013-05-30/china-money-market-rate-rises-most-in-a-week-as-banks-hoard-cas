China ’s money-market rate climbed the
most in more than a week on speculation banks are hoarding cash
to meet month-end  capital requirements .  The People’s Bank of China drained a net 17 billion yuan
($2.8 billion) from the financial system this week, after adding
128 billion yuan last week, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Cash supply will get tight in the short term because of
the month-end requirement,” said Cheng Qingsheng, a bond
analyst at Evergrowing Bank Co. in  Shanghai .  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed 42 basis points, or 0.42
percentage point, to 4.13 percent as of 10:50 a.m. in Shanghai,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. The gain is the biggest since May 20.  The central bank  issued  15 billion  yuan  of three-month
bills today at a yield of 2.9089 percent, unchanged for a
seventh sale, according to a trader required to bid at the
auctions. It also sold 13 billion yuan of 28-day repurchase
contracts, the trader said.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed one
basis point to 3.29 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
