New England Patriots tight end  Rob Gronkowski  is expected to have back surgery in June,  NFL Network
reported , citing a person familiar with his medical situation.  The surgery will be performed in mid-June by Robert Watkins,
who also operated on Gronkowski’s back in September 2009 -- a
procedure that forced the tight end to miss his final college
season at  Arizona , NFL Network said.  Gronkowski, 24, already is recovering from a fourth surgery
on his broken forearm. The All-Pro tight end broke it twice
during the 2012 National Football League season.  Gronkowski had a plate in his left forearm replaced after
developing an infection in the area. The infection hasn’t
returned, NFL Network reported.  Gronkowski missed five games last season, when he broke his
forearm on Nov. 18. He returned on Dec. 30 -- the last week of
the regular season -- and then broke his arm again in a
divisional playoff game against the Houston Texans on Jan. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
