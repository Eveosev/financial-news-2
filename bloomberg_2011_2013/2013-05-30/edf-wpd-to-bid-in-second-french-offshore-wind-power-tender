Electricite de France SA  and German
developer Wpd AG agreed to take part in France’s second offshore
wind tender, as the country plans to add 6,000 megawatts.  The French utility’s renewables unit and Bremen-based Wpd
plan to use 6-megawatt turbines made by  Alstom SA (ALO)  after an
accord signed with the power-equipment manufacturer in 2011, the
companies said today in a statement.  France started a second tender for offshore wind projects
in March, seeking investment of about 3.5 billion euros ($4.5
billion) at two sites off its Atlantic coast. The nation, as yet
without any sea-based  wind energy , plans to install 6,000
megawatts of offshore wind, tidal and wave power by 2020, its
deadline for getting 23 percent of energy from renewables.  The zones in the second program comprise about 200  wind
turbines  to be built off Le Treport in Normandy and between the
d’Yeu and Noirmoutier islands off the Pays de la Loire region.
It follows a first bidding process that awarded four projects
with almost 2,000 megawatts last April to groups led by EDF and
 Iberdrola SA. (IBE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
