Banks may reduce issuance of bonds
designed to bolster equity in a crisis because they offer few
advantages over traditional capital securities, according to
analysts at  CreditSights Inc .  Contingent capital notes, which pay coupons of as much as 9
percent, are growing relatively more expensive as bank
regulators insist bondholders contribute to bailouts,  Simon Adamson  and  John Raymond  in  London  wrote in a report. The notes
are no longer that much riskier than traditional dated
subordinated bonds that pay lower interest, the analysts said.  “When these were thought up, the idea of impairing bonds
before a collapse was pretty much unthinkable,” Adamson said in
a telephone interview. “These days, instruments like these
don’t seem so different because most bank securities are going
to be subject to some form of bail-in.”  Contingent capital bonds are designed either to convert to
equity or be written down when capital ratios fall below a
preset level, typically 5 percent and 7 percent. As regulators
increase  capital requirements  for banks, raising the level when
conversion takes place, “higher trigger bonds will be more
difficult to sell and might be prohibitively expensive,”
according to the report.  Adamson said he expects some issuance to continue in what
is “likely to be a limited market.”  Sales may come from lenders seeking to meet Tier 1 capital
ratios, the first layer to be impaired in a crisis, according to
CreditSights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
