Treasuries headed for the steepest
monthly loss in three years amid speculation the Federal Reserve
could curtail monetary stimulus if policy makers see signs of
sustained improvement in economic growth.  U.S. debt  has tumbled 1.8 percent in May as of yesterday,
the most since December 2009, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Benchmark 10-year notes rallied
earlier as the highest levels in more than a year lured
investors to the government’s sale of $29 billion in seven-year
notes. Government reports showed initial claims for  unemployment
insurance  exceeded forecasts last week and first-quarter
economic growth was revised lower.  “We are in a  bear market  for Treasuries, but it doesn’t
mean we will see rates rise sharply,” said  David Coard , head of
fixed-income trading in  New York  at Williams Capital Group LP, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “People are still
skeptical about the economy and whether or not it will be strong
enough to cause the Fed to actually taper. The economy is
probably strong enough that over the balance of this year you’ll
see rates rising.”  The  yield  on 10-year Treasury notes dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.11 percent as of 4:59 p.m.
New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The
price of the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023 rose 1/32, or 31
cents per $1,000 face amount, to 96 25/32. The yield reached
2.23 percent yesterday, the highest level since April 5, 2012.  Price Swings  Treasury volatility as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE  index  was at 77.41, down from 81.22
yesterday, the highest level in almost a year.  Trading volume dropped to $398 billion, after rising to
$631 billion yesterday, according to ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt . It reached $662
billion on May 22, the highest level in data going back to 2004.
The average daily volume for this year has been $298 billion.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index have fallen 1.5 percent in May, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004. Treasuries have lost
investors 1 percent this year after returning 2.2 percent in
2012.  The median of 75 economists’ and strategists’ predictions
compiled by Bloomberg is for the yield on the 10-year note to
end the year at 2.15 percent.  Futures Trade  Trading in Treasury futures reached a record yesterday,
according to the CME Group in  Chicago . Futures and options
trading for 10-year notes totaled 5.9 million contracts and 3.6
million contracts for five-year futures and options, the CME
said in a statement.  Yields on  current  seven-year notes were unchanged at 1.49
percent. The securities sold today drew a  high yield  of 1.496
percent, the most since March 2012 when the securities yielded
1.59 percent at an auction and compared with a forecast of 1.522
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the  Federal
Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand for the issue
by comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered,
was 2.70. The ratio averaged 2.67 at the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  40.8 percent of the notes, the
most since July and compared with 39.3 percent of the seven-year
notes auctioned last month. The average for the past 10
offerings is 38.3 percent.  Bid Data  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 20.7 percent of
the notes, the most since December and compared with 19.7
percent at the April sale. The average at the past 10 sales is
18 percent.  “I guess we found the right attractive level, at least for
the time being,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate
strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, a primary
dealer. “I think we kind of chop around these levels.”  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month to support the economy. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said last week the Fed could “take a step down in our pace of
purchases” in the “next few meetings,” in testimony to
lawmakers.  The central bank purchased $1.5 billion of securities
maturing between February 2037 and February 2043 today,
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  Economic Output  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2.4 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, less than previously estimated, the
Commerce Department said today in  Washington . The forecast in a
Bloomberg survey called for no revision from the 2.5 percent
pace initially reported.  Initial jobless claims increased to 354,000 in the week
ended May 25, the Labor Department reported. The median forecast
of 49 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for claims to
remain unchanged from the previous week at 340,000.  Treasury yields show inflation expectations fell to a nine-month low. The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and
same-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge
of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, narrowed to 2.20 percentage points today, the smallest gap
since August.  The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal
consumption expenditures deflator, rose 0.8 percent in April
from 12 months earlier, based on a Bloomberg survey of
economists before the Commerce Department reports the figure
tomorrow. It would be the smallest increase since October 2009.  The difference between 10-year and 30-year yields narrowed
to 1.14 percentage points, almost the smallest gap since
November.  “People are expecting month-end rebalancing into bonds out
of stocks, so they’re expecting some demand for Treasuries,”
said  Thomas Tucci , managing director and head of Treasury
trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “Everyone
realizes there’s some risk that’s been put back into the  bond
market  and I don’t think everyone’s going to load up on duration
just because it’s month end.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
