Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) , the nation’s
biggest refiner, beat estimates with a record profit in the
fourth quarter after it received compensation from the
government for selling fuels below cost.  Net income  rose 15 percent to 145.1 billion rupees ($2.3
billion), or 59.77 rupees a shares, in the three months ended
March 31 from 126.7 billion rupees, or 52.19 rupees a share, a
year earlier, the New Delhi-based company said in a regulatory
filing today. That exceeded the 141.9 billion-rupee median
profit  estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net sales
rose 9.7 percent to 1.28 trillion rupees.  Indian Oil depends on government support as it’s ordered to
sell fuels below the cost of production to help curb inflation.
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram’s attempt to narrow the
 budget deficit  by raising diesel prices and giving refiners the
freedom to set  gasoline  prices is helping boost profit for
Indian Oil and its rivals Bharat Petroleum Corp., and Hindustan
Petroleum Corp.  Indian Oil received 237.1 billion rupees in the quarter as
compensation from the government, compared with 208.6 billion
rupees a year earlier, Finance Director P.K. Goyal told
reporters today in  New Delhi .  Indian Oil  shares  rose 0.9 percent to 294.50 rupees at the
close in Mumbai. The stock has gained 9.1 percent this year,
compared with a 4.1 percent increase in the benchmark  S&P BSE
Sensex (SENSEX)  index.  The rupee rose 1.3 percent against the dollar in the last
quarter, lowering crude oil import costs for Indian refiners,
which purchase more than 80 percent of their requirement from
overseas. The currency has declined 3.7 percent this quarter,
dropping to the lowest level since July.  Brent crude , a benchmark for more than half of the world’s
oil, fell 4.9 percent on average in the quarter compared with a
year earlier, reducing costs for Indian Oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
