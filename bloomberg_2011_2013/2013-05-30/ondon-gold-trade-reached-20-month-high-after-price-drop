London  gold trading jumped to a 20-month high in April and silver volumes surged 25 percent after a
plunge in prices for both precious metals spurred an increase in
physical buying, the London Bullion Market Association said.  Trading in gold averaged 24.1 million ounces a day in the
London market, the most for any month since August 2011, the
LBMA said in a statement e-mailed today. The total compared with
21.8 million ounces a day in March. Silver volume was 165.2
million ounces a day, up from 132.5 million ounces in the
previous month. There were 5,395 gold transactions on average
per day, the highest on record, while silver transfers at 1,007
a day were the second-highest ever, according to the report.  Gold fell 14 percent in London in the two trading sessions
ended April 15, the biggest drop in more than 30 years, on
speculation that Cyprus or other European countries would sell
holdings in the precious metal, the LBMA said. The price
rebounded as much as 13 percent through early May as demand
increased for gold coins and jewelry. Assets in exchange-traded
funds backed by gold fell 18 percent this year to 2,152.7 metric
tons yesterday, the lowest since June 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “April was characterized by continued offloading of both
metals by ETF funds,” the LBMA said. “But this was more than
offset by strong physical demand, particularly from  India ,” the
world’s biggest consumer.  ETP Declines  Assets in exchange-traded funds backed by gold fell 174
metric tons in April, the biggest drop on record, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Silver ETF assets dropped by 1.4 percent in
April and 2.3 percent in May.  Gold demand in India is set for a quarterly record as
imports head for 300 to 400 tons in the second quarter, the
World Gold Council said in a report yesterday.  Gold traded at $1,411.60 an ounce today in London, heading
for a 4.4 percent loss in May, a second-straight decline. Prices
are down 16 percent this year. Silver for immediate delivery was
at $22.9425 an ounce, down 5.7 percent in May and 24 percent so
far in 2013.  The value of gold transferred in April increased about 3
percent from the previous month to a daily average of $35.8
billion, the LBMA said. Silver values climbed about 9 percent to
$4.17 billion a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
