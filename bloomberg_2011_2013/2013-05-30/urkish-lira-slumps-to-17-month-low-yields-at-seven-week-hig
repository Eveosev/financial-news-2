The Turkish lira headed for the
lowest level since January 2012 against the dollar amid
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may curb monetary
stimulus. Benchmark two-year yields headed for the highest level
in more than seven weeks.  The lira depreciated 0.5 percent to 1.8707 per dollar at
4:30 p.m. in Istanbul, the lowest level on a closing basis since
January last year. The currency has lost 4.2 percent against the
dollar this month, with analysts forecasting a drop to 1.91 per
dollar by the end of the year, according to forward rates data
compiled by Bloomberg. Two-year  yields  rose 27 basis points to
5.79 percent, climbing a third day and heading for the highest
level since April 10.  A perceived risk that the U.S Federal Reserve will curb
monetary easing earlier than expected is pushing U.S. yields
higher, which in turn “pulls all emerging market curves higher
and possibly steeper,” Cristian Maggio, a strategist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank in  London , said in e-mailed comments
today. “Foreign investors are reducing positions as they don’t
want to get hammered by a rising interest-rate environment.”  The Fed buys $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a
month to support the world’s biggest economy. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 the central bank may cut the pace of
purchases “in the next few meetings” if economic conditions
show a sustained improvement.  Treasury Move  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. increased
10,000 to 354,000 in the week ended May 25, Labor Department
figures showed today in  Washington . Economists expected 340,000
claims, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
Ten-year U.S. yields rose one basis point to 2.13 percent as of
8:51 a.m.  New York  time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
data.  “If U.S. Treasuries move higher, the sell-off in the
Turkish curve will continue, which would negatively impact the
lira,” Maggio said. “But if they change course, Turkey can
outperform on both cheap valuations and high correlation with
the U.S.”  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 0.7 percent to
1,013.67, heading for the lowest level since April 23. The Borsa
Istanbul National 100 index gained 0.1 percent to 87,294.66,
rising for the first time in six days.  The rise in yields gives the signal to the Turkish central
bank that “it should not cut  interest rates  further in the near
term,” Aziz Unan, a portfolio manager at Renaissance Asset
Managers, said in e-mailed comments. The bank has cut its
benchmark rate twice in the past two months, to 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
