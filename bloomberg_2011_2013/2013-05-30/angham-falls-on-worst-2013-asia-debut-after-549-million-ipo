Langham Hospitality Investments Ltd. (1270) ,
a trust backed by  Great Eagle Holdings Ltd. (41)  hotels, fell 9.2
percent in Hong Kong in the worst debut for an initial public
offering of least $500 million in Asia this year.  The shares closed at HK$4.54. The benchmark Hang Seng Index
slid 0.3 percent. Langham Hospitality, based in Hong Kong,
raised HK$4.26 billion ($549 million) last week selling units at
HK$5.00 each, near the midpoint of its price range, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Asian Pay Television Trust (APTT)  sank 5.2
percent in  Singapore  yesterday on the second-worst debut after a
$1.1 billion IPO, Bloomberg data show.  High-yielding securities across Asia declined today as bond
yields jump on concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve will start
slowing debt purchases aimed at igniting economic growth. In
Singapore,  Keppel REIT (KREIT)  and Parkway Life Real Estate Investment
led property trusts lower.  “There could be some knee-jerk reaction to rising U.S.
bond yields, which is not good for yield stocks such as REITs,”
said Ng Soo Nam, Singapore-based chief investment officer at
Nikko Asset Management Asia Ltd., whose Japan-based parent
oversees about $165 billion.  The trust is backed by hotels including The Langham,
Langham Place Hotel and Eaton, all located in Hong Kong’s
Kowloon district, according to a  filing  to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. The hotels have a combined 1,629 guest rooms, the
document showed.  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc
managed the offering for Langham Hospitality, according to a
prospectus. Langham Hospitality boosted operating profit by 14.5
percent to HK$504.8 million last year, while revenue increased
8.9 percent to HK$1.6 billion as occupancy rates improved, the
prospectus shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
