Peru’s sol slumped to its weakest
level in more than a year as slowing economic growth and
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will reduce monetary
stimulus sparked a selloff in the Andean nation’s bonds.  The sol depreciated 0.8 percent to 2.7220 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:53 a.m. in Lima, the lowest level on a closing basis since
October 2011, according to prices from Datatec. The drop
extended this month’s decline to 2.8 percent.  Sol-denominated bonds tumbled on speculation that U.S.
economic growth will lead the Fed to slow the pace of bond
purchases that have buoyed emerging-market assets.  “Yields keep rising, and the sol keeps falling,” said
Walther Benavides, a trader at  BBVA Banco Continental  in Lima.
“Foreigners with positions in local currency bonds are
terrified because they’re losing on both fronts.”  The yield on the benchmark sol bond due in August 2020 rose
20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 4.43 percent, the
highest since Sept. 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The yield declined to a record low 3.67 percent on April 19.  Peru’s economy expanded 4.8 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the slowest pace in more than three years,
as investment growth eased and exports fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
