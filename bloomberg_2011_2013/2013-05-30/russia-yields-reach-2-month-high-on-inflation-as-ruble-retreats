Russia ’s ruble bonds fell, driving
yields to a two-month high as oil dropped and signs of
accelerating inflation damped expectations of rate cuts.  Weekly price-growth data suggest May inflation accelerated
to as much as 7.5 percent, Alfa Bank economists Natalia Orlova
and Dmitry Dolgin wrote in an e-mailed note in Moscow. Russia’s
central bank, which is targeting inflation of 5 percent to 6
percent this year, holds its next rates meeting in the first
half of June.  “Expectations that the central bank will lower its repo
rates have subsided considerably,” Denis Poryvay, an analyst at
ZAO Raiffeisenbank in Moscow said in an e-mailed note. Inflation
has quickened to 7.3 percent, Poryvay said  The yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.35 percent by 1:23
p.m. in Moscow, the highest since March 29. The ruble retreated
0.1 percent against Bank Rossii’s dollar-euro basket to 35.8174
and was little changed versus the dollar at 31.5925.  Brent oil dropped 0.6 percent to $101.81 per barrel,
extending a 1.7 percent decline yesterday. Oil and natural-gas
industries contribute about half of Russia’s budget revenue.
Yields on 10-year  U.S. Treasuries  were little changed at 2.11
percent.  “OFZs will continue to decline,” Dmitriy Turmyshev,
deputy director at the investment management department of OAO
Gazprombank in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments. “Inflation is
high and doesn’t want to go lower.”  The yield on the 2027 OFZ bond may return to its 2013 high
of 7.5 percent reached on March 18, according to Turmyshev. “I
would start buying non-agressively at 7.4 percent,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
