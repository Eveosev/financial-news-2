Stoke City named  Mark Hughes  as
manager of the Premier League soccer club, replacing  Tony Pulis .  Hughes, 49, was fired by Queens Park Rangers in November
with the club in last place in the league. He’s also coached
 Blackburn Rovers , Manchester City, Fulham and the Wales national
team.  “We have thought long and hard about this decision, and we
have the man that we feel is the right fit for this football
club,” Stoke Chairman Peter Coates said at a televised news
conference, adding Hughes received a three-year contract. “We
have analyzed to death Mark’s career. We are satisfied that his
CV is very, very impressive.”  Hughes took over at promoted QPR in January 2012 after  Neil Warnock  was fired with the club in 17th place. QPR finished that
season in the same spot, one point above the three-team
relegation zone.  Hughes was fired after QPR began last season with just four
draws in 12 games. He was replaced by  Harry Redknapp , who
couldn’t save the club from finishing last and being relegated
to the second-tier Championship.  “I’ve had something like 270 games as a Premier League
manager, but people do tend to look at the last year or so,”
Hughes said. “If anything, it gives me greater determination to
go out there and prove people wrong.”  Pulis’s second stint at Stoke ended May 22 after seven
years in which he led the Potters back to the top flight and
into their first F.A. Cup final, where they lost to Manchester
City in 2011. Stoke finished 13th last season with 42 points,
its lowest total in five Premier League campaigns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
