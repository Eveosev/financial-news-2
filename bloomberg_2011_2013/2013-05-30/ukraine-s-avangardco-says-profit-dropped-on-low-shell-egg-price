Avangardco Investments Public Ltd. (AVGR) , a
Ukrainian egg producer, said its net income fell 16 percent to
$60.7 million in January through March as average whole-egg
prices declined.  The average price for whole eggs fell 8.1 percent in the
first quarter of the year, while the price for powdered egg
products rose 4.1 percent, Avangardco said in an e-mailed
statement today.  First-quarter revenue rose 6.3 percent to $155.8 million,
mainly from higher volume of powdered egg product sales,
according to Avangardco. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization fell 13.3 percent to $73.1
million, with an Ebitda margin of 46.9 percent.  Export revenue rose 80 percent from the same period a year
earlier, accounting for 23.1 percent of total revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
