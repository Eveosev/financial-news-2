Joy Global Inc. (JOY) , the largest maker of
underground mining equipment, cut its full-year profit and sales
forecasts and said it sees no immediate recovery in orders as
commodity producers reduce spending amid surplus supply.  Net income will be $5.60 to $5.80 a share on revenue of
$4.9 billion to $5 billion in the year through October, the
Milwaukee-based company said today in a statement. That’s lower
than its February projection for per-share profit of $5.75 to
$6.35 on sales of $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion.  Joy posted second-quarter earnings excluding restructuring
costs of $1.73 a share, beating the $1.56 average of 19
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s customers have cut  capital spending  by 40
percent to 50 percent in response to lower commodity prices, Joy
said. Sales of new equipment slumped 33 percent in the second
quarter, driven by weakness in the U.S., where coal producers
have struggled to compete as some power utilities switch to
cheaper natural gas.  “Encouraging signs in many areas of the economy have not
yet translated to the industrial sector, which is the primary
source of commodity demand,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Sutherlin said in the statement. “We expect customers to
continue to deploy capex for mining equipment on a selective
basis.”  Joy rose 1 percent to $55.61 at the close in New York. The
shares have declined 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
