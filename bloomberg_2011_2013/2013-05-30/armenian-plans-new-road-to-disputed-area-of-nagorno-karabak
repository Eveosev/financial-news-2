Armenia ’s plans to build a second
main road to the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a move
that underscores that country’s unwillingness to compromise with
 Azerbaijan  over disputed territories.  If Armenians build a second main road to Nagorno-Karabakh
it may mean that Armenia “will be more uncompromising about
Kelbajar,” Tatul Hakobyan, a political analyst with Civilitas
Foundation in Yerevan, said by phone today in a reference to the
adjacent region in Azerbaijan that the road will cross.  The road will connect Gegharkunik in northeastern Armenia
to Martakert in northern Nagorno-Karabakh passing through
Shahumyan-Kelbajar, one of seven territories around the
breakaway region under the control of Armenian forces.
Shahumyan’s return to Azerbaijan is among the most controversial
points in deadlocked talks over a peace agreement mediated by
U.S., Russia and  France .  Construction of the 114-kilometer (71-mile) road will start
next year after the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund, financed by the
Armenian diaspora, raises $30 million, according to Gevorg
Gevorgyan, spokesman for the fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
