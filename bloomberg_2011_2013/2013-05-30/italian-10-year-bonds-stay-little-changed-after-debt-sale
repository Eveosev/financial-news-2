Italian 10-year  government bonds  were
little changed after the nation auctioned 5.75 billion euros of
five- and 10-year securities at a debt sale.  The nationâ€™s 10-year yields were at 4.20 percent at 10:15
a.m. London time. Yields on five-year securities climbed two
basis points to 3.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
