Hog futures rose to the highest since
July on speculation that U.S. pork exports to  China , the world’s
biggest consumer, will gain as Shuanghui International Holdings
Ltd. takes over Smithfield Foods Inc. Cattle fell.  Closely held Shuanghui announced yesterday that it agreed
to acquire the Smithfield, Virginia-based U.S. producer for
about $4.72 billion. Shipments to Asian country this year would
total 326 million pounds (148,000 metric tons) if the deal is
completed, or 9.8 percent more than an earlier forecast,
according to Brett Stuart, the chief executive officer of meat
researcher Global AgriTrends.  “Meat is continuing to move,” Jason Golly, a vice
president of risk-management marketing at Lynch Livestock Inc.,
said in a telephone interview. “There’s just great demand.”  Hog futures for June settlement jumped 1.1 percent to 94.05
cents a pound at 10:44 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange,
after touching 94.375 cents, the highest for the most-active
contract since July 9.  Cattle futures for August delivery slid 0.2 percent to
$1.202 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement gained less
than 0.1 percent to $1.45675 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
