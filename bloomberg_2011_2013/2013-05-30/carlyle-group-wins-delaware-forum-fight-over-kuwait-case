Carlyle Group LP (CG)  won a  Delaware 
Supreme Court ruling that Delaware, not  Kuwait , is the proper
place to try an investment-contract case with National
Industries Group Holding.  The state’s high court yesterday upheld a judgment by
Delaware Chancery Court saying the companies were
“sophisticated international organizations” and knew what they
were doing when they agreed to Delaware courts as a venue for
possible disputes.  “Forum selection clauses have become a vital part of
interstate and international commercial agreements,” according
to the decision. “The parties agreed that the courts of
Delaware meet their standards of neutrality and expertise in
commercial litigation.”  Beginning in 2006, Safat, Kuwait-based National Industries
invested $25 million with Carlyle, a Washington-based private-equity firm, then sued in a Kuwaiti court in 2009 to recover an
alleged loss, the justices said. Carlyle interests sued in
Delaware contending any action against the firm must be filed in
that state as part of the contract.  The case is National Industries Group (Holding) v. Carlyle
Investment Management LLC, CA5527, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
