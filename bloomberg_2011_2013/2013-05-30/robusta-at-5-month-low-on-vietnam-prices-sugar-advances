Robusta coffee extended losses to a
five-month low in London as prices in  Vietnam , the world’s
leading producer of the variety used in instant drinks and
espresso, continue to slide. Sugar advanced.  Coffee prices in Vietnam fell 5.2 percent in the past two
weeks to 40,500 dong ($1.93) a kilogram (2.2 pounds),  data  from
the Daklak Trade & Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed.  Dak Lak 
is the nation’s main growing region. Production there this
season will be 25.5 million bags and crop development suggests a
2013-14 harvest of similar size, according to  Andrea Thompson ,
the Belfast, Northern Ireland-based head of research and
analysis at INTL FCStone Inc.’s CoffeeNetwork unit. A bag
usually weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  “Robusta prices continue to collapse, trading toward last
December’s low,” Arthur Liming, a futures specialist at
Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday.
“Cash coffee prices in Vietnam continue to fall.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in July slid 1 percent to
$1,871 a metric ton by 11:04 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London, and
dropped as low as $1,869, the lowest price since Dec. 19.
Arabica coffee for the same delivery month was little changed at
$1.275 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The price
difference between the two varieties was 42.6 cents a pound.  Global robusta coffee production will rise 2.9 percent to
70 million bags in the 2013-14 season after gaining almost 9
percent in the current period, ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.’s Volcafe
unit estimates. The flow of beans from Vietnam this season has
been “strong,” CoffeeNetwork’s Thompson said yesterday.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August added 0.6
percent to $478.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery
in July was up 0.3 percent to 16.72 cents a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for delivery in July was up 0.3 percent at 1,508
pounds ($2,287) a ton in  London . Cocoa for the same delivery
month rose 0.6 percent to $2,224 a ton in New York. ICE futures
trading volumes were 40 percent below the average for the past
100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
