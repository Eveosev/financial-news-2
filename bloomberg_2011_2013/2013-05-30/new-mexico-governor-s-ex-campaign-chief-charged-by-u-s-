A former campaign manager for  New
Mexico  Governor  Susana Martinez  was charged with stealing e-mail
messages sent to the governor and members of her staff after she
was elected.  Jamie Estrada, 40, is accused of computer intrusion and
making false statements, according to a statement today from
U.S. Attorney Kenneth Gonzalez in  Albuquerque .  Estrada controlled an Internet domain that was created
during Martinez’s campaign for governor in 2009 and that
continued to be used by the Republican and staff members after
she became governor in 2011. Estrada left the campaign in
December 2009, according to the statement.  In July 2011, Estrada used the username and password for
the Internet domain to renew it and redirect incoming e-mail
messages for the governor and members of her staff to a separate
domain he controlled, according to the statement.  Estrada’s lawyer, Zachary Ives, didn’t immediately respond
to a phone call to his office seeking comment on the charges.  Martinez’s office didn’t immediately respond to phone and
e-mail messages to her press office.  The case is U.S. v. Estrada, 13-1877, U.S. District Court,
District of New Mexico (Albuquerque).  To contact the reporter on this story:
