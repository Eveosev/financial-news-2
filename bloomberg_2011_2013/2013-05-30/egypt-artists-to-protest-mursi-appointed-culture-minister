Egyptian artists will rally today to
demand the dismissal of the new culture minister, who fired the
head of the Cairo Opera House and two other top arts officials
in what they say is an attempt by the Muslim Brotherhood to
expand control over the state.  About 400 artists and employees at the opera started a
three-day strike yesterday, suspending all performances, said
Nayer Nagui, artistic director and principal conductor at the
Opera House, in a phone interview today. he said.  “We knew our turn was coming,” Nagui said. “They want to
turn cultural institutions into idle and marginalized bodies
headed by mediocrities.”  The minister, Alaa Abdel-Aziz, was appointed by Muslim
Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Mursi this month. He has
dismissed Ines Abdel-Dayem, the former head of the opera house,
as well as the chiefs of the General Book Authority and the
ministry’s fine arts department. Calls to Abdel-Aziz’s mobile
phone weren’t answered.  The Islamist-dominated upper house of parliament discussed
the opera budget on May 28 and recommended reductions. One
Salafist member, Gamal Hamed, suggested that ballet performances
should be canceled because they encourage immorality and
obscenity, the state-run Ahram Online website reported.  Mursi’s critics accuse the president, who became the
country’s first democratically elected civilian leader in June,
of seeking to advance the interests of Islamists and attempting
to curtail freedoms while failing to revive the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
