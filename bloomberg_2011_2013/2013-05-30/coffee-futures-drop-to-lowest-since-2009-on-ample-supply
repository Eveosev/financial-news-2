Coffee futures fell to the lowest
since September 2009 on increasing supplies from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer. Sugar and cocoa gained.  Growers in Brazil will harvest a record 57.8 million bags
of coffee in the season starting Oct. 1, and global supplies
will outpace demand for the second straight year, according to
Volcafe, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based unit of commodity
trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. Futures headed for the biggest
monthly drop since October.  “The market is under pressure because we see ample supply
from Brazil,” Hernando de la Roche, a senior vice president at
INTL FCStone in Miami, said in a telephone interview. “This
crop is a huge crop.”  Arabica coffee for July delivery declined 1 percent to
$1.263 a pound at 12:22 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Earlier, the price touched $1.252, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 14, 2009.  Through yesterday, the price tumbled 23 percent in the past
12 months, the most among 24  raw materials  in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  A bag weighs 132 pounds (60 kilograms). Brazil is also the
top exporter.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery rose 0.5 percent to
16.75 cents a pound.  Cocoa futures for July delivery rose less than 0.1 percent
to settle at $2,211 a metric ton at 11:58 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
