Lithuania  added new restrictions to
environmental laws for shale-gas exploration and production as
the Baltic countryâ€™s government mulls an agreement with  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)   Parliament today amended laws to require an environmental
impact study of exploration, limit usage of radioactive or toxic
materials and set rules for waste storage, the legislature in
Vilnius, the capital, said on its website.  Chevron, a U.S. energy company, in January submitted the
only bid in a tender for shale-gas exploration rights in
Lithuania. The government, which seeks to develop shale-gas
resources as an alternative to imports of natural gas from
Russia, decided not to sign a deal with Chevron until laws on
the process could be improved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
