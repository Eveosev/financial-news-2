The European Union is investigating
whether  Germany  broke EU environmental-protection laws with
flight routes planned for the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport.  Germany will have two months to reply to a letter from the
European Commission in Brussels requesting information about the
routes’ compliance with EU directives, Joe Hennon, a spokesman
for EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik, told reporters
today in Brussels.  “The commission decided today to send a letter of formal
notice to Germany,” Hennon said. “They need to assess the
flight routes under the Environmental Impact Assessment
Directive and also under the Habitats Directive.”  The investigation is the latest setback for the project,
which is over-budget and was originally scheduled to open in
2011. Part of the complex may start operating in October, Bild
newspaper said May 28. The project may cost more than 5 billion
euros ($6.5 billion), Handelsblatt reported on May 6, compared
with the original estimate of 2.8 billion euros.  The project is being managed by the city of Berlin, the
state of Brandenburg and Germany’s federal government.  Ingo Strater, a spokesman for the Federal Transport
Ministry in Berlin, confirmed the letter. “We’ll carefully
assess the commission’s concerns and respond within the
requested timeframe,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
