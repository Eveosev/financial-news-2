The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce crude shipments into mid-June as
demand growth slows, tanker tracker Oil Movements said.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will ship 23.91 million barrels a day in the four weeks to June
15, compared with 24.12 million in the previous period to May
18, the researcher said in an e-mailed report. The figures
exclude two of OPEC’s 12 members, Angola and Ecuador. The
organization will meet in Vienna tomorrow to discuss its
production target, which is currently 30 million barrels a day.  Demand from western nations is “limping,” reducing
imports from the  Middle East  and West Africa,  Roy Mason , the
company’s founder, said today by telephone from Halifax,
 England . “There is no spectacular increase in supply.”  Middle Eastern shipments will slip by 1.1 percent to 17.58
million barrels a day, compared with 17.78 million in the month
to May 18, according to Oil Movements. That figure includes non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will advance 1.7 percent to 476.96
million barrels versus 468.88 million in the previous period,
data from Oil Movements show. The researcher calculates the
volumes by tallying tanker bookings. Its figures exclude crude
held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and  Venezuela .  To contact the reporter on this story:
