Philippine growth unexpectedly accelerated to the fastest pace in almost three years, defying a regional slowdown as President  Benigno Aquino  boosted investment and state spending. The peso reversed its decline.  Gross domestic product  rose 7.8 percent in the three months through March from a year earlier, compared with a revised 7.1 percent gain in the previous quarter, the National Statistical Coordination Board said in Manila today. The figure beat all estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists, whose median was 6 percent.  The peso rebounded from an 11-month low after the data showed Philippine resilience to a cooling in Asian economies that prompted central banks in  India ,  Vietnam  and  Thailand  to cut  interest rates  this month. Aquino, who won control of Congress in May elections, has cracked down on corruption, narrowed the  budget deficit , and procured the first investment-grade rankings from  Fitch Ratings  and  Standard & Poor’s .  “It’s showing domestic demand in the  Philippines  is very resilient in the face of slowing growth regionally,” said  Trinh Nguyen , Hong Kong-based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc. “Government spending surprised on the upside, raising optimism that investment in the country is picking up.”  The peso closed 0.2 percent higher at 42.325 per dollar, according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  fell 3.8 percent on concern valuations are excessive after surging to a record earlier this month.  New Trajectory  Philippine growth in the last quarter was the fastest among 11 Asian economies that have reported data, outpacing  China (CNGDPYOY)  for the first time since at least the first three months of 1994, according to Bloomberg data. The Southeast Asian nation’s full-year expansion last exceeded  China ’s in 1989, IMF data showed.  Aquino has raised levies on tobacco and liquor, pursued tax evaders and is seeking more than $17 billion in infrastructure investments to increase revenues and create jobs. Companies including San Miguel Corp.,  Ayala Corp. (AC)  and JG Summit Holdings Inc. are bidding for the nation’s airport and railway projects.  The economy grew 2.2 percent in the three months through March from the previous period. Investment surged 47.7 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 9.5 percent gain in the previous period. Household consumption increased 5.1 percent and  government spending  rose 13.2 percent, today’s report showed.  The nation is moving at a “new growth trajectory” and the government is committed to ensure stability as it sees the risk of attracting “too much flows,” Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said at a briefing today.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which has held  borrowing costs  at a record-low 3.5 percent for four meetings, has cut the rate on its special deposit accounts three times this year to 2 percent as it stepped up efforts to curb capital inflows.  Policy Space  Inflation (PHC2II)  isn’t likely to pick up soon, Balisacan said. Consumer-price gains eased to a 13-month low in April, rising 2.6 percent from a year earlier.  “We have ample policy space to address any immediate price pressures that may arise,” BSP Governor Amando Tetangco said today. The central bank doesn’t see inflation breaching the target of 3 percent to 5 percent over its policy horizon of two years, given recent levels and projections, he said.  The government is sticking to its growth target of 6 percent to 7 percent this year, even as weakening exports are likely to persist, Balisacan said.  Overseas shipments , which make up the equivalent of about 30 percent of the economy, fell 7 percent last quarter from a year earlier, data showed.
