Eco-Bat Technologies Ltd., a lead
producer, reported an 81 percent drop in first-quarter profit as
lead and silver sales declined.  Net income was 4 million pounds ($6.1 million) compared
with 20.6 million pounds in the same period a year earlier,
Matlock, England-based Eco-Bat said in an e-mailed report today.
Revenue fell 11 percent to 388 million pounds. Lead sales
dropped 15 percent to 181,600 metric tons from 213,700 tons
after the loss of a supply contract with Johnson Controls
Battery Group Inc. on Jan. 1 and “the difficult economic
climate in  Europe ,” it said. Eco-Bat and Johnson Controls,
based in  Milwaukee , are in litigation over a 2008 supply
contract, according to the statement.  Lead for delivery in three months averaged $2,308 a ton in
the first quarter, up 9 percent from $2,117 a ton in the first
quarter of 2012. Prices have since declined and there is
competition for scrap batteries in Europe and the U.S., Eco-Bat
said.  Eco-Bat said it cooperating with the European Commission
after regulators made unannounced visits on Sept. 26 at
companies that buy scrap batteries and other lead scrap for the
production of recycled lead. “The commission stated that it has
reasons to believe that the companies concerned may have
violated Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union, which prohibits cartels and restrictive business
practices,” Eco-Bat said.  ((Eco-Bat will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. U.K. time.
