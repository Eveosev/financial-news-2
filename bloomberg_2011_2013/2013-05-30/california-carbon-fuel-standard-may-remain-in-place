California ’s low-carbon fuel standard
will remain in effect, a state appeals court provisionally ruled
in a lawsuit challenging the regulation by U.S. ethanol producer
Poet LLC.  Poet, the second-largest U.S. maker of the corn-based fuel,
argued that the standard, which requires transportation fuel-sellers in California to reduce the “carbon intensity” of
their products by 10 percent by 2020, should be held invalid
because regulators approved it before completing an
environmental review.  “We’re looking for alternative remedies to throwing out
the regulations completely,” Justice  Rebecca Wiseman  said today
at the start of an hour-long hearing before the California Court
of Appeal in Fresno.  Wiseman and two other judges on a panel hearing the case
didn’t make a final ruling.  Poet’s lawsuit is one of two cases by out-of-state ethanol
producers challenging the low-carbon fuel rule, which assigns a
higher carbon intensity score to ethanol produced outside
California. While the fuel is chemically and physically
identical to ethanol produced in the state, more emissions are
produced by corn farming, transportation and processing
elsewhere, California officials say.  The Fresno case is Poet LLC v. California Air Resources
Board, F064045, California Court of Appeal, Fifth Appellate
District (Fresno).  To contact the reporter on this story:
