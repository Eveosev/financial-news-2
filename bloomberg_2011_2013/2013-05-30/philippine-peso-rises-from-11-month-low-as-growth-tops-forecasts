The Philippine peso strengthened,
rebounding from an 11-month low, and  government bonds  rose after
official data showed the economy expanded by the most in almost
three years in the first quarter.  The peso strengthened 0.4 percent to 42.275 per dollar as
of 10:11 a.m. in  Manila , according to prices from Tullett Prebon
Plc. The currency dropped by as much as 0.5 percent to 42.625
earlier, the weakest level since June 25, 2012.  Gross domestic product increased 7.8 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a revised 7.1 percent in the preceding
three months and the 6 percent median  estimate  in a Bloomberg
News survey. The currency dropped 1.1 percent against the dollar
yesterday on concern an improving U.S. economy increases the
chance the  Federal Reserve  will reduce its bond-buying program
that has increased the flow of funds to  emerging markets .  “We expect GDP to be on the high side of expectations,”
Rafael Algarra, executive vice president at Security Bank Corp.
in Manila, said today before the data was released. “That
should help the peso recover some lost ground.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, declined five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.02 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week that the
monetary authority’s $85 billion of bond purchases a month may
be cut back if there are signs of a sustained U.S. economic
recovery.  Overseas investors  sold  $115 million more Philippine shares
than they bought in the past four days, exchange data show.  The yield on the 5.875 percent sovereign bonds due March
2032 fell eight basis points to 4.38 percent, according to
prices from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
