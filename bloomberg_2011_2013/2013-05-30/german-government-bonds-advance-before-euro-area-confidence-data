Italian bonds advanced, with 10-year
yields dropping from a six-week high, after the nation met its
target amount at a debt auction, signaling demand for the
securities picked up following losses this month.  Yields on  Italy ’s five-year notes declined after the
biggest increase in three weeks yesterday as the nation sold
5.75 billion euros ($7.5 billion) of securities due in 2018 and
2023. French bonds fell, sending 10-year rates to the highest in
more than two months. Belgian debt also dropped, with the yield
difference between 10-year bonds and equivalent-maturity
benchmark German bunds widening to the most in four weeks.  “Italian bonds are rising as there is relief that the
Italian auction is behind us,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior
fixed-income strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan. “There’s
plenty of reasons for investors to be relieved after this
auction, given the risk-off mode of the last few days. The sale
went well with only thing to signal being a small rise in
borrowing costs.”  Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.12 percent at 4:57 p.m.  London  time,
after climbing to 4.23 percent, the highest since April 19. The
price of the 4.5 percent securities maturing in May 2023 rose
0.585, or 5.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 103.435.  The additional yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
the securities instead of benchmark German bunds narrowed six
basis points to 260 basis points.  Italy (GBTPGR10) ’s  five-year  yield fell five basis points to 3.01
percent after climbing 13 basis points yesterday, the most since
May 6.  Global Slump  Government bonds around the world have tumbled this month
amid speculation the Federal Reserve may start to taper its
bond-buying plan. Securities in the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Global Broad Market Index fell 1.5 percent in May, poised
for the steepest loss since April 2004.  Italian government bonds handed investors a loss of 0.8
percent this month through yesterday, according to the indexes.
German securities fell 1.6 percent, while U.S. Treasuries
dropped 1.8 percent.  Italy auctioned 3 billion euros of bonds due in May 2023 at
an average yield of 4.14 percent. It last sold the securities on
April 29 at 3.94 percent, the lowest rate since October 2010.  Investors bid for 1.38 times the amount of securities
allotted at the sale, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover
ratio of 1.42 last month.  The Rome-based Treasury also sold 2.75 billion euros of
five-year notes to yield 3.01 percent, up from a rate of 2.84
percent at a previous auction on April 29.  Spreads Widen  French 10-year debt fell, with yields gaining four basis
points to 2.10 percent, the most since March 14. Rates on
similar-maturity Belgian bonds rose five basis points to 2.27
percent, widening the yield spread with bunds seven basis points
to 75 basis points.  Germany ’s bonds climbed for the first time in four days as
 Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average plunged 5.2 percent, entering a
correction after dropping more than 10 percent from its recent
peak, while Japanese government bonds rose.  Bund yields fell two basis points to 1.52 percent after
climbing to 1.55 percent yesterday, the highest since Feb. 25.  “Bunds are higher, which is a reflection of firmer JGBs
and a weak Nikkei today,” said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “Month-end portfolio
adjustments should naturally favor bonds over equities, given
the bad performance we’ve had in bunds and Treasuries.”  The yield on Japanese bonds due in March 2023 slid 4.5
basis points to 0.89 percent at the close in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporters on this story:
