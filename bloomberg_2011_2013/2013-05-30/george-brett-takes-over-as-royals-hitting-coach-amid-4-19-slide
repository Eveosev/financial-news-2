George Brett, a Hall of Fame third
baseman whose 3,154 hits are the most in Kansas City Royals
history, has taken over as the team’s interim hitting coach amid
an eight-game losing streak.  Brett, 60, has been the Royals’ vice president of baseball
operations since retiring as a player following the 1993 Major
League Baseball season and has assisted the club during spring
training. This will be his first in-season coaching role.  Kansas City is in last place in the American League’s
Central Division with a 21-29 record after losing eight games in
a row and 12 of its last 13. The Royals, who are 4-19 after a
17-10 start to the season, have scored the third-fewest runs in
the AL and their 28 homers are the second-fewest in the majors
ahead of the Miami Marlins.  “Things have not gone as we would have expected and in
light of the downturn in offensive production and poor results
we’ve decided to make a change,” Royals General Manager Dayton Moore said in a  statement . “I’m thankful that this organization
has one of the greatest hitters and more importantly one of the
greatest competitors our game has ever seen in George Brett and
he has accepted our offer to join the coaching staff on an
interim basis.”  Brett is the only major leaguer in history to win batting
titles in three decades, having topped the AL in 1976, 1980 and
1990. He ranks 16th all-time in career hits.  Former hitting coaches Jack Maloof and Andre David were
reassigned to the Royals’ minor-league organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
