Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the world’s
fourth-biggest mining company, said production at three South
African chrome sites has been disrupted by wildcat strikes.  The action started May 28 when about 200 workers at the
Helena mine in the Bushveld Complex in the northwest downed
tools, and spread to the Magareng and Thorncliffe operations,
Christopher Tsatsawane, a spokesman for  the company , said by
phone yesterday. “Strike action is affecting production, but
the amount is unknown at this point.”  The Helena strike started after an employee, a member of
the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, accused a
shift supervisor of assault, Tsatsawane said. “This is a
solidarity action by AMCU to organize members to strike.”  About 200 workers who haven’t responded to three ultimatums
to report for duty have been dismissed and have three days to
appeal the decision, Tsatsawane said. He couldn’t confirm the
total number of workers involved, he said.  Employees in  South Africa  may strike legally, with their
jobs protected, if an independent mediator agrees to a stoppage
and after talks between unions and companies fail. Strikes that
haven’t followed this process can be deemed unlawful and lead to
workers being fired.  The three mines are operating “on a minimal scale,”
Tsatsawane said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
