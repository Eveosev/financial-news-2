The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index advanced 5 basis points to
95.5 basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The benchmark is poised for its highest
close since April 5 and a 12 basis-point rise since April 30,
its first monthly increase in eight, according to data provider
CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 2.5 basis points to 112.5 as of
8:25 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. prices show. The measure, set to gain 5 basis points this
month, is on track to close at its highest level since April 23,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 1.5 basis
points to 110 basis points as of 10:22 a.m. in Sydney, according
to Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark is poised to
close at its highest level since April 24 and rise 4.1 basis
points this month, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
