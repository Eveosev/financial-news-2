The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by Statistics  Canada .  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) declined 0.8% in
April, led by lower prices for petroleum and coal products. The
Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) fell 2.2%, mostly because of
decreased prices for crude oil.  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  The IPPI posted the first decrease since November 2012, as
most commodity groups were down. It was the largest decline
since December 2011. Of the 21 major commodity groups, 14 were
down, 3 were up, and 4 were unchanged.  The largest contributor to the decline of the IPPI in April
was petroleum and coal products (-3.0%), which fell largely
because of lower prices for fuel oil and other fuels (-4.7%),
specifically diesel fuel (-4.9%), as well as gasoline (-3.6%).
The decrease in gasoline prices was partly due to high
inventories of crude oil in North America. The IPPI excluding
petroleum and coal products declined 0.4% in April.  Primary metal products (-2.8%) also contributed
significantly to the decline of the IPPI, mainly as a result of
lower prices for other non-ferrous metal products, specifically
silver and platinum (-8.7%) and gold and gold alloys in primary
form (-6.3%). There were also declines in copper and copper
alloy products (-5.6%) and nickel products (-7.1%).  Among the other product groups that decreased was motor
vehicles and other transportation equipment (-0.4%). The
increase in the value of the Canadian dollar against the US
dollar was largely responsible for this decline.  Some Canadian producers who export their products report
their prices in US dollars. Consequently, the 0.6% appreciation
of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar may have had
the effect of pushing the IPPI downward. Without the measurable
effect of the exchange rate, the index would have fallen 0.6%
instead of 0.8%.  The decline of the IPPI in April was moderated slightly by
chemical products and rubber, leather and plastic fabricated
products.  Industrial Product Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with April 2012, the IPPI was unchanged, even
though most commodity groups were up.  Prices for lumber and other wood products (+10.3%)
continued to rise on a year-over-year basis, extending the
upward trend that began in February 2012. Higher prices for
softwood lumber (+19.9%) were largely responsible for the
increase in this commodity group.  Motor vehicles and other transportation equipment (+1.7%)
also posted a year-over-year gain, mostly due to the 2.6%
depreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar.
Without the measurable effect of the exchange rate, the IPPI
would have fallen 0.6% instead of being unchanged.  Among the other product groups that increased were
electrical and communications products (+2.0%), pulp and paper
products (+1.4%) and fruit, vegetables, feeds and other food
products (+1.1%).  Conversely, primary metal products (-5.3%) and petroleum
and coal products (-3.3%) mainly offset the year-over-year price
increases.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the decrease
in primary metal products was largely attributable to other non-ferrous metal products (-10.1%), iron and steel products (-3.0%)
and copper and copper alloy products (-5.7%).  Gasoline (-6.9%) and fuel oil and other fuels (-2.2%) were
mostly responsible for the decline in petroleum and coal
products. The IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products was up
0.5% on a year-over-year basis.  Raw Materials Price Index, monthly change  The RMPI fell 2.2% in April, the second consecutive monthly
decline and the largest decrease since June 2012. All major
product groups except one were down or unchanged.  The decrease of the RMPI was primarily due to mineral fuels
(-2.5%), particularly crude oil (-2.8%), which fell for a second
straight month. The decline in crude oil prices partly reflected
poor economic growth prospects among the largest petroleum
consumers. The RMPI excluding mineral fuels was down 1.8% in
April.  Non-ferrous metals (-4.7%) also contributed to the decrease
of the RMPI in April, mainly as a result of lower prices for
copper concentrates (-8.0%). Precious metals (-6.8%), zinc
concentrates (-3.1%) and other non-ferrous base metals (-3.3%)
were also down.  To a lesser extent, vegetable products (-1.5%) also
contributed to the RMPI decline, mostly because of lower prices
for grains (-2.8%), specifically corn and wheat.  The decrease of the RMPI was moderated slightly by non-metallic mineral products.  Raw Materials Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with April 2012, the RMPI was down 1.9%. The last
year-over-year increase in the index was in February 2012.  The year-over-year decline of the RMPI was largely due to
lower prices for mineral fuels, specifically crude oil (-3.3%),
which continued the downward trend that began in March 2012. The
RMPI excluding mineral fuels fell 1.1% on a year-over-year basis.  Non-ferrous metals (-5.8%) also contributed to the year-over-year decrease of the RMPI, as a result of lower prices for
copper concentrates (-7.0%), radioactive concentrates (-15.4%)
and other non-ferrous base metals (-7.6%).  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the decrease
of the RMPI was moderated slightly by wood products (+6.8%) and
animals and animal products (+1.5%).  Note to readers  With each release, data for the previous six months may
have been revised. The indexes are not seasonally adjusted.  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in Canada receive as the goods leave the
plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike
the Consumer Price Index, the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and
all the costs that occur between the time a good leaves the
plant and the time the final user takes possession of it,
including the transportation, wholesale, and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate
their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars,
which are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular,
this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood
products. Therefore, a rise or fall in the value of the Canadian
dollar against its US counterpart affects the IPPI. But the
conversion into Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents
provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes the full
effect of exchange rates into account.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on
the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot rate) established
by the Bank of Canada, and it is available on CANSIM in table
176-0064 (series v37426). Monthly and annual variations in the
exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated
according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for
example, CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the prices
paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of
those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices
are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into
Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of
the RMPI.  Statistics Canada is undertaking two important initiatives
for the IPPI and the RMPI.  The classification of the IPPI and the RMPI will change
soon and the basket will be updated to 2010=100. These changes
will take place in late 2013. For more information, please refer
