LeBron James of the Miami Heat and
Lance Stephenson and David West of the  Indiana  Pacers were fined
$5,000 each by the National Basketball Association for breaking
the league’s anti-flopping rule.  James and West were fined for flopping during a fourth-quarter collision in Game 4 of their Eastern Conference finals
matchup, the NBA said on its  website . Stephenson was fined for
over-exaggerating an elbow he took from Miami guard Ray Allen
during the first quarter.  The NBA enacted its anti-flopping policy this season to
punish players for attempting to fool referees into calling
undeserved fouls. Fines escalate for repeated infractions and
can reach $30,000.  James, who was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for the
fourth time this month, was accused of flopping by Chicago Bulls
coach Tom Thibodeau during the second round of the playoffs.
Prior to Game 4 against Indiana, James said players were still
getting used to playing without flopping and that it’s “not
even a bad thing, you’re just trying to get the advantage,”
according to CBS Sports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
