European stocks  climbed, rebounding
from a three-week low, as investors weighed data on U.S.
economic growth and house sales to gauge the Federal Reserve’s
view on continuing stimulus measures.  Lonmin Plc and Fresnillo Plc both rallied at least 5.5
percent as precious metals climbed. Genmab A/S jumped to its
highest price since August 2009 after its Arzerra cancer
treatment met its objective in a trial. Tate & Lyle Plc paced
declining shares after earnings missed analyst estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.4 percent to 303.55 at
the close. The measure dropped 1.9 percent yesterday amid
concern that the Federal Reserve will taper its bond purchases
as the economy strengthens. The gauge is heading for a 2.3
percent advance in May, extending its longest streak of monthly
gains since 1997.  “You have to be careful not to be too bearish,” Stewart Richardson, who helps oversee $100 million as chief investment
officer at RMG Wealth Management LLP, told Manus Cranny on
Bloomberg Television in  London . “There are going to be bad days
in the market, but there is that belief that the Federal Reserve
can always step in.”  In the U.S., the Commerce Department said that the economy
grew at a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. It
had earlier estimated that gross domestic product expanded at a
2.5 percent pace in the period.  The index of  pending house sales  rose 0.3 percent after a
1.5 percent advance in March, separate figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
forecast the April gain would match the prior month’s increase.  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes climbed in eight of the 17
western-European markets that were open today. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 rose 0.5 percent, while  Germany ’s DAX added 0.8 percent and
 France ’s CAC 40 gained 0.6 percent. Trading in Vienna was closed
for a holiday.  Lonmin led a rally in precious-metal producers, climbing
5.9 percent to 287 pence in London. Fresnillo advanced 6.2
percent to 1,156 pence, for its biggest advance in six weeks,
and Randgold Resources Ltd gained 5.8 percent to 5,225 pence.  Genmab jumped 6.8 percent to 208.50 kroner. A study found
that chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients given Arzerra in
combination with a second medicine lived 9.3 months longer
without their condition worsening. A total of 447 patients were
treated in the phase 3 trial, the last required before seeking
regulatory approval.  Saft Groupe SA gained 2.5 percent to 18.37 euros after the
maker of batteries for the aerospace industry entered an
agreement with Schneider Electric SA to collaborate on supplying
electrical-energy storage systems for commercial and industrial
buildings. Schneider rose 2.5 percent to 61.64 euros.  Semiconductor Inventory  STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe’s biggest semiconductor
maker, rose 2.1 percent to 7.34 euros in Paris and Infineon
Technologies AG, the second largest, increased 3.3 percent to
6.61 euros. JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a report to clients
that changes in the semiconductor industry’s inventory looked
“supportive for a continuing up-cycle.”  Pirelli & C. SpA (PC)  climbed 3.1 percent to 8.86 euros after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc upgraded Europe’s third-largest
tiremaker to neutral from sell, citing valuations.  Faurecia, which makes car interiors, added 3.8 percent to
16.97 euros after Goldman added the company to its “conviction
buy” list.  Tate & Lyle dropped 1.5 percent to 836.5 pence as the maker
of the artificial sweetener Splenda reported full-year sales of
3.26 billion pounds ($5 billion). That missed the average
analyst forecast of 3.28 billion pounds.  SBM Offshore NV declined 2.3 percent to 14.10 euros after
Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation for the oil services
company to underweight, the equivalent of a sell rating.
Analysts cited the stock’s 37 percent rally so far this year.  Tesco Plc also fell after JPMorgan downgraded the U.K’s
biggest retailer to neutral from overweight, citing a cautious
view on British food retailers. The stock lost 1.5 percent to
367.25 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
