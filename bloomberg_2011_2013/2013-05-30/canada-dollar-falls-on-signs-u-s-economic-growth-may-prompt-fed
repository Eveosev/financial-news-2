Canada ’s dollar reached the strongest
level in a week versus its U.S. peer as the nation’s current-account deficit narrowed more than economists forecast in the
first quarter on rising commodity exports.  The currency erased earlier losses against the greenback as
a report showed the U.S. economy expanded less than estimated in
the first quarter. Canada’s dollar trimmed a monthly decline
versus the U.S. currency as crude oil, the nation’s largest
export, rebounded from a four-week low.  “It’s really about a soft U.S. dollar,” said Adam Button,
a currency analyst at forexlive.com in  Montreal . “That’s
spilled over to the Canadian dollar, and that’s just sidelined
today. At the same time, it comes after a few weeks of extended
weakness for the Canadian dollar, so it’s no surprise to see a
snap-back. May has essentially been a terrible month for the
Canadian dollar.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is nicknamed for the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.5 percent to C$1.0297 per
U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, its strongest since May 23.
One loonie buys 97.12 U.S. cents.  The loonie declined 2.2 percent for the month versus the
greenback. It reached C$1.0421 yesterday, its lowest level since
June 5, 2012.  Oil futures gained 0.5 percent to $93.59 a barrel in New
York after falling as much as 1.6 percent. They touched $91.65,
the lowest level since May 2.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond yields were
little changed 2.06 percent. The 1.5 percent security maturing
in June 2023 added three cents to C$94.94.  Current Account  Canada’s deficit of  C$14.1 billion  (C$13.6 billion) from
January to March reported by Statistics Canada in Ottawa was
smaller than the C$15.6 billion shortfall forecast in a
Bloomberg economist survey with 16 responses. The fourth quarter
gap was revised to C$14.6 billion from C$17.3 billion.  “The current account looking slightly better, or at least
not as bad as feared,”  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency
strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by phone
from  London . The American economic report was “slightly
negative for the U.S. side of the equation,”  The U.S. economy grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, the Commerce Department said in  Washington . The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for no revision
from the 2.5 percent pace initially reported.  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. increased
10,000 to 354,000 in the week ended May 25, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. Economists called for
340,000 claims, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey.  Risk Reversals  The cost to insure against declines in the loonie versus
its U.S. counterpart fell to the lowest level in two weeks. The
three-month so-called 25-delta risk reversal rate touched 1.45
percent, the lowest since May 14.  Risk reversals measure the premium on options contracts to
sell Canadian dollars versus buying U.S. contracts that do the
opposite.  “There’s been quite a bit of chatter around U.S. dollar
selling on month-end tomorrow,” said Greg T. Moore, currency
strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, by phone from Toronto.
“There’s been some fairly significant moves in rates, equities
and foreign-exchange markets over the past month, so I think --
put all that together -- there’s some re-balancing that suggests
the U.S. dollar should be sold today.”  The Canadian dollar has declined in the past week along
with other dollar-bloc currencies in a basket of 10 developed
nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg Correlation Weighted
Index. The loonie has fallen 0.3 percent and the greenback has
dropped 0.5 percent, while the dollars of  Australia  and New
Zealand have declined 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
