The 2008 wine of Chateau Pavie, a
Bordeaux estate ranked as one of Saint-Emilion’s top four
growers, climbed to a record 1,520 pounds ($2,300) a case on the
London Liv-ex market yesterday.  Pavie 2008 traded as low as 990 pounds in May 2010 and
started to climb above 1,200 pounds a case from September, after
the estate’s promotion in Saint-Emilion’s 2012 classification
drawn up by  France ’s Institut National de l’Origine et de la
Qualite, or INAO. It touched 1,516 pounds this month.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 6 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared
by a 2 percent decline since then. Investor demand for top-growth Bordeaux wines has revived after a 16-month price slide
ending in mid-November.  Pavie was promoted with Chateau Angelus to the rank of
Premier Grand Cru Classe A, joining Chateau Cheval Blanc and
Chateau Ausone. Pavie’s 2008 vintage is trading at a lower price
than three of its younger vintages, the 2009, 2010 and 2012
wines, according to Liv-ex data on its Cellar Watch website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
