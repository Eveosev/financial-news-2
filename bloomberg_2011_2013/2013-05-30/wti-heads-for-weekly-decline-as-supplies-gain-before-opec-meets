West Texas Intermediate crude headed
for a third weekly decline as OPEC kept its production target
unchanged for a third consecutive time and after U.S. stockpiles
climbed to the most in more than 80 years.  Futures retreated as much as 1 percent in  New York . The
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries maintained its
target of 30 million barrels a day,  Libya ’s OPEC Governor Samir Salem Kamal said today after ministers ended a meeting in
Vienna. Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said earlier that prices
are reasonable and the market situation is excellent. U.S. crude
inventories rose  3 million barrels  last week to 397.6 million,
the highest level since at least 1931, government data showed.  “It is what the market was expecting,” Seth Kleinman,
head of energy strategy at Citigroup Inc. in London, said of
OPEC’s decision at its headquarters in the Austrian capital.
“The market is oversupplied, and OPEC needs to act but is not
feeling much urgency clearly.”  WTI for July delivery was at $92.78 a barrel, down 83
cents, or 0.9 percent, in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 1:28 p.m. London time. The volume of all
futures traded was 33 percent below the 100-day average. The
contract increased 48 cents to $93.61 yesterday. Prices have
fallen 1.4 percent this week and are little changed this month
after a 3.9 percent loss in April.  OPEC Supply  Brent for July settlement traded 77 cents lower at $101.42
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark grade was at a premium of $8.60 to WTI
futures, from $8.58 yesterday. The spread is poised to narrow
for a third month.  OPEC has no formal target for prices, the group’s
Secretary-General Abdalla El-Badri told a news conference in
Vienna after the ministers’ meeting.  Global supply and demand are balanced, inventories are
moderate and the market situation is excellent, al-Naimi, oil
minister for the world’s biggest crude exporter, told reporters
earlier.  “I said in March $100 is a reasonable price. Where are the
prices today? They are still at the reasonable level,” al-Naimi
said. “We’re not talking about a floor or a ceiling for the
price. The prices are determined by the market.”  Six-Month High  Production from the 12-member group climbed to the highest
level in six months in May, a Bloomberg survey showed. Daily
output rose by 98,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, to an average of
31.034 million from a revised 30.936 million in April, according
to the survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts.  Brent has declined about 7 percent while WTI has risen 7
percent since OPEC’s last meeting on Dec. 12.  An oversupply of crude in Houston should keep WTI prices at
least $8 a barrel below Brent, according to Adam Longson, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. Inventories along the
U.S. Gulf Coast surged to a four-year high of 195.5 million
barrels on April 26, data from the Energy Information
Administration show. They were at 193.2 million last week.  Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI
futures, increased by 335,000 barrels to 50.5 million last week,
according to yesterday’s report by the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. Supplies are down from a record
51.9 million on Jan. 18.  Gasoline Stockpiles  U.S. gasoline inventories dropped 1.5 million barrels last
week, the data show. They were forecast to fall by 500,000
barrels, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Distillate supplies, including heating
oil and diesel, rose 1.9 million barrels, compared with a
projected decrease of 450,000.  WTI will decline in the week through June 7 because of
ample supplies, said 23 of 42, or 55 percent, of analysts and
traders in a separate Bloomberg survey. Ten respondents, or 24
percent, predicted a gain and nine projected no change. Last
week, 63 percent of analysts forecast a fall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
