Nigeria’s House of Representatives
passed a bill that makes same-sex unions a criminal offense
punishable by as many as 14 years in prison.  The bill sets 14-year jail terms for people who enter into
same-sex marriages or civil unions and 10 years for those who
witness, aid or abet such unions as well as those who operate
gay clubs and societies, Victor Ogene, a lower-house spokesman,
said by phone from the capital, Abuja. Same-sex public displays
of affection would be punishable by as many as 10 years behind
bars. The Senate passed a similar bill in November 2011.  “It’s been synchronized with the Senate’s position,”
Ogene said. “It goes to the president to be signed. Within a
week they should put the papers together.”  Nigeria is  Africa ’s largest oil producer and most-populous
country with more than 160 million people almost evenly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south.  President Goodluck Jonathan’s spokesman Reuben Abati’s
mobile phone was switched off when Bloomberg News attempted to
reach him for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
