A U.S.-educated engineer running in
Iran’s June presidential race said his government should go on a
diplomatic offensive to convince the world its nuclear ambitions
are peaceful.  Mohammad Reza Aref suggested President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
had mishandled the nuclear issue by letting it get
“political.”  “Everyone knows that we aim to use advanced technologies
toward our progress,” said Aref, who was a vice president under
former President Mohammad Khatami a decade ago. “We need to
create a rallying force in the world behind Iran.” He spoke in
a live interview aired on Iranian state television late
yesterday.  Iran has been diplomatically isolated and punished
economically by world powers trying to pressure it to modify a
nuclear program they suspect is a cover to build bombs. Iran
says its nuclear program is peaceful.  Aref, 61, holds a doctorate from  Stanford University , where
he studied electrical engineering and statistics, according to
Iranian Diplomacy, a website run by former Iranian diplomats. He
is one of eight candidates vying to succeed Ahmadinejad in the
June 14 race.  Like Khatami, he advocates greater personal and press
freedoms and seeks to ease  Iran ’s international isolation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
