Cocoa futures traded in  New York  are
set to fall to the lowest level in almost two months after a
support level was breached, according to technical analysis by
London-based futures and options broker Sucden Financial Ltd.  The beans for September delivery will probably slide to
$2,140 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. within the next 10 days
after prices fell below $2,200 a ton yesterday, according to
Sucden senior analyst Myrto Sokou. Prices may then extend the
slide to $2,126, she said. That would be the lowest for a
second-month contract since April 4, data on Bloomberg showed.  “The market has been in a free-fall since May 3,” Sokou
said by phone from  London  yesterday. “If the downside momentum
continues to weigh on the market sentiment, it seems that the
next downside target would be $2,140 a ton and then $2,126 a
ton. It’s been a sharp decline in the cocoa market.”  Cocoa has fallen 6.6 percent so far this month, based on
the second-month contract, as rainfall in West Africa, the
world’s main growing region, is improving the outlook for the
2013-14 crop that starts in October. Rain will fall in the
region this week after totaling 0.5 inch to 3.5 inches last
week, MDA Weather Services, in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a
report e-mailed on May 28.  “If the market continues to be oversold like it is at the
moment, it seems that there may also be an opportunity for some
buying, with a short-term correction higher to retest $2,250 a
ton to $2,303 a ton levels,” Sokou said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
