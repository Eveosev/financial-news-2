India ’s rupee rose for the first time
in three days as some investors judged its decline to a 10-month
low yesterday to be excessive.  The 14-day relative strength index is 77.6, above the 70
threshold that suggests the rupee may advance. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the greenback against six major trading partners,
fell for a second day. The rupee yesterday dropped to the lowest
level since July on concern U.S. policy makers will rein in
stimulus measures as the world’s largest economy recovers.  “There are technical factors involved in today’s move,”
said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at Development Credit Bank
Ltd. in Mumbai. “The rupee is likely to stay rangebound today,
and the longer-term outlook will be determined by how the global
situation plays out.”  The rupee strengthened 0.1 percent to 56.1400 per dollar as
of 9:54 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 56.3750 yesterday, the weakest level since July 25,
and dropped 4.2 percent this month. The currency will stay
between 56 and 56.30 today, Raghuvanshi predicts.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.99 percent.  Overseas investors bought a net $14.8 billion of Indian
shares this year through May 28 and boosted  holdings  of debt to
a record $38.5 billion on May 21, exchange data show, as global
stimulus measures spurred flows into  emerging markets . Global
funds must hedge purchases of rupee bonds for exchange-rate
risks, Barclays Plc recommended in a research note today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 57.07 per
dollar, compared with 57.14 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 57.02 versus 57.13. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
