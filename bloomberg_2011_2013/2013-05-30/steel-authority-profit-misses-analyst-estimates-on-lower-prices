Steel Authority of India Ltd. , the
nation’s second-biggest producer, posted a worse-than-expected
72 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit as weak demand led to a
decline in prices.  Net income  for the three months ended March 31 dropped to
4.47 billion rupees ($80 million) from 15.8 billion rupees a
year earlier, the New Delhi-based company said today in an
exchange filing. The median profit of 26 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was 8.3 billion rupees. Sales fell 9
percent to 122 billion rupees.  India ’s steel consumption grew at 3.3 percent in the year
ended March 31, the slowest pace in four years, following a drop
in car sales and construction. Waning demand and higher imports
from  Japan  and  South Korea  caused prices to fall.  The company sold 3.24 million metric tons of steel in the
quarter, little changed from a year earlier. Net sales
realization fell 11 percent to 34,489 rupees a ton in the last
quarter from a year ago, Chairman C.S. Verma said in a press
conference after the earnings were released.  Lower prices eroded Steel Authority’s revenue by 13.5
billion rupees in the last quarter, Verma said. Hot-rolled steel
coil, a benchmark product used in automobiles and buildings,
declined 10 percent to an average 39,170 rupees, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on data from Metal Bulletin.  The  shares  fell 1.2 percent to 59.05 rupees at close in
Mumbai. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.3 percent.  A drop in raw material prices cushioned the profit decline.
Benchmark prices of coking coal, a key steelmaking ingredient,
slumped to a record $165 a ton during the quarter amid a drop in
demand from China and Japan, the world’s largest importer, and
rising production in  Australia ,  South Africa  and Mongolia. Steel
Authority imports about 70 percent of its coking coal needs.  Total costs fell 5 percent to 116 billion rupees, while
finance costs surged 78 percent to 2.15 billion rupees,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
