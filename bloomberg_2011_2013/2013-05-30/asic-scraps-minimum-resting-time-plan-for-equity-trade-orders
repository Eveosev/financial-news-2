Australia ’s securities regulator said
it will not proceed with a proposal to impose a minimum time
period that small equity trade orders must remain on order books
before they can be withdrawn.  Greg Medcraft, chairman of the  Australian Securities and
Investments Commission , announced the decision at a conference
in Sydney today. ASIC had included the measure as part of
proposals to improve liquidity for investors.  “We have seen a considerable lessening of noise created by
small fleeting orders and expect there will be even further
improvement,” Medcraft said. “Our proposal remains on the
table should market noise return to problematic levels.”  Regulators in countries from Australia to Singapore and
 Hong Kong  have weighed proposals to limit trading practices that
reduce fund managers’ ability to trade in and out of stocks.
ASIC said its investigations have found that concern from so-called high frequency trading strategies were overstated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
