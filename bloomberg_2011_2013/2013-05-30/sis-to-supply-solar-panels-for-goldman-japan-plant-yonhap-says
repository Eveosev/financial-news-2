South Korea’s  LS Industrial Systems
Co. (010120)  will supply solar panels for  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s 40
megawatt plant in Ibaraki, Japan, Yonhap News reported today,
citing a source at LSIS that it didn’t name.  LSIS will provide panels and other equipment for the plant
through  Kajima Corp. (1812)  and the order is worth about 40 billion won
($35 million), the South Korean news agency reported on its
Japanese website.  Goldman set up Japan Renewable Energy Co. in August to
plan, design and operate power plants that run on sunlight,
wind, fuel cells and biomass. The 40 megawatt generator is
expected to start operating in January 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
