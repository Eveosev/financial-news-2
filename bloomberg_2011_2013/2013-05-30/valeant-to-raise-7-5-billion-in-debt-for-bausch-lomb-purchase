Valeant Pharmaceuticals International
Inc. (VRX)  will finance its purchase of Bausch & Lomb Holdings Inc.
with about $7.5 billion in debt.  Valeant,  Canada ’s largest drugmaker, will raise a $4.3
billion term loan and sell $3.225 billion in senior unsecured
bonds, the company disclosed today in a regulatory filing.
Valeant will also seek $1.75 billion in equity.  Proceeds will support the $8.7 billion  acquisition  and
repay about $4.2 billion of Warburg Pincus LLC-owned Bausch &
Lomb’s borrowings leaving leverage, a measure of debt to
earnings, before taxes, depreciation and amortization at 4.6
times, according to the filing.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is arranging the financing, the
Montreal-based Valeant and Rochester, New York-based Bausch &
Lomb said in a statement on May 27. The transaction is expected
to close in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
