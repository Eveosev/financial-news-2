Indian demand for solar-power credits
has dropped 43 percent this month as electricity producers and
distributors sidestep clean-energy targets, according to
 REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt .  Bids for credits, which power companies and industrial
consumers need to meet renewable-energy goals, declined to 1,999
in May from 3,522 in April, REConnect said in an e-mail. The
Indore-based trader records all the transactions on the Indian
Electricity Exchange and the Power Exchange of  India .  Trading remains “dry” because authorities are failing to
enforce clean-energy targets on state electricity distributors
and large power producers, REConnect said.  India, which generates 58 percent of its electricity from
coal, requires companies including  Tata Power Co. (TPWR)  to get as much
as 10 percent of their energy from renewables. Those unable to
source enough locally may meet targets by buying credits from
wind, solar, hydro and biomass plants via the two exchanges.  The decline in demand has pushed the price of credits to as
low as 10,990 rupees ($196) apiece, according to REConnect. Each
credit represents 1 megawatt-hour of electricity fed into the
 power grid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
