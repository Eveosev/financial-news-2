Gold climbed to a two-week high on
speculation that the Federal Reserve will maintain bond
purchases to bolster the U.S. economy, boosting demand for the
precious metal as a store of value. Silver also rose.  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 2.4 percent
annualized rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department
said today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for
no revision from the 2.5 percent pace initially reported.
Initial jobless claims rose 10,000 to 354,000, above the 340,000
forecast. The dollar slumped the most in more than a month
against a basket of currencies  “Today’s data is an indication that the economy has not
fully recovered, and so the Fed will not end its stimulus in a
hurry,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J.
O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“Also, a weaker dollar helps.”  Gold futures for August delivery advanced 1.5 percent to
settle at $1,412 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the biggest gain for a most-active contract since May 23.
Earlier, the precious metal jumped to $1,471.70, the highest
since May 15.  Trading was 27 percent higher than the average for the past
100 days at this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said May 22 that the central
bank may slow its $85 billion of monthly debt purchases if the
economy shows sustained signs of improvement.  Gold has dropped 16 percent this year and entered a bear
market last month as equities rallied, the dollar strengthened
and amid concern that the Fed may slow the pace of its stimulus
measures.  Silver futures rose 1.1 percent to $22.69 an ounce in New
York, the second straight gain.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, palladium futures for
September delivery advanced 1.4 percent to $760.55 an ounce.  Platinum futures for July delivery climbed 2 percent to
$1,482.70 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
