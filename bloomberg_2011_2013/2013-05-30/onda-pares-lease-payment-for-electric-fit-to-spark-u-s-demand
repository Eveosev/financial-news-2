Honda Motor Co. (7267)  is trimming the lease
price for its electric Fit hatchback by a third as the carmaker
follows similar moves by  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) 
to boost demand for plug-in models.  The monthly fee to lease a Fit EV for 36 months will drop
to $259, from $389 previously, with no down payment, from June
1, Honda said yesterday in a statement. Customers who’ve already
leased one will pay the lower rate starting in June. The company
also said it will provide a 240-volt charger at no cost with the
lease, which includes collision insurance coverage.  With the changes, the car is “the only EV on the market
with no down payment, unlimited mileage, collision coverage and
a free home charging station,” said Steve Center, Honda’s U.S.
vice president for environmental business development, in the
statement.  While the rechargeable model from Tokyo-based Honda has
better all-electric range than either GM’s Chevrolet Volt or
Nissan’s Leaf hatchback, it trails both in U.S. deliveries since
going on sale this year. Through April, Honda reported sales of
just 68 Fit EVs compared with 5,500 Volts and 5,476 Leafs,
according to market researcher Autodata.  GM and Nissan began low-priced lease promotions for their
rechargeable models last year. Nissan is promoting a $199 per
month lease payment for Leaf, with $1,999 down, according to the
carmaker’s website. GM’s Volt plug-in hybrid is available for a
$269 monthly lease with a $2,399 down payment.  Honda’s Fit EV is rated by the U.S. as averaging 82 miles
(132 kilometers) per charge, compared with 75 miles for Leaf.
Volt averages 38 miles per charge before a gasoline engine
engages to power the car, giving it combined range of 380 miles,
according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Honda, with U.S. sales operations in Torrance,  California ,
plans to deliver 1,100 Fit EVs in the car’s first two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
