Canada ’s  current account  deficit
narrowed more than economists forecast in the first quarter on
rising commodity exports including record crude oil shipments.  The deficit of C$14.1 billion (C$13.6 billion) from January
to March reported by Statistics Canada in Ottawa today was
smaller than the C$15.6 billion shortfall forecast in a
Bloomberg News economist survey with 16 responses. The fourth
quarter gap was revised to C$14.6 billion from C$17.3 billion.  The world’s 11th largest economy has reported deficits in
its broadest measure of international trade since the end of
2008, with exports of goods restrained by a strong Canadian
dollar and weak global demand. The Bank of Canada said yesterday
that weak trade will continue to keep the economy from reaching
full output until mid-2015.  “The deficit is still fairly wide as a share of gross
domestic product, over 3 percent, and not therefore a compelling
base of support for the Canadian dollar,” said  Avery Shenfeld ,
chief economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto. “We will need
stronger prices for Canada’s resource exports to bring the
current account balance into better line from here.”  The currency was little changed at C$1.0352 per U.S. dollar
at 9:49 a.m. in Toronto. It touched C$1.421 yesterday, its
weakest level since June 5, 2012. One dollar buys 96.59 U.S.
cents.  The first-quarter deficit in merchandise trade narrowed to
C$1.69 billion from C$2.14 billion, as higher exports of goods
such as crude oil and metals outpaced growth in imports.  Investment Income  The deficit in investment income narrowed to C$4.88 billion
from C$5.11 billion, and the shortfall in services declined to
C$5.76 billion from C$5.99 billion.  Statistics Canada today also reported the  industrial
product price index  fell 0.8 percent in April, the most since
December 2011, led by a 4.9 percent drop in diesel fuel. The
decline in prices paid to manufacturers for their wares exceeded
all 11 estimates in a Bloomberg economist survey that had a
median of a 0.3 percent decline.  The  raw-materials price index  fell 2.2 percent in April
from March, the most since June 2012. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 10 economists was for a 0.9 percent drop.  Over the 12 months ending in April, industrial prices were
little changed while raw-materials costs fell 1.9 percent,
suggesting factory profit margins widened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
