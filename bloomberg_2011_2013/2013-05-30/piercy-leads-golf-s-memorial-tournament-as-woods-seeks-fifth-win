Charl Schwartzel holds a one-shot
lead in the opening round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s Memorial
Tournament, where defending-champion Tiger Woods is seeking his
fifth win of the season.  Schwartzel, the 2011 Masters Tournament winner, is at 7-under par after a round that included 10 birdies at Muirfield
Village Golf Club in Dublin,  Ohio . Scott Piercy, a two-time PGA
Tour winner, is a shot back at 6-under, one ahead of Josh
Teater, Russell Henley, Kyle Stanley and Charlie Wi, who all
shot 67.  Woods, a five-time winner of the event hosted by  Jack Nicklaus , is even par through six holes. Woods, who won the
Players championship three weeks ago in his most recent U.S.
Tour start, is playing in a group with U.S. Presidents Cup
captain  Fred Couples  (3-under) and 2011 PGA Championship winner
Keegan Bradley (1-under).  Rory McIlroy, the world’s No. 2-ranked golfer, shot 6-over
78 with six bogeys, a double-bogey and two birdies. Among
players who have finished their rounds, only Johnson Wagner (7-over) and Nicolas Colsaerts (8-over) scored worse than McIlroy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
