European Union carbon permits for
December rose to the highest for three weeks after a senior EU
climate official said the bloc was considering linking the
supply of allowances to the region’s economic performance.  The benchmark futures contract advanced as much as 2.9
percent to 3.86 euros ($5.04) a metric ton before closing at
3.82 euros, the highest since May 6, on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Jos Delbeke, the European Commission’s director-general for
climate, said the regulator saw the need to improve flexibility
of supply to take account of variations in the level of economic
activity. Such a measure is on top of six options that were
floated last year in a proposal to strengthen the bloc’s cap-and-trade system after prices slumped to all-time lows.  “The debate we are now going through is if certain things
happen, there could be a correction in the supply of allowances
brought to the market, according to specific rules or
principles,” Delbeke said yesterday in an interview in
Barcelona.  EU permits have gained 22 percent since the end of April,
heading for their first monthly increase since February.  The December contract fell to a record 2.46 euros a ton on
April 17 after the European Parliament rejected a proposed
measure to temporarily withhold some permits from the market in
an effort to reduce a surplus. The assembly is due to vote again
on the commission’s plan in July.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
were unchanged at 40 euro cents a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
