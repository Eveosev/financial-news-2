General Electric Co. (GE)  is looking at
successors for Michael Neal, the executive who led the finance
unit through frozen credit markets and a global recession,
according to a person familiar with the deliberations.  Neal, 60, has headed  GE Capital  since July 2005. It’s
common for Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE to consider
replacements for executives of his age, when top executives
frequently depart, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions aren’t public.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  has been shrinking
the unit since access to credit vanished after the 2008
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., imperiling all of
GE. He said at a conference last week that he may consider using
initial public offerings to accelerate the process and shed GE
Capital businesses no longer seen as essential.  GE Capital posted  profit  of $7.4 billion on $46 billion in
revenue last year. The unit had $68 billion in cash at the end
of the first quarter. Ending net investment, a measure of the
unit’s balance sheet, may fall more than 25 percent to as little
as $300 billion by the end of next year, Immelt has said.  Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for GE, declined to comment about
any succession plans after the Wall Street Journal reported
earlier today that Neal may leave as soon as the middle of 2013.  William Cary, GE Capital’s chief operating officer, and
Mark Begor, head of its real estate business, may succeed Neal,
the newspaper reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
