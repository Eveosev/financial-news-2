Rupert Murdoch ’s  News Corp. (NWSA)  is
canceling its listing on the London Stock Exchange, citing the
low trading volume for its shares.  The delisting precedes the New York-based company’s split
into two separate businesses at the end of next month, News
Corp. said in a statement today. London trades represent less
than 1 percent of the total global volume, it said.  News Corp. will break its publishing assets from
entertainment operations in June. Murdoch agreed to the split
last year under pressure from shareholders, who wanted the
faster-growing entertainment division to trade separately. The
publishing side with retain the News Corp. name while
entertainment will go under 21st Century Fox.  News Corp., which owns papers including the Wall Street
Journal and The Times of London, said last week it expects to
write down the value of its publishing business by $1.2 billion
to $1.4 billion this quarter, according a filing.  Murdoch won’t be leaving London altogether. News Corp. owns
about 40 percent of the U.K.’s biggest pay-television company,
 British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) , which is listed in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
