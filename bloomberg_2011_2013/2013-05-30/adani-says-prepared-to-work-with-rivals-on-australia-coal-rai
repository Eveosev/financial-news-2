Adani Enterprises Ltd. (ADE) , India’s
biggest thermal coal importer that’s seeking approval for a 300
kilometer (186 mile) railroad in Australia, remains prepared to
work with groups proposing rival networks.  “Adani is happy to work with other proponents to help
transport coal from mine to port,” local unit Adani Mining Pty
said today in a statement in response to questions from
Bloomberg. Adani is controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani.  Adani decided to proceed with its own project after
studying possible joint rail developments with  Aurizon Holdings
Ltd. (AZJ) , G.V. Krishna Reddy’s GVK Group and Waratah Coal Pty, the
company said in a  submission  posted today on the federal
environment department’s website. Adani last year signed an
initial pact with Aurizon,  Australia ’s largest haulage company,
to study building a rail line to connect the mine to a port.  The rail proposal to transport coal from the Carmichael
thermal coal mine to the port of  Abbot Point  on the Queensland
state coast was lodged with the federal government, the company
said. Adani bought the project in 2010 and seeks to start output
in 2016 from the estimated $6.8 billion development, at a time
of mining companies deferring projects due to falling prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
