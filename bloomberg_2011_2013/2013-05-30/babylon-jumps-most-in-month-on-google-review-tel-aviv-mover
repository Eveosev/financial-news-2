Babylon Ltd. (BBYL)  gained the most in more
than four months as  Google (GOOG)  Inc.’s review of the translation
software maker’s user policies found no faults, easing concern
that a key source of revenue would be jeopardized.  Shares of the company, which gets most of its advertising
sharing revenue from agreements with Google, jumped 6.5 percent,
the most since Jan. 28, at the close in Tel Aviv.  Or-Yehuda,
Israel-based Babylon’s stock was the biggest gainer in
percentage terms on the  TA-100 Index (TA-100) , which declined 0.1
percent. Babylon advanced 4.2 percent this month.  “This brings some security in the continued relations
between Babylon and Google, their biggest client,” Dov
Rozenberg, an analyst at Clal Finance Batucha Brokerage Ltd. in
 Tel Aviv , said in a phone interview.  Babylon’s stock, which more than doubled last year,  fell 25
percent  in the two months ending March 31 on concern that a
change in the company’s relationship with Google would hurt
revenue. Sales from the company’s Google partnership dropped to
66 percent at the end of the first quarter from 84 percent at
the end last year.  Babylon signed a four-year accord with  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  to share
revenue from online advertising, including mobile Internet, in
an effort to diversify sources of revenue, it said last month.
The company said in November it will seek to raise $115 million
in an initial public offering in the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
