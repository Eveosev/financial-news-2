Genting Bhd. (GENT) , which controls
Southeast Asia’s biggest casino operator, said first-quarter
profit fell 43 percent because of lower sales from its Singapore
and U.K. gaming resorts as well as plantation division.  Net income  for the three months ended March 31 dropped to
397.8 million ringgit ($129 million), or 10.77 sen a share, from
693.6 million ringgit, or 18.79 sen, a year earlier, according
to a filing to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange yesterday.
Revenue declined 2.8 percent to 4.13 billion ringgit.  The Kuala Lumpur-based company is the parent of  Genting
Singapore Plc (GENS) , which earlier this month reported a 44 percent
drop in first-quarter profit to S$115.9 million. Profit from the
group’s plantations division dropped on lower palm oil prices,
the firm said.  Genting slid 1.2 percent to close at 10.26 ringgit in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday, before the earnings were released. The  FTSE
Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI)  lost 0.5 percent. The stock has risen
12 percent this year, compared with the benchmark gauge’s 5.1
percent increase.  Its  Genting Malaysia Bhd. (GENM)  unit plans to invest $100 million
in the Bahamas Marina project, Lim Kok Thay, chairman of
Genting, said at an April 18 conference in Singapore. The
subsidiary opened a casino at the Aqueduct Racetrack in New York
in October, controls casino operators in the U.K. and owns
Resorts World Sentosa, one of Singapore’s two gambling resorts.  The group’s  plantation  division’s pretax profit fell to
45.1 million ringgit from 98.5 million ringgit in the same
period last year while earnings from power climbed to 79.9
million ringgit from 33.3 million ringgit, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
