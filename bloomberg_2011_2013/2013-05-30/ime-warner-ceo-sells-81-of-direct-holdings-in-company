Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive
officer of  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) , sold 81 percent of his direct
holdings in the media company for $12.2 million, capitalizing on
a 25 percent gain in the stock this year.  Bewkes, who turned 61 last week, sold 205,681 shares May 29
for $59.27 each, according to a  regulatory filing . The
executive, who has run the company since 2008, made $25.9
million in salary, stock awards and other compensation last
year, slightly less than the prior year. The shares have gained
75 percent since he took over as CEO.  He still owns 48,010 shares directly and 35,010 indirectly
through an employee-benefit plan. Bewkes also has 3.79 million
in  stock options  and 437,420 in restricted stock units. Adding
all those shares together, this weekâ€™s sale represents about 5
percent of his potential equity stake.  Bewkes has worked to slim down the  media conglomerate  that
once included  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  and AOL Inc. The company
announced plans in March to split off its Time Inc. magazine
unit amid an industrywide advertising slump. The company still
owns cable networks such as HBO and TNT, as well as movie studio
 Warner Bros .  Time Warner shares fell 2 percent to $58.37 at the close
today in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
