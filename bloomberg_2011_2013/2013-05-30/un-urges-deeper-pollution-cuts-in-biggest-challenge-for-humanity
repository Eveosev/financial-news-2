Governments worldwide must step up efforts to save the planet from global warming in the biggest challenge humanity has ever undertaken, according to United Nations’ climate chief Christiana Figueres.  Developing and industrialized nations aren’t doing enough to prevent the global temperature rising 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times, Figueres said in an interview during the Carbon Expo conference in Barcelona yesterday. The global average has already risen by about 0.8 of a degree in the past century, according to the  National Research Council  in  Washington .  “While it’s  clear  that governments at an international level are walking in the same direction, it is also clear that they’re doing so at a pace that is unacceptable to science,” Figueres said. “Science requires an acceleration both in the scale and the speed of national efforts.”  Her call comes as the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time, according to the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. The level is a landmark for scientists and environmentalists, who say emissions from burning fossil fuels are warming the planet at a pace that could lead to more heat waves, storms and floods worldwide.  “There’s nothing that humanity has ever attempted that is of greater impact than what we’re trying to do right now,” Figueres said. “This is a full transformation of the economic structure, of the energy system and of the economic logic that underpins growth. It’s a full transformation of social values and behaviors.”  Inadequate Commitment  International negotiations on a climate-protection deal have so far failed to bring adequate commitments from lawmakers. At best, pledges by countries from the U.S. and  China  to the Maldives will cut predicted emissions in 2020 to 52 gigatons (52 billion tons) from 58 gigatons, the UN Environment Program said in November. The level consistent with 2 degrees of warming is 44 gigatons.  Policy makers are too focused on the cost of reducing climate change and not on the opportunity it offers, according to Figueres.  The shift to a low-carbon economy can provide new jobs and growth, “inject a sense of optimism” into the global economy and offer a way out of the financial crisis, according to Figueres.  Not Enough  Climate protection efforts risk becoming sidelined in the European Union, where the sovereign-debt crisis means the bloc is struggling to balance the cost of emission-reduction policies with the need to keep manufacturers competitive. The EU Parliament last month rejected a proposal to help carbon prices in its emissions trading system recover from record lows, sending the measure back to its environment committee for further talks.  “I don’t think that the EU can be singled out,” Figueres said. “It’s clear that no country is doing enough, and that includes the EU member states and the EU as a region. No one is doing enough.”  Envoys from more than 190 nations are scheduled to next meet at an annual UN climate summit in Warsaw in November to take forward talks on a global greenhouse-gas reduction treaty. The deal, which they aim to agree by 2015, would come into force from 2020.  “While the effects of climate change are exponentially growing, the efforts of countries are not exponentially growing, and that is the gap we need to close,” Figueres said.
