The Nordic area needs to build as
many power links as possible, as quickly as it can, to help ship
out a glut of electricity into the rest of  Europe , according to
Vattenfall AB, the region’s biggest utility.  “The more cables we get in place, the better,” Chief
Executive Officer Oeystein Loeseth said in an interview in
 Stockholm  yesterday. “We urge grid companies to build as many
cables as possible, as fast as possible.”  Average Nordic power prices dropped an annual 34 percent to
a five-year low of 31.20 euros ($40.39) a megawatt-hour in 2012,
according to  prices  on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo,
as higher-than-average hydro output depressed prices. The glut
is predicted to expand in the coming decade as more wind, hydro
and biomass capacity is installed.  The Norwegian government on April 12 proposed a ban on
merchant power cables, which would thwart a planned 1,400-megawatt link from  Norway  to the U.K., called Northconnect,
planned by Vattenfall, E-CO Energi AS, Agder Energi AS and Lyse
Energi AS.  “We can’t do anything about it if Norway bans privately
owned cables, but we still want markets to merge, and get cables
in place,” Loeseth said. “New links would help a yearly Nordic
power glut of between 30 and 50 terawatt-hours, expected from
2020 and onward, making the Nordic area into a green battery for
Europe.”  In  Germany , the benchmark contract for 2014 dropped 15
percent this year to 38.75 euros ($49.94) a megawatt-hour,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
