Chicago  spot gasoline and diesel
strengthened versus futures after a government report showed
refiners unexpectedly processed the  least amount  of crude in 31
months. Crack spreads widened.  Refining in the U.S. Midwest PADD 2 region tumbled by
 162,000 barrels  a day, or 5.1 percent, to 3.02 million in the
week ended May 24, Energy Information Administration data show.
That’s the lowest level since Oct. 29, 2010.  The premium for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in Chicago widened  10.5 cents  to 38 cents a gallon versus
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:53 p.m., a
 nine-month high . Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel strengthened by 2
cents to trade at a premium of 12.5 cents, the  first advance  in
eight days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market wasn’t doing anything” before the refinery
report, said Mark Anderle, a trader at wholesaler Truman Arnold
Cos. in  Dallas . “Everyone was surprised to see that 5 percent
drop.”  Stockpiles of gasoline in the Midwest increased 395,000
barrels to  48 million  last week, snapping a five-week decline,
according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  The return of  Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP (CLMT) ’s
45,000-barrel-a-day Superior,  Wisconsin , refinery from a
turnaround may have helped increase gasoline stockpiles. The
maintenance, which ended about May 20, included the shutdown of
a fluid catalytic cracker and sulfur recovery unit.  Inventories of ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the region
slipped 1.61 million barrels to 25.2 million, the lowest level
since Dec. 21.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, gained $2.95 to $37.44 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
