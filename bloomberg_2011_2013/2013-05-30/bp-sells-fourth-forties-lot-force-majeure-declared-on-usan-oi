BP Plc sold its fourth  North Sea 
Forties crude cargo for loading in June at a higher differential
than yesterday. Total SA bought Russian Urals in the
Mediterranean at a bigger discount to Dated Brent than the
previous trade.  Nigeria has stopped shipments of Usan grade today after a
force majeure, a legal clause that protects a company from
liability if it can’t fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its
control, said two people with knowledge of the matter, who asked
not to be identified because they are not authorized to comment
publicly.  North Sea  BP sold Forties lot F0613 for June 17 to June 19 at 10
cents a barrel less than Dated Brent to Petroineos, the joint
venture between PetroChina Co. and Ineos Group Holdings SA,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with its
sale yesterday at a discount of 30 cents.  Total failed to buy Forties for June 18 to June 23 at 15
cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, while Eni SpA withdrew its
earlier bid for June 21 to June 23 at a discount of 45 cents,
according to the survey.  Statoil ASA (STL)  was unable to buy Oseberg for June 16 to June
18 for a third day at $1.00 a barrel more than Dated Brent, 15
cents higher than its bid yesterday, while Total didn’t manage
to buy the grade for June 21 to June 23 at a premium of 95
cents, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell by 11 cents to a discount of 17 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $102.21 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $102.90 yesterday. The August contract was at $102.02 at
the same time today, a discount of 19 cents to July.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total bought 80,000 metric tons of Urals for June 15 to
June 19 loading from Vitol Group at 45 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the survey
showed. That compares with a discount of 20 cents for the last
transaction on May 24.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 5 cents to a discount of
10 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at 8 cents a
barrel to the benchmark, compared with minus 14 cents yesterday.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 1 cent to $2.24 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
That’s the least since Feb. 22.  Angola  will export 52.8 million barrels of crude in July,
or 1.7 million barrels a day, a final loading program obtained
by  Bloomberg News  showed. This compares with 49 million, or 1.63
million barrels a day in June.  The final plan showed one more cargo each of Girassol,
Pazflor and Saturno grades and one less of Cabinda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
