Former  New York Giants  wide receiver
 Steve Smith  retired from the  National Football League  after knee
injuries forced him to miss 21 games since making the Pro Bowl
in 2009.  Smith, 28, spent four of his six NFL seasons with the
Giants, who selected him in the second round of the 2007 draft,
and won a Super Bowl title during his rookie year.  Smith had a career-high 107 catches for 1,220 yards and
seven touchdowns for the Giants in 2009 before a season-ending
knee injury a year later. He’s started only one game since and
was limited to 25 catches for 255 yards and one touchdown over
the past two years with the Philadelphia Eagles and St.  Louis
Rams .  “I’ve been blessed to play the game that I love at the
highest level for the past six years,” said Smith, who signed
with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the offseason. “I will
always cherish my time with the New York Giants and our Super
Bowl victory in 2007. This was not an easy decision, but it’s
the right decision for me at this time.”  In his four seasons with the Giants, Smith had 220
receptions for 2,386 yards and 11 touchdowns. His 107 catches in
2009 set a single-season  franchise record  and his 1,220
receiving yards that year is the third-most in team history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
