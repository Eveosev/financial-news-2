Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , the largest U.S. warehouse-club chain, said third-quarter profit rose 19 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as revenue from membership fees increased.  Net income in the quarter ended May 12 rose to $459 million, or $1.04 a share, from $386 million, or 88 cents, a year earlier, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said today in a statement. Analysts projected profit of $447 million, the average of 11  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Costco has worked to lower its already-discounted prices to lure more shoppers to its annual memberships. Third-quarter sales at stores open for more than a year increased 7 percent, excluding changes in  gas prices  and foreign-currency exchange rates. Revenue by similar measures fell 1.4 percent at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  in the U.S. and 0.6 percent at  Target Corp. (TGT)  in their most recent quarters.  Revenue (COST)  from membership fees advanced 12 percent to $531 million, the company said. That was part of a 7.9 percent increase in total revenue to $24.1 billion, Costco said. That compared with the $24.2 billion average estimate of 17 analysts.  Costco rose 1.3 percent to $114.43 at 10:53 a.m. in New York. The shares added 14 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a gain of 16 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Annual membership fees at Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club chain increased by as much as $10 earlier this month, the first such increase since 2006, the company said May 16.
