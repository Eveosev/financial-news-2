CIT Group Inc. (CIT) , the business lender
run by  John Thain , jumped 5.4 percent after reporting that
regulatory curbs imposed in 2009 while the firm struggled to
survive have been lifted.  CIT received notice from the  Federal Reserve Bank of New
York  that a written agreement dated Aug. 12, 2009 was
terminated, according to a statement today from the company. CIT
advanced $2.41 to $46.90 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York and traded
for as much as $47.77, its best level since February 2011. The
stock has gained 21 percent this year.  Bad loans including  subprime mortgages  led New York-based
CIT to take $2.33 billion from the Treasury’s bank rescue fund
and then file for bankruptcy. Thain, who joined the company
after its troubles began, led CIT with a plan that reduced the
lender’s bad credits and high cost of funds. The bailout wasn’t
repaid.  CIT’s 2009 agreement with the Fed required the company to
seek the regulator’s approval for issuing dividends or new debt.
CIT also pledged to provide periodic updates focusing on cash
and funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
