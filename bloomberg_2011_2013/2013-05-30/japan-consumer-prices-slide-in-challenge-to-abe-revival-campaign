Japan ’s consumer prices dropped for a
sixth straight month in April, highlighting the challenge for
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in sustaining confidence in an
economic revival.  Consumer prices excluding fresh food  fell 0.4 percent from
a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in  Tokyo  today,
matching the median estimate of 29 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  This week’s slide of Japan’s stock market into a correction
highlights the importance of Abe winning public and investor
confidence in the “third arrow” of Abenomics, a growth
strategy to accompany monetary and fiscal stimulus. The  Bank of
Japan  expects price declines to continue for “the time being,”
partly because of higher energy and durable goods costs in the
past, as Governor Haruhiko Kuroda chases 2 percent inflation.  “The decline is largely affected by technical reasons from
last year -- still, it doesn’t change the fact that it will be
extremely difficult for Kuroda to fulfill his pledge to hit the
target,” said  Masamichi Adachi , senior economist at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in Tokyo and a former central bank official.
Investors will be focused on Abe’s growth measures next month,
Adachi said.  Prices, excluding the impact of a sales-tax increase, will
rise 1.9 percent in the fiscal year starting in April 2015,
according to BOJ board members’ median estimate last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
