Argentina  created a commission to
oversee oil companies’ business plans that will be controlled by
governors of 10 provinces with oil and natural gas resources in
a bid to boost efficiency and output.  Oil unions will give advice to the 14-member commission
that will also include ministers from Argentina’s labor and
planning departments as well as the energy secretary and deputy
economy minister, according to the accord signed earlier today
between the federal government, the governors and union leaders.  “The state is creating a profitable framework that’s more
than acceptable for the industry because we know we need private
sector help to produce our natural resources,” Deputy Economy
Minister Axel Kicillof said at a press conference in Buenos
Aires.  Oil companies  will have to submit annual investment plans
to the commission that in turn will seek monthly advice from a
technical board of provincial governor appointees and appointees
by seven oil unions that signed today’s 11-page agreement.  “The commission will monitor oil field activities
including labor, production targets, output and investment,”
Planning Minister Julio De Vido said at the conference.  The commission will increase monitoring of oil and gas
companies, Martin Buzzi, governor of Patagonian province of
Chubut said at the same press conference.  “We will monitor every well not just overseeing volume but
also the number of drilling rigs, wells drilled and pipelines,”
Buzzi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
