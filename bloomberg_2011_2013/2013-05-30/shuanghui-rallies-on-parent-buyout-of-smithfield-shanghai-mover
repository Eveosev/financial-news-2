Henan Shuanghui Investment &
Development Co. (000895) , China’s biggest listed pork processor, jumped
the most in 29 months in Shenzhen trading after its parent
company agreed to acquire  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)   Shuanghui rose 8.7 percent to 42.86 yuan at the close, the
biggest gain since Dec. 7, 2010. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
slipped 0.3 percent. Closely held Shuanghui International
Holdings Ltd. agreed to acquire the Smithfield, Virginia-based
producer for about $4.72 billion, the companies said in a
statement yesterday.  “Shuanghui already has a very leading industry position in
China and it makes sense now for the company to expand overseas
as part of its internationalization strategy,” said Wu Kan, a
Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “The acquisition will help Shuanghui to
gain access to the U.S market and add to its global procurement
chain.”  China is the world’s biggest consumer of pork. Demand is
rising with the expansion of its middle class even as questions
are being asked about the safety of the country’s food supply.
Prices of wholesale pork are poised to rebound after plunging
over the past three months after the discovery of more than
9,000 dead pigs floating in Shanghai’s Huangpu river.  Sichuan Gaojin Food Co. (002143) , a Shenzhen-listed maker of pork
products, gained 0.9 percent to 5.48 yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
