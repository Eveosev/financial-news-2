Li Na ’s quest to regain the French
Open title she won two years ago was ended in the second round
by Bethanie Mattek-Sands.  The American, ranked 67th by the WTA, beat Li 5-7, 6-3, 6-2
on Court 1 at  Roland Garros  in Paris in a match interrupted by
rain three times.  Li, 31, won the French Open in 2011, the first player from
Asia to clinch a Grand Slam singles title.  Today’s defeat was the earliest for Li since she was
knocked out of Wimbledon at the same stage last year. She had
made the Australian Open final at the start of the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
