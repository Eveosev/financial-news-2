Treasury 10-year note yields traded
at almost the highest level in 13 months as the U.S. prepared to
sell $29 billion of seven-year securities and traders speculated
whether the Federal Reserve will consider reducing stimulus.  Treasuries pared losses after government reports showed
initial claims for unemployment insurance exceeded forecasts
last week and first-quarter economic growth was revised lower.
U.S. debt dropped earlier, extending the steepest monthly loss
in three years. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last week the
central bank could cut the pace of debt purchases if officials
are confident that the recovery will be sustained. Policy makers
next meet June 18 to 19.  “We’re going to higher yields,” said Charles Comiskey,
head of Treasury trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York, one
of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The Fed laid
out their views on tapering. It all goes back to the data. The
pressure is going to remain on the Treasury market until there’s
clarity at the next meeting.”  The  yield  on 10-year Treasury notes rose one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.13 percent as of 12:09 p.m. New
York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of
the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023 fell 3/32 to 96 20/32. The
yield reached 2.23 percent yesterday, the highest level since
April 5, 2012.  Bond Benchmarks  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index have fallen 1.5 percent in May, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004. Treasuries have tumbled 1.8
percent in May as of yesterday, the most since December 2009,
according to the indexes. Treasuries have lost investors 1
percent this year.  The median of 75 economists’ and strategists’ predictions
compiled by Bloomberg is for the yield on the 10-year note to
end the year at 2.15 percent.  “People are expecting month-end rebalancing into bonds out
of stocks, so they’re expecting some demand for Treasuries,”
said  Thomas Tucci , managing director and head of Treasury
trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “There will be
some of that, but it’s not like managers manage with their eyes
closed. Everyone realizes there’s some risk that’s been put back
into the bond market and I don’t think everyone’s going to load
up on duration just because it’s month end.”  The seven-year securities being sold today yielded 1.51
percent in pre-auction trading. The last sale of seven-year
notes on April 25 drew  bids  for 2.71 times the amount of debt
available. The average for the past 10 auctions of this maturity
is 2.67.  Debt Sales  A $35-billion sale of five-year notes yesterday attracted
the most interest from non-primary dealer investors since at
least 2003 as higher yields bolstered demand.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month to support the economy. Bernanke said last week the Fed
could “take a step down in our pace of purchases” in the
“next few meetings,” in testimony to lawmakers.  The central bank purchased $1.5 billion of securities
maturing between February 2037 and February 2043 today,
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2.4 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, less than previously estimated, the
Commerce Department said today in  Washington . The forecast in a
Bloomberg survey called for no revision from the 2.5 percent
pace initially reported.  Economic Data  Initial jobless claims increased to 354,000 in the week
ended May 25, the Labor Department reported. The median forecast
of 49 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for claims to
remain unchanged from the previous week at 340,000.  Treasury volatility as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE  index  rose to 81.22 yesterday, the highest
level in almost a year.  Treasury yields show inflation expectations fell to a nine-month low.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, narrowed to 2.20 percentage points today, the smallest gap
since August.  The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal
consumption expenditures deflator, rose 0.8 percent in April
from 12 months earlier, based on a Bloomberg survey of
economists before the Commerce Department reports the figure
tomorrow. It would be the smallest increase since October 2009.  The difference between 10-year and 30-year yields narrowed
to 1.14 percentage points, almost the smallest gap since
November.  Trading in Treasury futures reached a record yesterday,
according to the CME Group in  Chicago . Futures and options
trading for 10-year notes totaled 5.9 million contracts and 3.6
million contracts for five-year futures and options, the CME
said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
