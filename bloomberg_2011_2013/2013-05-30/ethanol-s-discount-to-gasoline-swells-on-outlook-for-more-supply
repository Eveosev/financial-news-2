Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded on concern that a robust corn crop will help lift
production and stockpiles from record low seasonal levels.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 0.64 cent to
11.45 cents a gallon, as the July ethanol futures contract’s
premium to June swelled to the highest in four weeks, a
phenomena known as  backwardation , where prompt prices are higher
than later ones.  “People are going hand-to-mouth to see where it’s going,”
said Michael Slider, director of business development at Fauser
Energy Resources in  Oregon ,  Illinois . “It’s mostly because of
the backwardation in price for corn and ethanol. People don’t
want to go out and pay and then it drops another 10 cents.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery added 0.3 cent to
$2.698 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 33 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery advanced 0.94 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.8125 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S., with one
bushel making at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.
Higher prices for the grain following last summer’s drought
prompted producers to temper output or idle operations.  Corn Falls  Corn for July delivery tumbled 10.75 cents to $6.5425 a
bushel in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the cost difference
between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was
17 cents, up from 13 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  July corn traded 91.5 cents higher than the contract for
December, after the fall harvest.  An Energy Information Administration report today showed
ethanol  production  last week fell 1.4 percent to 863,000 barrels
a day and  stockpiles  dropped to 16 million barrels, the lowest
level since Oct. 15, 2010.  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  rose 3.11 cents to 89.49
cents at 4:38 p.m.  New York  time. Advanced RINs, which cover
biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, gained 1.14
cents to 97.72 cents.  Imports averaged 27,000 barrels a day in the week ended May
24, the first time the U.S. has made foreign purchases of the
fuel since April 19, the EIA, the Energy Department’s analytical
arm, said.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.43 a gallon in that
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago added 6 cents to
$2.735 a gallon; in New York the additive increased 2.5 cents to
$2.78; in the U.S. Gulf the price jumped 1.5 cents to $2.79; and
on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to $2.84 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the  Gulf Coast  thinned 2
cents to 5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
narrowed 3.5 cents to 4.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
