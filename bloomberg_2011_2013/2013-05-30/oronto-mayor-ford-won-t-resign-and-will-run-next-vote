Toronto Mayor Rob Ford says he won’t
resign and pledged to run in the city’s next election after two
more staff members left amid allegations the mayor was caught on
video smoking  crack cocaine .  “I’m not stepping aside, I’m running in the next
election,” Ford told reporters outside his office in  Canada ’s
biggest city. “Things are doing great.”  Ford refused to answer questions today about his alleged
drug use. On May 24 he said, “I do not use crack cocaine nor am
I an addict of crack cocaine.”  Brian Johnston and Kia Nejatian, two of Ford’s aides,
resigned from the mayor’s staff today, the Toronto Star
newspaper reported. That brings the number of resignations since
the scandal broke to five.  The Star said on May 16 two of its reporters watched a
cellphone video allegedly showing Ford smoking from a crack
cocaine pipe. U.S. website Gawker was the first to report on the
video and has raised $200,000 to buy it.  Bloomberg News  hasn’t seen the video and can’t verify its
authenticity.  Ford denied there were any problems in his office, instead
touting his efforts to balance Toronto’s budget.  “I guarantee my name will be on the ballot” in the next
mayoral election, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
