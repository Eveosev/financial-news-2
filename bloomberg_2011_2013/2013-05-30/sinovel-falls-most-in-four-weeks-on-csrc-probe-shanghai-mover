Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) , China’s
third-biggest wind-turbine maker, fell the most in four weeks in
Shanghai trading after the company said it was being
investigated for possible violations of Chinese securities laws.  The shares closed 3.1 percent lower at 5.58  yuan , the
biggest one-day fall since May 2. The benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index fell 0.3 percent.  Sinovel said after the close of markets yesterday that it
received a notice from the China Securities Regulatory
Commission that a probe had been started into suspected
violations. The filing to Shanghai’s stock exchange didn’t
provide more details about the investigation.  In March, Sinovel revised down its 2011 profit by 22
percent to 607.4 million yuan ($99.1 million), citing an
accounting error.  The wind turbine maker is also currently embroiled in a
legal dispute with Devens, Massachusetts-based  American
Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , which is seeking more than $1.2 billion in
damages in Chinese courts from its former largest customer. AMSC
accused Sinovel of stealing its technology and violating sales
contracts.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
