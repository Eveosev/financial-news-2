Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, will expand capacity at a  Texas  plant by about
60 percent as it seeks to meet “rapidly growing demand” in the
west of the state, led by oil and gas producers.  Capacity at the plant in Odessa, Texas, will increase by
345,000 metric tons to almost 900,000 metric tons, the
Monterrey, Mexico-based company said in a statement today.  “We look forward to remaining a top cement provider to the
oil and gas industry as well as supporting the region’s growth
in infrastructure and residential construction,” Karl Watson Jr., president of Cemex’s U.S. unit, said in the statement.  The plant will add to Cemex’s output in its largest foreign
market as the company seeks to boost U.S. sales after first-quarter cement volumes fell in Mexico, the rest of  Latin America 
and  Europe . Cemex’s U.S. unit posted its fourth straight profit
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the
first three months of the year, as it raised prices in several
states.  The Texas plant expansion “is a sign that things are
advancing very well in terms of demand,”  Carlos Hermosillo , an
analyst at Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in a telephone
interview from Mexico City. Hermosillo has a buy rating.  Cemex climbed 2.9 percent to 14.79 pesos at the close in
Mexico City, before its announcement on adding capacity in
Texas. Shares have climbed 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
