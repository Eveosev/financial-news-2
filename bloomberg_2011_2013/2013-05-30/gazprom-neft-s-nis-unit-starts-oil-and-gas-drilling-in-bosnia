A joint venture of  Serbia ’s Naftna
Industrija Srbije AD and a unit of  Russia ’s OAO Zarubezhneft
began exploratory drilling in the Serb part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where it has a long-term oil and gas concession.  The first drill in Obudovac in northeastern Bosnia is based
on a $13 million investment and seismic surveys since 2011, Novi
Sad, Serbia-based Naftna Industrija, or  NIS , said in an e-mailed
statement. Another $19.5 million is earmarked for the research
in 2013 in Republika Srpska, the Serb half of Bosnia, where the
joint venture, Jadran Naftagas, plans another drill this year,
near the northeastern city of Bijeljina.  “The planned value of investments through 2014 is $40.7
million and $188.3 million for the exploitation phase, on
condition that reserves are proven,” said NIS, which is
controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft. (GAZP)   NIS formed the joint venture with OAO Neftegazinkor in 2011
and secured a 28-year oil and gas concession from the Bosnian
Serb authorities as part of its plans to expand its resource
base in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
