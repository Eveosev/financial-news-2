Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-largest lender, posted second-quarter profit
that beat analysts’ estimates on gains in investment banking and
wealth management. CIBC raised its dividend 2.1 percent.  Net income for the period ended April 30 climbed 8 percent
to C$876 million ($847 million), or C$2.12 a share, from C$811
million, or C$1.90, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said
today in a statement. Revenue advanced 2 percent to C$3.14
billion.  CIBC is seeking to build on its takeover of MFS McLean
Budden’s private-wealth business from  Sun life Financial Inc. (SLF)  in
September. The lender, which last month announced it was buying
Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management from  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , has
said it has a medium-term goal of wealth management generating
15 percent of total earnings, up from about 10 percent last
year.  Adjusted earnings, which exclude some items, were also
C$2.12 a share, beating the C$2.07  average estimate  of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. CIBC raised its quarterly
dividend 2 cents to 96 cents a share.  Wealth-management profit increased 16 percent to C$92
million from a year earlier as assets under management rose.
Earnings from wholesale banking advanced 51 percent to C$198
million, fueled by gains in trading.  Consumer banking posted profit of C$604 million, up 9
percent from the previous quarter.  CIBC fell 0.1 percent to C$80.43 yesterday in Toronto. The
shares have gained 0.6 percent this year, trailing the 3 percent
 advance  of the eight-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX Commercial
Banks Index.  (CIBC will hold a conference call to discuss results at
