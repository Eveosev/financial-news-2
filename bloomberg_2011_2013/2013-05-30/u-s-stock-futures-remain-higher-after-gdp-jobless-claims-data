U.S. stock-index futures remained
higher after government data showed the economy grew less than
previously estimated last quarter and jobless claims
unexpectedly increased.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
added 0.4 percent to 1,653.7 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York   Gross domestic product rose at a 2.4 percent annualized
rate, the Commerce Department said today in Washington. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for no revision
from the 2.5 percent pace initially reported. Applications for
jobless benefits increased 10,000 to 354,000 in the week ended
May 25, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
Economists called for 340,000 claims, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The  S&P 500  sank 1.1 percent last week as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank could reduce
monetary stimulus if officials see signs of sustained
improvement in growth. Data earlier this week showed  consumer
confidence  climbed to the highest level since 2008 and house
prices jumped the most in seven years, indicating growth in the
world’s largest economy is picking up. The S&P 500 fell 0.7
percent yesterday and the Dow sank the most since May 1.  The S&P 500 has retreated 1.2 percent from a record on May
21. The index is still up 144 percent from its bear-market low
in 2009 as earnings growth and Fed stimulus sent the market into
a fifth year of a  bull market .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
