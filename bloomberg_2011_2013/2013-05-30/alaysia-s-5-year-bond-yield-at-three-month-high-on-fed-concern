The yield on  Malaysia ’s five-year
 government bonds  rose to an almost three-month high after U.S.
Treasuries fell on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will reduce
asset purchases. The ringgit climbed.  The rate on 10-year Treasuries climbed one basis point
today and 45 basis points in May to 2.12 percent, set for the
biggest  monthly  jump since December 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the
central bank may scale back monthly debt-buying if the economy
showed signs of sustained recovery. Malaysia’s governing
coalition won a May 5 election to extend its 55-year rule.  “The market’s move is in reaction to the knee-jerk selling
in U.S. Treasuries,” said Ray Choy, regional head of fixed-income research in Kuala Lumpur at RHB Research Institute Sdn.,
a unit of  RHB Capital Bhd. (RHBC)  “Some of the catalysts for buying
government bonds have been removed as the political uncertainty
eased after the election.”  The yield on the 3.26 percent notes due March 2018 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.28 percent as of
4:20 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . It touched 3.30, the highest level
since the debt was sold on March 5, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The rate rose 13 basis points this month.  The ringgit advanced 0.3 percent to 3.0705 per dollar,
after sliding 1.2 percent yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency fell 0.9 percent in May. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, climbed 11 basis points to 7.49
percent. The rate has fallen 92 basis points since April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
