Life Uniform Holding Corp. , a
supplier of scrubs and uniforms for doctors and nurses, filed
for  bankruptcy protection  with a plan to sell virtually all of
its assets to Scrubs & Beyond LLC.  Life Uniform, based in St. Louis, listed assets and debt of
as much as $50 million each in Chapter 11 documents filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,  Delaware .
Affiliates Healthcare Uniform Co. and Uniform City National Inc.
also sought protection.  “The debtors have determined in consultation with their
advisers that the value of the debtors’ estates is likely to be
worth substantially more as a going concern than in
liquidation,” Robert Frezza, Life Uniform’s chief restructuring
officer, said in court papers filed today. The company retained
Morgan Joseph TriArtisan LLC to explore a sale.  Scrubs & Beyond, founded in 2000, agreed to be the lead
bidder at a court-supervised auction with an offer of about
$22.6 million. The bid may be topped at auction and any sale
requires court approval.  Life Uniform was acquired by an affiliate of private-equity
firm Sun Capital Partners Inc. in 2004.  The case is In re Life Uniform Holding Corp., 13-11391,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
