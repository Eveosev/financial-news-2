Campofrio Food Group SA (CFG)  rose to the
highest level in six months after Shuanghui International
Holdings Ltd. agreed to buy  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , the largest
shareholder in the Spanish maker of cold cuts and sausages.  Campofrio  rose  as much as 8.9 percent today in  Madrid  after
trading resumed and gained 5.6 percent at 11:37 a.m. local time
to 5.7 euros, the highest price since Nov. 13. That valued the
food maker at 583 million euros ($757 million). It was the
third-biggest gainer in the 112-company  Madrid Stock Exchange
General Index today .  “Something needs to happen with Campofrio eventually and
the market is assuming that Shuanghui may launch a takeover bid
for the rest of the Spanish company that Smithfield doesn’t yet
own,” Joao Safara Silva, a Madrid-based analyst at Banco BPI,
said in a telephone interview. “If such a deal is completed,
Campofrio could also benefit from some operating synergies.”  Smithfield is Campofrio’s biggest shareholder with a 37
percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In June
2011, Smithfield dropped talks to purchase the remaining shares
of Madrid-based Campofrio, citing the European economic outlook.  Shuanghui,  China ’s biggest pork producer, agreed to acquire
Smithfield, Virginia-based producer Smithfield for about $4.7
billion to boost supplies for the nation that’s the biggest
consumer of the meat, both companies said in a statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
