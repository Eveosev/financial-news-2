China  is capable of building its own
weaponry to protect itself, the defense ministry said in
response to a report that Chinese hackers gained access to
sensitive information about U.S. weapon systems.  The comment by Defense Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng
yesterday came after the Washington Post reported that designs
for many of America’s most sensitive advanced weapons systems
had been compromised by Chinese hackers. The Post cited a
Defense Science Board report and military and industry
officials.  “We think there are misjudgments in the U.S. rhetoric,”
Geng said at a briefing yesterday in response to a question
about the Post’s story, according to a  transcript  posted on the
ministry’s website.  Such accusations “firstly underestimated the U.S.
Pentagon’s security abilities, and secondly underestimated the
Chinese people’s wisdom,” Geng said.  Among more than two dozen major weapons systems whose
designs were breached were programs critical to U.S. missile
defenses and combat aircraft and ships, the Post said May 27,
citing the report the independent Defense Science Board prepared
for Pentagon leaders.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
