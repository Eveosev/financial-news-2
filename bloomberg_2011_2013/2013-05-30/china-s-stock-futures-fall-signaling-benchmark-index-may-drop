China’s stocks  fell for the first
time in five days, paring the benchmark index’s biggest monthly
gain this year. Property and technology shares led declines
before the release of manufacturing data this weekend.  Gemdale Corp. slumped 1.1 percent, pacing a retreat for
developers, after the 21st Century Business Herald reported
Beijing will take measures to limit  home prices . Sinovel Wind
Group Co. slid the most in almost a month after the company said
it’s under investigation by Chinese regulators. Henan Shuanghui
Investment & Development Co. jumped the most in two years after
its parent company agreed to acquire Smithfield Foods Inc.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.3 percent to 2,317.75
at the close. The index has gained 6.4 percent in May, the most
since December 2012. The CSI 300 Index lost 0.3 percent to
2,634.32. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell 0.7
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index slid 1.6 percent.  “Investors are waiting for more reforms or economic
reports like Saturday’s manufacturing data to create more
drivers for blue-chip stocks,” said Sun Zheng, an  investment
adviser  with Dongxing Securities Co. “We are cautious, which
explains why the index has been fluctuating between positive and
negative territory these days. Technology stocks have risen a
lot so it’s just profit-taking now.”  The Shanghai  index  has rebounded 6.6 percent from this
year’s low set on May 2 after interest-rate cuts by central
banks around the world spurred capital inflows and Chinese
policymakers accelerated reforms of the economy by allowing
private investment in industries such as telecommunications.  PMI Data  The Shanghai Composite trades at 9.5 times 12-month
estimated earnings, compared with a seven-year average of 15.5
times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading volumes
were 14 percent above the 30-day average today, while 30-day
 volatility  was at 16, compared with this year’s average of 19.4,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The government is scheduled to release results of its
official manufacturing index for May on June 1. The reading is
estimated to be 50, down from the previous month’s 50.6,
according to the median estimate of 27 economists. A preliminary
reading by HSBC and Markit’s Purchasing Managers Index last week
was 49.6, below the 50 level that divides expansion and
contraction.  A gauge of  property stocks  in the Shanghai index fell 0.6
percent, the most among five industry groups. Gemdale retreated
1.1 percent to 8  yuan . Even with today’s drop, the property
measure is up 11 percent this month, the most among the groups.  China Acquisition  Beijing will likely cap home prices on a “larger scale”
in the second half, 21st Century Business Herald reported today,
without citing anyone. The city may set housing prices before
the land is sold, according to the report.  A measure of technology stocks in the CSI 300 slid 1.1
percent, paring this month’s gain to 19 percent. Sanan
Optoelectronics Co. fell 2.8 percent to 19.93 yuan, trimming the
May rally to 42 percent. Neusoft Corp. dropped 0.4 percent to
8.97 yuan today.  Sinovel Wind lost 3.1 percent to 5.58 yuan. The company
received a notice from  China  Securities Regulatory Commission on
the decision to start the probe and will cooperate, according to
a filing to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  yesterday. Sinovel in
March revised down its 2011 profit by 22 percent to 607.4
million yuan ($99.1 million) due to an accounting error.  Henan Shuanghui jumped 8.7 percent to 42.86 yuan, the
biggest advance since Dec. 7, 2010. Shuanghui International
Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest pork producer, agreed to acquire
Smithfield for about $4.72 billion to boost supplies for the
nation that’s the biggest consumer of the meat. Sichuan Gaojin
Food Co., a Shenzhen-listed maker of pork products, gained 0.9
percent to 5.48 yuan.  -- With assistance from Belinda Cao in  New York . Editors: Allen
