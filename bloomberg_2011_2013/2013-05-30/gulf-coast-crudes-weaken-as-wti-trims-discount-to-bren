Gulf Crudes weakened against West
Texas Intermediate as the benchmark gained ground on Brent.  WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed 73 cents to $8.57 a barrel
at 2:35 p.m.  New York  time. When Brent drops versus WTI, it
decreases the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with
West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened by 25 cents a barrel to a
premium of $8.50 over WTI at 1:46 p.m. New York time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
to WTI narrowed 15 cents to $8.20.  Southern Green Canyon weakened by $1 to a $1.50 premium.
Mars Blend’s premium to WTI lost 20 cents to $4.20 a barrel.  The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, weakened
by 35 cents to $6.25 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium gained 5 cents to $3.90 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
