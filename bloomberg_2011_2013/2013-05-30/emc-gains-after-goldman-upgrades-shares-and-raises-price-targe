MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker, rose to a 22-month high
after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  added the company to its
“conviction buy” list and increased its price target 25
percent.  The company rose 9.6 percent to $8.35 at the close in New
York, the highest since July 2011.  MEMC “remains our top idea across our solar coverage given
a unique sum-of-the-parts story,” Brian Lee, a New York-based
analyst at Goldman, wrote in a note to investors today. Lee
increased his 12-month price target to $10 from $8.  The company, based in St. Peters, Missouri, makes
polysilicon wafers that can be used in semiconductors and solar
cells. Shareholders are expected to vote today on changing the
company’s name to SunEdison Inc., the name of its solar unit.  Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. is the biggest U.S. producer of
polysilicon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
