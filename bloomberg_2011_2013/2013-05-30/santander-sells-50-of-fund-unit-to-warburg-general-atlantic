Banco Santander (SAN)  SA agreed to sell
half of its asset management business to Warburg Pincus LLC and
General Atlantic LLC, the latest disposal by  Spain ’s biggest
bank as it bolsters capital.  The buyout firms will own 50 percent of a holding company
that will integrate Santander’s 11 asset management companies,
mainly in  Europe  and  Latin America , the Santander, Spain-based
lender said in a filing to regulators today. The sale values the
business at 2.05 billion euros ($2.67 billion) and will yield a
700 million-euro net capital gain for Santander, the bank said.  Santander has been selling assets, including a stake in its
 Mexican (SANMEXB)  bank last year and its Colombian lender in 2011, to
replenish capital buffers that have been depleted by losses on
Spanish real-estate holdings. Santander Asset Management
currently oversees 152 billion euros.  “This transaction will give Santander Asset Management a
broader international profile and provide excellent
opportunities for growth,” Juan Alcaraz, the unit’s chief
executive officer, said in a statement.  Santander’s former CEO, Alfredo Saenz, said in an April 25
news conference that the bank was in talks over its asset
management business with potential “partners” that may be
interested in participating in a “bigger” project.  The deal announced today will enable the unit to compete
with leading international asset managers and Santander expects
it will double its business volume in five years, the bank said.
Santander plans to keep the remaining 50 percent of the
division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
