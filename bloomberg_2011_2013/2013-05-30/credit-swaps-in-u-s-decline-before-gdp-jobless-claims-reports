A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
declined before reports on unemployment and growth in the
worldâ€™s biggest economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
0.7 basis point to a mid-price of 76.2 basis points at 8:03 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are looking for signs the economy is recovering,
boosting confidence that companies will be able to repay their
debts. The  U.S. economy  probably grew at a 2.5 percent
annualized rate in the first quarter of this year, the same as
estimated last month, economists forecast before revised data
from the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. Initial  jobless
claims , due from the Labor Department, were probably unchanged
at 340,000 in the week ended May 25, estimates show.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
