South African gold mining stocks rose
the most in more than a month on a weakening currency and
stronger gold price.  The  six-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index surged 5.5
percent, the most since March 7 on a closing basis, to 1,434.20
as of 1:56 p.m. in Johannesburg. All the gauge’s component
shares rose.  Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd. (HAR)  surged 9.4 percent to
38.50 rand, the most since March 2011, clipping four days of
declines.  The rand, the worst performer among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg after the Japanese yen this year, weakened
beyond 10 per dollar for the first time since 2009 today, and
last traded at 9.9928. The spot price of gold rose as much as
1.3 percent, the most in a week, and traded 0.5 percent higher
at $1,400.03 per ounce.  “The rand, which has underpinned them all week, is setting
fresh lows today,” Ryan Wibberley, a Cape Town-based trader at
Investec Asset Management, said by phone today. “The gold
miners are underpinned by this persistent rand weakness, the
rand-price of gold is up almost 10 percent in the last two
weeks.”  Johannesburg-based Harmony Gold, one of the three biggest
gold miners, is more geared to the rand-price of gold than
competitors with operations in other countries, Wibberley said.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  rose 6.8 percent, the most in a month, to
60.24 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world’s third-largest
miner of the metal, advanced 4.5 percent to 166.15 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
