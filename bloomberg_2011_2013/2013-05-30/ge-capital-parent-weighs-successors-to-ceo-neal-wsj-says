General Electric Co. (GE)  is evaluating
successors to Michael Neal, who may step down as chief executive
officer and chairman of its financial unit as soon as this
summer, the Wall Street Journal reported.  GE Capital executives who may seek the position include
William Cary, chief operating officer of the unit, and Mark Begor, who runs its real-estate division and capital
restructuring operations, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. Neal, 60, has been
chairman and CEO for eight years, it said.  The management shift would come as  Jeffrey Immelt , CEO of
the world’s largest maker of  jet engines  and diesel locomotives,
shrinks GE Capital and focuses growth on the company’s
industrial operations after seeking government help in the wake
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 collapse. Michael
Goodbody, a spokesman for  GE Capital , declined to comment when
contacted by  Bloomberg News .  GE Capital posted profit of $7.4 billion on $46 billion in
revenue last year. The unit had $68 billion in cash at the end
of the first quarter.  Immelt told analysts and investors in December that GE aims
to get 65 percent of its profit from the industrial units by
2015, compared with about 55 percent last year.  Neal joined GE’s industrial business in 1979 before moving
to the financial unit in 1987 and turned 60 earlier this year,
an age when many of GE’s senior executives move on, the Journal
said, citing the unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
