The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  climbed to the highest level in three
months as issuance by industrial and financial firms rose.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
rose $14.4 billion to $1.048 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
That’s the highest level since the period ended Feb. 27, while
the three consecutive weeks of advances total $55.3 billion, the
biggest expansion since the comparable period ended Jan. 16.  Demand from money-market funds, among the biggest investors
in the market, has increased, accelerating sales of commercial
paper.  Total assets  in the funds have increased to $2.601
trillion in the week ended May 22 from $2.563 trillion for the
period ended May 1, according to the  Investment Company
Institute .  “The increase in money-market funds outstanding has
created a rising demand for commercial paper,”  Howard Simons ,
strategist at Bianco Research LLC in Chicago, wrote in an e-mail.  IOUs issued by  non-financial companies  increased for a
fifth week, rising $5.3 billion to $214.5 billion, the highest
level since the period ended March 6, the Fed said.  Commercial paper sold by overseas financial institutions 
rose $2.5 billion to $245.1 billion outstanding, the most since
the period ended Feb. 6, while the  amount issued by U.S.-based
banks  increased for a third week, adding $8.6 billion to $311.4
billion, the highest level since Feb. 27, according to the Fed.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
