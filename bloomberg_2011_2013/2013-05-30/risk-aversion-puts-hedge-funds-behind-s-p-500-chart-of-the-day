Hedge funds  are paying a price for
being too hesitant to buy stocks in the midst of a four-year
bull market, according to  Barry Ritholtz , FusionIQ’s chief
executive officer.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, Hedge Fund Research Inc.’s
broadest fund index fell out of sync with the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index in 2011 and has yet to recover. The HFRX Global Hedge
Fund Index had a 4.8 percent advance for the year through last
week, while the  S&P 500  was 16 percent higher.  Many fund managers have been “overly timid and suffering
from risk aversion” because of the magnitude of the losses that
preceded the current advance, Ritholtz said yesterday during an
interview. The S&P 500 tumbled 57 percent from its October 2007
high to its March 2009 low.  Federal Reserve policy has worked against managers with a
macro strategy, which focuses on political and economic events,
he said. The central bank is conducting its third round of bond
purchases, or quantitative easing, and has held its benchmark
 interest rate  near zero since December 2008.  “This has been an impossible macro environment to trade
unless your macro theme has been Fed, Fed, Fed and you buy
everything you can,” said Ritholtz, based in New York. He
serves as his firm’s director of equity research.  The HFRX Macro/CTA Index was 0.2 percent higher for the
year as of last week after falling for four years in a row. The
indicator reflects the performance of macro funds and commodity
trading advisers, which focus on buying and selling futures,
options and other types of contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
