The Bank of  Israel ’s dual interest rate cuts this month and decision to buy foreign exchange have successfully reversed the shekel’s appreciation, said Barry Topf, senior adviser to Governor  Stanley Fischer .  Rate reductions by the  European Central Bank  and  Bank of Japan  as well as Israel’s natural gas finds had strengthened the shekel to the point where it didn’t reflect economic fundamentals, Topf said in an interview yesterday at the bank’s offices in  Jerusalem .  “The major factor was the changing global environment, where we essentially felt the need to recalibrate the macroeconomic variables in Israel to what was happening in the world,” said Topf, 59, who has spent 30 years at the central bank and been credited by Fischer for playing a major role in exchange rate policy. “The degree of excessive momentum developing in the movement of the  exchange rate  might have tempted people to think that there was a one-way bet developing and that’s never a good idea.”  The Bank of Israel -- which has surprised economists more than any other central bank in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development -- cut borrowing costs by a cumulative 0.5 percentage point in May to a three-year low and announced it will buy $2.1 billion by the end of 2013. As a result, the exchange rate is behaving more to “our liking,” Topf said. The shekel weakened 2.8 percent over that time from a 21-month high in early May.  ‘Effective’ Cut  The weight the  Bank of Israel  gives to the global environment, and especially to monetary policy in large central banks, is much greater than a decade ago, said Topf, who is to retire by the end of the year. Policy makers, who meet weekly, decided in May that global developments warranted an unscheduled rates session, with Fischer participating from abroad, he said.  Stimulus in  Japan  and the ECB’s rate cut this month played a role in the decision to pare the rate by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent, Topf said. The slowing of international trade, which strongly affects Israel’s economic performance, also affected policy makers’ thinking, he said.  “All this led to the general conclusion that it might be appropriate to take out a little bit of an insurance policy in terms of economic growth,” Topf said.  Second Cut  Two weeks later, the committee decided to drive home the point by trimming another 0.25 point to 1.25 percent.  “The rate cut this week was effective in reinforcing the credibility and willingness of the bank to implement its policies,” said Topf, who is also a voting member on the monetary policy committee. “Our rates are higher than zero so that rates can be cut further. A lot of central banks don’t have that luxury.”  Fischer will be leaving at the end of next month after eight years, saying he wants to spend more time with his family in the U.S. and has achieved most of the goals he set out to accomplish. He gradually cut the benchmark rate from 3.25 percent in 2011 to spur growth and boost exports hurt by currency appreciation.  While the central bank may be able to slow the shekel’s appreciation, changing its direction will be harder, said Tom Gerszbejn, a currency trader at  Union Bank of Israel (UNON)  Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Foreign investors continue to buy the shekel, as they still see the benefit of the country’s rate differential with major economies.”  Gerszbejn expects the shekel to strengthen to 3.50 per dollar by the end of the year. It traded at 3.6753 at 5:41 p.m. in Tel Aviv today.  ‘Extreme’ Gains  Exports make up about 40 percent of Israel’s economy. The shekel gained 3.8 percent in the past six months, the best performer among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The gains triggered complaints from the Manufacturers Association of Israel in early May. It urged Fischer to examine shekel gains, saying they were “extreme” compared with other  U.S. (TA-25)  trading partners and hurting export profits.  The Fischer-led Bank of Israel has surprised economists in about a quarter of its rate decisions, more often than any other OECD country for which comparable data is tracked by Bloomberg. Of the eight rate cuts since September 2011, only two were in line with the median estimate in Bloomberg  surveys .  Quicker Rebound  Israel’s $250 billion  economy  rebounded from the global crisis faster than most peers. Between 2009 and 2012, output expanded by 14.7 percent, compared with 10.7 percent in  Australia , 3.2 percent in the U.S. and a contraction of 1.5 percent in the euro region, the  Finance Ministry  said in a January report. Israel’s  main stock index  has outperformed U.S. and European benchmarks in that period, adding more than 88 percent.  Still, even with lower rates, growth will probably slow to 3.4 percent in 2014 from 3.9 percent this year, the OECD said yesterday. Excluding natural gas production, it will drop to 2.7 percent from 2.9 percent, the OECD said.  Slowing output has pushed  inflation  below the government’s 1 percent to 3 percent target for the first time in almost six years, leaving room for rate cuts.  The Bank of Israel bought $100 million last month in its first intervention since July 2011, as the start of natural gas production off Israel’s coast drove shekel gains even more. Investors, Topf said, overestimated the impact of the finds on Israel’s economy.  “That’s a risk and the steps we took are clearly aimed at making sure that doesn’t happen,” said Topf.
