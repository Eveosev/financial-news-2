China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s
largest phone company by users, sees its future in the expansion
of fourth-generation service to help it cope with threats
including  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) ’s WeChat message app.  The way that WeChat instant messaging replaces traditional
telecom services is “quite severe,”  China  Mobile’s Chairman  Xi Guohua  said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in  Hong
Kong  today. The company must boost data usage and investment in
4G services in response, Xi said.  The threat from WeChat adds to pressure from competition
with  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762)  and China Telecom Corp. for
smartphone users that has cut China Mobile’s share of the
nation’s mobile subscribers to 63.2 percent in April, from 65.7
percent a year earlier. The company is counting on a quick shift
to the high-speed fourth-generation service to stem that decline
and maintain its market lead within China’s 1.16 billion user
market.  “We are rolling out 4G as this represents the company’s
future,” China Mobile’s Xi told the meeting today. “Capex
investment is a must.”  After building a trial 4G network in 15 cities in 2012,
China Mobile in February said it will expand that to 100 cities
this year with 200,000 base stations that can reach a population
of 500 million people.  China’s government may issue licenses for 4G commercial
service around the end of this year, the company said in March.  China Mobile is paying a price for the strategy as the
company said in March it will bear costs for the 4G network that
were previously borne by its state-owned parent, boosting the
listed unit’s capital spending 49 percent to 190.2 billion  yuan 
($31 billion) this year.  As a result, China Mobile this year may post its first
annual profit drop in 14 years. Full-year net income is
 projected  to fall 1.8 percent to 127 billion yuan, the average
of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
