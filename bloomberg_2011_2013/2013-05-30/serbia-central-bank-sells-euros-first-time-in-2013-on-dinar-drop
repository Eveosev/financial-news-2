Serbia ’s central bank sold euros for
the first time this year to slow declines in the dinar, which
dropped to the lowest level in eight weeks.  The Narodna Banka Srbije, based in the capital, Belgrade,
sold 5 million euros ($6.5 million) to commercial banks to
“ease excessive daily volatility” in the domestic currency,
according to a statement on its website.  Three traders in Belgrade, who asked not to be identified
in line with their banks’ policies, said the regulator was
selling euros at levels of about 111.95 dinars after the
currency dropped almost 0.6 percent during today’s session. The
dinar traded at 111.9810 at 6:21 p.m. in Belgrade, falling for a
third day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The decline comes a week after the International Monetary
Fund said Serbia’s budget deficit will top 8 percent of gross
domestic product, more than double the target, unless government
policies change. Investor demand at a May 28 sale of Serbian
five-year bonds fell to half the plan.  The bank bought 90 million euros in the first five months
to slow gains in the dinar triggered by foreign investors buying
Serbian debt and the European Union’s executive arm recommending
that member states begin talks with Serbia over membership of
the 27-nation bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
