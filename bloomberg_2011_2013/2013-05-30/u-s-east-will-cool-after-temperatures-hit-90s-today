After a warm weekend, temperatures
will become more seasonal in the eastern U.S., putting a limit
on energy demand for cooling, said Matt Rogers, president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures are expected to reach into the 90s Fahrenheit
(30s Celsius) across the Northeast starting today, then fall
close to seasonal levels from June 4 to June 13, Rogers said.  “Seasonable-to-cool temperatures across the East lead to
benign energy demands there,” Rogers, based in Bethesda,
 Maryland , said in a note to clients today.  Higher-than-normal temperatures in large population areas
can spur natural gas needs as more people turn to air
conditioners to keep cool. Power plants will account for 32
percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  The high in New York is forecast to reach 91 today and
tomorrow before dropping into the 80s, according to the  National
Weather Service . It will be the first time temperatures have
been that warm since Sept. 1.  Temperatures in Boston and  Washington  are expected to rise
above 90 today and stay there until June 2, the weather service
said. The definition of a heat wave is three consecutive days
with temperatures at 90 or above.  The normal average temperature on June 1 in New York City
is 68 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In  Boston , it’s 63;  Chicago , 64;
Houston, 81; St. Louis, 72; and in Burbank,  California , 67.  To contact the reporter on this story:
