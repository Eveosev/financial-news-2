Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, said second-quarter profit rose 26
percent as acquisitions fueled returns.  Net income for the period ended April 30 climbed to C$1.94
billion ($1.88 billion), or C$1.27 a share, from C$1.53 billion,
or 99 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said today
in a statement. Revenue rose 12 percent to C$7.77 billion.  The C$3.7 billion purchase of  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) ’s auto-finance and deposit business, which was completed Feb. 1, helped
lift earnings from Canadian consumer lending. The lender also
benefited after buying out its partner in their RBC Dexia
Investor Services venture in July.  “We grew earnings this quarter in each of our segments
compared to last year, driven by the strength and
diversification of our business,” Chief Executive Officer
Gordon Nixon, 56, said in the statement.  Profit excluding some items was C$1.31 a share, the bank
said, missing the C$1.32  average estimate  of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Royal Bank set aside C$288 million for bad loans, down 17
percent from a year earlier.  Personal and commercial banking profit rose 12 percent to
C$1.06 billion from a year earlier, helped by lower provisions
for bad loans and C$12 million of earnings from the Ally
acquisition.  Dexia Deal  Investor and treasury services posted profit of C$67
million, compared with a year-earlier loss of C$121 million tied
to costs from the RBC Dexia deal. Royal Bank gained control of
the global custodian after buying a 50 percent stake from
partner Banque Internationale a Luxembourg SA last year for
about C$1.1 billion.  Insurance earnings rose 9.9 percent to C$166 million and
wealth-management profit increased 6.1 percent to C$225 million.
RBC Capital Markets, the firm’s investment-banking unit,
reported profit of C$386 million, up 4 percent from a year
earlier, lifted by higher underwriting and advisory fees.  Trading revenue across the bank fell 26 percent to C$566
million from a year earlier, the company said.  Royal Bank, the best performer among  Canada ’s eight-largest
lenders this year, fell 0.2 percent to C$63.98 yesterday in
Toronto. The shares have gained 6.9 percent this year,
outperforming the 3 percent  advance  of the eight-company
Standard & Poor’s/TSX Commercial Banks Index.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the fifth-biggest bank,
earlier posted profit that rose 8 percent to C$876 million, or
C$2.12 a share, to beat analysts’ estimates. The Toronto-based
bank also raised its quarterly dividend 2 percent to 96 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
