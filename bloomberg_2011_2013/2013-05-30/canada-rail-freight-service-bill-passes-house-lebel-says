Canada’s House of Commons has passed
the Fair Rail Freight Service Act, which will lead to better
relations between shippers and railway companies, Transportation
Minister Denis Lebel said.  The law, once passed by Canada’s Senate, will encourage
shippers and railways to negotiate service agreements, and will
provide for arbitration if the negotiations aren’t successful,
Lebel said in an e-mailed statement.  Canadian National (CNR)  Railway Co. is disappointed with the
legislation because it isn’t “consistent with a sound public
policy agenda that encourages increased productivity and
innovation,” Mark Hallman, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  The government should have encouraged customers and
railways to keep working “within a commercial framework,
instead of adopting new rail regulation that threatens to chill
supply chain innovation,” Hallman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
