China ’s carbon dioxide emissions will
rise about 40 percent more by 2020 by burning fuel compared with
levels in 2010 when it was already the biggest emitter, the
Economist Intelligence Unit said today in a report.  The projection came as the Economist estimated China’s
consumption of coal will grow by 18 percent during 2011-15, down
from 46 percent growth in 2006-10. Coal accounts for about two-thirds of China’s energy consumption and three-quarters of its
power generation, it said.  Measures such as a carbon tax and carbon trading, coupled
with  carbon capture  and storage techniques, will be needed to
contain emissions quickly, the Economist said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
