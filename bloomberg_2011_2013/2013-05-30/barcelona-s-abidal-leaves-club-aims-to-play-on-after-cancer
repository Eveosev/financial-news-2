Eric Abidal  said he’s leaving
Barcelona after this season to pursue his career as a soccer
player at age 33 after recovering from cancer and a liver
transplant in the past two years.  Abidal told a televised news conference Barcelona didn’t
offer to renew his contract. He made his comeback on April 6,
one of four games he played this season.  “I would have liked to stay here but the club sees it
differently,” Abidal, his voice breaking up with emotion, told
a news conference at Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium. “I have to
respect that decision.”  Abidal’s teammates including  Lionel Messi ,  Cesc Fabregas 
and Carles Puyol attended the news conference, clapping the
French defender’s speech at the end.  Abidal, who joined from Lyon in 2007, helped Barcelona to
win four Spanish league championships and two Champions League
titles.  He said he could return in the future after getting a
“very interesting” offer for a non-playing role.  “I appreciate the gesture,” Abidal said.  He didn’t immediately give more details about the role or
say for which club he might play next.  To contact the reporters on this story:
