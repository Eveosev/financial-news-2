The pound rose for a second day
versus the dollar, reaching the strongest level in more than a
week, as an industry report showed British  house prices  jumped
the most in 18 months in May.  U.K. government bonds advanced, trimming their worst
monthly loss since December 2009, as a decline in Japanese
stocks boosted demand for the perceived safety of fixed-income
assets.  Home prices  rose 1.1 percent from a year earlier, the
most since November 2011, the  Nationwide Building Society  said
in an e-mailed statement. They climbed 0.4 percent from April to
an average 167,912 pounds ($255,300).  “The recovery in the U.K. economy is patchy, but it’s
gradually going in the right direction,” said  Neil Jones , the
London-based head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. “I see the recovery in the housing market
as a manifestation of that. The demand for sterling should be
well underpinned.”  The pound advanced 0.5 percent to $1.5199 at 4:28 p.m.
 London  time after rising to $1.5217, the most since May 21. The
U.K. currency weakened 0.3 percent to 85.80 pence per euro.  Sterling has gained 2.1 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The pound has still weakened 2.9
percent this year, the worst performer after the yen and
Australian dollar, the indexes show.  The U.K. housing market is “gradually” gaining momentum,
the Nationwide said today.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
said this month that an economic recovery is in sight as
officials raised their forecast for growth.  Cheaper Credit  The central bank has extended its Funding for Lending
Scheme to give lenders access to cheaper credit and kept
 interest rates  at a record low to support the recovery.  Data tomorrow will show  mortgage approvals  increased to
54,600 in April from 53,504 in March, according to a  Bloomberg
News  survey of economists. The Bank of England will publish the
data at 9:30 a.m. in London.  The pound may resume its decline against the dollar as
policy makers will probably keep their “dovish” tone before
the arrival of new governor  Mark Carney  in July, Morgan Stanley
strategists led by  Hans Redeker  in London wrote in a client
report today.  “The sterling-dollar rebound has triggered the take-profit
stop on our short position and we now expect a further recovery
in the near term,” the report said. “We view this rebound as
corrective and we look for renewed selling opportunity in the
$1.5820 area.” A short position is a bet an asset will decline.  Analysts’ Forecasts  Sterling will fall to $1.51 by the end of June and decline
to $1.49 by the end of 2013, according to the median of
analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg News.  Ten-year  gilt yields  dropped from the highest level in more
than two months as Japan’s Nikkei 225  Stock Average (NKY)  plunged 5.2
percent, entering a correction after declining more than 10
percent from its recent peak.  The 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.96 percent after rising above 2 percent
yesterday for the first time since March. The 1.75 percent
security due in September 2022 rose 0.345, or 3.45 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 98.235.  U.K. gilts lost 2.4 percent this month through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds dropped
1.6 percent and U.S. Treasuries declined 1.8 percent.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index have fallen 1.5 percent in May, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004.  To contact the reporters on this story:
