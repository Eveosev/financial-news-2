Palm oil  declined from a seven-week
high as crude oil traded near the lowest price in four weeks,
cutting the appeal of vegetable oils as biofuel feedstock.  The contract for August delivery fell 1.1 percent to close
at 2,372 ringgit ($772) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the biggest decline for the most active futures
since April 29. Futures ended at 2,399 ringgit yesterday, the
highest level at close since April 8.  West Texas Intermediate crude fell to $92.59 a barrel after
an industry report showed U.S. stockpiles rose the most in a
month. The contract closed at $93.13 yesterday, the lowest since
May 1. A record 5.6 million tons of palm was used for fuel in
2012, according to Oil World, a Hamburg-based research company.  “The drop in crude prices makes biodiesel less desirable
and therefore there’ll be selling pressure on crude palm oil,”
said Sim Han Qiang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.  Palm oil for  physical  delivery in June was at 2,350 ringgit
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures are up
3.8 percent in May, heading for the first monthly gain in four.  The decline in  soybean oil  prices may also damp demand for
palm, Sim said. Soybean oil’s  premium  over palm oil was $297.56
a ton today, compared with an average of $322.89 this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The vegetable oils are
substitutes in food and fuel.  Soybean oil for July delivery lost 0.3 percent to 48.51
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending a 1.8
percent decline yesterday. Soybeans dropped 0.3 percent to
$14.9775 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery fell 0.9 percent to
close at 6,144  yuan  ($1,002) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , while soybean oil lost 0.7 percent to 7,484 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
