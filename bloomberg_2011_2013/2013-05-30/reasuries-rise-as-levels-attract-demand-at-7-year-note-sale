Treasuries advanced as yields at the
highest levels in more than a year lured investors to the
government’s sale of $29 billion in seven-year notes.  The securities drew a  high yield  of 1.496 percent, the most
since March 2012 when the securities yielded 1.59 percent at an
auction. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand for the
issue by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 2.70. The ratio averaged 2.67 at the past 10
auctions.  U.S. debt  dropped earlier, extending the steepest
monthly loss in three years.  “It helps that this is the highest yield we’ve had since
March 2012,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist BNP
Paribas SA in  New York , one of 21 primary dealers that are
obligated to bid at U.S. government debt auctions.  The  yield  on 10-year Treasury notes fell one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.11 percent as of 1:16 p.m. New
York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of
the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023 added 3/32, or 94 cents
per $1,000 face amount, to 96 26/32. The yield reached 2.23
percent yesterday, the highest level since April 5, 2012.  Yields on  current  seven-year notes fell one basis point to
1.48 percent. The yield at today’s auction compared with a
forecast of 1.522 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  Bid Detail  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  40.8 percent of the notes, the
most since July and compared with 39.3 percent of the seven-year
notes auctioned last month. The average for the past 10
offerings is 38.3 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 20.7 percent of
the notes, the most since December and compared with 19.7
percent at the April sale. The average at the past 10 sales is
18 percent.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index have fallen 1.5 percent in May, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004. Treasuries have tumbled 1.8
percent in May as of yesterday, the most since December 2009,
according to the indexes. Treasuries have lost investors 1
percent this year.  The median of 75 economists’ and strategists’ predictions
compiled by Bloomberg is for the yield on the 10-year note to
end the year at 2.15 percent.  Market Risk  “Everyone realizes there’s some risk that’s been put back
into the  bond market ,” said Thomas Tucci, managing director and
head of Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month to support the economy. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said last week the Fed could “take a step down in our pace of
purchases” in the “next few meetings,” in testimony to
lawmakers.  The central bank purchased $1.5 billion of securities
maturing between February 2037 and February 2043 today,
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2.4 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, less than previously estimated, the
Commerce Department said today in  Washington . The forecast in a
Bloomberg survey called for no revision from the 2.5 percent
pace initially reported.  Initial jobless claims increased to 354,000 in the week
ended May 25, the Labor Department reported. The median forecast
of 49 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for claims to
remain unchanged from the previous week at 340,000.  Price Swings  Treasury volatility as measured by the Bank of America

trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, narrowed to 2.20 percentage points today, the smallest gap
since August.  The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal
consumption expenditures deflator, rose 0.8 percent in April
