Asian  stocks  retreated, with Japan’s
 Topix (TPX)  index and Nikkei 225 Stock Average entering so-called
corrections, as commodities fell and the yen strengthened,
damping the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets 83 percent of sales from
overseas, sank 3.4 percent, pacing declines among Japanese
exporters.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company
and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, lost 1.2 percent as crude
and copper futures traded near the lowest levels in at least two
weeks.  Langham (1270)  Hospitality Investments Ltd., a hotel operator,
slumped 9.2 percent on its first trading day in  Hong Kong .
Nikkei 225 Stock Average futures jumped in after-hours trading
after Reuters reported Japan government pension fund is
discussing changing its portfolio mix to allow more equity
investment.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.2 percent to 134.95 as
of 9 p.m. in  Tokyo , with about five shares falling for each that
rose. All 10 industry groups dropped on the gauge, which is
poised to close at the lowest level since April 9. The measure
is heading for its first monthly decline in seven months as
speculation grows that the  Federal Reserve  will reduce its bond
purchases as the  U.S. economy  improves, and amid signs of an
economic slowdown in  China .  “Selling is feeding into more selling,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments
Ltd., which manages the equivalent of about $59.6 billion.
“It’s not that the market is tanking because of a special event
today. There’s underlying concern about the Fed’s early exit.”  Japan’s Topix, which had risen as much as 83 percent from
an almost 29-year low struck on June 4 last year, dropped 3.8
percent. The measure has retreated 11 percent from a five-year
high on May 22, passing the 10 percent threshold some investors
use to define a correction. Overseas investors sold a record
11.7 trillion yen ($116 billion) worth of Japanese shares in the
week ended May 24, according to Tokyo Stock Exchange  data .  Fast Plummets  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  slumped 5.2 percent, also falling more than
10 percent from last week’s high, as Fast Retailing Co., which
has a weighting of almost 10 percent on the benchmark index,
tumbled by the most since March 2011. The 11 percent plunge by
Asia’s biggest clothing retailer accounted for 23 percent of the
Nikkei 225’s net decline today.  Shares fell as the yen climbed as much as 0.7 percent to
100.47 against the dollar, a three-week high, before trading at
101.67 as of 9:12 p.m. in Tokyo. A stronger yen cuts the value
of overseas earnings at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Even after today’s plunge, the Topix and the Nikkei 225 are
still up more than 30 percent this year after the  Bank of Japan 
pledged to reach 2 percent inflation within two years with
unlimited bond buying and by doubling the monetary base.  “It’s difficult for the market to keep rallying,” said
 Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management in
Sydney, who manages more than $400 million. “Apart from
volatility caused by the currency and bonds, we are at a
juncture where further moves from Japanese equities need to be
fundamentally driven.”  Philippine Stocks  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.9 percent, while
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index and China’s Shanghai Composite Index both fell 0.3
percent. South Korea’s Kospi index declined 0.1 percent.
Taiwan’s Taiex Index dropped 1.1 percent. Singapore’s Straits
Times Index declined 1 percent.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index sank 3.8 percent, the
second-biggest decline among Asia-Pacific benchmarks, as concern
valuations are excessive overshadowed data showing the economy
grew in the first quarter at the fastest pace in three years.  Fed Concern  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
today. The index dropped 0.7 percent in New York yesterday amid
concern that the Federal Reserve could begin to taper its debt-buying program as the economy continues to improve. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the central bank could reduce
monetary stimulus if officials see signs of sustained
improvement in the economy.  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 13.5 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 15 times for the S&P
500 and 13.3 times the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by  Bloomberg News .  Japanese exporters declined. Honda dropped 3.4 percent to
3,875 yen. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker,
slipped 2.3 percent to 6,060 yen.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , Japan’s
second-largest television manufacturer, tumbled 4.1 percent to
804 yen.  Raw-material producers dropped. BHP decreased 1.2 percent
to A$34.46 in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s No. 2  mining
company by market value, fell 1.4 percent to A$53.96.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the nation’s fourth-biggest
lender, fell 1 percent to A$29.32. The stock fell an eighth day,
its longest losing streak since November 2010. A gauge of
 Australian banks  is down 12 percent this month, heading for its
biggest monthly decline in three years.  REITs Slump  Langham, a trust backed by Great Eagle Holdings Ltd.’s
hotels, slumped 9.2 percent to HK$4.51 on its trading debut in
Hong Kong. The company raised net proceeds of HK$4.26 billion
($549 million) for its IPO, selling shares at HK$5 each, the
midpoint of its  price range  between HK$4.65 and HK$5.36.  High-yielding securities across Asia declined today as bond
yields jumped.  Fortune Real Estate Investment Trust (778) , a shopping
mall operator in Hong Kong partly owned by billionaire  Li Ka-shing ’s Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd., sank 5.7 percent to HK$7.27.
Keppel REIT, an office landlord partly owned by the world’s
biggest builder of oil rigs, slid 2 percent to S$1.44 in
Singapore.  Mitsubishi Estate  A measure of Japanese real estate companies in the Topix
index extended its decline from an April 12 high to 22 percent.
Mitsubishi Estate Co. dropped 5 percent to 2,525 yen,
relinquishing its place as Asia’s biggest real estate company by
value to Hong Kong’s Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. Tokyo Tatemono
Co. dropped 8.8 percent to 746 yen, the lowest in a month.  “There could be some knee-jerk reaction to rising U.S.
bond yields, which is not good for yield stocks such as REITs,”
said Ng Soo Nam, Singapore-based chief investment officer at
Nikko Asset Management Asia Ltd., whose Japan-based parent
oversees about $165 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
