Frontline (FRO)  Ltd., the oil-tanker
company led by billionaire John Fredriksen, said an oversupply
of the vessels is preventing the market recovery needed to be
able to repay a convertible bond maturing in 2015.  “The tanker market is massively oversupplied and it may
take some time before a reasonable market balance is restored
and sustained recovery of the tanker market occurs,” the
manager of 32 supertankers said today as it reported a fourth
quarterly loss. Its cash might run out if the market doesn’t
recover and it can’t raise equity or sell assets, Hamilton,
Bermuda-based Frontline said, reiterating comments made Feb. 22.  The timing of any recovery will depend on global growth and
demolition of excess ships, Frontline said. World trade will
rise 3.6 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund
estimates, cutting its forecast in January and April from 4.5
percent. Scrapping will slow to 2.1 million deadweight tons this
year from 2.7 million tons in 2012, and the fleet will expand
another 4.7 percent, according to shipbroker Clarkson Plc.  “The company’s comments are in line with our view of
overtonnage being the primary headache for the tanker market,”
Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an Oslo-based analyst at Arctic
Securities ASA who recommends selling Frontline shares, said in
an e-mailed report. “Although we are seeing positive signs on a
shift in trade lanes, it does not make up for the number of
vessels on the water.”  Earnings Tumble  The global fleet of supertankers swelled 30 percent to
189.6 million tons since rates peaked in 2007, according to
Clarkson, the world’s largest shipbroker. Average daily earnings
plunged 74 percent in the past year to $8,429, its figures show.
Tanker owners lost about $27 billion since 2009, according to
Intertanko, the industry’s biggest trade group.  Frontline said its supertankers, known in the industry as
very large crude carriers, need $25,500 a day to break even.
Each vessel can hold 2 million barrels of oil.  The company had a first-quarter  net loss  of $18.8 million,
or 24 cents a share, after earning $7.18 million, or 9 cents, a
year earlier, the statement showed. Frontline said it has a $225
million issue of convertible bonds due in April 2015.  Frontline shares fell 5 percent to 12.3 kroner ($2.09) by
10:54 a.m. in Oslo trading. The stock is down 34 percent this
year, headed for a sixth consecutive  annual drop . It closed at
178.9 kroner on March 26, 2010, the day the company sold the
bonds, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
