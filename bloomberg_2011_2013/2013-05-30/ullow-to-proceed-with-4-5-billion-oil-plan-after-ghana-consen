Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , a U.K. explorer with
most of its licenses in Africa, said Ghana’s approval of a $4.5
billion oilfield development paves the way for its construction.  The government approved Tullow’s plan for the Tweneboa,
Enyenra and Ntomme deposits, collectively known as TEN, the
company said today in a statement. The London-based explorer and
partners  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and Kosmos Energy Ltd. plan to
pump about 80,000 barrels a day from TEN starting in 2016.  Tullow has extended exploration off Ghana after its Jubilee
field in 2010 opened up a new oil province. West Africa has
attracted interest from the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp. and
China’s  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  as international energy companies drill from
Mauritania to  Namibia .  “The government of Ghana has shown faith in Tullow and its
partners again and has set us a number of important targets
around local content and supply chain,” Chief Executive Officer
Aidan Heavey said in the statement. He said May 8 that Tullow,
the project operator, plans to sell part of its stake in the
development.  It will take 32 to 36 months to produce the first oil from
TEN following government approval, the company said in February.  Tullow  gained  1.4 percent to 1,043 pence in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
