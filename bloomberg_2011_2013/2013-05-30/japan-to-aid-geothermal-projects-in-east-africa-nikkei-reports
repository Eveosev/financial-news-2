The Japanese government plans to
provide support to develop geothermal projects in East Africa,
the Nikkei newspaper reported today without saying where it got
the information.  The  Japan  International Cooperation Agency plans to start
offering technical assistance in  Kenya  in September as the
African nation plans to increase its geothermal capacity to
about 5,000 megawatts in 20 years from 200 megawatts now,
according to the report.  Japan also plans to send geological survey missions to
countries such as Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania and to draw up a
development plan for  Ethiopia , the Nikkei said.  The geothermal plans are to be included in a list of
development assistance measures for Africa at a June 1-3
conference to be held in Yokohama city, according to the report.  Geothermal energy harnesses steam or hot water from
underground to generate electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
