Israel’s two largest lenders,  Bank
Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI)  and  Bank Leumi Le-Israel (LUMI)  Ltd., posted lower first-quarter interest income as they reduced risky loans.  Net interest income at Hapoalim, the nation’s largest
lender by assets, fell 4.2 percent to 2.06 billion shekels while
Leumi’s financing income dropped 3.8 percent to 1.76 billion
shekels, the banks said today in separate statements. Provisions
to cover bad loans at Hapoalim declined to 257 million shekels
from 303 million shekels a year earlier, while Leumi provisions
fell to 73 million shekels from 225 million.  “Banks are putting on the brakes on the corporate sector
and that’s hurting profitability,” Terence Klingman, head of
research at Psagot Investment House Ltd., said today by phone
from  Tel Aviv . “As banks de-risk their balance sheets that’s
having a positive effect on  credit quality .”  Restructurings at holding companies such as IDB Holding
Corp. and tougher capital adequacy directives from the  Bank of
Israel  are forcing banks to pare lending. Israel’s economic
growth will probably slow to 2.8 percent in 2013, excluding gas
output, from 3.2 percent last year, according to the central
bank. The Bank of Israel lowered rates this month twice to 1.25
percent, the lowest in more than three years.  The Bank of Israel said on May 28 that business sector debt
in March declined by about 0.9 percent from the previous month.
 Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF)  said this week provisions were
equivalent to 0.1 percent of outstanding loans.  Net income at Hapoalim fell 5.8 percent to 621 million
shekels ($169 million) in the three months to March, the bank
said. Leumi profit rose to 570 million shekels from 431 million
shekels. The bank sold a 4.6 percent stake in  Migdal Insurance &
Financial Holding Ltd. (MGDL)  stake, posting a 110-million shekel
profit from the sale, it said Jan. 3.  Israel Discount Bank (DSCT) , the nation’s third-largest lender by
assets, said today profit fell to 263 million shekels from 246
million shekels as net interest income fell to 1.04 billion
shekels from 1.1 billion shekels. Provisions at Discount rose to
145 million shekels from 123 million shekels.  Leumi fell 0.4 percent to 12.93 shekels while Hapoalim
gained 0.3 percent to 17.17 shekels at the close in Tel Aviv.
Discount gained 1.8 percent to 6.20 shekels in more than three
times the three-month average daily volume. The Tel Aviv Banking
Index of the bourse’s five largest commercial institutions has
advanced 2.8 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
