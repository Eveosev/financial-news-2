Young Sohn, the president of Samsung Electronics, spoke with  Bloomberg TV  in an interview at MaiTai Global. The annual kitesurfing event in Maui is geared toward entrepreneurs and attracts various water-loving tech executives. In the video, Sohn said he attends the event to network among industry folks and collaborate on new ideas. "Samsung typically had been a very Korea-centric corporation," Sohn said. He mentioned Boston and Israel as "global hot spots" for innovation that Samsung has gravitated toward. The South Korean electronics giant's plans to explore global hot spots is something Sohn has talked about before, including at a  Silicon Valley event  in February that my colleague Ian King covered. But Sohn wasn't wearing a wet suit at the time.
