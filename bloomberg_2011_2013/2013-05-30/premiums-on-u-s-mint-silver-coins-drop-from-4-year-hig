Premiums on American Eagle silver
coins sold by the U.S. Mint dropped in May from a four-year
high, signaling waning demand.  The premium charged by wholesale dealers fell to 13 percent
from 25 percent in April, Richard Nachbar, a coin dealer based
in Williamsville, New York, said today in a telephone interview.
The premium rose as high as 55 percent in the two months ended
November 2008, he said. Dimes, quarters and half-dollars dated
before 1965, which are 90 percent silver, traded at a premium of
17 percent in April after usually selling at a discount, he
said.  Sales of American Eagle silver coins in May have dropped 15
percent from the full month of April, according to  data  on the
mint’s website. Sales jumped to a monthly record in January, and
the mint suspended business for a week because of a lack of
inventory.  Silver futures have tumbled 26 percent this year, the most
among 24  raw materials  tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index. The commodity slumped into a bear market on April 1,
partly on concern that industrial demand would ebb.  Gold premiums have tumbled in  India  and Hong Kong, the
world’s biggest consumers, signaling that the buying frenzy that
followed the metal’s biggest slump in three decades has
weakened.  On April 15, gold plunged 9.3 percent, the most in 33
years, on record-high trading after an unexpected slowdown in
 China ’s economic expansion sparked a commodity selloff.  Gold has tumbled 17 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value amid low inflation
and a rally in equities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
