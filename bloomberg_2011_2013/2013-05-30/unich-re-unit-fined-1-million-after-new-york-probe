Munich Re ’s American Modern Insurance
unit agreed to pay a $1 million penalty, provide customer
refunds and make reforms after a probe into kickbacks paid to
banks, New York’s financial-services regulator said.  Chubb Corp. (CB) , Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Maryland and
FinSecure agreed to reforms and weren’t fined because they
didn’t pay kickbacks, New York’s Department of Financial
Services said today in an e-mailed statement.  The state’s investigation focused on force-placed policies,
or mandatory coverage for mortgage borrowers who lapse on
insurance payments with their original carriers. Assurant Inc.
and QBE Insurance Group Ltd. settled with the New York regulator
earlier this year.  Terese Rosenthal, a spokeswoman for  Munich Re (MUV2)  in the U.S.,
had no immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
