Johns Hopkins University, amid its
biggest fundraising drive, plans to borrow $95 million to
refinance debt.  The private Baltimore-based institution that opened in
1876, is set to issue the tax-exempt revenue bonds to replace
debt sold in 2001 and 2004, according to a Standard & Poor’s
report. S&P rates the school AA, third highest. It had about
$1.5 billion of debt as of March 31, according to S&P.  University bonds sold in June 2012 and maturing in July
2041 traded May 28 with an average yield of 3.06 percent, about
0.1 percentage point below an index of top-rated municipals with
similar maturities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Maryland Health & Higher Educational Facilities
Authority will issue the bonds. Johns Hopkins spokeswoman
Barbara Wallace didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail  seeking
comment on the sale. Authority Executive Director Annette
Anselmi didn’t respond to a telephone message.  The school plans to raise $4.5 billion to endow
professorships and to finance student aid and fellowships.  New York  Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a 1964 graduate who is
founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of
Bloomberg News, committed $350 million in January, the
university said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
