French jobless claims climbed for a
24th month to an all-time high as President  Francois Hollande 
vowed to reverse the increase by the end of this year.  The  number of people actively looking for work  increased by
39,800, or 1.2 percent, to 3.264 million in April, the labor
ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists
expected an increase of 30,000, according to the median of five
forecasts gathered by  Bloomberg News .  The increase takes the total number of jobseekers past the
previous record of 3.22 million in March. For Hollande, who won
office last year on a campaign against austerity, the loss of
tens of thousands of jobs at companies such as  PSA Peugeot
Citroen SA (UG)  is contributing to approval ratings near record lows.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said
yesterday that unemployment will keep rising through 2014.  “I’m not going to resign myself to this,” Hollande said
yesterday after the OECD prediction was published.  Hollande has created a payroll tax-credit to aid companies
and has cajoled unions and business groups to agree to ease
labor laws to make it simpler to trim wages in a downturn. He
has repeatedly pledged to reduce  government spending  and plans
to overhaul the pension and unemployment benefit systems in
coming months.  Hollande is today meeting with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  in Paris to discuss how to revive growth and create jobs
across Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
