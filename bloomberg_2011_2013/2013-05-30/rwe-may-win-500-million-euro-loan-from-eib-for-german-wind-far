RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, may win a 500 million-euro ($649 million) loan from the
European Investment Bank to develop an offshore wind farm.  The 1.1 billion-euro Innogy Nordsee 1 facility, 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of the North Sea island of Juist,
will have a capacity of 332 megawatts and use 54 turbines, the
Luxembourg-based bank said today in a statement on its  website .
The loan requires approval by EIB’s board, the statement shows.  The site is the first of three RWE projects in the area
totaling 1,000 megawatts in capacity, according to the Essen-based utility’s website. Germany plans to raise offshore wind
capacity to 10,000 megawatts by 2020 from about 280 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
