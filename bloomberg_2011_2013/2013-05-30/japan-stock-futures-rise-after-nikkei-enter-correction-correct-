Japanese stock-index futures rose
following a report that the nation’s pension fund may boost its
equities holdings, indicating the Topix index and  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  will rebound after entering corrections yesterday.  American Depositary Receipts  of Nissan Motor Co., Asia’s
third-biggest auto market, gained 0.8 percent as the yen
weakened. ADRs of Sony Corp. advanced 4.7 percent after people
familiar with the matter said the electronics maker is working
with Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. as it considers adopting
billionaire  Daniel Loeb ’s proposal for a sale of its
entertainment unit.  Futures on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring next
month closed at 13,810 in  Chicago  yesterday, up from 13,610 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
13,830 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. The underlying gauge
closed 5.2 percent lower at 13,589.03 yesterday, entering a
correction after sliding more than 10 percent from the May 22
high.  “The report suggests a more flexible approach is being
considered, which could allow investment in domestic stocks to
grow,” said Ioan Smith, a strategist at Knight Capital Europe
Ltd. in London. “The fund’s overall allocation will not dip
below the last reported level of 13 percent and must now be
close to its 17 percent ceiling.”  Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.4
percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.5 percent. Futures
on  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.3 percent and contracts
on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland Chinese
companies trading in Hong Kong added 0.6 percent. The Bloomberg
China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese shares in the
U.S. climbed 0.6 percent in New York yesterday.  Pension Fund  Japan’s $1 trillion  Government Pension Investment Fund  is
considering changes that would allow a greater investment in
shares, Reuters reported yesterday, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter. The shift would be the fund’s most
significant revision in strategy since 2006, according to the
 news agency .  The pension fund is considering the first change to its
asset balance amid concern government policies could erode the
value of $747 billion in local bonds, President Takahiro Mitani
said in a Feb. 1 interview with  Bloomberg News .  Nikkei futures also advanced as a Japanese official said
 David Lipton , an IMF official, supports the government’s
stimulus policies. The government official had been briefed on
yesterday’s meeting in  Tokyo  between Lipton and Japan’s Deputy
Prime Minister Taro Aso.  Offshore Investors  Japan’s Topix, which had risen as much as 83 percent from
an almost 29-year low struck on June 4 last year, dropped 3.8
percent yesterday. The measure has retreated 11 percent from a
five-year high on May 22, passing the 10 percent threshold some
investors use to define a correction.  Offshore investors  sold a
record 11.7 trillion yen ($116 billion) worth of Japanese shares
in the week ended May 24, according to Tokyo Stock Exchange
data.  The Nikkei 225 slumped 5.2 percent yesterday, also falling
more than 10 percent from last week’s high, as Fast Retailing
Co., which has a weighting of almost 10 percent on the benchmark
index, tumbled by the most since March 2011. The 11 percent
plunge by Asia’s biggest clothing retailer accounted for 23
percent of the Nikkei 225’s net decline yesterday.  Even after yesterday’s plunge, the Topix and the Nikkei 225
are still up more than 30 percent this year after the  Bank of
Japan  pledged to reach 2 percent inflation within two years with
unlimited bond buying and by doubling the monetary base.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slipped 01.1
percent. The gauge advanced 0.4 percent yesterday as weaker-than-expected data on economic growth and jobless claims boosted
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will maintain stimulus.  The yen fell 0.2 percent to 100.91 per dollar as of 7:39
a.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
