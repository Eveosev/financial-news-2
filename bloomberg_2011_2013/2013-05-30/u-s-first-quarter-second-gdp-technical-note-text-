Following is the technical note from
the Gross Domestic Product report from the Commerce Department.  This technical note provides background information about
the source data and estimating methods used to produce the
estimates presented in the GDP news release. The complete set of
estimates for the first quarter is available on BEA’s Web site
at www.bea.gov; a brief summary of “highlights” is also posted
on the Web site. In a few weeks, the estimates will be published
in BEA’s monthly journal, the Survey of Current Business, along
with a more detailed analysis of the estimates (“GDP and the
Economy”).  Sources of Revision to Real GDP  Real GDP increased 2.4 percent (annual rate) in the first
quarter, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point from the
advance estimate. The downward revision to the percent change in
real GDP is smaller than the average revision from the advance
to second estimate of 0.5 percentage point. The revision
reflected downward revisions to private inventory investment, to
exports, and to state and local government spending that were
partly offset by a downward revision to imports and an upward
revision to consumer spending.  The downward revision to private inventory investment
primarily reflected downward revisions to retail trade
inventories and to “other” industry inventories. The revised
estimates reflected newly available Census Bureau nondurable
manufacturing and trade inventory data for March, revised data
for February, and preliminary first-quarter Census quarterly
financial report data for mining industries and for information
industries. Benchmarked Census manufacturing inventories data
were also incorporated on a best-change basis. (BEA applies the
“best change” to the level of inventories.)  The revisions to exports and imports were mainly based on
newly available Census goods data for March and revised data for
February.  The downward revision to state and local government
investment was more than accounted for by a downward revision to
structures that was based on newly available Census construction
spending for March and revised data for January and February.  The upward revision to consumer spending reflected an
upward revision to spending on motor vehicle fuels that was
based on newly available February gasoline supply data from the
Energy Information Administration.  The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.2
percent in the first quarter, an upward revision of 0.1
percentage point. The revision was mostly accounted for by an
upward revision to PCE prices for financial services and
reflected the incorporation of newly available commercial bank
call report data.  Gross Domestic Income and Corporate Profits  Real gross domestic income (GDI), which measures the output
of the economy as the costs incurred and the incomes earned in
the production of GDP, increased 2.5 percent in the first
quarter.  Real GDI increased 5.5 percent, and real GDP increased
0.4 percent, in the previous quarter.  For a given quarter, the
estimates of GDP and GDI may differ for a variety of reasons,
mainly on their reliance on different and independent source
data. However, over longer time spans, the estimates of GDP and
GDI tend to follow similar patterns of change. For the year 2012,
real GDP and real GDI both increased 2.2 percent.  Profits from current production decreased $43.8 billion, or
2.2 percent (quarterly rate), in the first quarter.  Domestic
profits of financial corporations decreased $2.0 billion,
domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased $8.8
billion, and rest-of-the-world profits decreased $33.0 billion.  Revisions to Wages and Salaries, Disposable Personal Income, and
GDI  In addition to presenting revised estimates for the first
quarter, today’s release also presents revised estimates of
fourth-quarter wages and salaries, personal taxes, and
contributions for government social insurance. Wage and salary
disbursements are now estimated to have increased $171.7 billion
in the fourth quarter of 2012, an upward revision of $100.9
billion. These estimates reflect newly available wage and salary
tabulations for the fourth quarter from the BLS quarterly census
of employment and wages (QCEW). These data are more
comprehensive than the monthly employment and earnings data that
were used for the earlier estimates -- the QCEW data include
irregular pay, such as bonuses and gains from the exercise of
stock options, which were substantial for the fourth-quarter as
some companies accelerated bonus payments and other types of
irregular pay in anticipation of tax law changes.  Real disposable personal income is now estimated to have
increased 8.9 percent (annual rate) in the fourth quarter and to
have decreased 8.4 percent in the first. (By comparison, the
estimates that were available last month showed an increase of
6.2 percent in the fourth quarter and a decrease of 5.3 percent
in the first.)  The revision to fourth-quarter wages and salaries also
resulted in a revision to GDI. Real GDI is now estimated to have
increased 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter, an upward revision
of 2.9 percentage points.  Comprehensive NIPA Revision Scheduled for July 31  On July 31, 2013, BEA will present the results of its
comprehensive revision of the national income and product
accounts (NIPAs).  A series of articles in the Survey of Current
Business discusses the revision in detail; these articles and
other information about the revision are available on the BEA
Web site at www.bea.gov/GDP-revisions.  As part of this comprehensive revision, BEA will:  Incorporate the results of the 2007 Benchmark Input-Output
Accounts; *    Recognize expenditures on research and
development and on entertainment, literary, and artistic
originals as fixed investment;  Measure the transactions of defined benefit pension plans
on an accrual accounting basis and recognize the cost of
unfunded liabilities;  Update the reference year for chain-type quantity and price
indexes and chained-dollar estimates to 2009 from 2005.  Table A.--SOURCE DATA FOR THE ADVANCE AND SECOND
ESTIMATES OF GDP FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013  This table shows the actual data used for the second estimate of
GDP for the first quarter of 2013.  For these key series, actual
data for March were not available in time for inclusion in the
advance GDP estimate released on April 26, 2013, and BEA made
assumptions for these source data.  The numbers in brackets show
the March values that had been assumed for the advance estimate.
For most series, the data incorporated for February and, in some
cases, for January were preliminary, and the numbers shown in
brackets are the values used last month.  All series shown in the table are in billions of dollars,
seasonally adjusted at annual rates, and are published by the
Bureau of the Census.  2012
