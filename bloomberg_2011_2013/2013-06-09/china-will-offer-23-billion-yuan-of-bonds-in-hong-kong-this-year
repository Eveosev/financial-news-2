China will offer 23 billion  yuan 
($3.8 billion) of sovereign bonds for sale in Hong Kong this
year, a move that the city said will boost yuan-denominated
fixed income products for investors including pension funds.  The  Finance Ministry  will offer 13 billion yuan of bonds
June 26 and 10 billion yuan more in the second half, the
Beijing-based ministry said on its website today. The issuance
offers bonds with a 30-year tenor to institutional investors for
the first time, Hong Kong Financial Secretary  John Tsang  said.  Ten billion yuan of the bonds issued this month will be
sold to institutional investors, with the rest going to foreign
central banks and monetary authorities, China’s Finance Ministry
said. The bonds being sold in the second half will go to
institutional and retail investors, it said.  The move announced today marks the fifth consecutive year
that China’s Finance Ministry will sell yuan-denominated
sovereign bonds in Hong Kong, Tsang said, according to a
statement released by his office.  “This demonstrates clearly the Central Government’s
determination to make the issuance of RMB sovereign bonds to be
a long-term institutional arrangement in Hong Kong,” Tsang
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
