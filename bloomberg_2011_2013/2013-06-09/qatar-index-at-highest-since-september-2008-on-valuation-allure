Qatar’s benchmark stock  index  soared
to the highest in more than four years on investor optimism the
shares are catching up with its Gulf Cooperation Council peers
as valuations are seen as increasingly attractive.  Barwa Real Estate Co., Qatar’s biggest publicly traded
property developer by assets, climbed the most in 18 months. Oil
and gas services company Gulf International Services QSC snapped
a five-day losing streak and gained the most since May 30.
Qatar’s QE  Index (DFMGI)  advanced 0.5 percent to 9,335.21, the highest
close since September 2008.  Shares on Qatar’s benchmark trade at an  average  price-to-book value of 1.67 times, compared with 1.99 for  Saudi Arabia ’s
gauge. The  index (SASEIDX)  trades at less than 12 times earnings and at
“a very strong” dividend yield of 5 percent, according to
Bobby Sarkar, head of research at Qatar National Bank
Financial Services.  “It’s a fundamentally attractive market in terms of
valuation, and it has been one of the laggers in the GCC and is
now catching up,” Sarkar said. “And you have some impact from
the MSCI upgrade announcement that’s going to happen on the 11th
of this month.”  Potential Upgrade  Qatar and the  United Arab Emirates  are under consideration
for a possible reclassification at  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  from their
frontier-market rankings for the fifth year.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
said Qatar could be upgraded, a move that could see more than
$430 million flowing into the country.  The measure has rallied 12 percent this year, trailing a 50
percent gain for Dubai’s benchmark DFM General  Index. (SECTMIND)   Qatar, where most companies limit overseas holdings to 25
percent, said on June 5 it’s making “extensive efforts” to
raise foreign ownership limits of companies on its bourse, ahead
of the MSCI’s decision on upgrading the nation to emerging
market status. MSCI said last year the caps needed revising.  Shares in Barwa rose 5.2 percent, the biggest gain since
December 2011, and were the most active on Qatar’s gauge with
about 6.9 million shares traded. The company said on June 6 it
was selling assets valued at 26 billion riyals ($7.1 billion) to
shareholder Qatar Diar Real Estate Investment Co.  Gulf International Services increased 2.8 percent, the
biggest jump since May 30, after the company said its unit won
contracts valued at 1.7 billion riyals.  Elsewhere in the  Middle East , Oman’s MSM30  Index (TA-25)  added 0.8
percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share  Index (MSM30)  was little
changed at the close in  Riyadh . Dubai’s gauge lost 0.9 percent,
and  Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General  Index (ADSMI)  declined 0.3 percent.
Bahrain’s  gauge  slid 0.5 percent, and Kuwait’s SE Weighted Index
dropped 1.7 percent, trimming this year’s rally to 10 percent.  Egypt’s EGX 30 fell 2.9 percent, its sixth day of losses.
Israel’s TA-25 Index rose 0.6 percent. The yield on the nation’s
benchmark 4.25 percent bonds maturing in March 2023 increased
four basis points, or 0.04 of a percentage point, to 3.78
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
