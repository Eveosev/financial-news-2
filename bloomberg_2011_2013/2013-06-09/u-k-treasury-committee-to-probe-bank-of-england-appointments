The U.K. Parliament’s Treasury
Committee will investigate the  Bank of England ’s appointment
process and the independence of the Bank’s Financial Policy
Committee.  The committee on June 5 expressed reservations about the
appointment of Clara Furse, the former chief executive officer
of the  London Stock Exchange (LSE) , to the FPC. it questioned her
“awareness of the importance of asserting the independence” of
the body.  The inquiry will look at the different rules governing the
appointment and behavior of members of the FPC, the Monetary
Policy Committee and the Court of the Bank of England. In a
statement, the committee raised “serious inconsistencies and
complexities in the structure of accountability of the Bank of
England.”  “The FPC is still finding its feet,”  Andrew Tyrie ,
chairman of the Treasury Committee, said in a statement. “It is
crucial that its independence is safeguarded from the start. It
is therefore particularly important that the appointment process
and early exchanges between the Treasury and the FPC don’t give
the appearance that it has been compromised.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
