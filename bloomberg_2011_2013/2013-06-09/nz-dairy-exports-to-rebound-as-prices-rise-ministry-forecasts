New Zealand  dairy exports will
rebound in the coming year as production picks up and prices
rise, the Ministry for Primary Industries said.  Dairy export revenues will grow 8.1 percent to NZ$13.9
billion ($11 billion) in the year through June 2014 after
dropping 5.5 percent in the previous 12-month period, the
ministry said in its semi-annual forecasts published in
Wellington today.  The forecast gain “is due to high dairy prices and an
increase in production more than offsetting the expected high
exchange rate,” the ministry said. “Looking further out to the
year ending 30 June 2017, export revenue is forecast to reach
NZ$17.7 billion as a result of an expected rise in domestic
production, increasing international dairy prices and a
depreciating  New Zealand dollar .”  New Zealand is the world’s biggest exporter of dairy
products. Sales were hit by the higher  exchange rate  and a
summer drought which will curb milk production by 1.2 percent in
the current year, the ministry said. Milk output is forecast to
rise 4.5 percent in 2013-14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
