China ’s industrial output rose 9.2
percent in May from a year earlier and retail sales gained 12.9
percent, the National Bureau of Statistics said on its website
today.  Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households in the
first five months of the year increased 20.4 percent, the
Beijing-based agency said.  The gain in industrial production compared with the 9.4
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 39
economists and a 9.3 percent increase in April. Retail sales
matched the median projection and compared with a 12.8 percent
increase the previous month.  The median estimate for fixed-asset investment was a 20.5
percent increase after a 20.6 percent gain in the first four
months.  Data released earlier today showed consumer prices rose 2.1
percent in May from a year earlier, easing from a 2.4 percent
pace in April and below the government’s 2013 target of 3.5
percent for a fifth month. Producer-prices fell by a more-than-estimated 2.9 percent, the 15th straight monthly decline.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
