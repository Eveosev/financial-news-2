China ’s passenger-vehicle sales rose
at a slower pace in May as  consumer confidence  waned amid signs
that momentum for economic growth is slowing.  Wholesale deliveries of cars, multipurpose and sport
utility vehicles increased 9 percent to 1.4 million units in
May, according to the state-backed China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers yesterday. That compares with growth of
13 percent in April and 13.3 percent in March.  The slowing auto-sales growth follows data showing average
inventory levels at dealerships rose in April. Government
reports yesterday showed trade, inflation and lending in May all
trailed estimates, signaling weaker domestic demand that adds
pressure on Premier  Li Keqiang  to shore up economic growth.  “Strong inventory building in the first four months of
2013 and a softer GDP in 2Q13 lead us to expect gradually slower
sales growth for the rest of the year,” Ole Hui, a Hong Kong-based analyst with  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , wrote in a
research note on June 6.  Total sales of  vehicles , including buses and trucks, gained
9.8 percent to 1.76 million units last month, the association
said. Growth in motor vehicle output slowed to 15.7 percent
year-on-year in May from 18.3 percent in April, National Bureau
of Statistics data released yesterday showed.  Vehicle sales for the first half are expected to be between
10 million and 11 million units, CAAM Secretary General Dong
Yang said at a briefing yesterday. He said there’s no
overcapacity in China’s  auto industry .  Three Decades  “In the past three decades every time we thought there was
overcapacity in the auto industry, we were proved wrong,” Dong
said.  The sales data came on the same day that the National
Bureau of Statistics released data showing that industrial
production rose a less-than-forecast 9.2 percent from a year
earlier and factory-gate prices fell for a 15th month.  Sales of SUVs, the fastest-growing segment last year, rose
40.9 percent to 227,900 units while demand for multipurpose
vehicles rose 1.1 times to 84,600 units. Sedan deliveries gained
5.28 percent to 940,500 vehicles.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Lavida was the best-selling sedan last
month, while  Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) ’s Haval remained the nation’s
top-selling SUV.  Honda sales rose 4.6 percent in May, Nissan’s increased 2
percent, according to the companies. Toyota deliveries gained
0.4 percent for the first monthly sales increase in China since
January.  GM (GM) , the biggest foreign automaker in the world’s second-biggest economy, posted a 9.4 percent increase in China
deliveries last month to 252,942 units, led by demand for Buick
cars. At  Ford Motor Co. (F) , sales climbed 45 percent to 70,540
units in May.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
