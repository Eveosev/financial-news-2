(Corrects first paragraph of story published June 9 to
clarify that $500 million will be the company’s total investment
in  India .)  Hassad Food Co ., the agricultural
investment arm of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, will invest up
to $500 million in India.  The investment will be in the production of rice, coffee,
cardamom and “ready-made foods,” Chairman Nasser Mohamed Al
Hajri told reporters today in Doha. Hassad said on April 3 that
it agreed to buy a majority stake in Bush Foods Overseas Ltd.,
which owns basmati rice brands Neesa, Himalayan Crown and Indian
Star.  Hassad is seeking to secure supplies for Qatar through
buying agricultural land and investing in food-production
companies abroad. The company has focused on ventures in Asia
and  Africa  and owns sheep farms in Australia. Qatar, the richest
country in the world per capita, imports most of its food.  Hassad’s future focus will be on  North America ,  South
America  and Europe, Al Hajri said. “There will be something
invested in Canada for grain production,” he said, adding that
he hopes for an investment this year or early next.  Hassad also seeks to invest in a sugar venture in Latin
America this year after studying Brazilian sugar producers over
the past two or three years, he said. The company is also
interested in South America for grains, red meat and poultry.  Hassad’s global investments total $1 billion, Al Hajri
said. The company produces 100,000 sheep, 150,000 tons of grain
and 260,000 tons of rice a year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
