Defending champion  Rafael Nadal  took
the first set of his French Open final with fellow Spaniard
 David Ferrer .  Nadal won the set 6-3.  The pair each comfortably held their service games to
start, but in the third game, Nadal won the first of his two
break points when Ferrer hit a forehand wide. Ferrer broke right
back, taking his second break point during a 20-shot rally that
ended when Nadal hit a backhand into the net.  Serving at 3-3, Ferrer got back two break points, but then
gave Nadal another that the defending champion took with a
forehand passing shot. Nadal held and then broke to take the
set.  Nadal is going for his 12th Grand Slam championship. He is
four months into a comeback to the menâ€™s tour following a long
injury break. After a shock second round loss at Wimbledon, the
27- year-old left-hander was sidelined with a partially torn
patella tendon and inflammation in his left knee that forced him
to miss the London Olympics, the U.S. Open and the Australian
Open.  Should he win, Nadal will have eight singles titles in
Paris, surpassing seven other men who have won seven major
championships at one event. These include  Roger Federer  and  Pete
Sampras  at Wimbledon in the last two decades, Bill Tilden at
what was then called the U.S. Championships in the 1920s and
 William Renshaw  at Wimbledon in in the 1880s. Retired American
Chris Evert and Nadal are the only players to hold seven Roland
Garros championships.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
