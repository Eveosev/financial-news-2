Proposed tax increases and spending
cuts will slow Israel’s economic growth next year, and further
tax rises might be necessary beginning in 2015 if output doesn’t
pick up significantly, the  Bank of Israel  said today.  The reduced spending and higher taxes will moderate growth
by 0.7 percentage point in 2014, the central bank predicted in
an e-mailed statement. Unless growth is “especially” rapid,
taxes will have to be raised further to meet budget deficit
targets in 2015 and 2016, the report said.  The Organisation for  Economic Development  forecast last
month that Israeli growth, excluding new gas output, would slow
to 2.7 percent in 2014 on fiscal tightening.  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Cabinet voted last
month to reduce planned spending and raise taxes to meet deficit
targets of 4.65 percent of gross domestic product this year and
3 percent in 2014. Finance Minister Yair Lapid said May 7 on his
Facebook page that within two years, the economy will improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
