Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
popularity dropped for the first time since she took office in
January 2011 on economic growth and inflation concerns,
according to a Datafolha survey.  The president’s support is at 57 percent, eight percentage
points less than in March, according to the survey published by
Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Support fell among men and women
of all social classes in all regions. Datafolha polled 3,758
people in 180 municipalities between June 6 and June 7.  Inflation in May accelerated to 6.50 percent, matching the
upper limit of the central bank’s target range, according to a
June 7  report  by the national statistics agency.  Standard &
Poor’s  on June 6 lowered its outlook on  Brazil ’s BBB rating to
negative from stable on concern over sluggish growth and
weakening fiscal accounts. The central bank in April raised the
benchmark  interest rate  for the first time since July 2011 in an
attempt to fight rising prices.  Even with the drop in her popularity, 51 percent of those
surveyed said they’d vote for her if she runs for a second term
next year, the poll found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
