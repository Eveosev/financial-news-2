Rafael Nadal  beat  David Ferrer  in the
French Open final to become the first man in tennis history to
win the same Grand Slam event eight times.  Nadal defeated his friend and fellow Spaniard 6-3, 6-2, 6-3
on a cold, rainy day on the main Court Philippe Chatrier at
Roland Garros in Paris. The second set was interrupted twice by
protestors at the main court. The players stopped when people
seated high in the stands started chanting, and then a man with
a flare attempted to get onto court. Security was able to tackle
him and drag him away before he could reach Nadal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
