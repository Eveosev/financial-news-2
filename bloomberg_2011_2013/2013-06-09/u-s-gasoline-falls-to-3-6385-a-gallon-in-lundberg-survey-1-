The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 1.81 cents in the past three weeks
to $3.6385 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended June 7 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in
the period ended Feb. 22, is about 1.4 cents above the year-earlier price of $3.62 a gallon.  “Regions continue to sort out their refinery issues and
refinery comebacks,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg
Survey, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “Generally,
prices continued to edge up in the Midwest and certain other
parts of the country, and declined dramatically in the West and
to a lesser degree in the  Gulf Coast .”  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in  Chicago , where the average
rose 23.71 cents in the past three weeks to $4.48 a gallon,
Lundberg said.  Drivers there may get some price relief as refineries
return from maintenance, Lundberg said.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is
returning to normal at its 238,000-barrel-a-day refinery in
Joliet,  Illinois , company spokeswoman Tricia Simpson said by e-mail yesterday. The refinery had shut all its operating units
during the maintenance, which began April 14.  Retail Margins  Nationally, drivers may see prices rise a few cents as
retailers try to build back their margins, Lundberg said. Retail
stations were making about 11 cents a gallon during the period
covered by this survey, compared to 14 cents to 18 cents in the
spring.  The lowest price in the U.S. was in Jackson, Mississippi,
where customers paid an average of $3.20 a gallon. Regular
gasoline averaged $3.73 a gallon on  Long Island ,  New York , and
$3.94 in  Los Angeles .  Gasoline futures  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell
3.54 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.8715 a gallon in the three
weeks ended June 7.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  declined 366,000 barrels in the
week ended May 31 to 218.8 million, according to data from the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  Crude Prices  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex rose 1 cent to
$96.03 a barrel in the three weeks to June 7. Prices have
advanced 11 percent since April 17, when they reached $86.68,
the lowest settlement of the year.  Crude  inventories  fell 6.27 million barrels to 391.3
barrels in the week ended May 31.  Refinery inputs  and  production
of gasoline  in May jumped to the highest levels this year.  West Texas Intermediate crude may decline this week amid
weak demand for gasoline, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Fourteen of 34 analysts, or 41 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through June 14. Twelve respondents, or 35 percent,
predicted an increase. Eight projected no change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
