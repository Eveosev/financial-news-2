Patrick Kane  scored three goals,
including the winner in double overtime, as the  Chicago
Blackhawks  defeated the Los Angeles Kings 4-3 to advance to the
National Hockey League’s Stanley Cup Final.  The Blackhawks, who won the Western Conference championship
best-of-seven series four games to one, will host the Boston
Bruins in the first game of the championship series on June 12.
The Bruins swept the Pittsburgh Penguins for the Eastern
Conference title.  Duncan Keith scored three minutes, 42 seconds into the
first period and Kane tallied his first goal two minutes later
to give Chicago a 2-0 lead last night on home ice at United
Center.  Dwight King’s goal in the second period and  Anze Kopitar ’s
score at the top of the third period tied the game at 2-2. Kane
scored his second goal with four minutes left in the game and
 Mike Richards  countered with a tying score with 10 seconds left
to play to force an overtime.  Kane fired a 24-foot wristshot 11 minutes, 40 seconds into
the second overtime period for the win.  The Blackhawks, with the best regular-season record, will
host games one, two, five and seven in the best-of-seven
championship series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
