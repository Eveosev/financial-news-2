The Miami Marlins needed 20 innings
to defeat the  New York  Mets 2-1 on the same day the Toronto Blue
Jays went 18 innings to top the Texas Rangers 4-3 in Major
League Baseball.  The Marlins-Mets contest was six innings shy of the record-holding Brooklyn Dodgers-Boston Red Sox game, which was played
to a 1-1 tie until it was called for darkness after 26 innings
on May 1, 1920, said the Baseball Almanac.  The extra-inning games yesterday follow a 16-inning 7-5
victory by the Chicago White Sox against the Seattle Mariners on
June 5.  The Marlins-Mets game was the longest in innings since
April 17, 2010, when the Mets defeated St. Louis 2-1 in 20
innings, according to the Baseball Almanac.  Adeiny Hechavarria hit a run-scoring single to score
Placido Polanco in the 20th for the win at Citi Field.  Juan Lagares doubled in the second inning to score Ike Davis as the Mets, whose games were postponed by rain the
previous two days, took a 1-0 lead.  Chris Coghlan’s sacrifice
fly sent home Derek Dietrich in the fourth to tie the game at
1-1.  Matt Harvey started the game for the Mets, giving up one
run on six hits and striking out six in seven innings before he
had to leave in the eighth with tightness in his lower back.
Shaun Marcum (0-7) got the loss after surrendering one run on
five hits and striking out seven in eight innings.  Kevin Slowey (2-5) allowed eight hits and struck out eight
in seven innings for the win. Steve Cishek pitched a perfect
20th for his sixth save to end the game that went six hours, 25
minutes.  At Rogers Centre in Toronto, Rajai Davis hit a single to
left to score Emilio Bonifacio and end an 18-inning game that
lasted five hours, 28 minutes.  Toronto’s Colby Ramus tripled to score Edwin Encarnacion
and Adam Lind and then went home on a throwing error by second
baseman Jurickson Profar in the third inning.  Jeff Baker hit a solo home run in the seventh for  Texas ,
which tied the game with two runs in the ninth on A.J.
