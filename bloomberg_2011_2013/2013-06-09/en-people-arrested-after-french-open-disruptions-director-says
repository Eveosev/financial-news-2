Ten people were arrested at the
French Open for disrupting the men’s tennis final, tournament
director Gilbert Ysern said in an interview.  Protesters had twice interrupted the men’s final between
 Rafael Nadal  and  David Ferrer  on the main Court Philippe
Chatrier. One man carrying a flare came within a few meters of
Nadal before being apprehended by security guards. Other
protesters shouted and held a banner saying in English, ‘Help
France tramples on children’s rights.’’ At the same time, there
were also protests by the Court Suzanne Lenglen, where
protesters held a banner calling for the resignation of French
president  Francois Hollande .  “It probably required a good coordination beforehand on
their part,” said Ysern.  Although the French Open men’s final was also disrupted by
a protester in 2009, when a man entered the main court trying to
put a hat on eventual champion  Roger Federer ’s head, Ysern
praised his security staff for “controling the situation.” He
added the event would not be reviewing its security procedures.  “The players never felt at risk, and it was handled
perfectly well which makes us more comfortable to a certain
extent,” Ysern said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
