One man was killed in a clash near
the Iranian embassy in  Beirut  between supporters and opponents
of Hezbollah, the Shiite guerrilla group backing Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad against rebels.  The man died after sustaining gunshot wounds, the Lebanese
army said in a statement. The man was identified by Lebanese
media as Hashem Salman and was among a group protesting the
involvement of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Syria’s war.  Sectarian tension has soared in Lebanon this year after
Hezbollah joined forces with Assad, an Iranian ally, raising
concern that the country would be dragged deeper into the civil
war ravaging its larger neighbor. Rockets slammed into
Hezbollah’s stronghold in a southern suburb of Beirut last
month, injuring four people.  Sporadic violence between supporters and opponents of Assad
in Lebanon may evolve into a civil war as early as next year,
according to research firm IHS. The country, which has a long
history of sectarian violence, suffered a 15-year civil war that
ended in 1990.  Syria ’s war has killed more than 80,000 people since it
began in 2011, Vuk Jeremic, president of the UN General
Assembly, said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
