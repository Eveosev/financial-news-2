Ocean Thermal Energy Plc, a renewable
energy company that can produce power from the sea, plans to
raise as much as 8 million pounds ($12.4 million) by selling
shares on  London ’s Alternative Investment Market.  Cairn Financial Advisers LLP is advising Ocean Thermal
Energy on the deal, and its broker is Bayley, Rogers & Co. Ltd.,
the London-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. It
didn’t say when it plans the sale.  The company says its technology exploits the temperature
differential between the sea surface and the ocean depths to
generate power. It also can make energy-saving air conditioning
systems that use seawater for cooling, cutting electricity use
by as much as 90 percent, the company said.  Ocean Thermal Energy said it is working on seawater cooling
projects in the  U.S. Virgin Islands  and the  Cayman Islands , and
has signed a memorandum of understanding with Bahamas
Electricity Corp. to provide power from two 10-megawatt plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
