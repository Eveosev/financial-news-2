Harris English captured his first
U.S. PGA Tour title at golf’s FedEx St. Jude Classic with a two-shot victory over  Phil Mickelson  and Scott Stallings.  English, 23, shot a 1-under-par 69 during yesterday’s final
round at TPC Southwind in Memphis, Tennessee, to finish with a
four-round total of 12-under 268. Mickelson birdied the final
hole to get to 10 under, while Stallings finished his round with
a bogey on the 18th hole.  English received $1.01 million for the victory. It was the
final PGA Tour event before the U.S. Open, which is scheduled
for June 13-16 at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania.  Mickelson played tournaments the week before all four of
his major championship wins and said he’s encouraged heading to
Merion coming off a 28th career PGA Tour runner-up finish.  “My iron play was wonderful this week,” Mickelson said
yesterday in Memphis. “I was really pleased with that. My short
game got better as the week wore on.”  Mickelson is tied as the oddsmakers’ fifth favorite to win
the U.S. Open, according to the Las Vegas Hotel’s Super Book.
Tiger Woods is the favorite at 5-1, followed by Rory McIlroy,
 Adam Scott  and  Matt Kuchar  at 20-1, while Mickelson,  Lee
Westwood ,  Brandt Snedeker  and Justin Rose are listed at 25-1.  The U.S. Golf Association said yesterday that tickets for
the U.S. Open have sold out for the 27th straight year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
