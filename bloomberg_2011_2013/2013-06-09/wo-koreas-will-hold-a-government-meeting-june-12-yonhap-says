North and  South Korea  agreed to minister-level negotiations this week to discuss reopening a joint industrial park as both sides seek limited rapprochement following heightened rhetoric over the North’s nuclear program.  South Korea will send Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl Jae to the June 12-13 talks in Seoul, the ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. The agenda will focus on reopening the Gaeseong factory shut in April as well as resuming tourism at a North Korean luxury resort, according to the statement.  Delegates from both sides met yesterday at the Panmunjom border village to lay the groundwork for the first ministerial talks since November 2007. The meeting offered evidence Kim Jong Un’s regime is looking to ease tensions heightened by its threats of preemptive nuclear strikes after the  United Nations  tightened sanctions for its rocket launch and atomic bomb test.  “It heralds a start to the efforts to restore the inter-Korean relationship,” said Koh Yu Hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at  Dongguk University  in Seoul. “The issues at stake are too many and complicated to tackle at once. They should start with easier agreements such as Gaeseong rather than the thorny nuclear program.”  The agreement followed a meeting in  California  between U.S. President  Barack Obama  and Chinese President Xi Jinping, head of  North Korea ’s closest ally. The two leaders found “quite a bit of alignment” on stopping North Korea’s nuclear program, White House national security adviser Tom Donilon said.  ‘Clear Message’  “China has taken a number of steps in recent months to send a clear message to North Korea, including through enhanced enforcement of sanctions and through public statements by the senior leadership in China,” Donilon said at a weekend press conference in  Palm Springs , California.  Reopening Gaeseong and the Mount Geumgang luxury resort, which was closed in 2008 after North Korean soldiers killed a South Korean guest, would provide much-needed sources of hard currency to Kim’s impoverished state.  China , North Korea’s biggest benefactor, has pushed the totalitarian state to resume nuclear disarmament talks.  In a June 6 speech, South Korean President Park Geun Hye called on Kim’s regime to abandon its isolationist path, work to build trust with the South and become a “responsible member” of the international community.  North Korea suspended operations at Gaeseong April 8, a month after threatening nuclear strikes in response to the heightened sanctions and U.S.-South Korea military drills. The complex, about 10 kilometers (six miles) north of the demilitarized zone between the two countries, employed more than 53,000 North Koreans working for 123 South Korean companies.  Chinese Entreaties  The factory park has produced more than $2 billion of goods since opening in 2005, according to Unification Ministry data. North Korea generates $100 million in annual profits at Gaeseong, while South Korea makes quadruple that amount, according to Yang Moo Jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.  Thought to be around 30, Kim became head of the country upon his father  Kim Jong Il ’s death in December 2011. The younger Kim has so far resisted Chinese entreaties to resume nuclear disarmament talks while replacing some of his military advisers as he works to ensure control over the totalitarian state.  “North Korea is forced to come to the negotiation table as China is increasingly distancing itself from Pyongyang,” said Lee Jung Hoon, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul. “Kim Jong Un must regret closing Gaeseong, as he is in desperate need of money to keep control of his military and party leaders.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Saeromi Shin in  Seoul  at  sshin15@bloomberg.net ; Eunkyung Seo in Seoul at  eseo3@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Rosalind Mathieson at  rmathieson3@bloomberg.net
