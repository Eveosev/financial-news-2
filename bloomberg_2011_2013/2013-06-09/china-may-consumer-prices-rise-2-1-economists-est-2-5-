China ’s consumer prices rose 2.1
percent in May from a year earlier while the producer-price
index dropped 2.9 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics
said today in Beijing.  Consumer inflation compares with the 2.5 percent median
estimate of 39 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News and a 2.4
percent pace in April. The median projection for factory-gate
prices was for a decline of 2.5 percent.  Policy makers are seeking to keep the inflation rate within
about 3.5 percent this year, down from a 4 percent goal last
year. Price gains have been below target this year as food-price
gains moderated.  Producer prices have now dropped for 15 months in a row,
the longest stretch of declines since 2001-2002, reflecting
overcapacity in industries including steel and cement and softer
domestic demand.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
