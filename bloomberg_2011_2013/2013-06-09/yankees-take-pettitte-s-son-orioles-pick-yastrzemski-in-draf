The  New York Yankees  picked the son of pitcher  Andy Pettitte  and the nephew of former outfielder  Paul O’Neill  in Major League Baseball’s draft, which concluded over the weekend with 1,216 players selected.  Josh Pettitte, a high school pitcher from Deer Park, Texas, who hurled two no-hitters during his senior season, was selected in the 37th round by the Yankees.  “It’s a great honor and blessing getting the call from the team that you’ve grown up watching,” said Pettitte, who was one of 657 pitchers taken in the three-day draft.  The  Houston Astros  started the draft on June 6 by selecting Stanford University right-hander Mark Appel at No. 1, while later rounds were highlighted by family ties in the sport.  University of Michigan outfielder  Michael O’Neill , whose uncle played with the Yankees from 1993 through 2001, was drafted by the team in the third round.  In the 14th round, the Baltimore Orioles took outfielder Mike Yastrzemski. The 22-year-old grandson of Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski was drafted in the 30th round by the  Seattle Mariners  a year ago and passed up a $300,000 signing bonus to return to Vanderbilt University for his senior season. He hit .322 in 64 games for the Commodores with three home runs, 43 runs batted in and 19 stolen bases.  Ben Verlander, the younger brother of Detroit Tigers pitcher  Justin Verlander , was drafted in the 14th round by the Tigers. The team also took Torii Hunter Jr., a center fielder from Prosper High School in Prosper, Texas, and the son of outfielder Torii Hunter, in the 36th round.  Verlander, a junior outfielder from Old Dominion University, hit a team-leading .367 with 11 home runs and 37 runs batted in during 53 games this season.  Biggio’s Son  Cavan Biggio, a second baseman from St. Thomas High School in Houston and the son of former Houston Astros second baseman Craig Biggio, went in the 29th round to the Philadelphia Phillies. In the 35th round, the Astros picked right-hander Kacy Clemens of Memorial High School in Houston, the son of former pitcher  Roger Clemens  who played for the team from 2004 to 2006.  Cody Young, a first baseman from Virginia Commonwealth University and the nephew of Hall of Famer Robin Yount of the Milwaukee Brewers, was drafted by the  Chicago White Sox  in the 37th round.
