Britain’s membership of the European
Union is good for business and allows the government to help set
rules on trade and tax, Prime Minister  David Cameron  will tell
business leaders today.  “The fact is that it is in international institutions that
many of the rules of the game are set on trade, tax and
regulation,” he will say in Essex, east of  London , according to
his office. “When a country like ours is affected profoundly by
those rules, I want us to have a say on them. This is about
boldly pursuing our interests -- not by withdrawing from the
world but engaging with it.”  Conservative lawmakers made history last month by voting en
masse against their own government’s legislative program, in
protest at the lack of an immediate provision for a referendum
on EU membership. Earlier in the year, so-called Euroskeptics
forced Cameron to promise he would hold a referendum by 2017 if
he won re-election in 2015.  Tory lawmaker Andrew Bridgen yesterday went on the record
as having called for Cameron to quit as party leader. A total of
46 such letters need to be signed by lawmakers to trigger a
confidence vote in the prime minister.  In his speech today, Cameron will take up his theme that
his job is to equip the U.K. for a “global race.” He’ll point
to policies such as cutting  corporation tax  to the lowest in the
G-20.  Next week, the U.K. will host the Group of Eight summit.
There the prime minister has made reducing corporate  tax evasion 
one of the items on the agenda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
