Spanish bond risk is heading for
its biggest monthly decline before Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
approves a budget that will cut the deficit by at least 18
billion euros ($23.2 billion) next year.  Credit-default swaps on  Spain  fell nine basis points to 393
at 11:30 a.m. in  London  and are down from 518 basis points Aug.
31. The contracts, which peaked at 640 basis points July 24, are
also heading for a record quarterly decline.  Rajoy is defying anti-austerity protesters and dissent from
regional leaders as he struggles to convince investors he can
contain the crisis and avoid asking for a full bailout. The
rally in Spanish borrowing and bond insurance costs was fueled
by the  European Central Bank ’s bond purchase program announced
Sept. 6.  “The ECB meeting to support the  bond market  and
refinancing needs of the Spanish government has driven reduction
in credit risk,” said Alessandro Giansanti, an analyst at ING
Groep NV in Amsterdam. “I expect volatility will continue until
Spain asks for support.”  The 24 percent decline in the cost of Spanish swaps so far
this month is the most since January 2011, when the contracts
dropped 29 percent to 101 basis points. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The cost of insuring Italian debt is also heading for
record monthly and quarterly declines. The contracts fell six
basis points today to 364, compared with 467 Aug. 31 and 488
June 29.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 14 governments fell one basis point today to
147.  Corporate and financial swaps benchmarks are heading for a
fourth monthly decline. Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover
Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings
dropped 13 basis points to 567 and are down from 591 Aug. 31.
The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings fell 3.5 basis points to 137 and is down from 149
last month.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell six basis points to 203 and the
subordinated index declined 8.5 basis points to 343.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
