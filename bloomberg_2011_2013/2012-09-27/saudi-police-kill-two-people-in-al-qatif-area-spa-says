Saudi Arabia ’s security forces
killed two people, one of them wanted by the police, and injured
another two during clashes in al-Qatif area of the kingdom’s
oil-rich eastern province, the state-run Saudi Press Agency
reported, citing a statement by the  Interior Ministry .  Security forces opened fire after the gunmen fired first,
according to the  statement . A man was also arrested during the
clashes. The ministry called on other wanted men to surrender
themselves. Security forces arrested a man on their most-wanted
list earlier this month in al-Qatif, SPA reported on Sept. 3.  While Sunni Muslim-majority Saudi Arabia largely escaped
the unrest that spread across the Arab world in 2011, minority
Shiite protesters have clashed this year with security forces in
eastern towns including Awwamiya and al-Qatif. In July, security
forces arrested dissident Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr in the al-
Qatif area.  Saudi Arabia, holder of the world’s largest oil reserves,
bases its fiscal budget on a price of $95 a barrel, said
Mohammad Al-Sabban, an independent energy analyst who was a
senior economic adviser at the Ministry of Petroleum and
Minerals before retiring this year.  Oil prices  probably won’t move much as a result of the
killings and arrest, Emad Mostaque, a U.K-based analyst at
Religare Noah, wrote in an e-mailed note today. Crude oil rose
0.4 percent to $90.35 a barrel at 10:08 a.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporters on this story:
