Libya ’s Prime Minister-elect
Mustafa Abushagur vowed to meet an Oct. 8 deadline to form a
Cabinet after being threatened with dismissal, his office said.  “The reason for the delay is simple,” said Mohamad al-
Akari, a spokesman for Abushagur. “We have still not received
the names from the Mahmoud Jibril’s National Force Alliance
coalition party to include in the government list.”  Abushagur, who was elected by the General National Congress
on Sept. 12, was expected to present his government list to the
National Assembly for approval by Sept. 26 but asked for an
extension. He will be dismissed if he fails to meet the
deadline, a spokesman for the congress, Omar Homaidan, said by
telephone.  “It seems they are delaying on purpose,” said al-Akari.
“We have always made it clear that we want to form a government
that reflects all political parties in Libya for the sake of
national unity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
