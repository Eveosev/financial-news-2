U.S.  mortgage rates  declined to
record lows as the  Federal Reserve  pushed down borrowing costs
by resuming purchases of mortgage-backed securities.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan fell to 3.4
percent in the week ended today from 3.49 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a statement. It was the
lowest in data going back to 1971. The average 15-year rate
dropped to 2.73 percent, also a record, from 2.77 percent.  The housing market has been showing signs of recovering as
low  interest rates  draw in buyers who are competing for a
limited supply of homes. Rates declined after the Fed’s Sept. 13
announcement that it would buy $40 billion of securities per
month as part of measures to stimulate the economy.  “We’ve already seen low mortgage rates even before the Fed
action,” said  Anika Khan , a senior economist with  Wells Fargo &
Co . in Charlotte,  North Carolina . “We’ll continue to see
mortgage rates come down. That means affordability will continue
to be high.”  Demand for homes remains choppy, with  contracts  to buy
previously owned properties falling 2.6 percent in August after
a revised 2.6 percent gain in July that was more than initially
reported, the National Association of Realtors said today.  Purchases of new U.S. homes fell 0.3 percent to a 373,000
annual pace in August, following a revised 374,000 rate in July
that was the strongest since April 2010, figures from the
Commerce Department showed yesterday.  Home prices  in 20 U.S.
cities climbed more than forecast in July from a year earlier,
according to an S&P/Case-Shiller report.  Bond Yields  While borrowing costs are falling, they could be even
lower. Since the Fed’s announcement, the rates offered for new
30-year  loans  have fallen by 0.19 percentage point, compared
with a drop of about 0.6 percentage point for yields on the
 bonds  into which the loans get packaged, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and Bankrate.com.  The  gap  between the two, which typically signals increasing
lender revenue when it widens, reached a record of more than 1.7
percentage point yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
