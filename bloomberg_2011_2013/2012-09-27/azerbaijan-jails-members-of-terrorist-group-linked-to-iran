An Azeri court imprisoned members
of an Iran-linked group that plotted to kill the head of a
Jewish school in the capital, Baku.  The Baku Serious Crimes Court gave Rasim Aliyev, Ali
Huseynov and Rauf Abilov, all three Azeri nationals, prison
sentences ranging from eight years to 14 years, court official
Amar Hasanov said by phone. The verdicts can be appealed.  The trial was held behind closed doors and Hasanov didn’t
provide the name of the men’s defense lawyer.  The group, which received weapons and money from  Iran ,
could not carry out the plan as its members were arrested by
Azeri security services, Hasanov said.  The energy-rich Caspian nation’s ties to  Israel  and the
U.S. have caused tension with Iran. Azerbaijan said in March it
arrested members of an armed group that collected intelligence
about foreign embassies and companies, including  BP Plc (BP/) , for
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps, or Sepah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
