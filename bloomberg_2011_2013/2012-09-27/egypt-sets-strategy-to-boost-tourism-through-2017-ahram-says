Egyptâ€™s government has approved a
plan that aims to increase tourist arrivals to 30 million by
2017, the state-run al-Ahram reported today.  The plan targets 11.6 million tourists and $11 billion in
revenue from the industry by 2013, a return to 2010 levels
before the uprising that ousted former President  Hosni Mubarak 
and deterred many visitors, the newspaper said. The country aims
to boost revenue to $25 billion by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
