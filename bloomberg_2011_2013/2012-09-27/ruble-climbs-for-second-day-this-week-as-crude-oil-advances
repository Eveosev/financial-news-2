The ruble climbed the most in
almost two weeks as companies bought the currency for tax
payments and crude advanced, boosting the outlook for the
world’s biggest energy exporter.  The ruble added 0.9 percent to 31.0850 versus the dollar by
the close in Moscow. That pared yesterday’s 1.3 percent drop,
the biggest in two months. The currency was up 0.7 percent
against the euro at 39.9700 and increased 0.8 percent against
the central bank’s euro-dollar basket. Non-deliverable forwards
showed the ruble at 31.5870 per dollar in three months.  Crude in  New York  gained 1.3 percent to $91.15 a barrel.
Oil and natural gas contribute about 50 percent of  Russia ’s
government revenue. Russian companies are due to pay about 180
billion rubles ($5.8 billion) in profit tax tomorrow, Alexei Egorov, an analyst with Moscow-based OAO Nomos Bank, said by e-
mail.  “Rising oil and growth in demand for ruble liquidity ahead
of the profit tax payment helped ruble appreciation,” Egorov
said.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points to 214,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex rose
five basis points to 7.621 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
