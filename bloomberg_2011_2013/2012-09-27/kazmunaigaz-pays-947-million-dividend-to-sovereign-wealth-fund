KazMunaiGaz National Co.,
 Kazakhstan ’s state energy producer, paid 142 billion tenge ($947
million) in 2011 dividends to the sovereign wealth fund Samruk-
Kazyna, its owner.  KazMunaiGaz paid 293.35 tenge a share on Sept. 14, the
Astana-based oil and gas producer said today in a  statement  on
the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange website. The company’s 484 million
ordinary shares are all held by Samruk-Kazyna, according to the
bourse’s  website .  In March, KazMunaiGaz said it would raise $2.5 billion
selling bonds to the National Oil Fund in 2013, removing the
need to borrow abroad this year. The company has about $3.1
billion of  debt  coming due by the end of next year, out of a
total of $15 billion outstanding, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Last year,  net income  rose 38 percent to 422.5
billion tenge.  KazMunaiGaz plans to increase investments 7 percent to $3.8
billion this year, followed by $2.3 billion in 2013, according
to Raiffeisen Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
