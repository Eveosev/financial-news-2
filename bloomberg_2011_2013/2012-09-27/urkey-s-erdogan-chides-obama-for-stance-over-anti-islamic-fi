Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  criticized U.S. President  Barack Obama  for saying an
anti-Islamic film that caused outrage in the Muslim world fell
under the protection of freedom of speech.  Erdogan, in an interview with Kanal 7 television late
yesterday, said he had discussed the film with Obama and was
“saddened” by the president’s remarks. A Turkish court has
banned Internet access to the film, which depicts the Prophet
Muhammad as a womanizer and has sparked violent protests from
the Middle East to Southeast Asia, Erdogan said.  Erdogan condemned the killing of the U.S. ambassador to
Libya during a violent protest against the film.  Obama, addressing the  United Nations General Assembly  on
Sept. 25, spoke against a ban on the video because it would
violate the right to free speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
