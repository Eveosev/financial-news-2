David Wright  got his 1,419th career
hit to set a franchise record in the  New York Mets ’ 6-0 win
against the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Wright, 29, came into last night’s game at Citi Field in
New York tied with Ed Kranepool for the most hits in Mets
history. Wright ended the game with 1,420 hits after going 2-
for-4.  “Eddie came and saw me before the game, wished me luck and
just kind of reiterated that he’s happy for me and excited for
me,” Wright said. “That meant a lot to me.”  Wright set the mark in his 1,256th game. He has played nine
seasons with the Mets, who are fourth in the five-team  National
League East , 23 games behind the Major League Baseball-leading
Washington Nationals.  “It’s a testament to what a really, really good player he
is,” Mets manager Terry Collins told reporters. “It’s a
testament to his work ethic. Even last year, he was never
satisfied, always wanted to get better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
