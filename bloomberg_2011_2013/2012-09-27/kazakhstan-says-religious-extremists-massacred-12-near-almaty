Kazakhstan blamed religious
extremists for killing 12 people, whose bodies were found in a
mountainous area of the Almaty region last month.  All members of the group suspected of carrying out the
crime have been identified, the  Interior Ministry  said in a
statement e-mailed today. Kazakh authorities found the corpses
in the Ile-Alatausky national park in the country’s southeast.  President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  said in July that the
population of Kazakhstan, a predominantly Muslim former Soviet
republic that borders Russia and China, is growing “angry” at
law-enforcement officials for failing to keep extremists in
check.  To contact the reporter on this story:
