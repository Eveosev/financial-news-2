U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, today said NATO-led forces have resumed joint training
and operations with Afghan forces.  General John Allen, commander of NATO’s  International
Security Assistance Force , had suspended some joint operations
with Afghan forces on Sept. 18, after a rise in the number of
so-called insider attacks on U.S. and allied troops by their
Afghan counterparts.  “I can now report to you that most ISAF units have
returned to their normal partnered operations at all levels,”
Panetta said at a Pentagon news conference today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
