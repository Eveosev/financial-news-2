Itron Inc. (ITRI) , a smart-meter provider,
and Manas Energy Management Inc. said they were awarded a supply
and installation contract with a regional water utility in
 Turkey  to help cut costs and reduce water loss.  Kocaeli Water and Sewage Administration, or ISU, purchased
commercial and industrial water meters for an undisclosed price
that will help the utility reduce non-revenue water, or clean,
treated water that’s lost during distribution, the Liberty Lake,
Washington-based company said today in a statement.  Installation is under way by Manas, with the system for
ISU’s top 1,000 commercial and industrial water consumers to be
fully operational by May, said Itron, whose technology will
monitor account usage in real time to capture “anomalies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
