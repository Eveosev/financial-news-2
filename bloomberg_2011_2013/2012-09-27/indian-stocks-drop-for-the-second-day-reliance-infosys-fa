Indian (SENSEX)  stocks dropped for a second
day amid concern the rally after the recent government measures
to boost growth had made equities expensive.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid 0.3 percent
to 18,579.50 at the close. The gauge has risen 6.6 percent this
month, the most since June. The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index lost 0.3
percent to 5,645.05, changing directions at least 10 times amid
expiry of the monthly Nifty derivatives series. The Nifty rose
to a 14-month high on Sept. 21.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s largest
refining complex, and  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the second-largest software
services provider, dropped at least 1.5 percent each.  Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. (LT)  and  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the biggest household
products maker, climbed at least 2 percent each.  “There’s been some consolidation, some fatigue setting in
at higher levels as this series has been pretty strong,” Parag
Doctor, a technical analyst at Keynote Capitals Ltd. in Mumbai,
told Bloomberg TV India today.  The Sensex has risen 3.1 percent since Sept. 13, driving
valuations to a six-month high, after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  ended a freeze on  diesel prices  and opened retailing and
aviation sectors to foreigners the next day, the biggest policy
push of his second term in office.  ‘Moved Swiftly’  “The signaling effect that we are ready for reforms has
happened but to really get the wheels of the investment cycle
moving more needs to be done,” Hiren Ved, chief investment
officer at Alchemy Investment Management Ltd., told Bloomberg TV
India today. “It’s been a great relief that after a long time
the government has moved, and moved swiftly.”  A withholding tax on overseas company debt was lowered on
Sept. 21 and mutual funds were added in a plan meant to attract
retail investors to stocks. The government approved on Sept. 24
a plan to recast short-term loans held by state-owned utilities
to help them meet power-supply commitments and reduce debts.  The Sensex has advanced 20 percent this year and trades at
14.7 times estimated  earnings . The ratio is still less than the
gauge’s three-year average multiple of 16.3, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Offshore investors bought shares worth $3.3 billion so far
this month, the highest inflow since February, amid a burst of
policy announcements aimed at reviving an economy growing at
near its slowest pace in three years. They bought a net $851
million of shares on Sept. 25, raising stock investments this
year to $15.6 billion, according to data from the regulator.  ‘Big Bang’  “Big bang announcements by the government have increased
the interest of foreign investors; this was something they have
been waiting to hear for a long time,”  Gajendra Nagpal , chief
executive officer at Unicon Financial Intermediaries, said by
phone from  New Delhi . “The underlying tone remains bullish if
you go by the amount of money that has come in. Foreign funds’
interest is not going to dilute in a hurry.”  The rupee advanced 0.9 percent to 53.0263 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
53.0050 earlier, the strongest level since May 10, and has
gained 4.8 percent in September.  The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. and the BSE Ltd.
traded 1.26 billion shares yesterday, 41 percent more than the
12-month daily average.  Reliance retreated 1.8 percent to 829.85 rupees. Infosys
slid 1.5 percent to 2,549.35 rupees.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) ,
the largest explorer, lost 2.3 percent to 275.2 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro added 2.3 percent to 1,598.15 rupees,
ending a three-day fall.  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) , the biggest private
generator, rose 1.7 percent to 104.55 rupees. Hindustan Unilever
gained 2.1 percent to 537.75 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
