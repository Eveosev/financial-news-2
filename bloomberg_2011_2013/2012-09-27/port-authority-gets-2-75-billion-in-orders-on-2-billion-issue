Banks managing a $2 billion bond
sale for the  Port Authority  of New York and New Jersey, the
biggest issue in its history, took about $2.75 billion in orders
for the 50-year debt, according to the  Royal Bank of Canada .  RBC, which coordinated the underwriting of the taxable
bonds, set the yield at 4.46 percent, or 1.65 percentage point
over 30-year Treasuries, said Jaime Durando, head of RBC’s
municipal-bond syndicate desk, in a telephone interview.  Before the pricing, the Port Authority said the bonds might
offer a yield spread of 1.6 percentage points to 1.8 percentage
points above 30-year U.S. government bonds.  The Port Authority runs the New York City region’s three
major airports and six marine-cargo terminals. It is also
redeveloping the  World Trade Center site  in Lower Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
