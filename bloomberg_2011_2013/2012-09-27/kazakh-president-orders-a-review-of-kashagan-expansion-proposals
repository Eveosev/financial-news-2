Kazakhstan ’s President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  ordered a review of plans to expand the  Kashagan 
oilfield after venture partners including  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sought to extend a production deal.  Nazarbayev discussed oil and gas development in the country
at a meeting today in Astana with officials including his Chief
of Staff Karim Massimov and Prime Minister Serik Akhmetov,
according to a  statement  published on his website.  Umirzak Shukeev, head of the sovereign wealth fund, Sauat Mynbayev, the oil and gas minister, Lyazzat Kiinov, KazMunaiGaz
National Co.’s chief, and Timur Kulibayev, chairman of the
nation’s biggest business group Atameken, also attended.  Exxon and Shell are seeking to extend a production-sharing
contract at the Kashagan project in the  Caspian Sea  for 20
years, two people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to
be identified as the talks are confidential, said last month.  The $46 billion development, touted as the world’s biggest
discovery in four decades when found, is due to reach commercial
oil output no later than June 2013. Nazarbayev also ordered a
study into building a gas refinery and pipeline from the
Karachaganak field to central Kazakhstan and crude shipment from
 Russia  to the Pavlodar refinery, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
