Giants Stadium LLC is seeking
documents from defunct Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in an
effort to prove claims it filed against the former investment
bank relating to swaps on a $700 million financing of the New
Meadowlands stadium.  Lehman is seeking to “harrass” the Giants with supoenas
and may be getting ready to dispute the claims, a lawyer for the
Giants said in a federal court filing in Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
