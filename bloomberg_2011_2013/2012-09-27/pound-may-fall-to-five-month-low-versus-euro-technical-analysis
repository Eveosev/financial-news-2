The pound may weaken more than 4
percent to a five-month low against the euro should it drop
below a key support level, Credit Suisse Group AG said, citing
trading patterns.  The U.K. currency has failed to rise beyond its 55-day
moving average, currently at 79.10 pence per euro, meaning it is
now poised to fall toward support at 79.88 pence, which
represents the so-called neckline of a head and shoulders
pattern, analysts including Cilline Bain in  London , wrote in a
note to clients. A drop below that level would open the way for
a decline to as low as 82.63 pence, according to the analysts.  “A break out of the current range will act as a catalyst
for the market,” London-based Bain said in a telephone
interview confirming the contents of the research note. “This
is the beginning of the next phase.”  The pound advanced 0.4 percent to 79.34 pence per euro at
3:19 p.m. London time after appreciating to 79.24 pence today,
still 0.2 percent weaker than its 55-day moving average.  The target of 82.63 pence represents a 38.2 percent
retracement of the pound’s advance from a high of 90.84 pence in
July 2011 to a low of 77.55 pence on July 23, Bain said,
referring to so-called Fibonacci analysis. The last time
sterling traded at 82.63 pence was April 17.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance or below support indicates a currency may
move to the next level. Resistance is where sell orders may be
clustered. Support is where there may be orders to buy.  A head and shoulders is formed when a currency makes three
consecutive peaks, with the middle being the highest. A neckline
is a support level drawn across the base of the three peaks.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
