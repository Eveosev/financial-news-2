The  Bank of England  said Markets
Director  Paul Fisher  stated that the central bank forecasts
inflation to stay around 2 percent for the next two to three
years, correcting comments reported by the Sun newspaper.  “We are very seldom going to be actually at 2 percent,
we’ll always be a bit away and trying to bring it back,” the
London-based central bank cited Fisher as saying in an interview
with the newspaper published today. “So our forecast has
inflation within this sort of range -- either a bit above or a
bit below -- for the next two or three years.”  The Bank of England issued a correction to Fisher’s
reported remarks on inflation in an e-mailed statement.  “Inflation has come down from 5.2 percent to 2.5
percent,” Fisher also told the Sun, according to the article
published today in the paper copy. “We expected it to be a bit
lower by now, but there’s been a bit of stickiness in world
energy prices,” the newspaper cited him as saying.  The policy maker added that the U.K.’s third-quarter gross
domestic product number will be “very strong,” the Sun
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
