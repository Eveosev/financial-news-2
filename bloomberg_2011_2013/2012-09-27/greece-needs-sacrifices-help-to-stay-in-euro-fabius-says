Greece requires a mix of deficit
cuts and help from other euro zone members to remain a member of
the single currency, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said
today in an interview with  Charlie Rose  on PBS.  “Provided that they make sacrifices and that we give them

euro member. “But the answer is ‘Yes.‘ We need the integrity of
the euro zone.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
