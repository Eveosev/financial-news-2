H.B. Fuller Co. (FUL) , a U.S.
manufacturer of adhesives, dropped the most in a year after the
company lowered its outlook for 2012 sales.  The shares  fell  9.5 percent to $30.22 in New York, the
biggest drop since Sept. 22, 2011.  The company, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, reported third-
quarter results after the close of regular trading yesterday. It
reduced its  outlook  for 2012 revenue to $1.875 billion to $1.9
billion from a June 25 forecast of $1.925 billion to $1.975
billion.  The cut reflects a slowdown in global industrial adhesive
markets, Michael Sison, a Cleveland-based analyst for KeyBanc
Capital Markets, said in a note yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
