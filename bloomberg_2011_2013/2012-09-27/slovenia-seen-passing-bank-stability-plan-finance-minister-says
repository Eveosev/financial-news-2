Slovenian lawmakers will probably
adopt legislation to stabilize the euro region nation’s banking
industry as it struggles with a surge in bad loans, Finance
Minister Janez Sustersic said.  “I expect the legislation to be adopted and I think it’s
urgent we do so,” Sustersic told reporters in Ljubljana today.
A possible delay in adopting the plan “would be time lost,”
Sustersic said today at the Finance Committee meeting in
parliament in the capital Ljubljana, according to state-owned
STA newswire.  Central bank Governor Marko Kranjec said at the same
meeting that Slovenia shouldn’t rush with the legislation to
create a so called bad bank, STA reported. Lawmakers will vote
on the recapitalization plan tomorrow, part of an overhaul
effort the government of Prime Minister  Janez Jansa  is working
on to avoid seeking an international bailout package.  The government will guarantee as much as 4 billion euros
($5.2 billion) for the agency that will manage lenders’ bad
assets and inject as much as 1 billion euros into ailing banks
like Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and  Nova Kreditna Banka (KBMR)  Maribor
d.d., Sustersic has said.  Bad loans at Slovenian banks amount to 6 billion euros,
Sustersic said today, according to STA newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
