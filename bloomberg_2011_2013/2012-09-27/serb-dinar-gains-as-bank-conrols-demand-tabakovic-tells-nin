Serbia’s dinar has strengthened
because the National Bank of Serbia is controlling liquidity and
foreign currency demand, the Belgrade weekly magazine NIN
reported, citing central bank governor Jorgovanka Tabakovic.  The current value of the dinar of 115 to the euro is
“realistic” while the dinar was “unstable” earlier this year
because “some” market participants were “artificially”
creating liquidity and taking profit, the magazine quoted
Tabakovic as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
