Belarus may bring its refinancing
rate, the world’s highest, to its lowest level since April 2011
by the end of next year as inflation slows, according to
monetary-policy  guidelines  for 2013 approved by the government.  Subduing price growth and rebuilding gold and foreign-
currency reserves will be the country’s main policy goals next
year, the central bank, based in the capital, Minsk, said on its
website today. The benchmark  rate  may be cut to between 13
percent and 15 percent, down from 30 percent as of Sept. 12,
according to the regulator.  Belarus wants to increase its international reserves by
$300 million to $700 million by the end of next year after
meeting foreign debt payments, running a  trade surplus  and
attracting $4.5 billion of foreign direct investment, according
to the guidelines. The nation’s holdings, which shrank to as low
as $3.59 billion last year, were at  $8.14 billion  on Sept. 1.  The former Soviet republic began to lower borrowing costs
in February, cutting the benchmark rate eight times after
raising it by a cumulative 34.5 percentage points last year to
arrest capital outflows during a balance-of-payments crisis.
Belarusian  inflation  slowed for a seventh month in August,
decelerating to 55.6 percent from a year earlier after peaking
in 2012 at 109.7 percent in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
