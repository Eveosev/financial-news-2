SG-SSB Ltd., a Ghanaian unit of
Societe Generale SA, gained the most in 10 months as investors
anticipate increased profit in the nine months ending this
month.  Shares climbed 10 percent to 44 pesewas at the close in
Accra, the biggest gain since November.  “The company is projected to record favorable third-
quarter growth,” Hilary Lomotey, a stock broker with
Renaissance Capital’s Accra unit, said by phone today. It may
see a “growth of between 25 percent and 30 percent,” he said,
“driven mainly by loans and commission on advances.”  First-half profit rose 14 percent to 12.2 million cedis
($6.4 million), the Accra-based company said July 27.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
