Treasuries declined, snapping their
longest rally in almost four years, as risk appetite increased
with  Spain ’s cabinet approving a budget it said would ease the
nation’s debt crisis.  Bonds pared losses earlier as reports showed U.S. household
spending slowed. Yields on U.S. longer-term securities rose as
speculation the Chinese government will do more to support its
economy damped demand for the safest assets. The U.S. will
auction $29 billion of seven-year debt today, the last of three
note sales this week totaling $99 billion.  “There’s been some positive news out of Europe,” said Dan Mulholland, head of U.S. Treasury trading in the capital-markets
unit of BNY Mellon Corp. in  New York . “They are likely not out
of the woods. The auction should go fine in light of the
uncertainty surrounding  Europe .”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 11:55 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent
note due in August 2022 declined 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 29/32. Yields fell to 1.61 percent yesterday, the
lowest since Sept. 7.  Thirty-year bond  yields increased three basis points to
2.81 percent after falling yesterday to 2.78 percent, also the
lowest level since Sept. 7.  Treasury Auction  The seven-year notes being sold today yielded 1.05 percent
in pre-auction trading, compared with 1.081 percent at the
previous sale of the debt on Aug. 30. Investors  bid  for 2.80
times the amount offered last month, up from 2.64 times in July.  The U.S. sold $35 billion in five year notes yesterday at a
yield of 0.647 percent, and auctioned an equal amount in two-
year notes the previous day at a yield of 0.273 percent.  “We’ll see decent demand,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia, which oversees $12 billion in fixed income assets.
“We have a bit of a concession built in right now.”  Treasuries gained for an eighth day yesterday, the longest
stretch since December 2008, as investors seeking a refuge from
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis bolstered demand for the safest
securities. Protesters in Spain and Greece criticizing budget
cuts clashed with police this week.  Spain’s 2013 budget is designed to end the nation’s debt
crisis, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz said.  Spanish bonds advanced today even after demonstrators
called on Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  to reverse austerity
measures. The yield on Spain’s 10-year note dropped 12 basis
points to 5.95 percent, according to Bloomberg data.  U.S. Reports  U.S. stocks gained, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rising 0.5 percent in its first advance in six days.  Treasuries trimmed losses after the Commerce Department
said U.S. household purchases, which account for about 70
percent of the economy, grew 1.5 percent in the second quarter,
versus a previously reported 1.7 percent. An index of pending
home resales unexpectedly fell 2.6 percent after a revised 2.6
percent gain in July, figures from the National Association of
Realtors showed today in  Washington . A Bloomberg News survey
forecast a 0.3 percent gain.  “It’s just a little bit of unwinding of the fears
yesterday,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in New
York at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “The worry was that there wouldn’t be
a bailout for Spain and the unrest would force the government to
not make austerity.”  Risky Tactic  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles
Plosser  said “the economy is not doing well.” Plosser said in
an interview today on Bloomberg Television with  Tom Keene  that
tying policy to a specific  unemployment rate  is risky. The U.S.
jobless rate has been more than 8 percent since February 2009.  The central bank announced on Sept. 13 plans to buy $40
billion of mortgage securities a month in a third round of its
quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.  A measure of relative yields on mortgage securities that
guide U.S. home-loan rates was near a record low amid bets the
Fed will find a shortage of the bonds as it expands purchases. A
Bloomberg index of yields on Fannie Mae-guaranteed mortgage
bonds trading closest to face value was 59 basis points higher
than an average of five- and 10-year Treasury rates. The record,
55 basis points, was reached Sept. 25.  Less Expensive  Treasuries dropped from the most expensive level in two
months. The 10-year term premium, a model created by economists
at the Fed that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth
and inflation, was at negative 0.93 percent. It reached negative
0.97 percent yesterday, the most costly since July 25. A
negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value. The 2012 average is
negative 0.74 percent.  Treasuries have returned 0.7 percent since the end of June,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. U.K. gilts
handed investors a 1.5 percent gain in the period, and German
bunds rose 1.2 percent.  The gap in yield between 10-year notes and similar-maturity
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, known as the break-even
rate, was at 2.45 percentage points after touching 2.73
percentage points on Sept. 17, the most since May 2006. It has
averaged 2.22 percentage points this year.  The five-year, five -year forward  break-even rate , a
measure of the inflation outlook the Fed uses to help guide
monetary policy, was 2.7 percent on Sept. 24, down from a 13-
month high of 2.88 percent on Sept. 14. The 10-year average is
2.75 percent.  Fed Sale  The Fed is swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings
with those due in six to 30 years to support the economy by
putting downward pressure on borrowing costs. The central bank
sold $7.8 billion today of debt maturing from September 2015 to
November 2015 as part of the program, according to the Fed Bank
of New York’s  website .  Treasury yields rose earlier as the Shanghai Securities
News said there was speculation the  China  Securities Regulatory
Commission will announce 10 market-boosting measures at a press
conference today.  China’s central bank added a net 365 billion  yuan  ($57.9
billion) to the financial system this week, the most according
to data compiled by Bloomberg starting in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
