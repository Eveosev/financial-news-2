Customs at Moscow Sheremetyevo
airport detained a Russian citizen bringing 30 iPhone 5s from
 Germany  in his carry-on luggage, the Federal Customs Service
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The handsets were sent to an appraiser to ascertain their
value, the Customs Service said. According to Russian
legislation, individuals importing goods worth more than 10,000
euros ($12,870) have to pay as much as 30 percent duty,
according to the statement.  Sales of  Apple Inc.â€™s (AAPL)  new phone started in the U.S.,
Germany and seven other countries on Sept. 21. In  Russia , where
official sales of the iPhone 5 may begin in December, devices
acquired abroad were offered for as much as $3,700. Current
prices in the gray market have fallen to about  $2,050  for a
model with 64 gigabytes of storage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
