Teknosa Ic & Dis Ticaret AS (TKNSA) ,
 Turkey ’s biggest electronic goods retailer, is in talks with
potential acquisition targets in the country and signed a
cooperation agreement today with Dutch retailer Euronics
International to benefit from cheaper product procurement.  Teknosa, which runs 280 stores in its home country, is
looking at acquisition targets through its adviser HSBC Holding
Plc’s local investment banking and brokerage unit as
consolidation is “inevitable in the Turkish market,” Chief
Executive Officer Mehmet Nane said in an interview today.  The Turkish company is now a partner in the “cooperative-
like structure” of Euronics with powers to vote on that
company’s board decisions, Nane said. Euronics operates 11,000
outlets in 31 countries. Istanbul-based Teknosa will be able to
buy products from producers at cheaper rates through Euronics’
wider purchasing system, Nane said.  Teknosa, which went public in May after owner  Haci Omer
Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL)  sold a 11.5 percent stake, will lower the
prices of its products after the Euronics accord, Nane said.
Teknosa maintains its guidance of more than 20 percent sales
growth to more than 2 billion liras ($1.1 billion) this year, he
said. Teknosa aims for sales in a range of 2.05 billion liras to
2.15 billion liras, Nane said Aug. 1.  Teknosa fell 1.1 percent to 7.5 liras in Istanbul trading,
the lowest level since Aug. 16.  Euronics will increase sales to 17 billion euros ($21.9
billion) this year from 16.2 billion euros in 2011 after the
Teknosa agreement, Chairman Hans Carpels said at a news
conference in Istanbul today, adding that the company aims for
20 billion euros of sales in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
