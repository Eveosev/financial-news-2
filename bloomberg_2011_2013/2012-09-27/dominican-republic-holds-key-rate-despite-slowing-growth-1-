The  Dominican Republic ’s central
bank held the  benchmark interest rate  unchanged for the first
time since June as policy makers bet that inflation will remain
under control next year.  The bank kept the overnight rate at 5 percent, citing no
foreseeable inflationary pressures through next year and a
moderate economic growth forecast in the U.S. Policy makers in
the Caribbean’s biggest economy had cut the rate 175 basis
points, or 1.75 percentage points, since May, including a 50
basis point reduction in August.  “Production and internal demand remain below their long-
term trend, while market interest rates are beginning to be
reduced,” the bank said in today’s statement.  The Dominican Republic’s $57 billion economy should grow 4
percent this year after  expanding  3.8 percent in the first half
from a year ago, the central bank said. That was down from a
June 29 forecast of 4 percent to 4.5 percent.  The island nation’s fiscal position deteriorated in the
first half of the year due to higher expenditures and a public
sector deficit that expanded to 3.3 percent of gross domestic
product, according to a statement earlier this month from the
 International Monetary Fund .  “The short-term macroeconomic outlook poses a challenge to
the authorities, reflecting the need to strengthen the domestic
macroeconomic framework, in particular to significantly tighten
the fiscal position, and to cope with risks emanating from the
global economy,” the IMF said in a Sept. 19 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
