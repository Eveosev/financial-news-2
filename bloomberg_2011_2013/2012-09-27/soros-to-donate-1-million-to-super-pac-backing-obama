Investor  George Soros , a long-time
donor to Democratic candidates and causes, has agreed to
contribute $1 million to the super-political action committee
run by former aides to President Barack Obama.  Two officials of Priorities USA Action, the super-PAC
supporting Obama’s bid for re-election, confirmed the donation
today. A Soros spokesman,  Michael Vachon , did not immediately
respond to requests for comment.  Priorities USA Action reported raising $10.1 million in
August, the first month it surpassed Restore Our Future, a
super-PAC backing Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  that brought
in $7 million.  Soros’ $1 million donation to Priorities USA Action will be
his third seven-figure contribution this year.  In May, he said he would give $1 million apiece to American
Bridge 21st Century and $1 million to America Votes. American
Bridge is a research group that targets Republican candidates,
and America Votes is a coalition that includes unions,
environmentalists and women’s groups.  In 2004, Soros contributed $23.7 million to pro-Democratic
groups and political organizations, more than any other donor,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-
based research group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
