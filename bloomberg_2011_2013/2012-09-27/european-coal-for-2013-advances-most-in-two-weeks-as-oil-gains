European coal for delivery next
year increased the most in almost two weeks as crude gained.  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp added as much as 0.6 percent to $97.60 a metric ton
as of 3:51 p.m. in  London , according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the steepest gain since Sept. 14.  Brent oil for November settlement rose as much as $2.32, or
2.1 percent, to $112.36 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Bloomberg tracks information supplied by ICAP Plc, GFI
