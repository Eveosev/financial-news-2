Nordic power for 2013 will probably
fall 5 percent and may drop 13 percent in the coming months if
carbon-emission and coal prices continue to slide, said Antti
Kouvo, a portfolio manager at Energiakolmio Oy.  Electricity for next-year delivery in the Nordic region
traded at 36.95 euros ($47.60) a megawatt-hour, down 0.1
percent, at 2:43 p.m. on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange
in Oslo. European Union carbon permits for December delivery
fell 0.1 percent to 7.62 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures
Europe Exchange in  London . Coal for delivery next year into
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $97.60 a ton, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Power for 2013 could drop as low as 32 euros, assuming
that CO2 prices drop to 5 euros a ton and coal prices fall to
$90 a ton,” Kouvo said today in an interview in Helsinki. A
more likely price for the power contract is 35 euros, he said.  Economic stimulus from the Chinese government in the coming
six months may lift coal prices to a range of $100 to $110 a
ton, translating into a Nordic power price of 37 to 44 euros for
2014, Kouvo said. A recovery in  Europe ’s economy in a year or
longer may provide a further boost, he said.  “Assuming that the EU steps up its targets for emissions
cuts, combined with Chinese economic growth, Nordic power for
2015 could cost 43 to 50 euros,” Kouvo said. That forecast is
based on a coal price of $120 a ton, a carbon permit price of 12
euros, and an euro exchange rate of $1.35, he said.  Energiakolmio specializes in power portfolio management and
energy services for business customers. The company manages an
aggregate portfolio of 13 terawatt-hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
