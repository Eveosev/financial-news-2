Mexico ’s peso advanced, following
most major currencies higher, as a decline in Chinese industrial
profits fueled bets the country’s policy makers will act to
stimulate growth, bolstering the global economy.  The peso strengthened 0.3 percent to 12.8267 per dollar at
4 p.m. in Mexico City.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits fell 6.2 percent in
August from a year earlier,  China ’s statistics bureau said.
China may further cut banks’ reserve requirements or  interest
rates  if external demand worsens, Chen Yulu, academic adviser to
the People’s Bank of China, told reporters in Beijing.  The peso is getting support from “greater appetite for
risk generated by the expectation of a possible announcement on
greater stimulus to growth in China,” Grupo Financiero Banorte
SAB analyst Juan Carlos Alderete said in an e-mailed research
note today.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose one basis
point to 5.38 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price fell 0.09 centavo to 141.29 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
