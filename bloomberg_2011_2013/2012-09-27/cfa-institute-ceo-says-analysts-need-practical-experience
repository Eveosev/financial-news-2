Chartered Financial Analysts would
benefit more from experience working with clients rather than a
broader training program,  CFA Institute  Chief Executive Officer
 John Rogers  said.  “There’s only so much we can teach,” Rogers said today in
a speech for the Economic Club of  Canada  in Toronto. “No one
would claim that having technical expertise is enough to qualify
you to be a professional, in any practice.”  Rogers said analysts need to work with clients in addition
to going through about 1,200 hours of training to gain the
Chartered Financial Analyst designation. He said the CFA
Institute’s curriculum is “constantly evolving.”  More than 17,000 people registered with the CFA Institute
in Canada this fiscal year, Rogers said. Canada has the world’s
third-highest membership for the institute, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
