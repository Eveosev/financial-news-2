Bridas Corp., the  oil company  owned
by  China National Offshore Oil Corp. (883)  and the billionaire
Bulgheroni family, completed the purchase of  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s
Campana refinery in Argentina and filling stations in South
America.  Bridas’s subsidiary, Axion Energy, will control the assets
acquired from Exxon, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The gasoline stations are in Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay. No dollar amount was given for the deal announced in
March 2011.  Bridas will invest $800 million in the next three years to
increase gasoline production at the Campana refinery by 50
percent to 650,000 cubic meters a year and diesel production by
60 percent to 1.2 million of cubic meters a year, Mario
Calafell, a Bulgheroni family spokesman, said in telephone
interview from  Buenos Aires  today.  Calafell declined to comment on an Ambito Financiero
newspaper report that said the deal was worth $600 million.  Exxon Mobil didn’t respond to a telephone message to its
media line about the sale.  Bridas said it will continue using the Esso brand at its
filling stations and will be the exclusive distributor of Mobil
lubricants.  Bridas is owned in equal parts by Cnooc, China’s largest
offshore explorer, and the billionaire Bulgheroni family’s
Bridas Energy Holdings. Bridas also owns a 40 percent stake at
at  BP Plc (BP/) ’s controlled Pan American Energy LLC, Argentina’s
second-largest oil producer and the main supplier of crude to
Campana, located in Buenos Aires province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
