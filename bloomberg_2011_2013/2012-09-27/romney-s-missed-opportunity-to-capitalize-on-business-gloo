Earlier this week,  a  survey  of 800 small businesses and manufacturers conducted by Public Opinion Research painted a pretty bleak picture of the prospects for hiring and expansion. Here are the highlights: Glen Bolger and Bill McInturff, partners at POS, conducted the survey between Aug. 13 and Sept. 4 for the  National Federation of Independent Business  and  National Association of Manufacturers . The findings merely quantify what small business has been saying all along. The gloom and doom isn't limited to small-fry. Yesterday, the Business Roundtable reported that its  CEO Economic Outlook Survey  plunged to 66 in the third quarter, the lowest in three years and a huge drop from 89.1 in the second quarter. The survey asks chief executives of the nation's largest companies about their expectations for sales,  capital spending  and hiring over the next six months. "Uncertainty" is a big issue for both large and small companies. (My two cents is that "uncertainty" has become a euphemism for pessimism.) And who can blame them? Just thinking about four more years like the last four is enough to get anyone down. This is an issue on which Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  could capitalize. He understands business. He's lived it. He's acquired companies, dressed them down, dressed them up and resold them at a profit. Obama says he wants to help the middle class. But if small and big businesses aren't investing, expanding and hiring, you have to wonder about the source of that help. ( Caroline Baum  is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  her on Twitter.)
