The  European Central Bank ’s chief
legal counsel told a European court that officials need more
time to respond to an investor lawsuit because of management
upheavals and crisis-related work, according to a letter
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The Frankfurt-based central bank’s Executive Board faces
“unprecedented reorganization,” ECB Director General of Legal
Services Antonio Sainz de Vicuna wrote in the letter dated July
11. Also, its legal resources “are being put through severe
test as a result of the dramatic worsening of the sovereign debt
crisis and of tensions on international markets, with direct
implications for the ordinary functions of the ECB.”  The ECB is being sued by more than 200 Italian retail
investors who claim it’s unfair the central bank avoided losses
on Greek debt that private sector bondholders had to endure in a
restructuring earlier this year.  De Vicuna’s plea to the Luxembourg-based European Union
General Court underscores the strain on the ECB’s legal services
as the crisis imposes unprecedented demands on the central bank.
The remarks also cite the fallout from an overhaul of President
 Mario Draghi ’s Executive Board over the past year. More may be
imminent as Luxembourg’s Yves Mersch awaits the outcome of
wrangling with European lawmakers on his board appointment.  The letter shows “that the ECB and its legal department
are completely overwhelmed,” said Professor  Charlotte 
Gaitanides, a lawyer and head of European Studies at the
University of Flensburg in  Germany . “If they can’t cope now,
what is it going to be like once the ECB is put in charge of the
banking union?”  Greek Losses  In De Vicuna’s letter to  Emmanuel Coulon , registrar of the
EU’s second-highest court, he asked for a four-month reprieve to
respond to a lawsuit from Italian retail investors. They
complain that a principle of equal treatment was breached by the
ECB’s avoidance of losses on 45 billion-euro ($58 billion) in
Greek government debt holdings, while other bondholders endured
writedowns in the biggest debt restructuring in history.  An ECB spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the
letter. She said the central bank fully respects judicial
independence and refrains from commenting on any cases to which
it is a party.  The lawsuit against the ECB may not succeed as it can be
hard to prove damages caused to individual investors, said
Hubert de Vauplane, a partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel
LLP in Paris. It could still encourage large financial
institutions to pursue their own actions against the ECB, he
said.  First Claim  “This is the first claim of this kind and opens the doors
for other investors,” de Vauplane said in an interview. “Asset
managers and banks have been asking law firms if there are ways
to sue European Union authorities over the debt swap.”  That would add to the burden on ECB lawyers who de Vicuna
says are already stretched. He cited workload connected to the
ECB’s involvement in supervising bailed-out euro area nations
“where significant legislative measures need to be prepared,
monitored and assessed,” as well as measures to enhance the
euro area’s financial stability.  De Vicuna said the ECB’s input into EU President  Herman Van Rompuy ’s initiative to enhance European economic and monetary
union is also taking up resources. An interim report is required
next month and a final one before the end of 2012, he said.  Legal Load  Further work accumulating for the central bank’s lawyers
includes determining and drafting its potential role in the
supervision of  Europe ’s banks. Staff are now also tasked with
examining whether the ECB’s new unlimited government bond
purchasing program violates EU treaties, Germany’s Bild Zeitung
reported Sept. 25.  De Vicuna’s plea also cites changes in the ECB’s six-member
Executive Board in the past year, during which time Draghi was
appointed along with three other officials. A fifth post has
been vacant since May and the appointment of Mersch, the
Luxembourg central bank governor, to that job is being held up
by a European Parliament protest over the lack of top female
officials at the bank.  Joerg Asmussen has been the board member in charge of legal
services since he joined in January after Lorenzo Bini Smaghi
left. He also manages the ECB’s role in so-called Troika
missions to bailed-out nations with the European Commission and
the  International Monetary Fund .  Mersch Portfolio  Draghi will have the option to transfer the legal portfolio
to Mersch, a lawyer by training, which would be the second
management change for that division in less than a year.  “Recently appointed members of the Executive Board need
enough time to form their own opinions about the most
appropriate reaction by the ECB to the arguments of the
applicant, in consideration of past and future policies”
relevant to the dispute, de Vicuna wrote.  Flensburg University’s Gaitanides suggested that the strain
on ECB lawyers might harm the functioning of the institution at
a crucial time.  “One could argue that the legal department is merely part
of the ECB’s administrative framework that should just serve the
central bank’s economic objectives,” she said. “However, if it
doesn’t function properly that has far wider ramifications.”  The case is: T-224/12, Accorinti and Others v. ECB.  To contact the reporters on this story:
