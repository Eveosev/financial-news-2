A  Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  unit was sued by
a trustee for mortgage-bond investors over $183 million in
defective loans backing the securities.  DB Structured Products breached promises about the quality
of the loans that were pooled and packaged into securities,
trustee HSBC Bank said in a filing today in  New York  State
Supreme Court in Manhattan.  A review of loans indicate problems “may be pervasive and
systemic across the loan portfolio,” HSBC said. The bank seeks
an order requiring DB Structured Products to repurchase loans,
according to the filing.  Duncan King , a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank,
said the bank was reviewing the filing and declined to comment.  The case is Ace Securities Corp. Home Equity Loan Trust,
Series 2006-HE4 v. DB Structured Products Inc., 653394-2012, New
York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
