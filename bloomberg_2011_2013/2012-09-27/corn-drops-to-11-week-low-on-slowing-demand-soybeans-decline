Corn futures tumbled to an 11-week
low on signs of slowing demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter. Soybeans also declined.  Export sales of corn in the week ended Sept. 20 plunged to
368 metric tons from 69,578 tons a week earlier, U.S. Department
of Agriculture  data  show. That’s the lowest for that time of
year since at least 1990. Total sales for delivery before Aug.
31 are down 36 percent from a year earlier. Prices have fallen
16 percent since reaching a record in August, when hot, dry
weather damaged the U.S. crop.  “Corn-export demand is nonexistent, and prices are
adjusting lower,” Chad Henderson, the president of Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in
a telephone interview. “Livestock producers and ethanol plants
are waiting for lower prices before increasing purchases.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 1.2 percent to
settle at $7.1625 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after touching $7.115, the lowest for a most-active
contract since July 12. Still, prices are up 13 percent this
quarter after the most-severe Midwest drought in at least 50
years sent the grain to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10.  Soybean futures for November delivery slipped 0.1 percent
to $15.7075 a bushel in Chicago, after reaching $15.575, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Aug. 8. The oilseed is
headed for the fourth straight quarterly gain and reached a
record $17.89 on Sept. 4.  Speculation that August rains boosted yields in the Midwest
helped send soybeans lower today, Henderson said.  Brazil ,
 Argentina  and Uruguay got as much as three times the normal
precipitation in the past two weeks, improving conditions for
planting and early growth, he said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
