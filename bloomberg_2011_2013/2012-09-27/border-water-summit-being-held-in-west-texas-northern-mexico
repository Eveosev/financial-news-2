A two-day border summit on water
management, demand challenges and scarcity issues opens today in
the northern Mexico city of Juarez, and wraps up tomorrow across
the  Rio Grande  in the west Texas town of El Paso.  Mayors from both border cities, U.S. and Mexican consuls
and an El Paso Water Utilities executive are among the speakers.
Juarez’s water and sanitation board, the  University of Texas  at
El Paso, the International Boundary and Water Commission and
Juarez’s autonomous university are among the sponsors. Talks
include water technology advancements.  This year’s summit follows on a year-earlier gathering on
sanitation and water quality along the U.S.-Mexico border and
one in 2005 that focused on the Rio Grande.  To contact the reporter on this story:
