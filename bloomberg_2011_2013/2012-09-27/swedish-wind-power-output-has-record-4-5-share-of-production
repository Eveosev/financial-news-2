Wind parks in  Sweden  accounted for
a record 4.5 percent of the Nordic nation’s electricity in the
year through Sept. 23, said Swedenergy, the country’s power
industry association.  Output from  wind turbines  reached 7 terawatt-hours in the
period, up 33 percent from a year earlier, the lobby group said
today on its website.  A total of 104 new wind turbines were commissioned this
year in Sweden, taking the total capacity to 2,935 megawatts at
the end of June, according to the  latest data  from the Swedish
Energy Agency. The organization cut its full-year outlook for
supply from wind parks by 0.7 terawatt-hours to 7.1 terawatt-
hours, it said in an Aug. 14 report submitted to the Swedish
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
