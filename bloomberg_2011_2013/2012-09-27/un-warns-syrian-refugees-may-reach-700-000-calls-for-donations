The number of Syrian refugees in
neighboring countries could more than double to 700,000 by the
end of this year, the United Nations refugee agency said.  There are 294,000 Syrian refugees in  Jordan , Lebanon, Iraq
and  Turkey , and as many as 3,000 more are fleeing every day, the
UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees said on its website today.
It called on donors for $295 million in extra funding.  Syrian rebels have been fighting to overthrow President
Bashar al-Assad since March last year, in a conflict that has
left at least 30,000 people dead, according to estimates by the
Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights .  At least 22 people have been killed across the country
today, the Local Coordination Committees in  Syria  said, after
343 deaths yesterday, one of the highest tolls since the
uprising began last year.  Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Miqati said in an interview
with Al Arabiya television yesterday that there are more than
220,000 Syrians in Lebanon, of whom 66,000 have registered with
international groups as refugees in need of assistance.  Turkey’s Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  told Kanal 7
television late yesterday that his country has a total capacity
for 100,000 people and was already sheltering nearly 90,000.  “Many refugees are arriving with only the clothes on their
backs,” Panos Moumtzis, the group’s regional coordinator for
Syrian Refugees, said on the website. “Some have been displaced
many times before leaving Syria. They need humanitarian
assistance from day one.”  The European Commission said today that the plight of the
refugees could worsen by winter. It said international
organizations agreed that “the most pressing priorities ahead
are to increase humanitarian aid and provide medicines,
blankets, stoves, heating fuel and other non-food items.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
