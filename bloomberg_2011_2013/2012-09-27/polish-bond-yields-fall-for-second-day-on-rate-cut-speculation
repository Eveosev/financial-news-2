Poland ’s two-year bond yields
declined to two-week low on expectations the central bank will
cut  interest rates  next week to aid flagging economic growth.  The yield on notes maturing in July 2014 fell five basis
points to 4.064 percent, the lowest since Sept. 11. The zloty
gained 0.3 percent to 4.1424 per euro as of 1:43 p.m. in Warsaw.  Monetary policy makers are due to meet on Oct. 3. The need
for Polish interest-rate cuts is “obvious,” central bank
Governor Marek Belka was reported as saying by the PAP newswire
yesterday. Monetary easing should come as a “cycle” rather
than a one-time move, he was quoted as saying.  “Comments from the central bank governor have confirmed
dovish bias among policy makers,” Cezary Chrapek, an analyst at
Citigroup Inc.’s Bank Handlowy SA unit, wrote in an e-mailed
research note today. “This looks like an announcement of an
interest-rate cut at the next meeting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
