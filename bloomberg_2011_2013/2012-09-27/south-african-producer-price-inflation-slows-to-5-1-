South African producer prices rose
at the slowest pace in more than two years in August, allowing
the  Reserve Bank  to keep its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
to help support growth in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  The cost of goods leaving factories and mines rose 5.1
percent, compared with 5.4 percent in July, Pretoria-based
Statistics  South Africa  said on its website today. The  median
estimate  of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 5.3 percent.
Prices rose 0.7 percent in the month.  “It’s painting a fairly moderate picture for overall
inflation,” Elize Kruger, a Johannesburg-based economist at
KADD Capital who correctly forecast the increase, said in a
phone interview. “I don’t think there is enough upward price
pressure to make the Reserve Bank uncomfortable.”  The Reserve Bank left its  repurchase rate  unchanged at 5
percent last week, after reducing it by half a percentage point
for the first time in 20 months in July. Slower growth in
producers’ costs may ease pressure on consumer-price inflation,
which accelerated to 5 percent in August from 4.9 percent in the
previous month. The central bank aims to keep the inflation rate
within a range of 3 percent to 6 percent.  The bank on Sept. 20 cut its forecast for economic growth
this year to 2.6 percent. The economy expanded 3.1 percent in
2011.  A 1.4 percent month-on-month fall in grain prices is
positive for the outlook in food inflation, Kruger said.  The rand was at 8.2179 a dollar at 12:30 p.m. in
Johannesburg, down from 8.2109 before the release of the data.
The yield on the government 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 gained 1
basis point to 6.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
