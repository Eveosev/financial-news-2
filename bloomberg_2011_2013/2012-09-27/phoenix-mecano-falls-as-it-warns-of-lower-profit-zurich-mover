Phoenix Mecano AG (PM)  sank the most in
four months in Zurich trading after the maker of keyboards and
connectors cut is forecast for earnings before interest and tax
this year to 32 million euros to 37 million euros ($48 million).  The stock dropped as much as 6.80 percent and traded 6.2
percent lower at 455 Swiss francs at 10:51 a.m. local time.
Phoenix, based in Kloten,  Switzerland  has lost 7.1 percent this
year, giving it a market capitalization of 445 million Swiss
francs ($479 million).  The company will book costs of six million euros to eight
million euros after losing a contract to supply photo-voltaic
components to a major customer, forcing a downgrade of its
earlier Ebit forecast of 43 million euros to 53 million euros,
Phoenix said in a statement.  Sales could fall by around 25 million euros in 2013, as the
photo-voltaic industry bottoms out, the company said. Phoenix
will release more details on its current business performance in
a trading update on November 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
