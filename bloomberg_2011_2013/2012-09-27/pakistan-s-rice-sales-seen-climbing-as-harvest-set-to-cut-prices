Rice exports from  Pakistan , the
fourth-largest shipper, are set to rebound from November with
the new harvest after a rally in domestic prices and cheaper
supplies from  India  cut shipments, a traders’ group said.  Overseas sales may reach 4 million metric tons in the year
that began on July 1 as increased supplies from the new crop
cool local prices, said Safder Hussain Mehkri, vice chairman of
the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan. Exports slumped 46
percent to 238,659 tons in the July-August period, according to
 Pakistan Bureau of Statistics . Shipments were 3.7 million tons
in 2011-2012, according to the association.  Rice, staple for half the world, is poised for a second
monthly decline as  Thailand  and India, the world’s biggest
exporters, accelerated sales. Futures are little changed this
year, lagging behind corn, wheat and soybeans, as global rice
harvests are set for a record.  “New harvest will bring down the prices which are way too
high at the moment, making us less competitive in the global
market,” Mehkri said by phone from Karachi. “Our rice is 10-15
percent costlier than India’s. Better domestic prices will
improve our competitiveness against India.”  Non-basmati rice from Pakistan was sold at about $451 a ton
free-on-board in July and August, while it was $385 a ton in
India, according to data from the exporters’ associations in
both the countries. Rough rice for November delivery was little
changed at $14.90 per 100 pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade
at 6:48 p.m. in  Singapore  yesterday. Futures have lost 2.5
percent this month.  Indian Exports  India will export 8 million tons in 2011-2012, making it
the top shipper ahead of  Vietnam  and Thailand, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data show. In 2012-2013 India’s
shipments would drop to 7 million tons, compared with Thailand’s
8 million tons and Vietnam’s 7 million tons, the USDA estimates.
Pakistan’s exports in 2012-2013 will reach 4 million tons,
according to the agency.  Shipments from Pakistan were also hurt by international
trade sanctions on  Iran , which made payments between traders in
the two countries difficult, Mehkri said. The rice harvest this
year may surpass the 6 million tons in 2011-2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
