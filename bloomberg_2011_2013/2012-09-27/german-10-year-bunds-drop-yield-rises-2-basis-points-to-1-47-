Spanish 10-year bonds advanced,
snapping their biggest decline in almost two months, as Deputy
Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said the cabinet had
approved the nation’s 2013 budget.  Italian securities rose after borrowing costs fell at a
6.65 billion-euro ($8.6 billion) auction of five- and 10-year
debt. Spanish bond risk headed for its biggest monthly drop
before Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  approves a budget that will
cut the deficit by at least 18 billion euros next year. The
draft law will be presented to Parliament on Sept. 29. German
10-year yields were little changed after falling to the lowest
level in three weeks.  “If they stick to their fiscal guns, that will please the
markets and it will also please the  European Central Bank ,”
said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “We are taking a pause of breath
after the selloff yesterday but if there are any signs the
Spanish are toning down their commitment to fiscal consolidation
then the bond markets will punish them.”  Spanish 10-year yields dropped 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 5.95 percent at 5 p.m. London time. They
climbed 32 basis points yesterday, the most since Aug. 2. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 rose 0.825, or 8.25 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.295. Similar-maturity Italian
bond yields fell nine basis points to 5.12 percent.  Credit-default swaps on  Spain  fell nine basis points to 393
and are down from 518 basis points Aug. 31. The contracts, which
peaked at 640 basis points on July 24, are also heading for a
record quarterly decline.  Protests, Dissent  Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Rajoy is defying anti-austerity protesters and dissent from
regional leaders as he struggles to convince investors he can
contain the crisis and avoid asking for a full bailout. The
rally in Spanish borrowing and bond insurance costs was fueled
by the ECB’s bond-purchase program announced on Sept. 6.  “The Spanish budget could bode well for their bonds,”
said Ralf Umlauf, a research analyst at Landesbank Hessen-
Thueringen in  Frankfurt . “Today’s Italian auction was quite
successful. We think this is positive for the periphery’s bonds,
especially Spain and Italy.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yielded 1.46 percent after declining
to 1.439 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 5. Benchmark 10-
year bund yields are headed for a sixth quarter of declines, the
longest run since 1998. The rate has dropped 12 basis points
since the end of June.  Italian Auctions  Italy sold 2.93 billion euros of bonds due in November 2022
at an average yield of 5.24 percent, the central bank said.
That’s down from a yield of 5.82 percent at a similar auction on
Aug. 30. The nation also sold 2.72 billion euros of debt due in
2017 and 1 billion euros of floating-rate notes.  “The Italian auctions were well received by investors, in
particular domestic insurance and bank accounts,” Chiara Manenti, a fixed-income strategist at Intesa Sanpaolo SpA in
Milan, wrote in a client note today.  Italy  has now met 81
percent of its gross issuance planned for 2012 and that will
probably rise to 88 percent by the end of October, meaning that
“the risk of refunding for Italy is limited,” she said.  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by Ireland, according to measures of 10-year
or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities and credit-default swaps.  German bunds returned 3.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities were little changed, while Italy’s earned 14 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
