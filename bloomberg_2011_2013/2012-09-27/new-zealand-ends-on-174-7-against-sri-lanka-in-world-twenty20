Rob Nicol scored 58 as  New Zealand 
ended on 174-7 against host nation Sri Lanka in the opening
Super Eight game of cricket’s World Twenty20 competition.  Martin Guptill made 38, Brendon McCullum 25 and Ross Taylor
23 for New Zealand, which won the toss in Pallekele. Akila
Dananjaya took 2-32 and Nuwan Kulasekara 2-33.  Guptill made a brisk start to the innings before being
caught by Thisara Perera off Dananjaya with the score on 57.  Dananjaya had to have medical treatment on the field after
a drive by Nicol went through the bowler’s attempted catch and
hit him in the face. Soon after, McCullum was out in another
catch for Thisara Perera, this time off Ajantha Mendis.  Nicol stepped up the pace, scoring three sixes in a 20-run
over as he punished the bowling. He was finally caught off
Dananjaya after a 40-ball innings that included four sixes.  Later today defending champion  England  meets West Indies,
also in Pallekele.  There are two groups of four in the Super Eight, the top
two in each reaching the semifinals.  India ,  Australia ,  South
Africa  and Pakistan have also reached the last eight.  The competition, generally held every two years, is the
international championship of Twenty20, the shortest form of the
game. It started with four groups of three teams, followed by a
Super Eight, semifinals and final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
