Gold climbed to a record priced in
euros and Swiss francs on concern that central banks’ moves to
boost economies will devalue currencies, spurring demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  Bullion for immediate delivery in London reached 1,379.32
euros an ounce and has rallied 14 percent this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Gold priced in dollars rose 13
percent this year to $1,771.30 by 4:49 p.m. local time and is
trading 7.8 percent below the all-time high set in September
2011. The commodity set a record 1,667.18 Swiss francs today and
peaked in Indian rupees earlier this month.  Bullion, typically priced in dollars, is extending 11
consecutive annual gains as the  Federal Reserve  announced a
third round of quantitative easing and as central banks from
Europe to China to  Japan  also pledged more action this month.
Nations from  South Korea  to Kazakhstan are boosting their  gold
reserves  and metal held in bullion-backed exchange-traded
products rose to a record 2,551.9 metric tons valued at $145.3
billion on Sept. 25, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Central banks are weakening their currencies to boost
their economies and gold is a beneficiary,” Matthew Turner, a
precious metals strategist at  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  International
(Europe) in London, said today by phone. “The story of weak
currencies and strong gold is back in play and it’s not just the
dollar, it’s all currencies.”  Fed Stimulus  The Fed said Sept. 13 it will buy $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month and probably hold the federal funds rate near zero
until at least the middle of 2015. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said last
week it will add to a fund that buys assets, the  European
Central Bank  announced an unlimited bond-purchase program
Sept. 6 and China approved a $158 billion subways-to-roads
construction plan.  The 17-nation euro area is contracting as leaders strive to
rein in the debt crisis. European bar and coin demand rose 15
percent to 77.6 tons in the second quarter, according to the
London-based World Gold Council.  Higher local prices in  India , last year’s biggest buyer,
may curb consumption. The country’s imports slipped 56 percent
in the second quarter, according to the World Gold Council.
Jewelers there held a strike in March and April to protest
government taxes on imports.  Gold reached an all-time high of 97,644.88 rupees on Sept.
13, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While gold in British
pounds is about 8.5 percent below its September 2011 high, it
still climbed about that much since the beginning of January.  “The dollar price is still the focus of the market and
sometimes what it is showing is a weak dollar, rather than
strong gold,” Turner said. “When gold is at a high in many
currencies, it’s not a currency effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
