OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, snapped two days of decline as the country’s central
bank took steps to boost corporate lending and after emerging-
market stocks rebounded.  OTP’s shares rose 2 percent to 3,877 forint by the close in
Budapest after dropping 3.7 percent in the past two days. The
benchmark BUX stock index advanced 1.5 percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which cut its benchmark  interest
rate  two days ago, will ease the terms and conditions of its
two-year loan facility to boost corporate lending, according to
its website. Emerging-market stocks rose, paring the steepest
plunge in two months yesterday, on speculation policymakers will
do more to support economic growth after Chinese industrial
profits dropped.  “It can be seen that the Magyar Nemzeti Bank is striving
to boost lending,”  Akos Kuti , a Budapest-based analyst at
broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in an e-mailed report
today. “The rate cut has little impact on its own in the
current environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
