Helmut Elsner, the former Bawag PSK
chief executive officer, sued the Austrian bank and Cerberus
Capital Management, claiming $1.8 billion in damages tied to the
collapse of futures broker Refco Inc.  Elsner, who was convicted in 2008 of misuse of funds, said
he was made a “scapegoat” and was wrongfully held responsible
for losses at Bawag, according to a complaint filed yesterday in
 New York  State Supreme Court.  “Elsner, like numerous others, has been victimized by a
massive fraud,” the complaint states.  The losses at Bawag were discovered in 2006 after Refco
collapsed into bankruptcy. The losses led to the sale of Bawag
to private equity firm Cerberus. Elsner’s lawsuit also named
former Refco Chief Executive Officer Phillip Bennett, who is
serving a 16-year prison sentence.  Representatives of Bawag and Cerberus couldn’t immediately
be reached for comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Elsner v. Bennett, 653379-2012, New York State
Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
