Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki called
for more international support to help the African Union
peacekeeping mission in Somalia capture Kismayo, the last major
stronghold of al-Qaeda-linked insurgents.  Amisom, as the mission is known, needs additional funding
for a naval unit and for training of the Somali army before it
takes control of internal security from the peacekeepers, Kibaki
said at the  United Nations  in  New York  yesterday.  “More support is required from the  Security Council  and
individual partner states in order to consolidate the gains on
the ground,” Kibaki said, according to a copy of his remarks e-
mailed yesterday from the Presidential Press Service.  The al-Shabaab group has been fighting for five years to
topple the Western-backed government and impose Islamic law in
Somalia, which has suffered more than 20 years of civil unrest
sparked by the ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.  Al-Shabaab controls swathes of territory in south and
central Somalia. African Union forces have captured the capital,
Mogadishu, and several other bases over the past year, and are
now targeting the port city of Kismayo, a key source of income
for al-Shabaab.  The AU troops are from  Kenya , Uganda, Burundi and Djibouti.
Ethiopia has sent a separate military force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
