Zimbabwe President  Robert Mugabe 
told the country’s  High Court  he plans to call an election in
March, a step that would end a coalition government with the
party of political rival Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai .  Mugabe wants to call a constitutional referendum in the
first week of November and an election in the last week of
March, according to documents filed with the country’s court.  The referendum and elections are part of an agreement
brokered by the Southern African Development Community, a group
of nations including Zimbabwe, after a vote held in 2008 was
declared flawed because of procedural irregularities and
violence by most observers.  Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
party shares power with Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic
Change under the agreement, which was implemented in February
2009 in a bid to end a decade-long political stalemate and
economic recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
