Treasuries fell for the first time
in nine days, snapping their longest rally in almost four years,
as optimism  Spain  is moving closer to meeting budget-deficit
targets reduced the refuge appeal of U.S. government debt.  Demand for the safest assets at quarter-end helped support
the Treasury’s auction of $29 billion of seven-year notes even
with investors less risk-averse. The notes were sold at a  yield 
of 1.055 percent, versus a forecast of 1.064 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of six of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary
dealers that bid on the sale. The issue’s  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.61, the lowest in 11 months and below
the 2.82 average for the past 10 auctions.  “We’re seeing a bit of a respite here,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in  New York  of government-debt
trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and
dealer for institutional investors. Spain is “taking the
necessary measures. It’s a positive step,” he said.  The yield on the current  seven-year note  rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.05 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York trading, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices.  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  increased five basis points
to 1.65 percent. The price of the 1.625 percent security
maturing in August 2022 dropped 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 23/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields added six basis
points to 2.84 percent.  Market Volume  Treasury  volume  reported today by ICAP Plc, the largest
interdealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped to $297
billion, down from $301 billion yesterday. Daily volume has
averaged $242 billion in 2012. It touched $464 billion Sept. 13,
the highest in 13 months.  Treasuries gained for an eighth day yesterday, the longest
stretch since December 2008, as investors seeking a refuge from
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis bolstered demand for the safest
securities. Demonstrators in Spain and  Greece  protesting budget
cuts clashed with police this week.  “It’s just a little bit of unwinding of the fears
yesterday,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in New
York at the primary dealer Credit Suisse Group AG. “The worry
was that there wouldn’t be a bailout for Spain and the unrest
would force the government to not make austerity.”  Treasuries extended their drop after Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy ’s nine-month-old government announced its fifth
austerity package in what may be a move to head off tougher
conditions demanded as part of a potential European bailout.
Rajoy’s Cabinet approved a new tax on lottery winnings and a cut
in ministries’ spending to shrink the euro area’s third-biggest
budget deficit.  Bailout Decision  Rajoy has been stoking frustration among some European
leaders for delaying a decision on whether to seek a bailout
from the euro region’s rescue fund that would allow the  European
Central Bank  to prop up the nation’s bond market.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year note dropped 12 basis points
to 5.95 percent, according to Bloomberg data, after touching a
three-week high of 6.11 percent earlier.  Stocks rose as risk appetite increased. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index gained for the first time in six days, climbing
1 percent.  U.S. government securities have lost 0.2 percent this
month, paring their gain for the quarter to 0.7 percent,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Treasury Master
index. Treasuries have returned 2.4 percent this year, the index
showed, compared with a 22 percent gain by the  S&P 500 ,
including reinvested dividends. Treasuries rose 9.8 percent in
2011, versus a 2.1 percent gain by the equities benchmark.  Treasury Auction  At today’s auction of U.S. seven-year notes,  indirect
bidders , an investor class that includes foreign central banks,
purchased 34.9 percent of the notes, the least since the January
offering. The average at the past 10 sales was 40.6 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 17 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 14.1 percent at the last
10 auctions.  Today’s yield was the second-lowest a seven-year note sale
since Bloomberg began keeping records in 1980. The lowest was
0.954 percent at the July offering.  “It was a very strong auction in terms of yield,” said
 Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at the primary dealer
Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc. “The reason it was strong
was because of quarter-end.”  Investors such as banks and mutual funds are often
attracted to the safest securities at quarter-end to improve the
quality of assets on their balance sheets.  Three Offerings  Today’s offering was the final of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year
debt on Sept. 25 at a yield of 0.273 percent and the same amount
of five-year notes yesterday at a yield of 0.647 percent.  Treasuries trimmed losses earlier after the Commerce
Department said U.S. household purchases, which account for
about 70 percent of the economy, grew 1.5 percent in the second
quarter, versus a previously reported 1.7 percent. An index of
pending home resales fell 2.6 percent in August after a revised
2.6 percent gain in July, figures from the National Association
of Realtors showed today in  Washington .  The five-year, five-year forward  break-even rate , a measure
of the inflation outlook the Fed uses to help guide monetary
policy, was 2.67 percent on Sept. 25, down from a 13-month high
of 2.88 percent on Sept. 14. The 10-year average is 2.75
percent.  Quantitative Easing  The central bank announced on Sept. 13 plans to buy $40
billion of mortgage securities a month in a third round of
quantitative easing as it seeks to spur economic growth and
lower a jobless rate stuck above 8 percent since February 2009.
It said it would continue the purchases until the recovery is
well-established.  A measure of relative yields on mortgage securities that
guide U.S. home-loan rates was near a record low today amid bets
the Fed will find a shortage of the bonds as it expands
purchases. A Bloomberg index of yields on Fannie Mae-guaranteed
mortgage bonds trading closest to face value was 63 basis points
higher than an average of five- and 10-year Treasury rates. The
record, 55 basis points, was reached Sept. 25. The 2012 average
is 135 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
