Southern Co. (SO) , the second-largest
U.S. power company by market value, is seeking permission to
purchase as much as 210 megawatts of solar power by 2017.  The company’s Georgia Power unit, based in Atlanta,
submitted plans to regulators to buy 70 megawatts of capacity a
year starting in 2015, according to a statement yesterday.  If approved, the Advanced Solar Initiative would be the
largest voluntary purchase of solar energy by an investor-owned
utility in the U.S., Georgia Power said. Utilities in some other
states are required to buy electricity generated from renewable
sources. Georgia doesn’t have a state renewable portfolio
standard, as such polices are known.  The program “will encourage new opportunities for solar
development” in the state, Georgia Power Chief Executive
Officer Paul Bowers said in the statement. The initiative must
be approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission.  PG&E Corp. (PCG) ’s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. installed 288
megawatts of solar power last year, the most of any utility,
according to an April  report  from the Solar Electric Power
Association. The state requires utilities to obtain 33 percent
of their power from renewable sources by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
