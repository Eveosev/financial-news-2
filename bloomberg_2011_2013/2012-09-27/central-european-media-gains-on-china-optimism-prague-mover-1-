Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV) , the broadcaster co-owned by Time Warner Inc., rose the
most in a week, leading Czech stocks higher amid speculation
China may announce new stimulus measures to support economic
growth.  The stock climbed 2.5 percent, snapping a three-day slump,
to 130 koruna in  Prague , making it the best performer today in
the 14-member PX equity index, which was up 1 percent.  New World
Resources Plc (NWR)  advanced 2.3 percent and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) 
gained 1.9 percent, while ,  Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA) 
dropped 3 percent today.  CME, as the company is known, lost 13 percent of its value
in the previous three days. European stocks followed Chinese
securities higher on speculation the nation may introduce
further stimulus package to aid its economy after a report
showed that industrial profits fell for a fifth month.  “The sentiment on the markets has turned overnight,” said
Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
