The naira appreciated for a third
day as the central bank increased the amount of dollars sold at
its twice-weekly auctions and as oil, the nation’s key export,
advanced.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest crude producer gained 0.1
percent to 157.25 a dollar as of 2:10 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $450 million at its two
auctions this week, the highest in seven, according to data on
its website. Oil rebounded from the lowest close in almost two
months and extended gains on speculation that  China  will take
measures to stimulate its economy. Nigerian benchmark Bonny
Light crude climbed 0.62 percent to $111.47 a barrel.  “Naira is appreciating largely due to sufficient dollar
supplies from the central bank,” Kunle Ezun and Kenneth
Asenime, Lagos-based strategists at Ecobank Transnational Inc.,
wrote in a note to clients today.  The central bank kept its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged
at a record 12 percent on Sept. 18 to control inflation and
bolster the naira, Governor Lamido Sanusi said. The  inflation 
rate slowed to 11.7 percent in August from 12.8 percent the
previous month, the lowest this year, the statistics agency said
Sept. 16.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s 16 percent domestic bonds due June
2019 rose two basis points to 13.37 percent, according to
yesterday’s data on the  Financial Markets Dealers Association 
website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 fell five basis points to 4.75 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.8968 a
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
