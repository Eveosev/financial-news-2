European electricity network
operators have submitted rules for power trading that will help
the bloc to achieve its goal of a single market by 2014 to
European Union regulators.  The capacity allocation and congestion management  code 
contains rules for day-ahead and intraday markets and the
calculation of capacity as well as defining bidding zones,
Entsoe, a Brussels-based body that represents national
operators, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators has
three months to assess the code and if they approve it, it will
become law, Entsoe said.  Entsoe was set up to develop codes for matters such as grid
access, congestion management, interoperability and transparency
that are part of EU energy legislation, known as the third
package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
