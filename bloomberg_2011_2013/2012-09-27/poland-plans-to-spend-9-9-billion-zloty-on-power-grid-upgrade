PSE Operator SA,  Poland ’s power
grid operator, plans to spend 9.9 billion zloty ($3.1 billion)
in the next five years building  power lines  and upgrading the
national electricity transmission network.  The supervisory board of the Konstancin-Jeziorna-based
company approved its investment plan that includes building
almost 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) of power lines and
upgrading 2,000 existing ones, PSE Operator said today in an e-
mail.  The investments include laying cables to connect new power
sources to the grid as well as building cross-border lines with
neighboring countries.  PSE Operator plans to build a link with the Lithuanian
network, to allow Poland to import 500 megawatts of power by
2015. The cable will in part be financed by the European Union
as the connection is among strategic projects aiming at linking
the 27-nation bloc’s energy markets. By 2020, the grid manager
is planning to build additional links with  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
