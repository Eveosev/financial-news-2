Researchers will begin testing an
experimental drug made from chemicals like those in cannabis on
cancer patients at two U.K. hospitals, and they expect findings
next year on whether the product is safe.  Cancer Research UK  and a U.K.  National Institute for Health
Research  agency will carry out the trial of dexanabinol, a
product made by  e-Therapeutics Plc , in 45 patients with solid
tumors at hospitals in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Leeds,  England ,
the Newcastle-based biotechnology company said today in a
statement. E-Therapeutics is funding the research, it said.  “The starting point for this trial was to map networks of
proteins that appear to have a role in cancer, identify points
at which these networks could be disrupted, and then see if
there were existing drugs to target these points,”  Ruth
Plummer , clinical professor of experimental cancer medicine at
Newcastle University, who is leading the trial, said in the
statement.  A similar early-stage test in  brain cancer  began in  San
Diego  in June, e-Therapeutics said at the time. Results from
both trials are expected next year, the company said.  Dexanabinol is made in a laboratory and is chemically
related to compounds found in marijuana, e-Therapeutics said.
The drug was originally developed for patients with severe head
injuries, Plummer said. It lacks the psychological effects
associated with cannabis.  The company is 47 percent owned by  Invesco Ltd. , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
