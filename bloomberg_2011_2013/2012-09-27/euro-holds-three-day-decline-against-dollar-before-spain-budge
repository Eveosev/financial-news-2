The euro fell to a two-week low
against the dollar as Spanish ministers in  Madrid  unveiled a
fresh round of budget cuts amid the prospect of a sovereign
bailout.  The shared currency slid for an eighth day versus the yen,
the longest streak in four months, after economic confidence in
the euro area unexpectedly fell in September. The dollar
weakened against most peers after claims for U.S. jobless
benefits fell more than forecast. The pound rose for the first
time in four days against the greenback after a report showed
the economy contracted less than previously estimated.  “In the race of pro-risk currencies, the euro is losing
out based on its weak growth profile,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a
currency strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co . in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. “However, the market reaction to an aid
request from  Spain  would be positive for the euro.”  Europe ’s shared currency dropped 0.3 percent to $1.2838 at
11:31 a.m. New York time, reaching the lowest level since Sept.
12. The euro fell 0.4 percent to 99.68 yen, extending its run of
declines to the longest since May 31. The yen added 0.1 percent
to 77.66 per dollar.  Spain’s Debt  Spanish 10-year  government bonds  extended their advance as
the government approved its budget for 2013, with yield slipping
11 basis points to 5.95 percent.  Implied volatility, which signals the expected pace of
currency swings, for the currencies of Group of Seven nations
fell to 7.88 percent. The gauge reached 7.75 percent on Sept.
13, its lowest level since October 2007, according to a JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  index . Lower volatility makes investments in
currencies with higher benchmark lending rates more attractive
because the risk in such trades is that market moves will erase
profit.  The Australian dollar rebounded from a two-week low amid
speculation  China  will act to support growth in the world’s
biggest consumer of commodities.  The Aussie rose 0.5 percent to $1.0420. It yesterday
touched $1.0329, the weakest since Sept. 11. The Aussie has
gained 1 percent this month and 1.8 percent this quarter against
the greenback.  Kiwi Gains  New Zealand’s dollar increased versus the majority of its
major peers as the country’s business confidence rose to a four-
month high in September as record-low  interest rates  boosted
spending and the housing market, according to a survey.  The so-called kiwi advanced 0.6 percent to 82.95 U.S.
cents. The kiwi has gained 3.3 percent versus the dollar this
month, the most out of its major counterparts. It has risen 6.7
percent this year, the second-most out of peers.  The real is also on pace for the biggest quarterly decline
out of its most-traded peers, having slipped 1.1 percent. The
Brazilian currency has lost 8.3 percent versus the dollar in
2012.  The Mexican peso leads all 16 of the dollar’s biggest peers
with a gain of 8.4 percent this year.  European Sentiment  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area dropped to 85 from 86.1 in August, the European
Commission in Brussels said today. Economists had forecast no
change in the gauge, the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  The euro is still on track for a 2.2 percent advance
against the dollar this month, amid speculation that the
 European Central Bank  will buy bonds from Spain and other euro-
region nations to stem market turmoil. The ECB’s plan, announced
by President  Mario Draghi  on Sept. 6, requires nations to
request aid that would come with strict conditions attached.  “The focus is on Spain,” said  Lutz Karpowitz , a senior
foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“There is a little bit of pressure on the euro, and we expect
that to continue because the tensions remain. There is
speculation that Spain may have to tap the rescue funds.”  Currency Forecasts  Analysts have raised their year-end estimates for the euro
by one cent this month, to $1.27 from $1.26, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The revision comes amid
optimism policy makers are working toward a solution for the
debt crisis and after the  Federal Reserve  said on Sept. 13 it
will buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities each month
until the labor market improves.  “Rajoy may attempt to push through some harsh austerity
measures today,” said Melinda Burgess, a foreign-exchange
strategist at  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  in  London .
“Pressure is intensifying on Spain to ask for a bailout and if
they took one that would be a positive for the euro.”  The  Dollar Index  fell 0.1 percent to 79.826 after reaching
80.012 yesterday, the most since Sept. 12.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 26,000 to
359,000 in the week ended Sept. 22, the lowest since July, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast 375,000
claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The pound climbed 0.2 percent to $1.6192 and advanced 0.3
percent to 79.42 pence per euro, after appreciating to 79.24
pence, the strongest level since Sept. 6.  U.K. gross domestic product fell 0.4 percent in the second
quarter, instead of the 0.5 percent decline estimated last
month, the  Office for National Statistics  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
