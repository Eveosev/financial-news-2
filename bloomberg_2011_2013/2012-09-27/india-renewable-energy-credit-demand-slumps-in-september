Demand for renewable-energy credits
in  India  declined this month because of a supply glut and
concern regulators may not enforce clean-energy targets on
utilities.  Bids from companies seeking to buy credits fell 7 percent
from the August trading session, while sell bids gained 13
percent, according to data from  REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt. ,
an Indore-based trader. The credits sold for 1,500 rupees ($28)
each, the floor price set by the regulator.  “Demand has remained depressed due to enforcement
concerns,” REConnect said in a note to clients.  The government requires power distributors, steelmakers,
miners and other energy users to buy as much as 10 percent of
their need every year from renewable utilities. State-run
distribution companies, the main intended buyers, are failing to
meet those targets because they are cash-strapped and count on
government leniency, Debashish Majumdar, head of the state-run
Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, said this week in
Mumbai.  Each credit represents one megawatt-hour of clean
electricity fed into the grid. Companies facing the target
include  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) ,  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) ,  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) 
and  Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. (RELI)   Companies failing to secure enough renewable power locally
to meet the target can opt to buy credits sold by wind farms,
hydropower and biomass plants over the country’s two power
exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
