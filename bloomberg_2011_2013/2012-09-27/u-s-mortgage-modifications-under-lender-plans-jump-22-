Private lenders in the U.S.
increased home-loan modifications in the second quarter,
following a $25 billion settlement of wrongful  foreclosure 
investigations, according to a government report.  Permanent and trial mortgage modifications under non-
government programs climbed 22 percent to 242,463 while those
done under the government’s Home Affordable Modification Program
fell 53 percent from a year earlier to 53,723 loans, the U.S.
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said today.  The five largest U.S. loan servicers, including  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , agreed to a $25 billion
settlement in February that required them to provide more
assistance programs to  delinquent  homeowners. The number of new
borrowers getting the government-backed modifications has
declined because of stricter qualification rules than private
plans on standards such as debt-to-income ratios.  “Under the settlement, more people will get a
modification,” Bruce Krueger, a senior mortgage expert with the
comptroller’s office, said in a conference call with reporters.  Lenders have struggled to find ways to reduce losses as
more than 11 percent of mortgages were delinquent or in
 foreclosure  at the end of June. The percentage of mortgages that
were current and performing at the end of the quarter was 88.7
percent, compared with 88.9 percent the previous three months
and 88.1 percent a year earlier, according to the Office of the
Comptroller, a division of the Treasury Department.  Servicers implemented 416,036 new loan modifications during
the quarter, while starting 302,636 new foreclosures. The
biggest change was among non-government trial modifications,
which increased 74 percent during the quarter and 50 percent
from a year earlier to 178,528.  The loans reviewed by the report comprise 60 percent of all
mortgages outstanding in the U.S., or 30.5 million loans
totaling $5.2 trillion in principal balances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
