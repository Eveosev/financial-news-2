Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds rose,
pushing down yields for a second day, as increasing prices for
copper and gold, the country’s top exports, bolstered the
outlook for the local currency.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.27 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.32 centimo to 123.51 centimos per
sol.  Copper and gold advanced amid speculation policy makers
will take steps to spur growth in  China , the world’s largest
consumer of industrial metals. Peruvian bond yields touched
record lows last week after the sol rose to its strongest level
against the dollar in 15 years. The sol is the best performing
emerging-market currency in the past year after the Chilean
peso, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are betting the sol “will get stronger in the
coming weeks,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at  Banco
Santander  in Lima. “It would already be at 2.53 if it weren’t
for” the central bank buying dollars.  The sol closed unchanged at 2.5950 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency touched
2.59 on Sept. 17, the strongest level since 1997,  data  from
Peru’s financial regulator show.  The central bank  bought  $100 million in the spot market
today and paid an average 2.5946 soles per dollar. It has
purchased a record $11 billion this year to stem gains in the
sol.  Peru will post a  trade surplus  this year as commodity
export volumes will increase, though prices will be below last
year’s level, Trade Minister Jose Silva told reporters in  Lima 
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
