Traders at broker-dealers often
interact with bankers who know confidential information, raising
concerns about undetected  insider trading , the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission said.  Senior executives at some broker-dealers are allowed access
to non-public information from one group while overseeing
employees who could benefit from it, the SEC’s Office of
Compliance Inspections and Examinations said today in a  report .
Allowing some supervisors to be “above the wall” dividing
traders from those with the information may facilitate insider
trading, according to the report, which didn’t name any firms
where such practices exist.  The SEC’s review of secrecy procedures at broker-dealers
follows a nationwide crackdown on insider trading by the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation  in  New York  and prosecutors in the
office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that began five
years ago. The probe snared Raj Rajaratnam, 55, the co-founder
of Galleon Group LLC, who was convicted last year on  securities
fraud  and conspiracy charges.  “The report illustrates the types of conflicts of interest
that may arise between a broker-dealer’s obligations to clients
that provide confidential information for business purposes and
the potential misuse of such information for insider trading or
other improper ends,” Carlo di Florio, the director of the SEC
office, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
