R.A. Dickey became the  New York
Mets ’ first 20-game winner in 22 seasons, pitching his team to a
6-5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Starting the Mets’ home finale at Citi Field in New York,
the knuckleball-throwing Dickey tied his career high with 13
strikeouts over 7 2/3 innings, raising his record to 20-6 and
becoming the first Met to reach the 20-game mark since Frank Viola in 1990.  Dickey, 37, exited with a 6-3 lead and then watched
reliever Jon Rauch give up a two-run home run to Alex Presley in
the ninth before being replaced by Bobby Parnell, who earned a
two-out save. Dickey threw a season-high 128 pitches to earn the
win as the Mets raised their record for the year to 72-84.  “This is as much for you as it is for me and I’m happy to
celebrate with everybody,” Dickey told the stadium fans in a
televised interview. “The season hasn’t gone as we wanted but
this is a special moment right here.”  Pittsburgh (76-80) used four second-inning hits to score
two runs off Dickey for the early lead.  The Mets’ Ike Davis hit his 31st home run in the bottom of
the inning off Pirates starter Kevin Correia, sending the ball
well over the right-field fence. Later in the inning, Mike Baxter had a home-run try taken away by Pirates right fielder
Travis Snider, who scaled the chain-linked fence and reached
several feet above its top before catching the ball in the
webbing of his glove.  Former Mets catcher Rod Barajas, who hit a run-scoring
double off Dickey in the second inning, added a solo homer in
the fourth as the Pirates took a 3-1 lead.  Mets Runs  Scott Hairston ’s single scored  David Murphy  in the bottom
of the fourth inning and the Mets took the lead for good in the
fifth as Murphy hit a run-scoring single and  David Wright  a
three-run homer to right field, ending the outing for Correia
(11-11).  Viola went 20-12 with a 2.67 ERA in 1990, finishing third
in the voting for the Cy Young Award as the National League’s
best pitcher behind the Pirates’ Doug Drabek and the  Los Angeles
Dodgers ’ Ramon Martinez.  Dickey, a Cy Young candidate this season, passed  Clayton Kershaw  for the National League strikeout lead today, finishing
with more than 10 for the seventh game this season. With six
games remaining in the Mets’ season, Dickey has 222 strikeouts.
His previous best was 134 last season, when he went 8-13.  NL Leader  Dickey, who entered the game leading the NL with a 2.66
earned-run average and five complete games, never won more than
11 games in nine previous seasons in  Major League Baseball . The
victory raised his career record to 61-56.  In June, Dickey became the first major leaguer since 1988
to throw consecutive one-hitters.  The crosstown  New York Yankees  had six 20-game winners in
the 22 years since Viola’s feat:  Andy Pettitte  in 1996 and 2003,
David Cone in 1998,  Roger Clemens  in 2001, Mike Mussina in 2008
and CC Sabathia in 2010.  The last knuckleballer to record 20 wins in a season was
Joe Niekro, who went 20-12 in 1980.  Pirates center fielder Andrew McCutchen left the game in
the seventh inning after landing hard on his left knee while
diving to trap a ball. McCutchen went 0-for-4, lowering his
batting average to .332. He leads the  San Francisco Giants ’
Buster Posey, who has a .331 average, in the race for the NL
batting crown.  The announced attendance at the game was 31,506.  To contact the reporter on this story:
