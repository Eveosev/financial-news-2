The European Agency for the
Cooperation of Energy Regulators will add 10 people next year to
its staff of 43 to enforce EU rules to stop manipulation in the
bloc’s power and natural gas markets.  ACER plans to “work intensively” on the Regulation for
Energy Market Integrity and Transparency, or Remit, in 2013 and
expects the framework of the rules to be in place by the
beginning of 2014, the Ljubljana, Slovenia-based agency said in
a work program published on its website yesterday.  ACER is due to publish guidance on how European utilities
such as  RWE AG (RWE)  and  GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  should report data on power and
natural gas outages under Remit by the end of September.  The agency may provide definitions of the data companies
need to publish concerning plant outages and how quickly they
are required to do so.  To contact the reporter on this story:
