LG Display Co. (034220) , the world’s second-
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, said it filed a
lawsuit against  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and Samsung Display Co.,
claiming they infringed its patents related to organic light-
emitting diode technology.  Samsung products, including the Galaxy S3 smartphone and
Galaxy Tab 7.7 tablet device, infringe LG’s patents, the Seoul-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today. LG, in a suit
filed with  Seoul  Central District Court, asked Samsung to stop
violating its patents and sought monetary damages, according to
the statement that didn’t provide further details.  The suit comes after LG employees were charged over theft
of technology from Samsung Mobile Display Co. in July. Samsung
Mobile, which has been merged with Samsung Display, at the time
requested LG formally apologize and take steps to prevent a
recurrence. Samsung Display said in an e-mailed statement today
it plans to consider a legal response to LG’s lawsuit if needed.  “This lawsuit has been filed both to enforce LG Display’s
intellectual property rights and promote fair competition,” LG
said in today’s statement.  LG Display fell 0.4 percent to close at 27,800 won, the
lowest since Sept. 13, while Samsung Electronics added 1 percent
to 1,338,000 won. The benchmark Kospi index rose 0.4 percent.
Samsung Display isn’t publicly traded.  OLED televisions are as thin as 4 millimeters (0.2 inch)
and produce sharper images than liquid-crystal-display models.
Shipments of OLED TVs may  surge 62-fold  to 2.1 million sets in
2015 from 34,000 in 2012, according to an estimate by Englewood,
Colorado-based  IHS Inc. (IHS) ’s iSuppli.  -- With assistance from Seyoon Kim in Seoul. Editors: Suresh
