Cepheid Inc. (CPHD) , a maker of medical
tests, plunged the most in two months after cutting its third-
quarter sales forecast.  Cepheid  declined  10 percent to $35.18 at the close in New
York, its biggest one-day drop since July 20.  Sales for the quarter will be $79 million to $81 million,
the Sunnyvale, California-based company said in a statement
yesterday. Interruptions in the supply of Xpert cartridge parts
will postpone more than $5 million in orders past the end of the
quarter, Cepheid said. The company left its full-year sales
forecast unchanged at $333 million to $347 million.  “We have notified customers that we are working diligently
to fulfill orders as quickly as possible, but this will take
several more weeks, pushing fulfillment of some orders from the
third quarter into the fourth quarter,” Chief Executive Officer
John Bishop said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
