The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose to the highest level in three weeks,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 28 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:13 a.m. in
 London , the most expensive since Sept. 5, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The cost has increased from minus 17 on
Sept. 14, the cheapest since June 2011.  The one-year basis swap was unchanged at 28 basis points,
or 0.28 percentage point, below Euribor.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending in euros, was unchanged yesterday at a record-low 0.222
percent. The benchmark, derived from a daily survey of banks for
the European Banking Federation, had fallen for 37 consecutive
days.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held near the lowest since March 2011. The
difference between Euribor and overnight indexed swaps, known as
the Euribor-OIS spread, was little changed at 13.9 basis points.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.096
percent yesterday from 0.092 the day before. The Eonia swap, an
estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the next
three months, was unchanged at 8.3 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday, placing 308 billion euros ($397 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based central bank from 307 billion euros the
day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
