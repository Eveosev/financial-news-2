Copper gained in  London  after
falling by the most in two months yesterday as lower prices
lured buyers on expectation of growth-supportive measures in
 China . Industrial metals climbed.  Three-month copper rose as much as 1.1 percent to $8,205 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $8,178 at
1:37 p.m. in Shanghai. It dropped as much as 2.3 percent
yesterday, the most since July 23, and is set for a quarterly
advance. December futures increased 0.5 percent to $3.73 a pound
on the Comex in  New York .  Markets in China will be closed next week for National Day
holidays, and the Chinese Communist Party is likely to convene
for the Congress held once every five years in a few weeks to
complete the leadership change. Industrial companies’ profits in
China dropped 6.2 percent from a year earlier to 381.2 billion
 yuan  ($60.4 billion), falling for a fifth month, the National
Bureau of Statistics said today.  “There should be a bit of buying from China on expectation
of growth-supportive policies after the Party Congress,” Shen Zhaoming, an analyst at Changjiang Futures Co., said by phone
from Shanghai. “The economy looks weak and the government needs
to do something. If they don’t do it now, they should do it
after the Party Congress.”  Any near-term strength may be good opportunity to sell as
prices may slide to $8,000 and possibly $7,800 in the next four
to six weeks as the stimulus fever burns out and market concern
about  Europe  and China return to the fore, Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said in a report today.  January-delivery copper fell 0.2 percent to 59,060 yuan
($9,368) a ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange. The metal for
immediate delivery was quoted at a discount of about 140 yuan
today to the front-month SHFE contract.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
