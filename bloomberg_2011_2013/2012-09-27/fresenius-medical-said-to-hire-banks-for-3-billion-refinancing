Fresenius Medical Care AG, the
worldâ€™s biggest provider of  kidney dialysis , hired banks for a
$3 billion debt refinancing, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America Merrill Lynch will
arrange the loans comprising term loan A and revolving credit
facilities, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the deal is private.  The banks are inviting other potential lenders to meetings
in Frankfurt tomorrow and in  New York  on Oct. 5, the people
said. Fresenius did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
