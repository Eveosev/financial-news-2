OAO Kubanenergo headed for a four-
month high on optimism that OAO MRSK Holding will offer a
premium to buy shares from minority investors in the Krasnodar-
based Russian electricity distributor.  Kubanenergo rose as much as 7.5 percent before trading up
4.9 percent at 122 rubles by 2:23 p.m. in Moscow, the highest
price since May 10 on a closing basis. MRSK Holding added 1.5
percent to 2.37 rubles. The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 0.2 percent.  MRSK,  Russia ’s holding company for interregional power
distributors, has been increasing its stake in Kubanenergo,
reaching 63 percent last week, according to a Sept. 21
statement. The company plans to make an offer to Kubanenergo’s
minority shareholders after receiving approval from the  Economy
Ministry , Interfax reported yesterday, citing Chief Financial
Officer Aleksey Demidov.  Alfa Bank  expects MRSK to offer shareholders 157.8 rubles a
share, or $5.06, according to an e-mailed report.  “We view the news as positive for Kubanenergo shares and
recommend investors participate in the buyback once it is
announced,” Alfa analysts led by Alexander Kornilov wrote in
the report. Given “huge” debt of 6.6 billion rubles, the
premium to Kubanenergo shares’ market price creates a “very
attractive exit opportunity.”  The deal may be closed by the end of the year, Troika
Dialog said in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
