Sugar imports, including smuggling,
into  China  may reach 3.8 million metric tons in 2011-2012, said
Liu Hande, vice chairman of the China Sugar Association.  The purchases in 2011-2012 have resulted in “overstock,”
said Liu. The Chinese government bought 1.5 million tons in
2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
