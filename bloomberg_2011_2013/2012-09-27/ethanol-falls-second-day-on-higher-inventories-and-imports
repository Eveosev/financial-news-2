Ethanol futures fell to a three-
month low in  Chicago  as imports compounded a supply glut.  Prices slipped a day after the Energy Department said
 inventories  in the week ended Sept. 21 were at 19.3 million
barrels, 11 percent higher than a year earlier, while  imports 
averaged 72,000 barrels a day, compared 37,000 last year.  “We’ve built up a lot of supply over the last three or
four weeks just because of the import situation,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “The stats look
pretty ugly for the seasonal time frame.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 0.4 cent to
$2.223 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest
settlement price since June 28. The futures have gained 0.9
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.30 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel dropped 3.5
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.305, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.305 a gallon and in Chicago the additive lost 1.5 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.22.  Gasoline for October delivery jumped 6.32 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $3.1443 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  The motor fuel widened its  premium  to ethanol to 92.13
cents from 85.41 yesterday, the highest since April 30.  Corn for December delivery decreased 8.5 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $7.1625 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
