Serbia plans to reduce government
subsidies by almost 20 percent in 2013 as it seeks to halve its
fiscal deficit.  The government will cut subsidies to 26 billion dinars
($290.9 million) from 32 billion dinars this year, Finance
Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  told reporters in Belgrade today.  The government will continue to subsidize “bank lending at
least through the first half of 2013 to ensure liquidity,”
Dinkic said. Subsidies to unprofitable companies will be reduced
to “encourage them to find a partner,” Dinkic said.  The economy will probably grow 2 percent next year, after
contracting by almost a full percentage point in 2012, he said.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, sworn in on July 27,
is trying to stave off bankruptcy, ensure enough funds to
finance the budget gap, pay pensions and public wages and keep
on servicing foreign creditors.  The government has yet to secured the support of the
 International Monetary Fund , which wants to see how Serbia
handles its deficit and central bank autonomy before committing
to a new loan program. The IMF suspended a $1.3 billion deal in
January on evidence the previous government was slipping on
agreed fiscal targets.  All government departments must submit their draft 2013
financing plans by Oct. 1 with clearly defined spending caps and
subsidy limits, Dinkic said.  The government will replace tax office managers by the end
of 2012 and step up controls of income and property of all
bankruptcy trustees who have been “slow and inefficient” in
completing bankruptcy procedures while receiving “high fees,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
