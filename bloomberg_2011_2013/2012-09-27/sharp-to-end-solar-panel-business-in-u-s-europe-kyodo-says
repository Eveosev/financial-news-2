Sharp Corp. (6753)  plans to end production
and sales of solar cells and modules in the U.S. and  Europe  by
March as part of a restructuring,  Kyodo News  said.  Sharp also plans to sell three manufacturing plants for
solar products in Japan’s Nara, Osaka and Toyama prefectures and
consolidate production at its Sakai plant, Kyodo reported today,
without saying where it got the information.  Sharp wasn’t the source of the report and nothing has been
decided, Miyuki Nakayama, a company spokeswoman, said by phone.  Osaka-based Sharp plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs, or
about 18 percent of its workforce, and is in talks to sell
plants as it tries to return to profit, two people with
knowledge of the proposal said yesterday.  The job cuts and sales of television factories in Mexico,
China and Malaysia, as well as U.S. solar developer Recurrent
Energy LLC, were in the plan Sharp presented to lenders Sept.
24, the people said, declining to be identified because the
matter isn’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
