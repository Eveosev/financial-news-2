Slovakia should collect 233 million
euros ($300 million) less in taxes next year, causing a need for
more austerity as the eastern euro-area member seeks to trim the
budget  deficit , Finance Minister Peter Kazimir said.  The revision, representing 0.3 percent of gross domestic
product, was driven by worsening prospects for economic  growth 
and lower-than-estimated corporate-tax receipts last year,
Kazimir said at a press conference in the Slovak capital,
Bratislava, today. In 2012, tax collection will fall 209 million
euros short of plan, the ministry projects.  Lower tax receipts jeopardize Premier  Robert Fico ’s efforts
to bring the fiscal gap below the European Union’s limit of 3
percent of GDP as early as next year to halt contagion from the
sovereign-debt crisis. The government will cut spending to make
sure the euro-area member since 2009 will meet its fiscal goals
“at any price,” Kazimir said.  The government has already adopted revenue-boosting
measures worth 300 million euros in 2012 and 1.2 billion euros
next year such as changes to the pension system and introduction
of special levies for selected industries. The administration is
working on legislation, which shall bring almost 500 million
euros more in 2013, mostly from higher income tax rates.  The 2011  budget deficit  will probably be revised to 5
percent of GDP, from 4.8 percent originally reported, Kazimir
also said. The budget for this year targets the gap at 4.6
percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
