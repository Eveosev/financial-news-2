Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  won a 25
percent reduction in a fine for its role in a bitumen industry
cartel, while other members including  Total SA (FP)  and Royal BAM
Group NV lost their appeals at a European Union court.  Shell’s fine was cut to 81 million euros ($104.2 million)
from 108 million euros because antitrust regulators failed to
show that the company “played the role of instigator and leader
in the infringement,” the EU General Court ruled today.  The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust watchdog, in
September 2006  fined 14 companies  266.7 million euros for fixing
the price of bitumen, a petroleum byproduct used to make
asphalt, over eight years on the Dutch market. Shell, whose fine
was increased for being a repeat offender, received the biggest
penalty.  BP Plc (BP/)  escaped a fine because it cooperated in the
probe, the commission said.  Dutch companies  Ballast Nedam (BALNE)  NV,  Heijmans NV (HEIJM) , Koninklijke
Volker Wessels Stevin NV, Royal BAM Group and Swedish company
Nynas AB lost their appeals today. Only a subsidiary of Ballast
Nedam had its liability for its fine reduced, while the total
fine on its parent was upheld today.  Total was fined 20.25 million euros, the third highest
penalty in the cartel, behind Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin,
which was told to pay 27.4 million euros.  Today’s ruling “proved that the decision to appeal in 2006
was well founded,” Wendel Broere, a spokesman for Shell in  The
Hague , said by phone.  Shell ‘Regrets’  “Shell does recognize that competition law was infringed”
and “regrets this,” said Broere. “Shell is committed to
complying with competition laws and we have an extensive
compliance program.”  Total,  Europe ’s third biggest oil company, didn’t
immediately respond to requests for comment to its press office.  The penalties were part of a crackdown on the  construction
industry  by the commission and regulators in EU countries such
as Finland and  Sweden .  The commission said at the time that the Dutch cartel was
led by Shell and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin. It was made
up of eight suppliers and six purchasers of road bitumen in the
Netherlands, according to the commission.  The cases are: T-343/06, T-344/06, T-347/06, T-348/06, T-
351/06, T-352/06, T-353/06, T-354/06, T-355/06, T-356/06, T-
357/06, T-359/06, T-360/06, T-361/06, T-362/06, T-370/06.  To contact the reporter on this story:
