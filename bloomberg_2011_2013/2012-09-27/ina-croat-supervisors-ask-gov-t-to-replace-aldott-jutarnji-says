The four Croatian supervisory board
members of  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , the Zagreb-based refiner
controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , asked the government to seek
dismissal of Zoltan Aldott, president of INA’s management board,
Jutarnji List reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Mol owns 49.1 percent and the government holds 44.84
percent of the refiner. The government in the last two years has
attempted to increase its influence in INA, after Mol won
controlling rights to Croatia’s largest refiner in a
shareholding agreement in 2009.  David Stern , president of the supervisory board, didn’t
answer calls to his mobile phone today. INA spokeswoman Marina
Burazer, declined to comment when contacted by phone in Zagreb
by Bloomberg New.  To contact the reporter on this story:
