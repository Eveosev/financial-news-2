San Francisco  Giants outfielder
Melky Cabrera won’t be included on the Major League Baseball
team’s postseason roster once he is eligible to return from his
50-game suspension for a violation of the sport’s drug policy.  The Giants will use the players that helped them clinch a
playoff spot over the last two months, manager Bruce Bochy said
today. The 28-year-old Cabrera, who was leading the National
League in hitting at the time of his suspension, would have been
eligible to return to the team after its fifth playoff game.  “While I am disappointed that I won’t have the chance to
join my team in the playoffs, I wish my teammates the best in
the postseason and I’ll be rooting hard for them to bring
another world championship to San Francisco,” Cabrera said
today in a statement released by the team.  Baseball in August announced that Cabrera would be
suspended 50 games for using the muscle-builder testosterone. He
admitted to taking the banned substance and accepted the
punishment.  Cabrera was hitting .346 with 11 home runs and 60 runs
batted in at the time of his suspension. Last week he removed
himself from consideration for the NL batting title, which he is
currently leading with less than a week remaining in the season.  The Giants, 90-65, have clinched the NL West division,
their second title in the past three seasons. The team is 26-12
since Cabrera’s last game.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
