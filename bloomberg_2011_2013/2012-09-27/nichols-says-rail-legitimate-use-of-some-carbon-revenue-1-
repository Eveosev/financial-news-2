The construction of a high-speed
rail line connecting California’s biggest cities would be a
“legitimate” use of some revenue generated from the state’s
auctions of carbon allowances, the state’s air chief said.  Using all of the money generated from the sale of carbon
permits for the rail project is “not the intent” of
California’s carbon program,  Mary Nichols , chairwoman of the
state’s Air Resources Board, said during a renewable energy
conference in San Francisco today. Each permit allows for the
release of one metric ton of emissions in the state.  California Governor  Jerry Brown  is counting on revenue from
the carbon program to help pay for the multibillion-dollar rail
line eventually linking San Francisco to  Los Angeles . A
legislative review panel in January questioned the project’s
long-term funding and recommended against selling debt to start
construction.  California carbon permits for December 2013 delivery
slipped 25 cents to $15.20 a metric ton, data compiled by  CME
Group Inc. (CME) ’s Green Exchange shows. Prices are down 25 percent
from this year’s high of $20.25 a metric ton in July.  The Air Resources Board is scheduled to hold an auction of
permits for the first two phases of carbon program on Nov. 14.
It will sell at least 21.8 million permits for the first phase
of the program starting in 2013 and at least 39.5 million for
the second phase beginning in 2015, according to an agency
notice Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
