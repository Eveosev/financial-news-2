U.S. stock futures maintained gains
as reports showed durable goods orders slid more than forecast
and the economy grew less than previously estimated in the
second quarter, while jobless claims decreased last week.
Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in December
rose 0.4 percent to 1,432.00 at 8:31 a.m. in  New York  after
climbing as much as 0.6 percent.  Total orders for durable goods, those meant to last at
least three years, plunged 13 percent, the most since January
2009, paced by a decline in demand for civilian
aircraft. Orders for non-defense capital equipment excluding
airplanes rose 1.1 percent after decreases of 5.2 percent in
July and 2.7 percent in June, the Commerce Department reported
today in Washington.  Second-quarter gross domestic product increased 1.3
percent, compared with a previous estimate of 1.7 percent.
Jobless claims fell by 26,000 to 359,000 last week.  The  S&P 500  has retreated for five straight days, trimming
this quarter’s advance to 5.2 percent. The index has erased all
its gains since the  Federal Reserve  announced Sept. 13 that it
will undertake a third round of quantitative easing. The Fed
said it will purchase mortgage-backed securities at a pace of
$40 billion per month until labor markets “improve
substantially.”  Futures increased earlier amid speculation China may
announce new stimulus measures.        A report today showed China’s industrial profits fell for a
fifth month, increasing speculation the government will do more
to support economic growth. Net income dropped 6.2 percent from
a year earlier to 381.2 billion  yuan  ($60.4 billion), the
National Bureau of Statistics said. China may further cut banks’
reserve requirements or  interest rates  if external demand
worsens, Chen Yulu, an academic adviser to the People’s Bank of
 China , told reporters in Beijing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
