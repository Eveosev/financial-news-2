Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer,
plans to increase its share of offshore oil profits because of
“prevailing realities” in the industry, Petroleum Minister
Diezani Alison-Madueke said.  The Petroleum Industry Bill, which was sent to Parliament
in July, proposes to boost the government’s share to 73 percent
from 61 percent, Alison-Madueke said today in an e-mailed
statement from the capital, Abuja.  “The proposed increase of government take to about 73
percent is not only competitive but considerate when we look at
the scale of other entities around the world,” she said, citing
Norway, Indonesia and Angola as examples. Previous terms
introduced in 1993 were based on an oil price of $20 a barrel,
and are no longer realistic because “crude prices have been on
the upward swing,” she said.  The bill, which seeks to reform the way the oil industry of
Africa’s top producer is regulated and funded, was initially
introduced to parliament more than three years ago. Lawmakers
were unable to pass it before the end of the last legislative
session in May 2011.  Energy companies including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Chevron
Corp. (CVX) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  said in a joint
presentation to lawmakers in 2009 that the proposed tax
increases would make exploration “uneconomical.” They pump
more than 90 percent of the country’s oil through ventures with
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
