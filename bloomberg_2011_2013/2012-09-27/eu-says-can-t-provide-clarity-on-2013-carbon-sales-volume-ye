The European Union can’t yet
provide clarity on the exact volumes of carbon permits to be
auctioned in 2013, according to Peter Zapfel, emissions
coordinator at the European Commission.  The EU is analyzing data from member states on the
allocation of free permits next year, he told a conference in
Brussels today. Zapfel also said the EU is working on changes to
the bloc’s carbon registry to cover “a number of issues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
