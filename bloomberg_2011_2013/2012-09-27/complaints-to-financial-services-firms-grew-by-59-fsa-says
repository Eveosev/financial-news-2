Complaints to U.K. financial
services firms increased by 59 percent, largely driven by
payment protection insurance, or PPI, the Financial Services
Authority said in a statement.  A  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  unit received the largest number
of complaints on general insurance and pure protection in the
first six months of 2012 with 81 percent of the complaints
upheld by the firm, according to data  published  on the FSA’s
website today. Santander UK Plc attracted the most complaints on
banking and home finance for the same period.  British regulators said last year that consumers may
receive as much as 9 billion pounds ($14.6 billion) in
compensation as a result of improper sales of PPI. The FSA said
in June that banks will also repay small and medium-sized
businesses for improperly sold interest-rate derivatives.  Customers who bought PPI rarely compared prices and terms
or switched providers, and usually weren’t aware they could have
purchased it from other companies, the U.K.’s Competition
Commission has said.  Lloyds said complaints, excluding PPI and general
insurance, fell by 18 percent and banking complaints were down
21 percent.  “This is equivalent to 1.4 complaints per 1,000 customers,
compared to 1.7 at the same point last year and 2.1 at the end
of 2010,” according to an e-mailed statement from Emma
Partridge, a spokeswoman for Lloyd’s Halifax unit. “On this
basis the group continues to receive fewer complaints than any
other bank.”  Banking complaints rose by 5 percent during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
