India ’s rupee rose toward the
highest level since May after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s
steps to curb the  budget deficit  and attract investment lured
foreigners to the nation’s assets.  Overseas investors pumped $2.7 billion into local  stocks 
since Sept. 13, the day the government announced it was cutting
fuel subsidies, exchange data show. The BSE India  Sensitive
Index (SENSEX)  of shares gained 3.7 percent in the period and foreign
funds  bought  $196 million of rupee-denominated debt. Indian
policy makers are unlikely to curb the currency’s gains,
according to Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.  The rupee “offers greater prospects for  capital
appreciation  should the rally in equity markets continue,”
analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman, including New York-based
chief currency strategist  Marc Chandler , wrote in a report to
clients today. In Asia, the currency is probably one of the
“best prospects for carry trades,” they wrote.  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 53.3600 per dollar as of
10.17 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 53.0550 on Sept. 24, the strongest level since May 10,
and has gained 4.1 percent in September. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to
11.16 percent.  Best Performer  The rupee is Asia’s best-performing currency this quarter,
strengthening 4.3 percent against the dollar. It lost 8.6
percent in the three months through June.  India’s finance ministry reduced a tax on local companies’
overseas borrowing to 5 percent from 20 percent on Sept. 21. In
a rare prime-time speech to the nation the same day, Prime
Minister Singh vowed to introduce more policy changes after
cutting fuel subsidies and allowing foreign investment in
industries including retail and aviation.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 54.31 per dollar,
compared with 54.46 yesterday, and offshore non-deliverable
contracts were at 53.97 from 54.14. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
