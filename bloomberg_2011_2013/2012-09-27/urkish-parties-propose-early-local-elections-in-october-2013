Turkeyâ€™s ruling Islamic-rooted
party and a nationalist opposition group proposed a
constitutional amendment to hold early local elections on Oct.
27, 2013, the Anatolia news agency said.  The  Justice and Development Party  and the Nationalist
Action Party submitted a joint petition to the parliament for
the necessary amendment, the state-run agency said.  The elections were originally scheduled for 2014, when the
country was also expected to hold a presidential vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
