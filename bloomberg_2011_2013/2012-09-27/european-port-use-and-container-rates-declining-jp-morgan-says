Port usage in northern  Europe  is
falling as the shipment of manufactured goods declines, amid an
oversupply of vessels that’s keeping container lines’ earnings
below break-even levels on the Asia-to-Europe route, JPMorgan
said.  The following are comments from Christopher Combe, head of
transport, equity research at the Capital Link 5th Annual
International Shipping and Marine Services Forum in London
today.  “Given the massive overcapacity in the shipping sector,
rates have now gone below cash break-even for the operators and
they are pushing in a very big way for rate increases. Time will
tell how successful they’ll be. We suspect it’s going to be very
tough.”  On utilization rates for northern Europe ports:  “We’re at the point where we are near bottom. How long
we’ll stay there is not very certain. The key is that average
utilization across the northern European ports is about 85
percent. It’s very difficult to get any pricing power. It’s
currently, at best, close to 80 perhaps or just below. There are
no real signs of confidence that we’re anywhere near the point
where pricing power emerges.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
