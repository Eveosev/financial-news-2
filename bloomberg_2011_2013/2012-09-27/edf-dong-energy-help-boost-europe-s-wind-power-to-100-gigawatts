The European Union has reached 100
gigawatts of installed wind-energy capacity, equivalent to the
output of 62 coal-fired power stations, the  European Wind Energy
Association  said.  After the 27-nation bloc took two decades to reach 10
gigawatts, it’s taken just 13 years to add a further 90
gigawatts, the EWEA said today in an e-mailed statement. New
projects from  Denmark  to Greece by developers including Dong
Energy A/S and EDF Energies Nouvelles contributed to the total.  The EU, which has a target to cut carbon-dioxide emissions
by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, is expanding clean-
energy projects from wind to solar to replace aging coal plants
and reduce reliance on fossil-fuel imports. Growth has been
subsidized by government incentives including above-market rates
paid to generators of renewable power.  “It would require burning 72 million tons of coal annually
in coal-fired  power plants  to match Europe’s annual wind-energy
production,” EWEA Chief Executive Officer Christian Kjaer said
in the statement. “Loading that amount of coal on trains would
require 750,000 wagons with a combined length of 11,500
kilometers (7,150 miles) -- the distance from Brussels to  Buenos
Aires .”  U.K. Growth  Offshore wind capacity in the U.K., the world’s largest
market for marine wind farms, exceeded 2.5 gigawatts this month
for the first time,  RenewableUK  said in a separate statement.
The opening today of the 317-megawatt  Sheringham Shoal  project
off eastern  England  means Britain now has 2.67 gigawatts of wind
turbines installed at sea, enough to provide electricity for 1.8
million homes, the lobby group said.  Wind turbines  generated about 4.5 percent of the U.K.’s
power supply in the second quarter, the government said today.
In the EU, about 5 percent of electricity came from wind last
year, while more than half was from conventional fossil fuels,
28 percent from nuclear energy and 13 percent from hydropower,
Eurostat statistics show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
