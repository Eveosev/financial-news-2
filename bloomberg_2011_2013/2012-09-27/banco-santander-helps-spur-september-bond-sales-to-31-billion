European banks led by  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  took advantage of demand for higher yields than on
government debt to spur September’s financial bond issuance to
23.9 billion euros ($31 billion), the busiest month since June.  Spain’s biggest bank priced 2.5 billion euros of senior
unsecured debt due 2016, the largest single issue from a
financial company this month. A total 26.7 billion euros of debt
was issued in June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investor sentiment, roiled by strains developing in the
Spanish and Italian economies, improved after European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  vowed in a July 26 speech to take
whatever action was required to save the euro. The assurance
opened a window for peripheral borrowers, which started to close
this week as Spain’s debt crisis worsened.  “Things are in line with the positive sentiment toward the
periphery we’ve seen following Draghi’s ‘whatever it takes’
speech,” said  Suki Mann , head of credit strategy at Societe
Generale SA in London. “It’s still expensive, still fairly
stressed and we’re seeing mainly the best names, but it has been
feeding into the general sentiment.”  Lenders including  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS) ,
which has had to borrow 3.4 billion euros from the Italian
state, were able to sell senior unsecured debt. Italy’s third-
largest bank issued 500 million euros of 4.875 percent bonds due
2014 priced to yield 497 basis points more than German debt. The
spread is now 495 basis points, Bloomberg generic prices show.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain’s second-biggest
bank, raised 2.5 billion euros in two deals, one of 1 billion
euros due in 2014 and the rest in 4.375 percent notes due 2015.  The yield premium on the 2014 bond was 362 basis points,
compared with a spread of 285 basis points between German and
Spanish government debt of similar maturity on the sale date.
The 2015 debt offered a spread of 429 basis points, 84 basis
points more than the spread on  government securities .  To contact the reporter on this story:
