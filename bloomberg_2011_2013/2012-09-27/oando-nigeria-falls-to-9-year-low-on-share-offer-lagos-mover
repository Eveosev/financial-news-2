Oando Plc (OANDO) , the Nigerian energy
company that announced a share offer yesterday, fell to the
lowest in nine years on concern the amount raised will be
insufficient to cover debt.  The stock dropped by the daily limit of 5 percent to close
at 12.21 naira in Lagos, its lowest since May 2003.  Oando will raise 35 billion naira ($222 million) in an
offer to existing shareholders in the fourth quarter to cut debt
and increase crude exploration, Chief Executive Officer Wale Tinubu said in a statement yesterday to the  Johannesburg Stock
Exchange . He gave no details of Oando’s debts.  “Investors’ perception is that compared to the company’s
debts, the amount they are raising is too small,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Kundila Finance Ltd., said
by phone today.  Oando has expanded its operations in  Africa ’s top oil
producer to include crude and gas exploration and production,
with additional plans to build a fuel-receiving terminal and
refinery in  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, Lagos.  Oando shares have fallen 45 percent this year, compared
with a 24 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
