General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
largest maker of  jet engines  and diesel locomotives, climbed the
most in three weeks after raising its forecast for sales growth
at its industrial units.  Revenue at GE’s industrial businesses will rise about 10
percent this year, topping the previous forecast for a gain of 5
percent to 10 percent, according to a presentation today from
the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company. The shares jumped 2.9
percent to $22.73 at the close in  New York .  “We like the industrial portfolio and think it’s going to
deliver double-digit growth,” Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  said at a meeting with analysts and investors in
Ossining, New York.  Sales in excess of GE’s forecast would be a bright spot
among U.S. industrial stocks. Analysts pared profit estimates
for industrial companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index by
1.05 percent for this quarter and by 0.9 percent for the last
three months of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Both results trailed the average for the index, the data showed.  Earnings per share will experience “double-digit growth”
this year and in 2013, Immelt said, without giving a figure.
Analysts project an adjusted profit of $1.54 a share in 2012 and
$1.74 next year, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Acquisition Focus  Immelt said his focus for acquisitions will be on targets
in the $1 billion to $3 billion range. While GE signaled
interest this week in mining-equipment and service suppliers as
part of a new unit focused on the industry, Immelt said today
that investors should oppose a big underground mining deal.  His comment seemed to rule out interest in  Joy Global Inc. (JOY) ,
a company that stirred speculation among analysts and investors
as a takeover candidate after the creation of the GE Mining
division. Milwaukee-based Joy climbed 1.7 percent to $57.35.  GE’s advance extended its gain for the year to 27 percent,
outpacing the 15 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. Today’s increase was the most since Sept. 6, and marked
the highest closing price since Oct. 1, 2008.  Industrial revenue in growth markets from  Canada  to  Brazil 
to  Russia  will grow at a double-digit pace this year from $33
billion in 2011, according to GE, which reported getting 53
percent of 2011 sales from outside the U.S., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Operating Profit  Operating profit margin growth will be 30 basis points to
50 basis points this year and 50 basis points to 70 basis points
in 2013, GE said, reaffirming earlier comments. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  GE will have $100 billion in cash available for 2012 to
2016 from sources including internal payouts from its financial
unit and cash flow from industrial businesses, the company said.  The biggest use of that  cash  will be for mergers and
acquisitions and stock buybacks, with a goal of reducing the
shares outstanding to less than 10 billion, GE said. The total
was 10.6 billion shares as of July 1, according to the company’s
most-recent quarterly regulatory filing.  “We’re going to be very disciplined with cash and
extremely focused on creating  shareholder value ,” Immelt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
