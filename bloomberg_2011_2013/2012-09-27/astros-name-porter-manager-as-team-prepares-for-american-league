Bo Porter was hired as manager of
the Houston Astros after two seasons as third-base coach for the
Washington Nationals.  Porter, a 40-year-old Houston resident, will remain with
the Nationals until their Major League Baseball play ends in the
postseason, Astros owner  Jim Crane  announced today at a news
conference.  Porter previously coached with the Arizona Diamondbacks and
Florida Marlins. He managed the Jamestown Jammers, a Marlins
affiliate in the New York-Pennsylvania League, in 2006.  The Astros are coming off the two worst seasons in the
franchiseâ€™s 51-year history. They lost a team-high 106 games
last year and are 51-105 with six games remaining in 2012. Tony DeFrancesco, who took over on an interim basis after the team
fired Brad Mills in August, will manage the team until the end
of the season.  The Astros move to the  American League  from the National
League next season. The team intends to change its color scheme
and unveil new uniforms, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
