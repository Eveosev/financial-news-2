Rubber rebounded from a two-week
low as speculation grew that  China  may take additional measures
to bolster growth, boosting demand from the world’s largest user
for the commodity used to make tires.  March-delivery rubber settled 0.5 percent higher at 254.6
yen a kilogram ($3,277 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange after dropping to 249 yen, the lowest level since Sept.
14. The most-active contract has climbed 6 percent this quarter,
trimming this year’s loss to 3.3 percent.  China’s stocks  jumped by the most in three weeks on
speculation the government will announce measures to bolster the
equities market after the Shanghai Composite Index fell below
the 2,000-point level yesterday. Chinese industrial companies’
profits dropped for a fifth month in August, adding to signs the
nation’s economic slowdown is extending into a seventh quarter.  “The market was buoyed by speculation for additional
stimulus by China,” Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE
Koeki Co. in Tokyo, said today by e-mail.  Futures were also supported by a plan of the world’s three
largest producers to reduce rubber exports from October to buoy
prices, he said.  Thailand , Indonesia and  Malaysia , representing
70 percent of world output, agreed to cut supply by 450,000 tons
by curbing shipments and destroying aging trees.  January-delivery rubber rose 1 percent to close at 24,080
 yuan  ($3,821) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 96.65 baht ($3.12) a
kilogram, according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
