Democratic Republic  of Congo’s
central bank lowered its benchmark  interest rate  by 1.5
percentage points to 6 percent, citing macro-economic stability
and low inflation as the reasons for the cut.  Congo’s economy should expand about 7.2 percent and
inflation should be below the targeted 9.9 percent this year,
the Monetary Policy Committee said in a Sept. 25 statement
published on the bank’s  website  today. Annualized inflation was
5.95 percent as of Sept. 23, the bank said.  “The three main markets, namely goods and services,
foreign exchange, and monetary, are characterized by a
remarkable stability,” the bank said.  Congo posted 6.9 percent growth and 15.23 percent inflation
last year, the bank said in February. Increased commodity prices
and construction spurred the economy last year, it said. The
Central African country produces about 4 percent of the world’s
copper, has around half the world’s cobalt reserves, and has
deposits of gold, diamonds and tin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
