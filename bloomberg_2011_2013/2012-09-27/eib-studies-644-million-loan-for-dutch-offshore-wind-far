The  European Investment Bank  is
considering a 500 million-euro ($644 million) loan for a Dutch
offshore wind project developed by Typhoon Offshore BV.  The loan will help finance construction and operation of
the 2.6 billion-euro North Sea project, the European Union’s
lending arm said in a website  statement . No timeframe was given
for possible approval.  Typhoon Offshore, a unit of clean energy investment company
Typhoon Capital BV, is developing the 600-megawatt park 85
kilometers (53 miles) north of the Dutch island of
Schiermonnikoog, according to the company’s website.  The company plans to reach financial close next summer on
the project, where loans are agreed on and their draw-down
possible, Typhoon Offshore Managing Director Michael van der
Heijden said today by phone from Amsterdam, where the company is
based.  Typhoon Offshore is in “detailed discussions” with export
credit agencies including  Denmark ’s Eksport Kredit Fonden and
commercial banks about funding the project, which will use 70
percent of senior debt with the remainder a mix of equity and
“junior debt,” he said.  Siemens AG (SIE)  will supply turbines to the venture which will
power 785,000 homes a year when built, he said. First power from
the plant is expected by late 2015 or early 2016.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
