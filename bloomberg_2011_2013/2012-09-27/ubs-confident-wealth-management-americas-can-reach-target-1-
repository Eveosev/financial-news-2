UBS AG (UBSN) ’s wealth management Americas
division is “confident” it can achieve a $1 billion pretax
profit target, according to Brian Hull, vice chairman of the
unit.  “We believe we can do this without any help from the
market,” Hull said at a presentation to investors in  London 
today. “We had very modest expectations of the market when we
set this goal.”  The division of the Zurich-based bank, headed by  Robert McCann , reported a pretax profit of $420 million in the first
half of this year. It can boost earnings by increasing lending
and providing the right advice to clients, Hull said.  “Our advisers have been working hard to deliver the right
advice to clients,” he said, adding that investing in
relationships rather than just selling products positions the
bank well to  profit  in the future.  While customers’ risk appetite is still low, judging from
internal and external surveys the mood may be improving, Hull
said.  “At the margin, we get the sense that investors are
slightly more positive than they were a year ago,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
