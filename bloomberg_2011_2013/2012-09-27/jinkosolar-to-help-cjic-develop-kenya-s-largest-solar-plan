JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , a Chinese
solar panel maker, will help China Jiangxi Corp. for
International Economic & Technical Cooperation, or CJIC, develop
a 50-megawatt solar park in Kenya.  The manufacturer agreed to provide solar panels and
technical support for the photovoltaic plant at Garissa in the
northwest of the country, according to a statement today. The
grid-connected project will generate about 76,474 megawatt hours
each year, helping reduce coal consumption, it said.  Upon completion, the project will be Kenya’s largest solar
park and one of the biggest in sub-Saharan Africa, according to
the company. Plants of more than 50 megawatts have only been
announced in  South Africa  and Namibia, while the largest
operating in the region is a 5-megawatt plant in  Cape Verde ,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance data show.  In August, Jingkosolar agreed to supply 1 megawatt of
panels to a chrome mine in South Africa and said it sees
opportunities for solar power in the country.  CJIC, a contractor, has experience building infrastructure
projects such as hydroelectric plants and roads in African
countries.
