The U.S. congressman who held 22
hearings over a year and a half that tracked public backlash
against the  Transportation Security Administration  said he’s
ready to offer legislation to save the agency from itself.  “The truth is this is a very dangerous world,”
Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Transportation
Security Subcommittee, said in an interview. “TSA not surviving
isn’t an option. We have got to make it, though, smarter and
leaner.”  The Alabama Republican said he plans to offer a proposal
next year, and its chances will improve if Republicans win
control of the Senate in the November elections. The legislation
would be shaped to force change onto a reluctant agency and
congressional Democrats while blunting calls from within his own
party to eliminate the TSA altogether, he said.  The legislation would give airports more power to hire
private contractors for screening and make it tougher for the
TSA to refuse, Rogers says. It also would scale back passenger
pat-downs; require changes in how the agency buys screening
equipment; mandate periodic reassessments of security
procedures; and possibly eliminate the agency’s list of items
that can’t be carried onto planes, he said.  “There’s not another department inside the U.S. government
that interacts with the American public more intimately and on a
more regular basis than the TSA,” said Rick “Ozzie” Nelson,
director of the homeland security and counter-terrorism program
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
 Washington . “As long as every conversation about the TSA starts
with a horror story, we’re not going to have the agency we
want.”  ‘TSA’s Responsible’  Congress has an important oversight role and TSA has to be
able to work with lawmakers, agency Administrator  John Pistole 
said in an interview.  “If something goes wrong today at Dulles, I don’t think
people will be blaming Congress,” Pistole said, referring to
Washington Dulles International Airport. “They might, but
they’ll definitely be looking at TSA. It’s good to have ideas
and suggestions and everything, but ultimately somebody’s
responsible for it -- and TSA’s responsible.”  The Senate has been more satisfied with TSA. In contrast to
repeated House hearings under Rogers, the Senate Commerce
Committee, headed by West Virginia Democrat  Jay Rockefeller , has
held one general oversight hearing in the past two years.
Despite “growing pains” in TSA’s 10 years of existence, the
agency has become leaner and more nimble under Pistole,
Rockefeller said in a statement today.  Evolving Threats  “Every agency must efficiently and wisely use taxpayer
money,” Rockefeller said. “Congress will continue to conduct
oversight of TSA’s programs and policies to make certain the
agency has the resources necessary to meet evolving threats.”  The size of TSA’s workforce, and especially the number of
airport screeners, has been a particular focus of Republican
lawmakers. About $5.3 billion of the TSA’s $7.8 billion budget
and almost 95 percent of its 55,722 employees are devoted to
 aviation security , according to the Homeland Security
Department’s most recent budget request.  House Transportation Committee Chairman  John Mica , another
Republican eager to scale back TSA, wrote language into this
year’s  Federal Aviation Administration  authorization bill to
force TSA to approve airports’ applications to hire private
screening companies unless it can demonstrate that the change
wouldn’t improve security.  Before that bill passed,Pistole had ordered a freeze on
moves to private screeners besides the 16 airports where they
had been approved. Pistole said he still isn’t convinced that
private companies will reduce costs, and said federal screeners
can respond more rapidly to changing security threats.  Philosophical Difference  “The notion that all-privatized is all better -- I have a
philosophical difference with him on that,” Pistole said.
“Whether every airport is privatized or TSA provides the
security, the taxpayer is still paying.”  TSA compared costs at airports using private screeners
versus government employees in a 2011 study, concluding that
private screeners cost 3 percent more, according to the
Government Accountability Office.  Orlando Sanford International Airport, Sacramento
International Airport and three Montana airports have sought to
switch to private screeners since the FAA bill passed. The TSA
has given the airports preliminary approval to seek proposals
from prospective contractors.  Private Screeners  The shortcoming in that approach, according to a staff
report published this month by Rogers’s subcommittee, is that
most airports don’t want to risk the TSA’s wrath by seeking
permission to replace the agency’s screeners. An alternative,
Rogers said, would be to create a list of pre-approved screening
contractors that airports could choose from, leaving the TSA to
supervise security.  Private screeners, employed at the time by the airlines,
failed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said J. David Cox,
national president of the American Federation of Government
Employees, the union that represents TSA screeners.  Companies may underbid to win contracts that will appear at
first to save money, Cox said. Experience throughout the
government shows that costs rise as contracts grow more
complicated, he said.  “This country has been there and done that,” Cox said.
“We saw what a disaster it was.”  Airports’ Decisions  Airports will support Rogers’s approach on screeners, said
Deborah McElroy, executive vice president of policy and external
affairs at the Airports Council International-North America, a
Washington-based trade group. Some airport managers prefer
contractors while others think their relationship with the TSA
is fine, she said.  “We strongly believe that airports should make the
decision,” McElroy said. “If the airports decide to do it,
there shouldn’t be barriers.”  TSA has wasted a great deal of money through procurement
mistakes, such as the $29.6 million purchase of 207 explosives-
detecting “puffer” machines that didn’t work in an airport
environment, Rogers said. Machines intended to read boarding
passes and check for fraudulent documents may cost more than
$100 million without a clear justification of the cost,
according to the report by Rogers’s staff.  “We waste a lot of money jumping through too quickly to
buy the latest and greatest shiny thing,” Rogers said.  Wanting to change TSA is easier than doing it, said Kip Hawley, who ran the agency under President  George W. Bush  from
2005 to 2009.  A lawmaker proposing an overhaul would probably be invited
to a closed-door briefing about the hundreds of known al-Qaeda
operatives and how a small chunk of C4 plastic explosive could
down an airplane, Hawley said. It’s easier to add security steps
than eliminate them, he said.  Pain Cycle  Still, the public perception of the TSA, dominated by
stories of encounters between low-risk passengers and
overzealous agency officers, has created tension in airports
that hurts security, Hawley said.  “It’s a cycle of pain that appears endless,” Hawley said.  No congressman wants to be held responsible for changes to
security that backfire, said Jeff Price, an aviation consultant
with Leading Edge Strategies in Denver,  Colorado .  “If you’re the one who successfully made the switch, and
there’s another terrorist attack, not only are lives lost, but
you can kiss your career goodbye,” Price said.  Teenaged Awkwardness  Rogers said there’s more risk in not giving TSA direction.  “It’s like a teenager,” Rogers said. “Their limbs are
growing faster than their coordination. It was understandable
that they would have some problems, just like teenagers do.
We’re at the point now where people expect more maturity.”  Rogers says he hasn’t acted so far because it was clear the
Senate, controlled by Democrats, wouldn’t go along.  When he does propose a bill, Rogers said he expects to see
amendments proposed to eliminate the agency. He said he’ll work
to prevent those from getting enough votes.  Still, he said, sentiment among  House Republicans  to
dismantle the TSA is growing and agency officials aren’t taking
that threat seriously enough.  “I’ve got a lot of folks who want to get rid of TSA, a
bunch of them,” Rogers said.  Keeping it from being killed may be as far as Rogers is
willing to go to protect it.  “This is not just a passing period of time they can
endure,” Rogers said. “I’m not going anywhere. I will be here
for a very long time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
