I.M. Skaugen SE said its liquefied
petroleum gas and chemical carrier, Norgas Cathinka, was safely
anchored after colliding with a passenger ferry yesterday near
the Indonesian port of Merak.  The master of the vessel, its chief officer and a seaman
are assisting the local police, Oslo-based Skaugen said today in
a statement.  “It’s our firm intention to co-operate in every way we can
with the on-going investigations,” said Morits Skaugen, chief
executive officer of Skaugen.  The vessel collided with a so-called Ro Ro passenger ferry.
At least eight people on the ferry died and rescuers saved 208
passengers, Budi Harto, head of the national disaster agency in
 Indonesia ’s Lampung province, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
