U.K. demand for oil products in
July fell to the lowest level for the month since 2002,
according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change.  Consumption dropped by 2.5 percent to 5.25 million metric
tons from a year earlier, according to the  report  published on
the U.K. government departmentâ€™s website. Demand rose on the
previous month.  Consumption of  gasoline  dropped by 5.6 percent to 1.1
million tons in July, the lowest figure for the month in at
least 14 years, according to the report.  Diesel demand in July was 1.8 million tons, little changed
from a year earlier. Jet fuel consumption rose to 1 million
tons, up 3.8 percent from a year earlier, DECC said.  Refinery throughput in the U.K. fell to 18.2 million tons
in the three months to July, a drop of 5.7 percent from the
equivalent period in 2011 with the closure of the Coryton
refinery a contributory factor, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
