The  National Hockey League  canceled
the rest of the exhibition season as its lockout of the players’
union goes on.  The NHL had earlier called off preseason games through
Sept. 30 and is preparing for a four-day work week for office
staff starting Oct. 1. The regular season is scheduled to start
on Oct. 11.  The league locked out players after their collective
bargaining agreement expired on Sept. 15. The two sides are at
odds over revenue sharing and player compensation. The NHL made
a record $3.2 billion in revenue last season.  The two sides are scheduled to resume discussions tomorrow,
the first meeting since the league and players rejected each
other’s proposals on Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
