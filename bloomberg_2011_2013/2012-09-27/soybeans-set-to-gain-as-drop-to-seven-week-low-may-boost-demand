Corn fell to an 11-week low after a
government report showed U.S. exports have slipped since prices
rallied to a record last month. Soybeans also declined.  U.S. exporters sold 368 metric tons in the week ended Sept.
20, compared with 69,578 tons a week earlier, the Department of
Agriculture said today. Corn prices are down about 15 percent
since the worst U.S. drought in half a century spurred a rally
to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10. Wheat export sales at
about 426,000 tons were 13 percent below a week earlier.  The export sales report “was disgusting on corn,” Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting
in Lafayette,  Indiana , said by phone. “For wheat, even though
sales were down from the four-week average, they were a little
better than I was expecting.”  Corn for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to $7.19 a
bushel at 8:07 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, after
touching $7.185, the lowest for a most-active contract since
July 12. Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$15.66 a bushel.  Wheat for December-delivery fell 0.1 percent to $8.6825 a
bushel in Chicago. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat
dropped 0.3 percent to 260.50 euros ($335.34) a metric ton on
NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
