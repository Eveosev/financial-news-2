Cyprus’s state-run natural gas
supplier, known as  Defa , invited investors to express interest
in supplying the company with natural gas until September 2018,
when Cyprus expects to exploit its own gas reserves.  Defa wants to proceed quickly and aims to pick a winner by
year end, the Nicosia-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Interested companies can suggest any means to supply and
transport natural gas, irrespective of the technology used,
while the process of finding a supplier will only proceed if the
price allows for a significant reduction in the cost to produce
electricity in Cyprus, Defa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
