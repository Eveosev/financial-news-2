(Corrects a.m. to p.m. in fourth paragraph.)  Gold rose the most in two weeks on
speculation that  China  will announce more stimulus measures to
support economic growth, boosting demand for the precious metal
as a store of value.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits dropped for a fifth
month in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said today.
The Shanghai Securities News reported that there is speculation
that the government will announce market-boosting measures. Gold
has surged 11 percent this quarter as the  Federal Reserve 
announced a third round of stimulus measures to increase growth.  “News out of China is positive for gold,” Carlos Perez- Santalla, a broker at PVM Futures Inc. in Hoboken, New Jersey,
said in a telephone interview. “Prices continue to remain well
supported from the Fed announcement.”  Gold futures for December delivery advanced 1.5 percent to
settle at $1,780.50 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest gain since Sept. 13. Prices have risen 14
percent this year.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 2.1 percent to
$34.666 an ounce in New York, the biggest increase since Sept.
13.  Platinum futures for January delivery jumped 0.7 percent to
$1,651.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , a third
straight gain.  Strikes at  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the largest
producer of the metal, may lead to job losses after at least
21,000 staff halted work without following required dispute
resolution procedures, Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith
said yesterday. The company said in an e-mailed statement that
it began disciplinary action today that may lead to dismissals.  A six-week walkout at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana mine erupted
into violence, with 46 killed, including 34 shot by police last
month. The miners won wage gains of as much as 22 percent.  Palladium futures for December delivery gained 1.5 percent
to $635.40 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
