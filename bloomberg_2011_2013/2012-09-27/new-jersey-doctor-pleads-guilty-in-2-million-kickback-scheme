A  New Jersey  doctor who ran a
medical-resonance imaging center pleaded guilty to directing a
kickback scheme that prosecutors said led to $2 million in
business from doctors who took payments for patient referrals.  Ashokkumar Bararia, 62, pleaded guilty today in federal
court in Newark, New Jersey, where prosecutors charged 13
doctors and a nurse practitioner on Dec. 13 for taking illegal
payments to refer patients to Orange Community LLC in Orange,
New Jersey.  Bararia was the medical director and “owner-in-fact” of
Orange Community, according to a criminal charge that said he
negotiated, approved and paid kickbacks of $25 to $100 for
diagnostic tests referred between 2008 and 2011. The center
provided diagnostic tests such as MRIs, computed axial
tomographies, ultrasound imaging and echocardiograms.  Bararia faces as many as five years in prison. He was
released on $500,000 bail after appearing in court.  His attorney, Joseph D. Mancano of Philadelphia, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the plea.  The case is U.S. v. Bararia, U.S. District Court, District
of New Jersey ( Newark ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
