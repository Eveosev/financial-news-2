The lira strengthened for a third
day, heading for its strongest level in almost seven weeks,
before “hefty” quarterly tax payments and repurchase
agreements redemptions tomorrow.  The Turkish currency appreciated less than 0.1 percent to
1.7898 per dollar at 4:18 p.m. in Istanbul, the highest on a
closing basis since Aug. 10, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.56 percent.  Turkish lenders will see “hefty outflows” of 15.5 billion
liras ($8.7 billion) tomorrow due to tax payments and repo
redemptions, Erkin Isik, strategist at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) ,
said. Maximum repo funding central bank can provide on that day
is 10.5 billion liras via its one-week and one-month repurchase
agreements auctions, Isik said.  Turkey ’s trade deficit will probably narrow to $8 billion
in August from a revised $8.4 billion a year earlier, according
to a Bloomberg survey of seven economists. The data is due for
release tomorrow. The gap shrank 14 percent from a year earlier
to $7.9 billion in July, narrowing for the nine month on an
annual basis.  The central bank lent 4 billion liras at 5.75 percent in
its one-week repurchase agreements auction today, compared with
3.5 billion liras yesterday and 2 billion liras a week ago,
according to the Ankara-based bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
