The following is the text of
 Canada ’s employment, earnings, and hours report for July
released by  Statistics Canada .  In July, average weekly earnings of non-farm payroll
employees were $906.68, up 1.1% from the previous month. On a
year-over-year basis, earnings increased 4.1%.  The 4.1% increase during the 12 months to July reflects a
number of factors, including wage growth, changes in the
composition of employment, as well as average hours worked per
week. In July, non-farm payroll employees worked an average of
32.9 hours per week, down from 33.1 the month before but up from
32.8 in July 2011.  Average weekly earnings by sector  Year-over-year growth in average weekly earnings outpaced
the national average of 4.1% in five of the largest industrial
sectors: professional, scientific and technical services;
educational services; accommodation and food services;
manufacturing; and construction.  Weekly earnings in professional, scientific and technical
services increased 6.1% to $1,279.82, with gains in all
industries within the sector.  Average weekly earnings in educational services rose 6.0%
to $1,010.22 over the 12 months, with all the growth in post-
secondary as well as elementary and secondary schools.  Weekly earnings in accommodation and food services were up
5.2% to $377.30 in the 12 months to July. Increases were most
notable in special food services and limited-service eating
places.  In manufacturing, weekly earnings increased 4.8% to
$1,012.30 in the 12 months to July, with the most notable growth
among manufacturers of transportation equipment; paper; primary
metal; wood products; machinery; as well as plastics and rubber
products.  In construction, weekly earnings rose 4.5% to $1,133.10.
Growth was widespread across most industries in this sector.  Average weekly earnings up in every province  Average weekly earnings of non-farm payroll employees
increased in every province in the 12 months to July. Growth was
highest in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince
 Edward Island  and Alberta.  In Saskatchewan, average weekly earnings were $929.31 in
July, up 7.1% from 12 months earlier. These weekly earnings were
among the highest of all provinces.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, average weekly earnings
increased 6.9% to $934.21, also among the highest provincial
earnings.  Average weekly earnings in Prince Edward Island were
$762.67 in July, up 6.5% compared with 12 months earlier.  At $1,094.85 in July, average weekly earnings in Alberta
were the highest among all provinces, up 6.1% from 12 months
earlier.  Weekly earnings in British Columbia were $876.98 in July,
up 4.9% from 12 months earlier.  Non-farm payroll employment by sector  Total non-farm payroll employment rose by 19,200 between
June and July, the fifth consecutive monthly increase.  In July, increases in payroll employment were in retail and
wholesale trade; professional, scientific and technical
services; health care and social assistance; construction as
well as transportation and warehousing. The most notable decline
was in public administration.  On a year-over-year basis, payroll employment increased by
290,300 (+1.9%), with most of these gains since February 2012
(+237,400).  Among all sectors, mining, quarrying, and oil and gas
extraction posted the highest 12-month growth rate in payroll
employment, at 8.1% (see the “Sector profile” section of this
release). It was followed by the construction sector (+4.6%);
accommodation and food services (+3.4%); professional,
scientific and technical services (+3.3%) and transportation and
warehousing (+3.1%).  Sector profile: Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction  From time to time, this release profiles an industrial
sector or province with a notable trend. This month, we examine
the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector because
of its faster-than-average growth in earnings, hours and payroll
employment.  In July, there were 221,400 payroll employees in mining,
quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, representing 1.4% of the
national total. This compares with a share of 1.1% in 2001. The
largest proportion of employees in this sector (44%) were
working in support activities for mining and oil and gas
extraction, which include services such as contract drilling,
oil and gas well services and mine tunnelling.  Another 27% of employees worked in oil and gas extraction,
while the remaining worked in metal ore mining (14%), non-
metallic mineral mining and quarrying (10%) and coal mining (4%).  Provincially,  Alberta  (55%) had the largest share of
employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction,
followed by Ontario (11%), British Columbia (10%) and
Saskatchewan (9%).  In Alberta, the vast majority of employees in the sector
were in two industries: support activities for mining and oil
and gas extraction; and oil and gas extraction. In Ontario, most
employees worked in metal ore mining; support activities for
mining and oil and gas extraction; and non-metallic mineral
mining and quarrying.  In British Columbia, employees in this sector were mostly
working in support activities for mining and oil and gas
extraction; metal ore mining; and coal mining, while employees
in Saskatchewan were widespread in all industries, with the
exception of coal mining.  The mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector
was hit particularly hard by the economic downturn in 2008/2009.
Its decline in payroll employees was sharper than for most other
sectors.  After peaking at 208,200 payroll employees in October 2008,
employment in this sector fell for 12 consecutive months, with a
total decline of 16.8% to 173,300 employees. In comparison, the
all-sector decline was 2.4%.  Between October 2008 and October 2009, most industries
within the sector experienced notable job losses. The exception
was coal mining, the industry with the fewest employees, which
had relatively stable employment levels.  From October 2009 to July 2012, payroll employment in
mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction increased 28%,
compared with the 4.9% all-sector growth rate. As a result, by
July 2012, the number of employees within the sector was higher
than the previous peak in October 2008 by 13,200.  Average weekly earnings in mining, quarrying, and oil and
gas extraction have been the highest of all sectors since 2007.
Also, this sector had the fastest growth rate in earnings, up
11.7% in the 12 months to July to $1,916.46. The most notable
growth in the sector occurred among employees in mining and
quarrying, where average weekly earnings rose 21.5%.  Average weekly earnings in July were the highest in oil and
gas extraction at $2,382.65, followed by mining and quarrying
($1,780.89) and support activities ($1,724.34).  Average weekly hours worked by payroll employees in mining,
quarrying, and oil and gas extraction increased from 40.8 to
41.5 hours in the 12 months to July. This sector has the longest
average workweek, well above the all-sector average of 32.9
hours in July. Employees in the mining and quarrying industry
had the longest weekly hours worked in July (42.4), followed by
support activities (41.7) and oil and gas extraction (40.3).  Note to readers  The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is a
business census of non-farm payroll employees. Its key objective
is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, the
number of jobs and hours worked by detailed industry at the
national, provincial and territorial level.  Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from
its monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a household
survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age
population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed
(including the self-employed), unemployed and not in the labour
force. This survey is the official source for the  unemployment
rate  and collects data on the socio-demographic characteristics
of all those in the labour market.  As a result of conceptual and methodological differences,
estimates of changes from SEPH and LFS do differ from time to
time. However, the trends in the data are quite similar.  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the
effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal
adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic
trends ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part -
partie3-eng.htm) .  Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and
salaried employees, as well as the “other employees” category,
which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees.  Average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried
employees only and exclude businesses that could not be
classified to a North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) code.  All earnings data include overtime pay and exclude
businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code.
Earnings data are based on gross payroll before source
deductions.  Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total
weekly earnings by the number of employees.  With each release, data for the current reference month are
subject to revision. Data have been revised for the previous
month. Users are encouraged to request and use the most up-to-
date data for each month.  Data on the education sector  Changes in payroll employment in education during the
summer months can be affected by changes in payment schedules
and school-year calendars. Month-to-month changes should
therefore be interpreted with caution, and more attention given
to long-term trends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
