Former Italian Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi  said European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi ’s bond-buying program will fail to help governments that
seek aid.  “This ECB initiative, as regards excessive bond spreads,
can’t work,” Berlusconi said today at a book presentation in
Rome. “You see how my Spanish colleague, the prime minister,
resists this push to make him ask for help.”  Countries that request assistance will be hurt by austerity
measures imposed by the European Union and by a stigma of
weakness in the market, Berlusconi said. Greece, which has sunk
deeper into recession, is an example of what happens to
governments that sign memorandums of understanding with European
institutions, he said.  “These rules, which have already been dictated to  Greece ,
bring the economy to collapse, pushing the economy of each
country into a recessive spiral with no foreseeable end,”
Berlusconi said.  A country that wants help “must declare to the world its
condition of need, which would lead to a devaluation of the
nation’s economy and its products,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
