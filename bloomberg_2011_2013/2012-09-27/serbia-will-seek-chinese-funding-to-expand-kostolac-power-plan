Serbia  plans to apply for a Chinese
government loan to add a new unit to its Kostolac power plants
and expand a  coal mine  that feeds it, the premier said.  The project worth $700 million may be financed from a $10
billion fund that China earmarked for investments in 16
countries of central and eastern Europe, under “preferential
terms of financing,” Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  said in a
statement e-mailed after his meeting with China Machinery
Engineering Corp. officials in Belgrade yesterday.  The 640-megawatt plant in the Kostolac power generation
complex is owned by Elektroprivreda Srbije, Serbia’s state-run
utility, which wants to add a 350-megawatt unit to the two
plants at Kostolac B and increase coal production from the
nearby Drmno field to 12 million tons a year from nine million
tons.  China Machinery Engineering is already involved in an
upgrade of two plants at  Kostolac B , supported by a $344 million
20-year loan from the  Export-Import Bank of China , or Exim Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
