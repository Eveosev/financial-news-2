Fewer Americans than forecast filed
first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments last week,
a sign the labor market is getting back on track.  Applications for  jobless benefits  decreased 26,000 to
359,000 in the week ended Sept. 22, the lowest since July, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast 375,000
claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  A turnaround in claims, which have been on the rise since
July, indicates companies in the U.S. may be growing more
confident that sales will pick up. At the same time, the jobless
rate may be slow to fall after exceeding 8 percent for 43 months
without a pick-up in the pace of hiring.  “The labor market is not getting any worse,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research LLC.
“But jobless claims only tell you one side of the equation, so
they don’t automatically mean that hiring is going up.”  A separate report from the Commerce Department today showed
demand for capital goods rose in August while failing to make up
for declines in the previous two months, signaling slowdowns in
business investment and exports threaten to further restrain the
U.S. economic recovery.  Orders for non-defense capital equipment excluding
airplanes rose 1.1 percent after decreases of 5.2 percent in
July and 2.7 percent in June. Total orders for durable goods,
those meant to last at least three years, plunged 13 percent,
the most since January 2009, paced by a plunge decline in demand
for civilian aircraft.  Stock Futures  Stock-index futures trimmed earlier gains after the reports.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in
December rose 0.5 percent to 1,433.6 at 9:08 a.m. in  New York .  The  U.S. economy  probably created more jobs than currently
estimated in the year ended March 2012, the Labor Department
also said today in preliminary projections.  The number of jobs added to payrolls will probably be
revised up by 386,000 from the current estimate of 1.94 million,
the department said on its website.  Estimates for jobless claims in the Bloomberg survey of 48
economists ranged from 365,000 to 385,000. The Labor Department
initially reported the prior week’s applications at 382,000.  A Labor Department official today said claims related to
Tropical Storm Isaac were not enough to have a material
influence on the data.  Investment Cools  Other data from the Commerce Department showed the economy
expanded at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
less than the 1.7 percent previous estimated, as  consumer
spending  climbed at the slowest pace in a year.  The four-week  moving average  for jobless claims, a less-
volatile measure, dropped to 374,000 from 378,500.  The number of people  continuing  to collect jobless benefits
fell by 4,000 to 3.27 million in the week ended Sept. 15. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
1,900 to 2.16 million in the week ended Sept. 8.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits
held at 2.6 percent in the week ended Sept. 15. Thirty-seven
states and territories reported an increase in claims, while 16
reported a decrease.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Hiring Stumbles  Hiring stumbled last month, with payrolls rising by 96,000
workers after a revised 141,000 gain in July, Labor Department
figures showed Sept. 7. The jobless rate fell to 8.1 percent in
August from 8.3 percent as more Americans left the  labor force .  Employment prospects may be lifted, albeit temporarily, as
businesses boost headcounts ahead of the year-end holidays. Toys
“R” Us Inc., the world’s largest toy retailer, said it will
hire 45,000 temporary staff in the Christmas period at both its
stores and online distribution centers in the U.S., up from
40,000 last year.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  said will hire more than
50,000 temporary workers in its U.S. stores.  Economists project payrolls expanded by 120,000 workers in
September, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. The Labor Department will release the figures on Oct. 5.  Weak demand is still restraining job growth. Siemens AG
said will cut 615 jobs at U.S. factories producing windmills in
response to “a significant drop in new orders,” according to a
message to employees obtained by Bloomberg. Alpha Natural
Resources Inc., the second-largest U.S. coal producer, said last
week it will close eight mines, eliminating 1,200 jobs.  The pace of labor market progress persuaded the  Federal
Reserve  to announce further monetary accommodation this month.
The central bank said it will expand its holdings of long-term
securities by purchasing $40 billion of mortgage debt a month
until the labor market improves significantly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
