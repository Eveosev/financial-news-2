Teleperformance (RCF)  SA, a French
operator of  call centers , rose to the highest price in more than
a year in Paris trading after Chairman Daniel Julien said the
company was in an “acquisition mood.”  The stock advanced as much as 4.1 percent to 22.63 euros,
the highest intraday level since June 15, 2011, and was up 2.8
percent to 22.35 at 4:59 p.m. in the French capital, giving the
company a market value of 1.27 billion euros ($1.63 billion).  “We want to continue to strengthen our position in the
U.S. market, not by buying more of the same but by entering
into some verticals where we are not strong enough,” Julien
said in an interview yesterday in Lisbon, where he took part in
the inauguration of a new contact center. “In the last two
years we didn’t do acquisitions and we are again in an
acquisition mood.”  With more than 100 million euros in free  cash flow  and a
300 million-euro  credit line  from banks, the Paris-based company
has a “comfortable cash position” to make purchases, the
chairman said. Teleperformance has 250 contact centers in
49 countries and serves clients such as phonemaker  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) 
and Aeromexico.  “If we make an acquisition it will be end of year or
the beginning of next year,” Julien said. “We don’t want
to acquire super-big companies, we prefer to acquire, step by
step, mid-size companies between 50 million and 100 million
in revenue.”  ‘Big Machine’  Julien, who opened Teleperformance’s first office in Paris
in 1978, said he expects demand to rise as companies
increasingly outsource customer support. “We take care of the
big machine of the day-to-day interaction with their customer
base,” he said.  Teleperformance’s business in the Asia Pacific region and
the English-speaking market, which includes the U.S., accounted
for 37 percent of revenue in the first half, according to the
company.  Teleperformance’s first-half  net income  rose to 45.3
million euros from 33.3 million euros a year earlier, while
revenue gained 6.1 percent to 1.13 billion euros, the company
said on July 30. Julien reaffirmed the company’s target for
full-year revenue to increase as much as 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
