Asia ’s gasoil and  fuel oil  crack
spreads weakened for a third day. Naphtha refining margins rose.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s  premium  to Dubai crude fell 17 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $19.16 a barrel at 11:40 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  Gasoil swaps for October rose 16 cents, or 0.1 percent, to
$126.35 a barrel, PVM data showed. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil
widened 5 cents to $1.45 a barrel. This spread, or the  regrade ,
has increased 61 percent from a week earlier, signaling it’s
more profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 33
cents to $3.57 a barrel, PVM data showed. A bigger discount
indicates wider refining losses from making the fuel.  Fuel oil swaps  for October were unchanged at $658 a ton,
PVM said. The  premium  of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-
centistoke grade was unchanged at $12.25 a ton.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures gained $6.13, or 5.9 percent, to $109.59 a ton,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This spread increased
for a fifth day.  Naphtha swaps for October increased $5.75, or 0.6 percent,
to $938.25 a ton, PVM data showed.  In Singapore, gasoline’s premium to naphtha fell 62 cents
to $17.88 a barrel yesterday. This  reforming margin  has
increased about 40 percent so far this month, signaling it’s
more profitable for refiners to make car fuel over petrochemical
feedstock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
