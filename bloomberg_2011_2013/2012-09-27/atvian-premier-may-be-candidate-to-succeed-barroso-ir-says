Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has been asked informally to stand as a candidate to
become the next president of the European Commission when  Jose Barroso ’s term expires in 2014, Ir  reported .  Dombrovskis consented when asked by the European People’s
Party, the biggest party in the European Parliament, if he would
be a candidate for the position, he said in an interview with
the Riga-based magazine published today. Dombrovskis said he
didn’t think the possibility “was very high” that he would get
the job, according to the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
