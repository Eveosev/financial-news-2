Corn farmers in  Argentina , the
world’s second-largest exporter of the grain, have planted 9.6
percent of the 2012-2013 crop’s estimated area of 3.4 million
hectares, the  Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said .  Argentina’s corn planted area for the current crop was
reiterated at 12 percent less than the previous season, the
Cereals Exchange said today in its weekly crop report published
on its website. Argentina is the world’s second-largest exporter
of the grain, behind the U.S.  Frost on Argentina’s wheat crop, Latin America’s largest,
was mitigated by excessive humidity from rain this week, the
exchange said.  “It is too soon to forecast an impact,” the exchange
said, maintaining wheat’s estimated planted area at 3.6 million
hectares.  Farmers in the northern part of the country have started
harvesting wheat, it said. The wheat season runs from April
through January.  Last year Argentina was the world’s fifth largest wheat
exporter after the U.S., Australia, Russia and  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
