The European Union will start
auctioning carbon permits for 2013 in “a few weeks,” according
to Peter Zapfel, emissions trading coordinator at the European
Commission.  Preparations for the so-called early auction of permits for
the next phase of the EU emissions trading program are
proceeding in line with the plan, Zapfel told a conference in
Brussels today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
