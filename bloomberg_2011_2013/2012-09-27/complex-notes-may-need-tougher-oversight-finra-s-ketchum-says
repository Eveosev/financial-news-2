Regulators may have to increase
oversight of more complex financial products if banks don’t
clamp down on improper sales practices, the head of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said.  “If the industry and regulators are unable to demonstrate
the ability to control sales practice abuses related to these
complex products through appropriate supervisory controls and
oversight then, in my opinion, some form of product approval may
become inevitable,”  Richard Ketchum , chairman and chief
executive officer of Finra, said today at a forum held by the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association in New
York.  Finra, the industry-backed regulator, has said investors
need to understand better the risks involved with complex
products such as structured notes, which can offer higher yields
by combining debt with derivatives. In July, Finra issued an
investor warning about exchange-traded notes after a security
tied to stock-market volatility plummeted in March.  Ketchum said the types of products that may need approval
include so-called range accrual notes, which pay investors if
two assets are both above a certain price, “worst-of” notes,
linked to the worst performing asset in a basket and notes tied
to futures of volatility indexes.  Finra doesn’t now require banks that sell complex
securities such as structured notes to submit their products for
review, instead requiring brokers to explain the risks of a
product to customers, Ketchum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
