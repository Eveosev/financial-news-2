Ontario is ahead of schedule on a
plan to eliminate its budget shortfall and will reduce program
spending by an additional C$18 billion ($18.4 billion) over the
next three years, the province’s finance minister said.  Ontario is putting a ‘pause’ on public sector wages, Dwight Duncan said in a speech in Calgary. The province is proud of the
 oil sands  and  Alberta , the finance minister said.  Ontario’s C$13 billion gap last year was two years ahead of
schedule in its deficit-reduction program, Duncan told reporters
after his speech to the Alberta Enterprise Group.  “We’re two years ahead of schedule and I haven’t shortened
the time to balance yet because of uncertainties in the world
economy,” he said.  Duncan presented a plan in March to eliminate a C$15.2
billion deficit by the year beginning April 2017. The province
had its debt rating cut to Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service in
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
