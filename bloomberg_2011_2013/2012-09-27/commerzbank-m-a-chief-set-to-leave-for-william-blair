William Blair & Co., a Chicago-
based investment bank owned by its employees, said it hired
Philipp Mohr, the global  head  of mergers and acquisitions at
 Commerzbank AG (CBK) , to open an office in  Germany .  Mohr, who will start in January from Frankfurt, will be a
managing director and global head of industrials at the U.S.
firm, said William Blair spokesman Tony Zimmer. Ute Gerbaulet,
global head of  equity capital markets  at Commerzbank, is also
leaving the German lender, said Margarita Thiel, a spokeswoman
for the bank, who also confirmed Mohr’s departure.  Mohr’s responsibilities will be assumed by Stefan Jaecker,
Commerzbank’s German head of M&A, and Rosalind Hedley-Miller,
his U.K. counterpart, while Roman Schmidt, head of global
corporate finance at Commerzbank, will temporarily run ECM,
Thiel said.  Mohr has been global head of M&A at Commerzbank, which is
based in  Frankfurt , since 2009. He has previously  worked  at
Dresdner Kleinwort as well as JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  London .
Gerbaulet joined Commerzbank from WestLB AG in 2007.  Commerzbank and William Blair have worked alongside each
other on transactions including managing Capvis Equity Partners
AG’s sale of  Bartec Holding GmbH , a German maker of explosion-
resistant switching and signaling gear, agreed in July.  William Blair, which also provides asset management
services, was founded in 1935 and has more than 1,100 employees
and 10 offices in four continents, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
