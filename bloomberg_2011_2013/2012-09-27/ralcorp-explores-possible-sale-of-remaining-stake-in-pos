Ralcorp Holdings Inc. (RAH)  said it is
examining the sale of its remaining stake in  Post Holdings Inc. (POST) 
after spinning off the maker of Grape-Nuts and Alpha-Bits
cereals earlier this year.  Ralcorp owns 6.8 million shares of Post’s common stock, the
St. Louis-based company said today in a statement, representing
about 20 percent of the total. Based on Post’s closing price
yesterday of $29.49, the stake is worth about $201 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
