Thailand ’s baht traded near the
lowest level in two weeks after foreign investors pulled money
from local stocks following data showing exports fell for a
third month in August. Bonds gained.  Offshore funds sold a net $196 million of Thai shares
yesterday, the most since August 2011, exchange data show. The
finance ministry cut its economic growth forecast for 2012 this
week and Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said
yesterday the contraction in overseas sales could hurt local
consumption and investment. The baht has strengthened 1.1
percent this month and 2.4 percent this quarter.  “The central bank will probably want to slow the baht’s
appreciation for competitive reasons,” said Kampon
Adireksombat, an economist at Tisco Securities Co. in Bangkok.
“But it’s clear they aren’t going to change the currency
trend.”  The baht traded at 30.97 per dollar in Bangkok versus 30.99
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
31.06 earlier, the weakest level since Sept. 14. The baht may
fluctuate between 30.75 and 31.25 between now and the end of the
year, Adireksombat forecast.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 4.27 percent.  Gross domestic product will increase 5.5 percent this year,
compared with an earlier projection of 5.7 percent, the  finance
ministry  said on Sept. 25. Exports fell 7 percent in August from
a year earlier, the customs bureau said on the same day.  The yield on the government’s 3.65 percent bonds due
December 2021 dropped for a third day, easing one basis point or
0.01 percentage point to 3.58 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest since Sept. 10. The
yield reached 3.71 percent on Sept. 17, the highest since May.  Baht-denominated government notes have returned 1.5 percent
this year, according to an index compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
