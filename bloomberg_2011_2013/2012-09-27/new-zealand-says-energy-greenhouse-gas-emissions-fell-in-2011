New Zealand â€™s energy industry
reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 1.9 percent in 2011, the
Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment said in an e-
mailed statement. The reduction was largely driven by a 10
percent fall in emissions from electricity generation as the use
of renewable energy increased, the government department said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
