Turkish troops killed 13 Kurdish
militants in a clash near the Iraqi border, the Anatolia news
agency said.  The fighting occurred near the border town of Cukurca in
Hakkari province, bordering Iraq and  Iran , the state-run
Anatolia said today. Two soldiers were killed and four others
were wounded in the clashes, it said.  Turkish F-16 warplanes were bombing positions of the
Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK, based on intelligence from
drones, the agency said. More than 700 militants, soldiers and
policemen have been killed in intensified clashes so far this,
according to official figures.  The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in the Kurdish-
dominated southeast since 1984. The conflict has killed as many
as 40,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
