U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums
gained as West Texas Intermediate’s discount compared to Brent
widened to the largest in six weeks.  The difference between the benchmarks widened 10 cents to
$20.16 a barrel in  New York , the widest gap since Aug. 16. When
Brent rises at a faster pace than WTI, as it did today, it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades competing with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 70 cents to $20.20 a
barrel at 2:06 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet increased $1 to $20 over WTI.  Poseidon’s  premium  gained 50 cents to $14. Mars Blend added
65 cents to $14.40 a barrel over WTI and Southern Green Canyon
increased 75 cents to a premium of $12.75.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened 35 cents to $17.35 above WTI.  Bakken oil’s premium gained 25 cents to $2.25 a barrel.  The discount to WTI for Western Canada Select, a heavy oil
blend from  Alberta , narrowed $1.75 to $10. Syncrude’s premium to
the U.S. benchmark widened $1.25 to $10 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
