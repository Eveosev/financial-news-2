The European Commission won’t start
an infringement procedure against  Hungary ’s planned tax on
financial transactions this week as the executive body has yet
to make a final decision on the levy, news website  BruxInfo 
reported, citing unidentified people in Brussels.  The commission, the European Union’s executive arm, views
the tax to be levied on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s transactions
as a breach of the bloc’s laws on central bank independence,
according to the news website.  The Commission may start the infringement procedure later,
BruxInfo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
