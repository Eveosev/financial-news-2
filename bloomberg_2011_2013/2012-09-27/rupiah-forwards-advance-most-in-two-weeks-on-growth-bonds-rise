Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards
advanced the most in two weeks on speculation inflation
accelerated this month, signaling consumption is boosting
economic growth.  Government bonds  rose.  Consumer prices rose  4.61 percent  in September, compared
with 4.58 percent in August, a Bloomberg survey of eight
economists showed before data due Oct. 1. Gross domestic product
will increase 6.2 percent next year, from 6 percent in 2012,
driven by “robust domestic demand,” the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report today.
Inflation is forecast to accelerate to 4.7 percent in 2013 from
an average 4.2 percent this year, the OECD said.  “Faster inflation signals  consumer spending  is still
strong, which is the biggest driver of Indonesia’s growth,”
said Klara Pramesti, a research analyst in the treasury division
at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards for the rupiah
strengthened 0.3 percent to 10,103 per dollar as of 9:14 a.m. in
Jakarta, the most since Sept. 14, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell assets
at a set price and date, traded at a 5.2 percent discount to the
spot rate. Non-deliverable forwards are settled in dollars.  The contracts gained 0.5 percent this month, paring their
quarterly decline to 1.1 percent and 2012 loss to 4.8 percent.  The rupiah traded at 9,600 per dollar, having closed at
9,601 yesterday, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. It touched 9,628 yesterday, the weakest level since May
31, and has declined 2 percent this quarter in the worst
performance among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 88 basis points, or 0.88
percentage point, to 7.13 percent, the highest since Aug. 13.  The government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022 advanced for
the first time in eight days, pushing the yield down two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.04 percent, prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield declined 11
basis points this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
