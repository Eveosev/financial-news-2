Vinay Pande, chief investment
adviser at Deutsche Bank AG, is set to join  Brevan Howard  Asset
Management LLP, the hedge fund co-founded by  Alan Howard .  Pande, 55, will start Oct. 1 as head of a team including
Gerald Lucas and two other researchers, he said today in a
telephone interview. The group will be managing money for Brevan
Howard U.S. Investment Management LP, which was set up in June,
Pande said.  Brevan Howard is expanding after the London-based firm
outperformed the hedge-fund industry last year. Assets under
management are about $36.7 billion, and the U.S. investment unit
initially will oversee about $300 million, according to a June
regulatory filing.  Pande joined Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank in 2006 after
leaving Caxton Associates LLC, a  New York  hedge fund. His
advisory group developed strategies for investing around the
world, the bank said in a 2006  statement .  From 1985 to 1993 he worked for the World Bank in
Washington, including as chief investment officer. His plans
were reported earlier by aiCIO, a newsletter.  Max Hilton, a spokesman for Brevan Howard, and  Amanda Williams , a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
