Finland’s economic contraction may
be bigger than forecast as the deepening  European debt crisis 
continues to hurt exports, LaehiTapiola said.  It had in June estimated gross domestic product to shrink
0.5 percent in 2012. That forecast may be “too optimistic,”
the Espoo, Finland-based banking and insurance company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “It’s almost certain that the drop in the  unemployment
rate  has come to a halt,” Jari Jaervinen, chief economist at
Tapiola Asset Management, a unit of LaehiTapiola. “We expect
the economy to reach a trough in early 2013, which would allow
moderate growth in the second half of next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
