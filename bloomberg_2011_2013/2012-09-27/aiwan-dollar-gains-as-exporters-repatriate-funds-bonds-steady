Taiwan ’s dollar gained the most in
almost two weeks on speculation exporters are converting
overseas earnings as the month-end approaches.  Government bonds 
were little changed.  The local currency has rallied 1.9 percent in September,
the second-best performance in Asia, as global funds bought $1.6
billion more Taiwanese stocks than they sold, according to
exchange data. Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said
yesterday that demand for the island’s goods from overseas is
showing signs of improvement and the monetary authority’s
mandate is to maintain relative stability in the exchange rate
and step into the market in the event of abnormal fluctuations.  “It’s mainly exporters selling the  U.S. dollar  today,”
said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of
Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “Exports might be getting better like the
governor said, but we’re still lacking enough evidence out there
to show fundamentals have improved.”  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.3 percent to NT$29.42 against its
U.S. counterpart, the biggest advance since Sept. 14, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.198 on Sept. 17, the
strongest level since May 3, and has appreciated 1.6 percent
this quarter.  One-month non-deliverable forwards in the currency advanced
0.2 percent to NT$29.375, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, increased three basis points to 3.78
percent.  Industrial production rose 1.89 percent last month from a
year earlier, the most since February, official data showed
Sept. 24. Export orders declined in August for a sixth month, a
report showed last week.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent bonds due September
2022 was at 1.168 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight money-market rate  climbed one basis point
to 0.399 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
