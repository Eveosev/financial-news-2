Libya ’s military has ordered the
formation of a unit charged with disbanding “illegal” militias
in Benghazi, the country’s second largest city.  The unit groups the Zawiya Martyrs Brigade, a militia, with
members of the special forces, the military police and the
intelligence service, the state-run Libya News Agency reported
today, citing a statement from the armed forces command.  The National Mobile Force - Benghazi will be responsible
for implementing an earlier decree by the National Congress
requiring the illegal or unlicensed armed groups to disband and
returning to the state institutions and installations used as
bases since the rebellion against  Muammar Qaddafi  last year, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
