Ballard Power Systems Inc. (BLD) , a
manufacturer of hydrogen fuel cells for buses and backup-power
systems, closed unchanged in Toronto after gaining the most in
19 months following an announcement it shipped its fuel
generation systems overseas.  The Burnaby, British Columbia-based company ended the
session at 70 Canadian cents after earlier climbing 17 percent,
the most intraday since February 2011.  The shares  have dropped
36 percent this year.  Ballard shipped its first 100 ElectraGen fuel-cell power
systems to Cascadiant Inc. and Inala Technologies, its
distributors in  Southeast Asia  and  South Africa  respectively,
the company said after the market closed yesterday. The
technology will be deployed for backup power in wireless
telecommunications systems.  The fuel-cell supplier received a C$7 million ($7.1
million) grant from Sustainable Development Technology Canada on
Feb. 28.  ElectraGen-ME systems extract hydrogen from a mixture of
methanol and water, with the hydrogen then used to power fuel
cells, the company said.  Ballard is building a 6-megawatt facility at a chemical
factory in North Vancouver, and plans to complete it by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
