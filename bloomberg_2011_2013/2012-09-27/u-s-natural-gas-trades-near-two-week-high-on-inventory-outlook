Natural gas futures traded in  New
York  near the highest price in two weeks as concern eased that
supplies would test storage limits before demand picks up with
colder weather.  Gas for November delivery was at $3.204 per million British
thermal units, down 0.3 percent at 1 p.m. Tokyo time. That
followed a gain for the October contract, which expired
yesterday. It jumped 9.9 cents to $3.023 per million Btu to the
first settlement above $3 since Sept. 13 and the biggest
increase since Sept. 11.  U.S. stockpiles  gained 78 billion cubic feet last week,
based on the median of  22 analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Supplies totaled 3.496 trillion cubic feet as of Sept.
14, below the Energy Department’s estimated capacity of 4.239
trillion. The agency’s weekly supply report is scheduled for
release today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
