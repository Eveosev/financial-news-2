Latvia agreed to cut government
payments to people without income and  unemployment benefits ,
ignoring warnings from the  International Monetary Fund  that the
move may threaten economic growth.  Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis and Andris Jaunsleinis,
chairman of the Union of Municipalities, signed an agreement
today in the capital, Riga, to lower the guaranteed minimum
income for the country’s poorest from 45 lati ($83) a month to
35 lati starting next year, according to the Cabinet’s  website .  Latvian  unemployment , which stood at 16.1 percent in June
after peaking at 20.5 percent in 2010 as a recession erased more
than a fifth of economic output, is only worse in Greece and
 Spain  within the European Union, according to Eurostat. The
government should wait for a study on long-term unemployment
before cutting benefits as the move “could worsen inequality
and undermine growth,” the IMF said in a July 16  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
