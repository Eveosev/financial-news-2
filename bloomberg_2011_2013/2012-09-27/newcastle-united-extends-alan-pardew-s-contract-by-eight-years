Newcastle United has extended its
contract with manager  Alan Pardew  and his three-man strong
senior coaching staff by eight years, the Premier League soccer
club said on its website.  “The club has awarded the long-term contracts to ensure it
has the stability necessary to achieve consistent success in the
Premier League and European club competition,” it said.  Newcastle finished in fifth place in the Premier League
last season.  “We’re looking to build on the success we had last season
and these new contracts are aimed at keeping the club
progressing on and off the pitch, as we have done since
returning to the Premier League in 2010,” managing director
Derek Llambias said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
