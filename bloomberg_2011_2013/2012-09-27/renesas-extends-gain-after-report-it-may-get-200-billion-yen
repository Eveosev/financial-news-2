Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  rose for
the second day in Tokyo after  Kyodo News  reported a Japanese
state-backed fund and a group of companies may invest about 200
billion yen ($2.6 billion) in the unprofitable chipmaker.  Renesas, which supplies companies including Apple Inc. and
Nintendo Co., jumped as much as 7.5 percent to 330 yen and
traded at 315 yen as of 11 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.1 percent.  The worldâ€™s biggest microcontroller maker surged more than
20 percent this week after a government official said Sept. 24
that  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  are among Japanese
companies that may join with  Innovation Network Corp. of Japan 
to invest more than 100 billion yen for a majority stake in
Renesas. The companies want to secure a stable supply of
microcontrollers from the chipmaker, Kyodo reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The rescue plan for the Apple supplier, first reported by
the Nikkei newspaper Sept. 22, would counter a bid by KKR & Co.,
a New York-based private-equity firm, which is said to have
offered about 100 billion yen to buy shares of Renesas.  Kawasaki, Japan-based Renesas is trying to end losses
exacerbated by falling demand for its system LSI chips, used for
functions from processing images for TV screens to crunching
data. The company plans to cut 5,000 jobs and may close or sell
as many as nine of 18 domestic factories.  Renesas forecasts it will return to an  operating profit 
this fiscal year, it  said  Aug. 2. Operating profit, or sales
minus the cost of goods sold and selling, general and
administrative expenses, may total 21 billion yen for the 12
months ending March 31, compared with a loss of 56.8 billion yen
a year earlier, Renesas said.  The company was formed in 2010 through the merger of money-
losing chipmakers Renesas Technology Corp., a venture between
Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric, and NEC Electronics Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
