Uganda ’s tourism income climbed 22
percent in 2011 because of the increasing popularity of gorilla-
tracking safaris, the ministry of tourism said.  Earnings rose to $805 million from $662 million in 2010,
and there are prospects of further growth in the coming years,
the ministry said in a statement today in Kampala, the capital.  An estimated 1.15 million tourists visited Africa’s biggest
coffee exporter last year, the ministry said, without giving
comparative figures. In 2010 the ministry estimated it would get
1 million visitors, up from 817,000 in 2009.  Tourism beat coffee exports as the country’s top earner of
foreign currency. The Uganda Coffee Development Authority
reported export earnings of $449 million in the 12 months
through September last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
