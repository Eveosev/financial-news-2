The Czech and Hungarian economies
will keep shrinking in 2013 as the euro region, which buys most
of their exports, sinks deeper into a recession, Capital
Economics Ltd. said.  While the Czech economy will grow 0.5 percent next year, it
will contract for the “best part” after shrinking 0.8 percent
in 2012, emerging-markets economists at Capital led by  Neil Shearing  wrote today in an e-mailed note. Hungary’s economy will
contract 0.5 percent, becoming the only eastern European nation
to stay in a recession, after shrinking 1.5 percent this year,
Capital estimates.  “The highly open economies of central  Europe  are
particularly exposed via trade linkages,” the economists wrote.  The Czech and Hungarian central banks cut  interest rates 
this week after the two economies shrank from the previous
quarter between April and June. Hungary’s 2013 GDP growth
forecast of 1.6 percent is among the main stumbling blocks in
International Monetary Fund bailout talks, which stalled Sept. 6
after the government refused to lower the projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
