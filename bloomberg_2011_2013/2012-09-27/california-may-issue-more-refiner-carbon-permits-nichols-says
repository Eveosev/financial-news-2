California may consider issuing
more free carbon permits to oil refiners after the first auction
of allowances in November,  Mary Nichols , the state air chief,
said at a conference today in  San Francisco .  Refiners’ allocation of the permits, each allowing for the
release of one metric ton of emissions, is set to shrink in the
second phase of the state’s cap-and-trade program beginning in
2015.  “There could be changes,” Nichols, chairwoman of the
state’s air resources board, said at the conference. “We’d be
able to take a look at that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
