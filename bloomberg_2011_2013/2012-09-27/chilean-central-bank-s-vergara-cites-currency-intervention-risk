Intervention to weaken currencies
has risk for emerging-market policy makers, Chilean central bank

said. Sterilizing intervention by selling bonds worsens the
balance sheet of the central bank involved, he said in remarks
prepared for a conference in Santiago that were posted on the
central bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
