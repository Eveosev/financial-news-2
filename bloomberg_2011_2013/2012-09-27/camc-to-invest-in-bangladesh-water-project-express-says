China CAMC Engineering Co. (002501)  will
invest 25 billion taka ($306 million) in a water-treatment plant
in  Bangladesh  to reduce the capital’s reliance on underground
water sources, the Financial Express reported.  The Padma project will pipe 450 million liters (119 million
gallons) of water to Dhaka after the first phase is completed,
the report said, citing Abu Alam Md Shahid Khan, local division
secretary at the Ministry of LGRD and Cooperatives in
Bangladesh.  China CAMC agreed with the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage
Authority to build the plant, which will help meet water demand
in the city, the Express said. Bangladesh will spend 10 billion
taka on the project, the first phase of which is scheduled for
completion within 42 months, Taqsem Khan, managing director of
the authority, was quoted as saying.  An e-mail and a call to the Chinese company’s investor
relations department today to confirm yesterday’s report weren’t
immediately answered.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
