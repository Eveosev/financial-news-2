 Bahrain-based Gulf Finance House’s
GFH Capital Ltd. unit has signed an exclusive agreement to lead
and arrange the acquisition of the parent company of English
soccer team Leeds United, the company said in a statement.  Leeds, a three-time English champion, plays in the
Championship division, one level below the Premier League. It
was relegated from the Premier League, soccer’s richest domestic
competition, in 2007 after suffering financial difficulties.  “It is expected that from next season each team in the
Premier League will receive a minimimum of 60 million pounds
($97 million) per season due to the increase in broadcasting
rights,” the statement said. “LUFC would also benefit from
this if it can achieve promotion to the Premier League.”      No further details were provided by the company, which
cited a confidentiality clause. Leeds chairman Ken Bates five
days ago said the team was in advanced negotiations about
potential investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
