Toshiba Corp. (6502) ,  Japan ’s biggest
builder of nuclear power plants, won an order to build gas-fired
power generation systems for Chubu Electric Power Co. as last
year’s nuclear disaster fuels demand for alternative energy.  The power systems that use new gas turbines developed by
 General Electric Co. (GE)  will be supplied to the utility’s Nishi
Nagoya thermal power plant in central Japan, Toshiba said today
in a statement. The order is valued at about 100 billion yen
($1.3 billion), the Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today
without saying where it obtained the information.  Japanese utilities are installing gas-fired power stations
to cut dependence on atomic energy as all but two of the
nation’s 50 reactors remain shut after the Fukushima nuclear
accident. Toshiba and GE, which began collaboration in gas
turbines in 1982, will jointly explore sales opportunities for
the new power systems, the statement said today.  GE’s 7F 7-series gas turbines will be combined with
Toshiba’s steam turbines and generators to supply the power
systems, Toshiba said.  Japan, already the world’s largest importer of liquefied
natural gas, will probably need 19 percent more by 2020,
according to Oslo-based Arctic Securities ASA.  Toshiba, which also produces flash memory chips,  notebook
computers  and televisions, rose 1.2 percent to 251 yen in early
trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
