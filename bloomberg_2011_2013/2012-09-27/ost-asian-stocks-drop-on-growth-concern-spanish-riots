Asian  stocks  rose as a drop in
Chinese industrial profits increased pressure on Premier  Wen
Jiabao  to step up measures to support growth in the world’s
second-largest economy.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the country’s
biggest developer by market value listed in Hong Kong, rose 1.4
percent.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  advanced 1.3 percent after
Kyodo reported a government-backed counter offer for the
Japanese chipmaker may be double KKR & Co.’s bid.  Nitori
Holdings Co. (9843)  fell 8.6 percent in  Tokyo  after the furniture
retailer reported profit that missed estimates.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.8 percent to 122.48 as
of 6:27 p.m. in Tokyo. More than two stocks advanced for each
that fell. The gauge climbed 4.5 percent this quarter as central
banks in  Europe , the U.S., Japan and China took action to
stimulate economic growth.  “The positive would be a big China stimulus package that
could send markets higher,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based
chief investment strategist at Russell Investment Group, which
manages about $150 billion. “The signals are that they are not
really itching to do that. There’s some evidence in the data
that we’ll start to see stabilization in economic growth by the
end of this year. The risk would be that the Chinese data
continues to weaken into the end of the year and the first
quarter of 2013.”  Industrial Profits  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.1 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite surged 2.6 percent as the National Bureau of
Statistics said in Beijing that profit at Chinese industrial
companies dropped a fifth month in August. Today’s report may
increase pressure on Wen to step up easing measures as concern
mounts that yearly growth will be the weakest in 22 years.  Chinese developers trading in  Hong Kong  advanced. China
Overseas Land & Investment gained 1.4 percent to HK$19.46, while
state-owned China Resources Land Ltd. rose 1.8 percent to HK$17.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average and Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index both gained 0.5 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index
rose 0.4 percent, Singapore’s Straits Times climbed 0.4 percent
and Taiwan’s Taiex increased 0.2 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4
percent today. The U.S. gauge dropped 0.6 percent yesterday, for
its longest retreat since July, amid concern that Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening and global growth is slowing.  Asia’s benchmark index earlier declined 0.2 percent as data
from the U.S. to Italy added to concern that global economic
growth is waning and Spanish borrowing costs soared amid violent
protests against austerity measures.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index climbed 7.6 percent this year
compared with a 14 percent gain on the  S&P 500  and an 11 percent
advance on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The Asian benchmark
traded at 12.7 times estimated earnings compared with 13.9 for
the S&P 500 and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600.  Renesas Bid  Renesas climbed 1.3 percent to 311 yen after  Kyodo News 
reported a Japanese state-backed fund and a group of companies
may invest about 200 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in the
unprofitable chipmaker.  Among declining shares, Nitori lost 8.6 percent to 7,460
yen as it reported operating profit for the first half that
missed analyst estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
