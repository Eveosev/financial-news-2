Zimbabwe Platinum Mines Ltd. (ZIM) , a
unit of  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , said a tax demand will
delay the company’s planned $469 million expansion program to
boost output by 50 percent.  “The revised tax assessment puts pressure on Zimplats’
cash flows,” Chief Executive Officer Alexander Mhembere said in
a written response to Bloomberg questions. “Some aspects of the
project will be postponed.”  Zimplats had a tax agreement with the government that gave
it certain concessions over the treatment of capital
expenditure. The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, known as Zimra, has
ruled that the concessions weren’t written into law and so they
no longer apply.  Mhembere said the company doesn’t plan to appeal the $33.8
million tax demand and has “agreed to the re-calculation.”  “However, we are in discussions with Zimra on the payment
of interest and penalties on the principal amount,” the CEO
said. “We are keen to resolve this issue as soon as is
possible.”  Mhembere said the Zimbabwean government and Zimplats’ major
shareholder, Impala Platinum, reached an agreement on the
implementation of black-ownership laws in March.  “A joint technical team was established then to work on
the details, therefore there is no question of imposition of
terms,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
