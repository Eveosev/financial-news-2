Peruâ€™s non-commodity exports will
increase this year, allowing the country to post a  trade surplus 
that will grow next year, said Foreign Trade Minister Jose Silva.  Commodity export volumes will rise from last year though
prices will fall, Silva said at a news conference in Lima.  Silva said August exports were higher than preliminary
figures reported yesterday by exporter association Adex, which
said sales overseas dropped 25 percent to $3.48 billion from a
year ago. Peru posted a $192 million trade deficit for July
after exports fell 20 percent, the statistics agency reported
Sept. 11.  The European Parliament may approve a free-trade agreement
between the European Union and Colombia and Peru on Nov. 21,
Silva said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
