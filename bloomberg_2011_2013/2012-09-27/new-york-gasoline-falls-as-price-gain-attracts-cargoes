Gasoline declined in  New York  after
a 76 percent gain in the fuel’s premium to futures yesterday
lured more cargoes from  Europe .  Shipments of the motor fuel to the U.S. from Europe are
poised to advance 35 percent in the two weeks through Oct. 10,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Prices in New York have
surged as inventories along the East Coast are at the lowest
level since October 2008.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane  gasoline  in New
York Harbor dropped 5.5 cents to 24.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:38 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday it rose to 30
cents, the highest level since Sept. 11. Prompt delivery gained
0.82 cent to $3.3893 a gallon.  “You’ve got  Boston , Providence,  New Haven , Bridgeport, and
Newburgh all having gasoline supply issues,” said Eugene A.
Guilford, Jr., president of the Independent Connecticut
Petroleum Association, adding that low supplies in New Haven and
Bridgeport last week forced suppliers to go out of state to
resupply.  East Coast  stocks  of reformulated gasoline, or RBOB,
dropped to 13.7 million barrels last week, the lowest level
since Oct. 3, 2008, according to the Energy Department.  Traders and oil companies booked 16 tankers for the Europe-
U.S. route for the two weeks to Oct. 10, and 11 more probably
will be hired, according to the median estimate in a survey of
eight shipbrokers and traders yesterday who specialize in
transporting gasoline. That’s seven vessels more than last
week’s total and the most shipments since Sept. 12, prior
surveys showed.  “The resupply has been spotty,” Guilford said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
