Statkraft AS, Norway’s biggest
power producer, will build two wind farms in  Sweden  with joint
capacity of 369 megawatts and annual output of 1 terawatt-hour.  The Bjoerkhoejden wind farm will have an installed capacity
of 270 megawatts and will start production in two stages, in
2014 and 2015, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.
The Oegonfaegnaden 99-megawatt plant will be completed as early
as 2014, it said.  The projects are joint ventures with  Svenska Cellulosa AB. (SCAB)   Sweden will produce 7.1 terawatt-hours of power from  wind
turbines  this year, according to a report submitted to the
government last month by Energimyndigheten, the nation’s energy
agency. In the 12 months to August, Sweden consumed a total of
139.8 terawatt-hours of electricity, data from the  Nord Pool
Spot SA  exchange show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
