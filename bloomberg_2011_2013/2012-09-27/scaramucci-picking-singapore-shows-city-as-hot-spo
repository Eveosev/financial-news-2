When Anthony Scaramucci wanted to bring SALT, the largest U.S. annual hedge-fund schmooze fest, to  Asia  for the first time, he toured five cities looking for a venue.  Singapore won. Citing its world-class infrastructure and status as a global financial center, Scaramucci, known in the industry as “the Mooch,” ruled out  Hong Kong ,  Tokyo , Seoul and Shanghai before settling on Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino for his SkyBridge Capital LLC’s  SkyBridge Alternatives Conference  on Oct. 17-19, an add-on to the firm’s annual conference in Las Vegas.  “The attitude in Singapore is that they aggressively want to compete,” Victor Oviedo, a SkyBridge Capital partner who toured Asia with Scaramucci, said in a phone interview from the firm’s base in New York. “Despite being small, they have managed to compete in a boxer world above their weight class.”  The island off the tip of Malaysia has emerged atop Asia’s ranks for business travelers and conventioneers ranging from orchid collectors to financiers and economists such as  Michael Milken ,  Jim Rogers ,  Nouriel Roubini  and  Joseph Stiglitz . They’re being lured by the Sands, a two-year-old resort built by U.S. gaming giant  Sheldon Adelson , uncongested roads, some of the cleanest urban air in the region and development projects with waterfront parks, luxury shops and high-end restaurants.  Singapore topped Hong Kong as Asia’s most-popular business destination in the first half of 2012, according to a survey of 2,500 people in nine countries by  Accor SA (AC) , the largest international hotel operator in the region, whose chains include Sofitel, Novotel and Ibis. Last year, the two cities were tied.  ‘Reinvented Itself’  Conventions, conferences and tradeshows in Singapore rose 46 percent to 2,130 last year from 2010, according to the Singapore Tourism Board. Comparable international events in Hong Kong fell almost 7 percent to 1,336 in 2011 from a year earlier, data from the Hong Kong Tourism Board show.  “Singapore has constantly reinvented itself,” Clarence Tan, chief operating officer for Asia and Australasia at London- based  InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) , which manages hotels including the Crown Plaza and  Holiday Inn  in the island-city, said in a phone interview from Tokyo. “As Asia matures, Singapore has also matured as a destination for the more savvy business and leisure travelers.”  Business Visitors  Hong Kong’s overnight business visitors fell 1.3 percent to 1.75 million in the first six months of this year, according to the tourism board. Excluding business travelers from mainland China, they fell 2.2 percent to 994,200. Singapore doesn’t break out half-year numbers, country of origin or duration of the stay. Its 3.2 million business visitors increased 2.6 percent last year over 2010, according to its official figures.  Hong Kong is dependent on business travelers from the mainland. Last year’s overnight arrivals, excluding Chinese mainlanders, were little changed at 0.1 percent growth to 2.03 million, while including them they rose 4.1 percent compared with the year before.  For the first time, Singapore was ranked the world’s top international meeting destination last year by the  Union of International Associations , a research institute in Brussels that collaborates with  United Nations ’ agencies including the  Food and Agriculture Organization , the Economic and Social Council and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.  Highest Occupancy  Singapore is also posting the highest hotel occupancy rates in the region. In January, they climbed 12 percent to 92 percent from a year ago, the highest rate of the year, according to  CBRE Hotels Asia Pacific . Average occupancy in the six months to June rose almost 1 percent to 84.6 percent from a year ago, according to London-based research group STR Global.  Hong Kong posted a 0.2 percent increase to 83.8 percent in the first six months of 2012. Shanghai gained 8.2 percent to 58.5 percent, while in the U.S. they climbed almost 3 percent to 62.3 percent, the data show.  The  Marina Bay Sands , which opened in 2010 and whose design recalls the Starship Enterprise of the TV series “ Star Trek ,” had an occupancy level of more than 99 percent in the second quarter of this year, the highest for any casino hotel in the world, according to brokerage Phillip Securities Pte.  “It becomes a wave movement,” Robert McIntosh, executive director of CBRE Hotels Asia Pacific, a unit of Los Angeles- based property broker CBRE Group Inc. “For a while a new facility will attract a lot of conferences because they want to say that they’ve been to that new one.”  Business travelers and convention organizers also consider “things like pollution, political risk,” he said.  ‘Good’ Air  Singapore last year had air that measured “good” 96 percent of the time, according to the Pollutant Standards Index used by the  National Environment Agency . Public anti-government protests are virtually non-existent.  Hong Kong’s polluted air exceeded World Health Organization guidelines for “dangerous” or “very dangerous” for 306 out of 365 days last year, or 84 percent of the time, according to the  Hedley Environmental Index  published by the University of Hong Kong. At least three anti-government demonstrations in recent months drew thousands of people to Hong Kong’s streets.  Even as international meetings including trade shows and exhibitions in Hong Kong declined last year, conventions alone grew 24 percent to 324 and meeting attendees rose 9.3 percent to 1.56 million from the previous year, meaning that the industry has done “rather well” given the state of the global economy, Josephine Lo Wing-sze, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Tourism Commission, responded in an e-mailed statement.  New Facilities  “Tokyo and Seoul may tick many of the boxes, but what’s been achieved in Singapore is that it ticks a lot more boxes than it did four, five years ago because of the new facilities and the increased range of facilities,” McIntosh said, noting that the rise of the yen, which has remained at post-World War II highs of less than 80 to the dollar for most of this year, has made Tokyo more expensive.  Singapore ranked fourth among Asia’s cities for its hotel rates -- behind Sydney, Hong Kong and Tokyo -- and 18th in the world, according to a biannual  survey  by London-based Hogg Robinson Group. Its average room rate of S$335 ($264) in the first six months of this year was an increase of 3 percent over the same period last year, it said.  Hong Kong rates averaged HK$2,380 ($307) in the same period, unchanged from 2011. In Tokyo, the average room cost 22,348 yen ($280), a 4 percent increase over last year, the survey said.  Hotel rates in Singapore rose almost 10 percent last year compared with 2010, according to  STR Global .  Increasing Spending  That has regional business travelers seeing the impact. Yoshinobu Agu, 43, an investment-banking executive for Citigroup Inc. in Tokyo who stayed at the  Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore , next to the Marina Bay Sands, on a visit in August said Singapore hotel rooms had become expensive, almost on a par with New York and Tokyo.  Business travelers to the island-state are increasing their hotel spending more than for any other country, budgeting 16 percent more per night in Singapore in the first half of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011, the  Accor  survey found.  The average Singapore hotel allowance in U.S. dollar terms rose to $156, an amount lower than STR Global’s room average because it accounts for corporate discounting. In comparison, a business traveler in the Asia-Pacific region spent $125 a night, a 3.3 percent increase from a year ago, the survey showed. In the U.S., a room night cost $102.  Worth It  “Singapore hotel rates have remained high,” said New York-based Shankar Iyer, founder and chief executive officer of Viteos Fund Services LLC, which provides support to hedge funds, who visits Singapore a few times a year. “My average spend in the rest of the world has gone down because hotels around the world, especially Europe and  North America , have had poorer occupancy and hence better rates.”  Still, many say it’s worth it. Peter Thompson, 38, a London resident on a work assignment with Universal Studios Inc. paid about $360 a night at the Ritz-Carlton in August.  “In London, I would pay more with no swimming pool and no breakfast included,” he said while seated in the high- ceilinged, airy lobby after checking out.  The luxury hotel segment in Singapore posted a 12 percent increase in revenue per available room until May compared with a year earlier, Jonas Ogren, Asia director at STR Global, said in an e-mailed response to questions. Hong Kong’s luxury segment revenues grew 4.6 percent in the same period.  ‘Incredible Success’  Shares of the Singapore-traded arm of the  Mandarin Oriental (MAND)  Hotel Group, Mandarin Oriental International Ltd., the operator of luxury hotels from Singapore to San Francisco, are up 3.7 percent this year compared with a 16 percent advance in the benchmark Straits Times Index. The company reported a 29 percent decline in profit for the six months ended June 30 due to the euro-zone crisis and “fragile” economic conditions.  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  said second-quarter profit fell 34 percent as revenue in Asia and Nevada slumped. Adelson, chairman of the Sands, called the Singapore property an “incredible success” during a conference call with investors in June.  “Three hundred million people within a 90-minute flight or a car trip gives us confidence that there is considerable room for growth as tourism expands,” he said.  The island-city is estimated to add 17 percent more hotel rooms from last year through 2014, as visitor arrivals are expected to climb 20 percent in the same period, CBRE said.  More Arrivals  Tourist arrivals are expected to reach 18 million in 2015, up 36 percent from the  13.2 million  last year, Tan of InterContinental said. The chain, which has four hotels in Singapore, plans to double that in the next three to five years, he said.  “Singapore is adding about 2,500 rooms annually now, and the market seems to be able to absorb it quite nicely,” Tan said. “That augurs well for the industry.”  Singapore’s  Marina Bay  area, targeted for development by the government in 2005, includes waterfront pedestrian areas and promenades, a freshwater reservoir, performance spaces, an art and science museum, tapas restaurants and oyster bars, the $6 billion Sands casino resort, commercial and residential buildings and the world’s largest Ferris wheel, the Singapore Flyer. The year it planned the marina, Singapore also overturned a 40-year ban on casinos to spur economic growth.  In addition to the Sands, Resorts World Sentosa, built by  Genting Singapore Plc (GENS)  for S$7 billion, opened in 2010 and features Southeast Asia’s only Universal Studios theme park. The two hotels were granted by the government a 10-year period of operating exclusivity.  New Gardens  Singapore in June opened its newest marina attraction, the S$1 billion, 101-hectare (250-acre)  Gardens by the Bay  featuring flora from South America and Africa, as it seeks to boost visitor arrivals by as much as 10 percent this year. The city plans to spend a further S$905 million over the next five years boosting tourism.  Singapore’s Changi Airport is less than 30 minutes’ drive from Marina Bay. The city invented  congestion pricing , now adopted in cities including London and Stockholm, which charges motorists to use downtown roadways at peak times and results in reduction in traffic jams of as much as  30 percent , increased use of public transportation and lower roadside emissions.  The city’s rapid transformation and influx of foreigners has contributed to crowded transportation and more competition for jobs, public housing and places in schools. The tension led Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s ruling party to its smallest electoral win last year since independence in 1965.  F-1 Premium  Room rates can soar during international events. When the island-state played host to the Formula One race this month, its fifth since 2008, rooms at the Ritz-Carlton along the course were priced at S$1,250 a night, according the hotel’s website, up from S$565 a night a week earlier. Marina Bay Sands rooms were S$811 on the day of the F-1, Sept. 23, compared with S$423 a week earlier.  The SALT conference will host an array of speakers including former junk-bond king Milken and New York University Professor Roubini, as well as politicians  Al Gore  and  Tony Blair . Scaramucci announced in July that he intends to open a SkyBridge Capital office in Singapore next year and seeks to raise as much as $500 million for an Asia-focused fund.  “Our identity as a company matches that of Singapore,” Scaramucci said while making the announcement. “Both are small but manage to pack in a lot and have lots to offer.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Pooja Thakur in Singapore at   pthakur@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Andreea Papuc at   apapuc1@bloomberg.net
