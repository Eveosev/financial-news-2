Singapore ’s stockpiles of  light
distillates  rose to the highest level in eight weeks, according
to data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Stockpiles of naphtha, reformate and gasoline increased 13
percent to 9.77 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 26,
 International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest level since
the week ended Aug. 1.  Middle distillates , a category that includes gasoil and
kerosene, rose 1 percent to 9.33 million barrels.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
 fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen, fell
7.3 percent to 18.53 million barrels. Inventories were 19.98
million barrels a week earlier, the highest level since the week
ended Aug. 7.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
