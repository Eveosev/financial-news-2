MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , the
Texas-based prepaid wireless carrier, rose the most in six weeks
after DealReporter said the company has held talks with suitors
such as  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  and  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)   MetroPCS advanced 6.2 percent to $11.95 at the close in New
York, the biggest daily gain since Aug. 15. The shares have
climbed 38 percent this year.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile USA business participated in
talks with MetroPCS, DealReporter said, citing an unidentified
source familiar with the matter. Some of the talks are ongoing,
the publication reported.  Jason Armstrong, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
said earlier this month that it might make sense for Sprint to
buy MetroPCS or its prepaid rival  Leap Wireless International
Inc. (LEAP)  Such a transaction would be easier to complete than Sprint
buying T-Mobile, the fourth-largest U.S. mobile-phone service.
Sprint ranks third in the market, behind Verizon Wireless and
AT&T Inc.  Drew Crowell, a spokesman for Richardson-based MetroPCS,
Bob Toevs, a Dish spokesman, and  Scott Sloat , with Sprint,
wouldn’t comment. Ron Low, a representative for T-Mobile USA,
also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
