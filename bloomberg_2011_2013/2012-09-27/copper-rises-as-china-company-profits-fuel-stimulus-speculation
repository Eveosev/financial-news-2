Copper rose for the second time in
three days in  New York  on speculation that policy makers will
take steps to spur growth in  China , the world’s largest consumer
of the metal, as profits slid for industrial companies.  Profits dropped 6.2 percent from a year earlier in August,
falling for a fifth month, China’s statistics bureau said today.
China’s stocks jumped the most in three weeks on speculation
that the government will announce measures to bolster the
equities market.  “Copper is very China-sensitive, and so the speculation
that we could see additional stimulus is supportive,”  Bill O’Neill , a partner at Logic Advisors in  Upper Saddle River , New
Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “The rise in China
stocks is creating a positive for the market as well.”  Copper futures for December delivery gained 0.9 percent to
settle at $3.744 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices have risen 8.3 percent this month, heading for the
biggest gain since January.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange
fell to 220,075 metric tons, daily exchange figures showed.
Orders to remove the metal from warehouses rose 1.1 percent to
39,875 on bookings in New Orleans, where they have surged more
than 12-fold this month.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months added 0.7
percent to $8,175 a ton ($3.71 a pound).  Aluminum, nickel, tin, lead and zinc also rose in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
