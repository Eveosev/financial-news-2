Victims of phone-hacking by  News
Corp. (NWSA) ’s now-defunct News of the World tabloid dropped plans to
seek additional damages designed to punish wrongdoers at a civil
trial next year.  Pursuing exemplary damages could prejudice the criminal
proceedings, scheduled to begin in September 2013, a few months
after the civil suit is scheduled to start,  Hugh Tomlinson , a
lawyer for the victims, said at a hearing in London today.  “It’s in the best interests to remove the plea of
exemplary damages on the basis that the claimants will be fully
and properly compensated by awards of ordinary and aggravated
damages,” Tomlinson said.  News Corp., controlled by  Rupert Murdoch , has paid out more
than $315 million for legal fees, civil court settlements, and
the cost of shutting the News of the World as a result of the
phone-hacking scandal. It continues to be the subject of police
probes into phone and computer hacking and bribery.  “We are glad that the claimants have very sensibly seen
the light and agreed to the proposal that they should abandon
their claim,” News Corp. lawyer Dinah Rose said today.  The civil lawsuits are being handled as a single case to
establish a common set of claims and facts about the hacking
conspiracy and set standards for monetary damages. A trial
scheduled for February 2012 was canceled after victims were paid
as much as 600,000 pounds ($972,000) each, including costs.  The current civil trial, which had been scheduled to begin
in May, could be pushed back until June, Judge Geoffrey Vos said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
