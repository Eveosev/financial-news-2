The U.K.,  Europe ’s second-biggest
greenhouse-gas emitter, sold 4 million spot carbon allowances at
7.48 euros ($9.63) a metric ton in an auction, its 29th such
sale since November 2008.  The nation received bids for a total of 15.55 million tons,
3.89 times more than the number of allowances on offer,
according to information from the Debt Management Office, the
government body that oversees the sale.  The permits will be delivered on Oct. 3 due to a closure of
the EU’s carbon permit registry, the DMO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
