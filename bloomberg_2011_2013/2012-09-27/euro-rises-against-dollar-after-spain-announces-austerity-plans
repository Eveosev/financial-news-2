The euro strengthened against the
dollar after  Spain  announced its fifth austerity package, adding
to speculation that it will meet the requirements for a European
financial bailout to contain its debt crisis.  The dollar weakened against all of its 16 most-traded peers
after claims for U.S. jobless benefits fell more than forecast
amid increased demand for risker assets as  stocks  rose for the
first time in six days and crude-oil futures increased. The 17-
nation currency rallied, after reaching a two-week low, as
Spain’s budget plan “responds to country-specific
recommendations and goes even beyond them in some areas,”
European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli
Rehn  said in e-mailed statement.  “The element which is seen now as a positive as it has
increased the odds that Spain will get its bailout,” said
 Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe
Generale SA in  New York . “The market likes the story because
it’s what it wants to hear.”  Europe ’s shared currency gained 0.3 percent to $1.2913 at 5
p.m. New York time, after earlier touching $1.2829, its lowest
level since Sept. 12. The euro advanced 0.1 percent to 100.20
yen. The yen added 0.2 percent to 77.61 per dollar.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 1 percent, while crude
oil futures gained 2.5 percent to $92.26 a barrel in New York.  Euro Trade  The euro has weakened 3.3 percent this year, the second
worst performance after the yen among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar is down 2.9 percent.  The  New Zealand dollar  has led all major currencies this
month against the greenback, appreciating 3.5 percent. The
Brazilian real increased the least out of 16 counterparts versus
the dollar, gaining less than 0.1 percent.  Swedish’s krona has appreciated more than all of its peers
versus the dollar this quarter, gaining 6.1 percent. The
Brazilian real is on pace for the biggest quarterly decline out
of its peers, having slipped 1 percent.  The Brazilian currency has lost 8 percent versus the dollar
in 2012, more than four times the decline of South Africa’s
rand, the second-biggest loser. The Mexican peso leads all 16 of
the dollar’s biggest peers with a gain of 8.6 percent this year.  Price Swings  Implied volatility, which signals the expected pace of
currency swings, for the currencies of Group of Seven nations
fell to 7.85 percent. The gauge reached 7.75 percent on Sept.
13, its lowest level since October 2007, according to a JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  index . Lower volatility makes investments in
currencies with higher benchmark lending rates more attractive
because the risk in such trades is that market moves will erase
profit.  The Australian dollar rebounded from a two-week low amid
speculation  China  will act to support growth in the world’s
biggest consumer of commodities.  The Aussie rose 0.7 percent to $1.0442. It touched $1.0329
yesterday, the weakest since Sept. 6.  New Zealand ’s dollar increased versus the majority of its
major peers as the country’s business confidence rose to a four-
month high in September as record-low  interest rates  boosted
spending and the housing market, according to a survey.  Kiwi Gains  The so-called kiwi advanced 0.9 percent to 83.15 U.S.
cents.  The British pound increased as U.K. gross domestic product
fell 0.4 percent in the second quarter, instead of the 0.5
percent decline estimated last month, the  Office for National
Statistics  said.  The currency climbed 0.4 percent to $1.6235 and advanced
0.1 percent to 79.53 pence per euro, after appreciating to 79.24
pence, the strongest level since Sept. 6.  Spanish 10-year bonds  advanced , snapping their biggest
decline in almost two months, pushing 10-year yields down 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5.95 percent.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s Cabinet approved a new tax
on lottery winnings and a cut in ministries’ spending to shrink
the euro area’s  third-biggest  budget deficit. The 2013 target is
4.5 percent of gross domestic product compared with a 6.3
percent goal for this year. He’s risking a deeper recession
while an unemployment rate of 25 percent stokes mounting
protests.  ’Clearer Signals’  “Investors may have been looking from some clearer signals
that Spain is moving closer towards requesting a bailout,”  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in  Washington  at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage. “But what we’re
seeing does, to some extent, set the groundwork for an eventual
request for aid by Spain.”  The euro could appreciate to $1.32 if the current bailout
situations in Spain and Greece are rectified,  Nick Bennenbroek ,
head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York, said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch Money.”  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six U.S. trading partners, lost 0.4 percent
79.551. It reached 78.601 on Sept. 14, the lowest level since
February.  Applications for U.S. jobless benefits decreased 26,000 to
359,000 in the week ended Sept. 22, the lowest since July, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast 375,000
claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
