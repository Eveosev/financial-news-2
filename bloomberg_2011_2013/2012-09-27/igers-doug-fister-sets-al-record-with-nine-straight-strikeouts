Detroit Tigers pitcher Doug Fister
set an American League record by striking out nine straight
batters in a game.  Fister struck out nine  Kansas City Royals  beginning with
two outs in the fourth and ending with two outs in the seventh,
when catcher Salvador Perez grounded out.  The Tigers were leading the Royals 4-1 in the eighth
inning. Fister, who is 10-9 with a 3.32 earned run average, has
10 strikeouts in the game.  Tom Seaver of the  New York  Mets struck out 10 on April 22,
1970, for the major-league record. Eight straight have been
struck out by AL pitchers five times.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
