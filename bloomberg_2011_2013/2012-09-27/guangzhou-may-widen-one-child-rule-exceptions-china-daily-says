The southern Chinese city of
Guangzhou has proposed revisions to its family planning
regulations that would allow more people to have more than one
child, the  China Daily  reported today.  The proposals include eight situations in which couples
would be allowed to have another child, the newspaper reported,
citing a draft of the revised rules. It didnâ€™t say how many
situations are included in the current regulations.  The revised rules include allowing couples, when one or
both spouse have been previously married, to have a child if one
person has had no more than two children from previous marriages
and the other has had no children, according to the report.
Current rules allow such couples to have a child if one person
has had no more than one child in a previous marriage and the
other has had none, the newspaper reported.  Families in Guangzhou have an average of 2.73 people,
compared with the national average of 3.10, the newspaper
reported, citing population statistics from 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
