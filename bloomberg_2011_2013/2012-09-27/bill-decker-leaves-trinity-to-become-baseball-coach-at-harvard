Bill Decker is leaving Trinity
College after 22 seasons to become head coach of the Harvard
University baseball team, Harvard Director of Athletics Bob Scalise said in a news release.  Decker succeeds  Joe Walsh , who died July 31 after 17 years
as coach of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based team. The Crimson
were 12-30 last year.  Decker is Trinity’s winningest coach with a 529-231 record
that includes five conference championships, nine National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament appearances and one
national championship.  “I step away from that program knowing it’s healthy and
knowing that I can share a similar situation with the wonderful
people at Harvard,” Decker said.  Decker led Trinity, of Hartford,  Connecticut , to a 45-1
mark that resulted in the school’s first NCAA Division III
national title in 2008. Last season, the Bantams were 34-11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
