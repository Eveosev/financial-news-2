Swansea goalkeeper Michel Vorm
signed a four-year contract until 2016, the English Premier
League club said on its website.   Vorm, 28, joined Swansea for 1.5 million pounds ($2.4
million) from Dutch club Utrecht in August 2011. He was voted
the clubâ€™s player of the year last season by both his teammates
and the fans as the Swans finished 11th in their Premier League
debut.   Swansea is currently in 11th place ahead of its game at
Stoke in two days.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
