European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  promised a “big leap forward” toward a better-run euro
economy and urged the U.S. to tame its deficits in order to
shore up global growth.  Barroso, in charge of the European Union’s executive arm,
said plans for better bank supervision and closer fiscal and
political ties within the 17-nation euro zone point the way out
of the almost three-year-old debt crisis.  “There is a now a strong political will in Europe to do
whatever it takes to exit this crisis stronger and more united
than ever before,” Barroso said at  Princeton University  today,
according to a speech text released in Brussels.  Barroso also took aim at global economic imbalances, fueled
by China’s export-driven growth strategy and by budget deficits
and excessive consumption in places like the U.S.  “Restoring growth in  Europe  is as important for the world
as the U.S. actions to prevent a fiscal cliff or the rebalancing
of the growth model of some emerging economies,” Barroso said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
