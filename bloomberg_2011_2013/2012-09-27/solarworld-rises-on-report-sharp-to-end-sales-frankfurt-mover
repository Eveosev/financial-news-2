Solarworld AG (SWV) , Germany’s biggest
maker of solar panels,  rose  to the highest level in four months
after a report that Sharp Corp. plans to trim production of
solar equipment in the U.S. and  Europe .  Solarworld rose for a fourth day, jumping as much as 12
percent to 1.67 euros today, the highest intraday price since
May 18. The stock traded at 1.60 euros at 12.43 p.m. in
 Frankfurt , up 7.6 percent. Shares have fallen 51 percent this
year, valuing the Bonn-based company at 180.9 million euros
($233 million).  “It’d be a positive if some desperate players left the
market, but real consolidation would require also the exit of
some Chinese manufacturers,” Heinz Steffen, an analyst at
Fairesearch, said by telephone. He recommends clients to buy the
shares and expects the stock to rise to 1.90 euros within six
months.  Sharp plans to end production and sales of solar cells and
modules in the U.S. and Europe by March as part of a
restructuring,  Kyodo News  reported today, without saying where
it got the information. Sharp wasn’t the source of the report
and nothing has been decided, Miyuki Nakayama, a company
spokeswoman, said by phone.  Solarworld shares rose 10 percent yesterday, after EU
ProSun, an industry group led by the German company, filed an
anti-subsidy complaint with the European Commission in Brussels,
stepping up demands for tariffs and accusing Chinese exporters
of receiving illegal subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
