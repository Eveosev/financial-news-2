Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds
fell to a record low on speculation policy makers will lower
 interest rates  as soon as tomorrow to support the economy.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 6.34 percent, according to the central
bank, the lowest closing level since the debt was first sold in
2009. The bond’s price rose 0.404 centavo to 129.791 centavos
per peso.  Colombia’s central bank will lower the  overnight lending
rate  by a quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent at its meeting
tomorrow, according to 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Twenty-two said borrowing costs will be unchanged.  “The market is expectant of what may come from tomorrow’s
meeting,” said Daniel Velandia, the head of research at
Correval SA brokerage in Bogota. “People are betting either
that the central bank will hold rates through year-end or lower
the rate once more.”  Banco de la Republica lowered the target lending rate in
August for a second straight month, reducing it by a quarter-
percentage point to 4.75 percent.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 1,798.82 per  U.S. dollar . The
currency has fallen 0.8 percent in the third quarter and rallied
7.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
