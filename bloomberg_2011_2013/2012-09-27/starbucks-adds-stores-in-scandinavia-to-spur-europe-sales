Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  will open its first
city-center stores in Sweden and Norway next year as the world’s
largest coffee-shop operator works to boost  sales  in Europe.  Starbucks will partner with Norway’s Umoe Restaurant Group
AS to open the stores and will increase its locations in
airports and train stations, the companies said in a statement
yesterday. The number of stores to be opened wasn’t disclosed.  The coffee-shop chain has struggled to boost sales in
Europe, a region Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said in
July was “extremely challenging.” Sales at stores open at
least 13 months in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa were
unchanged in the quarter ended July 1, and Seattle-based
Starbucks may begin closing some unprofitable locations in the
current quarter, Alstead said at the time.  Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  has sought to turn
around the company’s European business with television
advertisements and new drink recipes in order to promote demand
as governments impose austerity programs on a weakening economy.  Starbucks  fell  0.8 percent to $50.10 yesterday in  New York .
The shares have gained 8.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
