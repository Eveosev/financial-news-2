European governments need to take
measures that will put an end to the debt crisis during the
respite provided by the  European Central Bank ’s bond-buying
plan, an International Monetary Fund official said.  Policy makers need to find a pace of fiscal consolidation
that’s not so fast it will hurt growth and not so slow that it
will disappoint investors, Jose Vinals, the director of the
IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, said in prepared
remarks for a speech in Brussels today.  “‘Austerity or growth’ and ‘stability or growth’ are not
the real choices in front of us,” Vinals said. “The real
choice is between making tough political decisions that address
once and for all the roots of the crisis, and postponing -- once
more -- taking the necessary measures with the false hope that
time is on our side.”  Vinals’ remarks, echoing Managing Director  Christine Lagarde ’s comments earlier this week, reflect concerns that
Europe may yet again miss a chance to halt its debt crisis even
after ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged to buy government bonds
in exchange for strict conditions. German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  and French President  Francois Hollande  disagree on a
timetable for starting joint oversight of Europe’s banking
sector, while Spain is resisting asking for aid.  Policy makers need to push for changes in their labor and
product markets to boost the region’s growth, Vinals said. In
the financial sector, higher quality capital and “truly liquid
assets” are needed while securitization should also be
restarted, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
