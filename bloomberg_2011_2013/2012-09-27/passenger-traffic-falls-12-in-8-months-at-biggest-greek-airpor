Passenger traffic at Athens
International Airport SA dropped 12 percent in the first eight
months of the year as  Europe ’s economic crisis continued to hurt
spending on travel.  The number of people passing through the country’s biggest
airport fell to 8.9 million in the eight months through Aug. 31
from 10.1 million in the same period a year earlier, according
to a statement posted on the airport’s website. International
passenger traffic declined 13 percent to 5.8 million and
domestic travelers were down 8.7 percent to 3.1 million.  The drop is due to the “negative impact” of  Greece ’s
political and financial turmoil, the company said. In August,
the number of people passing through the airport fell 11 percent
to 1.5 million, with international traffic down to 1 million
from 1.1 million in the same month last year.  Greece’s inconclusive elections in May and June raised
concern the country would leave the euro. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s coalition government is now working to meet targets
under two bailouts from the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund .  Tourism, Greece’s biggest industry, accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and one in five jobs in 2011,
according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
