Republican U.S. Senate candidate
Todd Akin said his Democratic opponent, Missouri Senator  Claire McCaskill , was more “ladylike” in her campaign six years ago
than when she debated him on Sept. 21.  When she defeated Republican Senator Jim Talent in 2006,
McCaskill “had a confidence and was very much more sort of
ladylike,” Akin told reporters today at a press conference in
Jefferson City on the third day of a statewide bus tour.  “In the debate we had Friday, she came out swinging, and I
think that’s because she was threatened,” Akin said.  McCaskill spokeswoman Caitlin Legacki didn’t respond to a
request for comment. McCaskill, 59, is seeking a second term.  Akin, 65, a six-term Republican congressman, was pressured
by other Republicans to quit the Senate race after he said in a
television interview last month that “legitimate rape” rarely
causes pregnancy.  He refused to end his candidacy, and some Republicans
resumed supporting him after Sept. 25, the last day he could
seek a court order to have his name removed from the Nov. 6
ballot. The  National Republican Senatorial Committee , the Senate
Republicans’ campaign arm, endorsed him yesterday. Last month,
NRSC Chairman  John Cornyn  of Texas had called on Akin to leave
the race.  Washington Senator  Patty Murray , who heads Senate
Democrats’ campaign efforts, said in a statement that Akin was
“at it again with another comment that’s demeaning to women and
offensive to all.”  She called on the NRSC to condemn his latest remark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
