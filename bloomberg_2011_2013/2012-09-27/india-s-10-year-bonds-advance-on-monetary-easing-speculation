India ’s 10-year bonds gained for
the first time in three days on speculation the central bank
will ease the monetary policy further to counter slowing growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India cut the  cash reserve ratio  on
Sept. 17 by 25 basis points to 4.50 percent, the lowest level in
eight years.  Asia ’s third-largest economy grew 5.5 percent in
the three months ended June, government data show. Growth was
5.3 percent in the previous quarter, the least since 2009.  “Bonds are gaining on expectations of policy support to
boost growth,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.16 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  The RBI refrained from cutting the repurchase rate for a
third meeting this month after reducing it by 50 basis points to
8 percent in April. The next policy review is due Oct. 30.  The government will borrow 2 trillion rupees ($38 billion)
selling debt in the six months beginning October, as budgeted by
the government, Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said
today.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.64 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
