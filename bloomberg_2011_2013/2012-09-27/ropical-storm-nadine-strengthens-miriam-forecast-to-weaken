Tropical Storm Nadine, which formed
more than two weeks ago, became a little stronger in the
Atlantic, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. In
the Pacific, Miriam is set to weaken today.  Nadine was about 680 miles (1,095 kilometers) south-
southwest of the Azores with winds of 60 miles per hour, up from
45 mph yesterday, as it moved southwest at 6 mph, the Miami-
based center said in an  advisory  issued at 5 a.m. Atlantic
Standard Time. Slow strengthening is forecast over the next two
days, according to the notice.  Tropical Storm Miriam was about 395 miles west of the
southern tip of  Baja California , a peninsula in northwest
 Mexico , with winds of 45 mph, the NHC said in a separate
 advisory . The system is forecast to weaken.  Further south, the center is monitoring a system about 375
miles south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico that has a 50
percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next two
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
