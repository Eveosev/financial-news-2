Greece  is evaluating bids to
explore and produce oil and gas reserves in three blocks in the
west of the country, Deputy Energy Minister Assimakis Papageorgiou said.  “The bids were opened in the middle of this month and are
in the process of final evaluation,” Papageorgiou said at a
conference yesterday, according to an e-mailed transcript of his
comments from the  ministry .  Greece received eight bids from 11 companies acting on
their own, or as part of ventures, for oil and natural-gas
reserves in the Patraikos Gulf and in Katakolo, located off the
western coast, and in Ioannina in the northwest of the mainland,
the Athens-based Energy Ministry said on July 2.  A venture between  Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE) ,  Edison
International (EIX)  SpA and  Melrose Resources Plc (MRS)  made bids for
Ioannina and Patraikos, a group comprising Energean Oil & Gas
SA, Trajan Oil & Gas Ltd. and  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  bid for rights
in Patraikos and Katakolo, while Energean and Schlumberger
together with  Petra Petroleum Inc. (PTL)  bid for Ioannina, the
ministry said.  Arctic Hunter Energy Inc. (AHU)  and K.O. Enterprises Inc. made a
joint bid for Ioannina while Chariot Oil and Gas Ltd. submitted
an offer on its own. Grekoil Energy Ventures Ltd. made a solo
bid for Katakolo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
