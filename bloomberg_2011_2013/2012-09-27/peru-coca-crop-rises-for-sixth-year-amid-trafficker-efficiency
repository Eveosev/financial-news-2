Peru ’s coca crop increased for a
sixth straight year in 2011 as producers diversify away from
areas targeted by U.S. government-backed efforts to eradicate
the plant used to make cocaine.  The area under cultivation increased 2.1 percent to 62,500
hectares (154,441 acres) from 61,200 hectares in 2010, according
to a report released yesterday by the  United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime .  Cultivation increased in 10 of Peru’s 11 growing areas
covered by the agency’s survey last year, led by a 40 percent
rise in plantations in the northeast near the Brazilian border
to 4,450 hectares. Production is rising to meet demand for crack
and cocaine in  Europe  and  Brazil , which is the largest market in
the Americas after the U.S.  “Drug traffickers are becoming more efficient” said
Flavio Mirella, the head of the agency’s Peruvian office, during
a presentation of the report in  Lima . “Traffickers need less
coca leaf to produce more cocaine. Routes of supply are
diversifying and producing areas are getting closer to certain
routes of exit” toward  Bolivia  and Brazil, he said.  New growing areas have compensated for slower growth in the
Valley of the Apurimac and Ene rivers, Peru’s top-growing area
since 2010, where there is little room to expand, and the Alto
Huallaga area, where eradication is focused, said Mirella.  Guerrillas, Government  Maoist guerrillas protecting growing areas and transit
routes for cocaine consignments have stepped up attacks on army
patrols this year, leading the government to allocate greater
resources for the drugs fight in next year’s budget.  President  Ollanta Humala  aims to increase manual
eradication of coca crops to 30,000 hectares by 2016 from its
target of 14,000 hectares this year while encouraging farmers to
switch to alternative crops such as cocoa and coffee.  Cultivation of the crop in  Colombia  rose for the first time
since 2007 last year, expanding 3 percent to 64,000 hectares,
while the crop contracted by about 12 percent in Bolivia,
according to the agency.  Peru and Bolivia have overtaken Colombia to become the
world’s biggest cocaine producers, according to a U.S.
government report published July 30.  Europe remains the biggest market for cocaine shipments
from Peru while Colombia is the top supplier of cocaine to the
U.S., according to the UN agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
