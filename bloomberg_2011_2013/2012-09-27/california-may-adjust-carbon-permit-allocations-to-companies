California’s air resources board
may adjust the number of carbon permits it plans to give to
specific companies before the first auction of allowances in
November under the state’s cap-and-trade program,  Mary Nichols ,
the board’s chairman, said during a conference in  San Francisco .  Industry allocations wouldn’t change, just the distribution
to companies within the sectors, she said.  The agency hasn’t officially assigned the permits yet to
most of the companies regulated under the program and may
reconsider allocations based on new data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
