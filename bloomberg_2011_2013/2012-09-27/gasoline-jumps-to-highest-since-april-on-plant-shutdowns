Gasoline rose to the highest level
in almost five months on concern that refinery shutdowns in the
Atlantic Basin will further reduce stockpiles on the U.S. East
Coast.  Prices climbed the most since June 29 as  Europe ’s largest
refinery, Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s 400,000-barrel-a-day Pernis
plant in the Netherlands, is conducting maintenance until early
November. Supplies on the East Coast, including  New York  Harbor,
the delivery point for futures contracts, were the lowest since
October 2008 last week, Energy Department data show.  “You’re losing a significant amount of Atlantic Basin
supply,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  Gasoline for October delivery rose 6.79 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $3.149 a gallon at 1:09 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $3.2086, the highest
intraday price for the front-month contract since April 30.
Prices are up 15 percent since June.  The premium of the front month over later months, known as
backwardation, is the largest since Sept. 1, 2005. The October
contract, which expires tomorrow, was 24.5 cents over November
as of 1:10 p.m.  U.S. gasoline  inventories  fell 481,000 barrels to 195.8
million barrels last week, the ninth consecutive decline and the
lowest level since October 2008, according to department data.
Output slid 2.1 percent to the lowest level in 10 weeks.  Tight Supply  “You have tight supply in the Harbor, coupled with
refinery outages and slowdowns and you’re heading into
maintenance season,” said Dan Stauffer, an over-the-counter
energy broker at INTL FCStone Inc. in New York.  Irving Oil Corp. is performing maintenance on sections of
the 298,800-barrel-a-day Saint John refinery in  New Brunswick ,
which exports more than half of its production to the East
Coast.  Valero Energy Corp. shut all the main production units,
including the fluid catalytic cracker and coker, at its Pembroke
refinery in Wales while the plant’s only crude unit undergoes an
eight-week turnaround.  The refinery maintenance at St. John, Pernis and Pembroke
may further reduce shipments to the East Coast. Last week,
gasoline imports were the lowest for this time of the year since
at least 2004.  Gasoline stockpiles in independent storage in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp, Europe’s oil-trading hub, dropped to the
lowest level in almost a year, according to PJK International
BV.  “There’s a lot of heavy maintenance going on in Europe,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. “Basically, we’re at extremely low levels.”  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 1 cent to $3.795 a gallon
yesterday, AAA  data  show. Prices have fallen 12 of the past 13
days, declining 7.6 cents to the lowest since Aug. 27. Prices
reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  October-delivery heating oil rose 5.21 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $3.1589 a gallon on exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
