The  U.S. economy  probably created
more jobs than currently estimated in the year ended March 2012,
the Labor Department said today in preliminary projections.  The number of jobs added to payrolls will probably be
revised up by 386,000 from the current estimate of 1.94 million,
the Labor Department said on its website.  The final annual benchmark revisions to payrolls will be
issued with the January employment data that are released in
February 2013. The Labor Department uses records from state
jobless benefit tax records to benchmark its employment data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
