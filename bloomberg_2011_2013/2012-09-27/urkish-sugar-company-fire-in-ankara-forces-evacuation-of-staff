Staff were evacuated from the
headquarters of  Turkey â€™s state-owned sugar company, Turkiye

top floor of the building in Ankara today, the state-run agency
said. Some kitchen personnel suffered smoke inhalation, it said.  Video footage on NTV television showed smoke billowing from
the building and covering the sky in downtown Ankara.  The cause of the fire was not immediately clear, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
