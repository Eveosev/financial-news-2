Shaun Kingsbury, an investment
partner at private equity group Hudson Clean Energy Partners LP,
was appointed to run the U.K. government’s 3 billion-pound ($4.9
billion)  Green Investment Bank .  Six non-executive directors, including HgCapital LLP
Director Tom Murley and  Standard Life Plc (SL/)  Chief Executive
Officer David Nish, were also appointed, U.K. Business Secretary
Vince Cable said today in a  statement . They’ll take up their
posts in late October.  The bank, to be started with 3 billion pounds of state
money, is designed to spur investment in carbon-cutting
technologies such as offshore wind power. It will be based in
Edinburgh with the main transaction team in  London  and will be
fully operational later this year, subject to European
Commission approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
