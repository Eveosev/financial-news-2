U.S. Bancorp said it’s working with
federal law enforcement officials after “attacks” on its
website caused delays for customers.  “These issues are related to unusual and coordinated high
traffic volume designed to slow down the system, similar to what
other banks have experienced in the past week,” said Nicole
Garrison-Sprenger, a spokeswoman for the Minneapolis-based
company, in an e-mailed statement. Customer data and funds are
secure, she said. “We are continuing to monitor the situation
today and we will take any precautions we deem necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
