Gasoline fell, paring the biggest
weekly gain since July, as refineries returned from seasonal
maintenance while supplies are above normal.  Futures slipped 1 percent after climbing to $2.6837 a
gallon yesterday from $2.5031 Nov. 7.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Baton
Rouge plant in Louisiana and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Three Rivers
refinery in  Texas  finished planned work. Gasoline  supplies  were
209.2 million barrels, 1.9 percent above the five-year average
for this time of year.  “Over the course of five trading days, gasoline rallied
nearly 20 cents. It’s not unusual for it to fall off,” said
Andy Lebow, a New York-based senior vice president at Jefferies
Bache LLC. “There’s probably some profit-taking, and there’s
the expectation of higher production due to refineries returning
from turnarounds.”  Gasoline for December delivery fell 2.6 cents to settle at
$2.6577 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Trading
volume for all contracts was 35 percent above the 100-day
average at 3:24 p.m. Prices rose 4.1 percent this week, the
largest gain since the period ended July 12.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI shrank $1.17 to $17.78 a
barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent fell $1.21 to $2.33.  U.S.  pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.5 cent to
$3.199 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its
website and are 23.9 cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for December delivery advanced 0.83
cent to $2.9389 a gallon on trading volume that was 4.7 percent
below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI widened 27 cents to $29.59 a
barrel, the highest level since April. The fuel’s crack  spread 
versus Brent widened 10 cents to $15.02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
