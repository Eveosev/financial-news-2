Novak Djokovic and Tomas Berdych
both won in straight sets to leave  Serbia  and the  Czech Republic 
tied 1-1 after the first day of the Davis Cup tennis final.  Djokovic gave Serbia the lead by defeating Radek Stepanek
7-5, 6-1, 6-4 to open the best-of-five final in Belgrade.
Berdych then beat Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 to pull the
defending champion even.  The teams will play a doubles match tomorrow, with two
singles matches scheduled for the following day.  Djokovic extended his winning streak to 23 matches since
losing the U.S. Open final to Spain’s  Rafael Nadal  in September.
The world’s No. 2-ranked player beat the top-ranked Nadal at the
ATP World Tour Finals four days ago for his seventh tournament
title of the season.  Berdych, ranked seventh by the men’s tour, didn’t lose a
service game in defeating the No. 117 Lajovic, who was broken
four times. Lajovic is replacing  Janko Tipsarevic , who missed
the final with an injured right heel.  The Czech Republic is seeking to win the top team event in
men’s tennis for the third time. Serbia captured its only title
in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
