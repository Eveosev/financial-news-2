Nintendo Co. (7974) , the creator of the
game franchises Mario and Zelda, closed at the highest since
August after buying a stake in  Dwango Co. (3715) , a company that
provides content through mobile phones.  The stock rose 5.15 percent to close at 13,070 yen in
 Tokyo , the highest since Aug. 6. Dwango shares surged 21 percent
after the video game company bought 612,200 Dwango shares,
according to a statement filed with the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today.  Nintendo isn’t planning to distribute games through
Dwango’s video delivery system Niconico, Nintendo spokesman
 Yasuhiro Minagawa  said. Nintendo currently promotes its games
through the system, he said.  Nintendo acquired the shares at the request of Dwango
Chairman Nobuo Kawakami for his personal funding needs, saidMinagawa.  Nintendo, which posted a net loss of 8 billion yen ($81
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30, maintained its
projection to sell 9 million Wii U units and 18 million 3DS
devices in the full fiscal year, the company said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
