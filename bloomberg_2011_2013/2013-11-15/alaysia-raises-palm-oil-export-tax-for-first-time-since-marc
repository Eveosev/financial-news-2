Malaysia , the world’s second-largest
producer, increased the  tax  on exports of crude palm oil after
keeping it unchanged since March. Prices entered a  bull market 
on Nov. 1.  Cargoes will be taxed at 5 percent in December, according
to a Customs Department statement on the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board website. The reference price was set at 2,452.43 ringgit
($765) a metric ton. The tariff was zero in January and February
before rising to 4.5 percent in March. Indonesia last month set
its export tax at 9 percent for November.  “Because of the slight increase in export duty which will
come into effect in December, it might stimulate short-term
demand in the  spot market  in order to enjoy the 4.5 percent
now,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga
Investment Bank Bhd. “The short-term increase in demand should
bode well for the spot market and probably flow to the futures
market as well.”  Futures for delivery in January rose as much as 1.2 percent
to 2,620 ringgit on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange after the
export tax was announced. Palm rose to 2,628 ringgit on Nov. 1,
the highest close since September 2012 and 21 percent more than
the 2,167 ringgit settlement on July 29, meeting the common
definition of a bull market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
