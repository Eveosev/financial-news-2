The  Federal Reserve ’s errors in
predicting inflation are “within the normal range of
uncertainty” and stem from changes in economic growth and labor
costs, according to economists at the Cleveland Fed.  The inaccurate forecasts for price increases shouldn’t
raise doubts about the reliability of such projections and
forecasting models, Cleveland Fed economists Todd Clark and
Saeed Zaman said in a  report  released today. The  Federal Open
Market Committee  in January 2012 predicted 1.7 percent inflation
for this year compared with a recent forecast of about 1.2
percent, they said. The Fed has a 2 percent goal for inflation.  “The gap between actual inflation and forecasts made in
early 2012 hasn’t been especially large and falls well within
the normal range of uncertainty,” they said. The model they use
in the study “explains most of the falloff in inflation as a
response to other economic developments.”  Policy makers monitor the Personal Consumption Expenditures
index, which tracks prices paid for everything from homes to
clothes. September’s 0.9 percent increase was the second lowest
since 2009.  St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  has said policy
makers should be careful in changing policy based solely on
their economic forecasts, which have proven in the past to be
too rosy.  FOMC forecasts “have tended to be too optimistic over the
last several years,” Bullard, who votes on monetary policy this
year, said in August. “Given this experience, I think caution
is warranted in taking policy action based on forecasts alone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
