Hog futures rose for the first time
in four days on signs of increasing demand for U.S. pork demand
and tightening supplies. Cattle advanced.  Yesterday, the price of  wholesale pork  jumped 1.9 percent,
the most in eight weeks, the latest U.S. government data show.
This week, hog processors have slaughtered 1.69 million animals,
down 3 percent from a week earlier.  “Domestic consumption has been pretty darn good,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  Hog futures for February settlement climbed 0.4 percent to
90.175 cents a pound at 9:38 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile

days.  Wholesale pork has climbed 14 percent this year to 93.97
cents a pound.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.1 percent to
