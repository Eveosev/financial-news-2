Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  region
strengthened to the highest level in almost a month after a fire
early today at  Chevron Corp (CVX) ’s Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery
killed a worker and shut a unit.  Conventional 85.5-octane gasoline, or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast gained 3 cents to a discount of 15.25 cents a gallon below
 New York  Mercantile Exchange futures at 12:11 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the narrowest discount
since Oct. 17.  “If it’s a pretty big problem for Chevron there, they’re
going to have go to the cash market to cover their branding
needs,” Jim Mosby, supply manager of ADMO Energy LLC, said by
phone from  Kansas City , Missouri. “So people just jump in front
of them in anticipation.”  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  climbed 1 cent to 15.25
cents a gallon below futures, the narrowest discount since Oct.
18.  The Pascagoula detonation took place at 2 a.m. local time
in the furnace of a reformate splitter unit at the 330,000-barrel-a-day plant on  Mississippi ’s Gulf Coast, and the
subsequent fire took about an hour to put out, Tom Kovar,
general manager of the refinery, said in a press conference
today at the site. The unit was called “cracking 2 area”in
company statements throughout the day.  The refinery produces 130,000 barrels of gasoline, 68,000
barrels of diesel and 50,000 barrels of jet fuel a day,
according to a company website. It also produces bunker fuel,
liquefied petroleum gases and other products.  Conventional,  85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago
weakened by 4 cents relative to New York futures to a discount
of 23 cents a gallon at 12:39 p.m. New York time.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel  in  Chicago  strengthened 0.5 cent to 3 cents
below ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
