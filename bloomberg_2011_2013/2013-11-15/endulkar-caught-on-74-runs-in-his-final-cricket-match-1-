Sachin Tendulkar  was caught on 74 to
end his first innings of his final cricket Test as  India  built a
313-run lead over the West Indies.  Tendulkar is playing his 200th and final match in the
longest form of the game. He was caught by  Darren Sammy  off the
bowling of Narsingh Deonarine after facing 118 balls and hitting
12 fours in Mumbai.  The hosts won the toss yesterday and put the West Indies in
to bat. The visitors were all out for 182 runs in 55.2 overs,
and India ended its innings on 495 all out.  Nicknamed “Little Master” and “Master Blaster,” the 5-foot-5 Tendulkar is playing in his hometown. He holds almost all
of cricket’s major run-getting records, including the most runs
and centuries in elite Test and one-day matches. In 2011, he
helped India win its first Cricket World Cup title since 1983.  Last year, when just one month shy of his 39th birthday, he
became the first player to score 100 international centuries.  Tendulkar made his Test debut against  Pakistan  in November
1989 and registered his first three-figure score the following
year against  England . In 2008, he passed West Indian batsman
Brian Lara as the top scorer in elite five-day matches. He needs
79 runs in his final innings to reach 16,000 for his Test
career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
