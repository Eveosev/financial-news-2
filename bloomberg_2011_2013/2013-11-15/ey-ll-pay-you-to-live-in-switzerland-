Like the rest of the rich world, Switzerland is currently experiencing rising inequality, and rising prices for key items like real estate. And since Switzerland has a very vibrant referendum system, they’re getting ready to vote on  a proposal to give everyone a basic income of $2,800 a month . This would enable a married couple to earn $67,200 a year without working. That minimum amounts to less than half of Switzerland’s per-capita income of $80,000. But it’s still a whole lot of money; the U.S. equivalent would be mailing every adult here a check for $2,000 a month. The economic effects, positive and negative, would probably be far-reaching, as Annie Lowrey  reports  in the New York Times: It's less surprising that liberals would take a shine to the idea: I’m a big booster of the Earned Income Tax Credit, but I’ve been less sanguine about the effects of a basic income, which are likely to be at best uneven. Consider the cost of real estate, one of the sore points in Switzerland, where there isn’t a whole lot of flat land to build on. In that, Switzerland is a bit like my own home city of Washington: it’s a small area attracting a lot of new, more-affluent residents (wonks and lobbyists, in Washington’s case; international finance types for Switzerland). Many of the poorer residents don’t make enough to compete in the new bidding wars, and they don’t like it one bit. But suppose we gave everyone in Washington a check for $2500 a month. Would that make it easier for the old residents to get nicer apartments? Not really, because everyone would be getting that check. Poorer residents would have another $2500 to commit to the housing bidding war, but so would the wealthier residents. Unless the $2,500 actually created a larger supply of housing -- and that’s as much a matter of planning regulations and building codes as of demand. In other words, there’s a difference between giving one person $2,500, which makes her unambiguously better off, and trying to get the same effect by giving every single taxpayer $2,500. Which is not to say that this scheme can’t work, just that there are reasons to think that it might not solve the concernsthat motivated it. It also seems to me unlikely that a basic income would replace welfare programs. The programs would creep back, because farmers like food stamps and health care providers like health care subsidies, and politicians in expensive urban areas do not want their loyal constituents forced into other counties where they can’t vote for the politicians in expensive urban areas. When you view a basic income as an addition to the welfare state, rather than a replacement, it starts to seem quite expensive indeed. Especially if it encourages more people not to work. On the other hand, you can tout potential economic benefits. People might be freed to take more economic risks, say on starting a new business. The poor might use the extra resources to invest in education. And a universal benefit might get rid of some of the  perverse disincentives to work  that are built into our current system. Overall, I’d really like to see Switzerland pass this, if only so we can observe the effects.
