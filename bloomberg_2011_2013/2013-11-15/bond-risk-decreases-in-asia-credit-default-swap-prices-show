The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  from non-payment decreased, according to
traders of credit default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 134 basis points
as of 8:21 a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The measure is poised to drop 2.2 basis
points this week, the most since the five days ended Oct. 18,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 2 basis points to
85.75 as of 9.22 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is set for an 8.75 basis-point fall this week, the
most since the five days ended July 12, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 0.5 of a basis point
to 103.5 basis points as of 11:44 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
