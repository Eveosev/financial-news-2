 David Zervos, managing director at 
Jeffries LLC, looks at testimony to Congress by Janet Yellen, 
nominated to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, and 
explains why it indicates that she will maintain the Fed's bond 
purchase program known as quantitative easing in order to create
higher nominal gross domestic product, which also means higher 
inflation.  Zervos talks with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hays and 
guest host Barry Ritholtz, head of Ritholtz Wealth Management 
and a Bloomberg View contributor, on Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays
Advantage."  (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 10:51
