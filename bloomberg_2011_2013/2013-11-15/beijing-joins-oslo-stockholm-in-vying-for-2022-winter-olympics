Beijing, Oslo and  Stockholm  joined
 Poland ’s Krakow, Lviv in Ukraine and Kazakhstan’s Almaty in
bidding for the 2022 Winter Olympics, double the number of
cities that vied for the 2018 games.  Potential hosts had to submit bids to the International
Olympic Committee by midnight last night. The proposals will be
assessed, finalists selected and then the host will be awarded
the Games in July 2015 at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the IOC
said today in an e-mailed statement.  “These cities and their supporters clearly understand the
benefits that hosting the Games can have and the long lasting
legacy that a Games can bring to a region,” new IOC President
Thomas Bach said in the statement. “Indeed, while recent Games
have left an array of sporting, social, economic and other
legacies for the local population, many cities that did not go
on to win the right to host the Games have also noted benefits
as a result of their bids.”  The Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi will host the next
winter Games in February, and the 2022 bid cities will get an
opportunity to observe how an Olympics unfolds as it happens,
the IOC said. The 2018 Winter Games will be held in Pyeongchang,
South Korea.  Earlier this year, citizens in the southern German
state of Bavaria voted against a bid by Munich to host the 2022
event, two years after the city made a failed attempt
to stage the 2018 edition.  The majority of voters in Munich, the Alpine resort of
Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the districts of Berchtesgadener Land
and Traunstein rejected a potential bid in a referendum.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
