Miox Corp., a closely held U.S.
producer of water-treatment technology, is donating equipment to
purify water in areas of the  Philippines  recovering from Typhoon
Haiyan.  Miox is providing six sodium hypochlorite generators that
are expected to arrive by Nov. 17, Aileen Culling, a spokeswoman
for  Albuquerque , New Mexico-based Miox, said today in an
interview. The systems are being delivered through a joint
effort with Operation Blessing International Relief &
Development Corp., which is also sending a system made by Severn
Trent Plc. The seven devices can treat about 500,000 gallons
(1.9 million liters) daily.  “There’s aid coming from all over the world, but the
infrastructure is just destroyed,” Culling said. Miox has
donated water-treatment systems after at least four other recent
disasters, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake, she said.  Typhoon Haiyan has killed at least 3,600 people and
displaced almost 1.9 million people, according to government
estimates. Relief efforts were slowed because roads were washed
out or covered in debris from the storm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
