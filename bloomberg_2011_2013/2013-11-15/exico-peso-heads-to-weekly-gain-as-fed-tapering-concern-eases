Mexico ’s peso headed to its biggest
weekly advance since September amid eased concern that the
Federal Reserve will reduce U.S. monetary stimulus that has
bolstered demand for the Latin American country’s securities.  The currency appreciated 1.6 percent this week to 12.9622
per dollar as of 9:36 a.m. in Mexico City. It was little changed
today. Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.2 percent today, pushing the drop
since Nov. 8 to six basis points.  The peso gained this week as Janet Yellen, President  Barack Obama ’s nominee to be the next Fed chairman, indicated that she
will maintain U.S. policy makers’ pace of asset purchases until
she sees a robust economic recovery. Speculation that the U.S.
central bank may reduce its $85 billion in monthly bond buying
in December had been mounting since a U.S. Labor Department
report showed last week that companies hired more workers than
forecast in October.  “What got rid of all the pressure was Yellen’s
testimony,” Eduardo Rodriguez, a trader at Casa de Bolsa
Finamex SAB, said in a telephone interview from Guadalajara,
Mexico. “Currencies like the peso revalued without the pressure
of a rate increase and automatically there were flows to
 emerging markets  like Mexico.”  Yellen signaled her determination to use bond buying to
strengthen the economy and drive down the unemployment rate in
the U.S., Mexico’s top export market, during testimony before
the Senate Banking Committee yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
