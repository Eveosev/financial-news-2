New York Knicks guard J.R. Smith was
fined $25,000 for “directing hostile language to another player
via his Twitter account,” the National Basketball Association
said in an e-mailed news release.  Smith was fined for his action two days ago that followed a
Twitter post by Detroit Pistons guard  Brandon Jennings 
criticizing  Chris Smith , J.R.’s brother and Knicks teammate.
Jennings later deleted his post.  “No respect for these lil kids who pop at the mouth on
twitter an then want to delete they tweets! #GrowUp! @ManUp!”
Smith said in his post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
