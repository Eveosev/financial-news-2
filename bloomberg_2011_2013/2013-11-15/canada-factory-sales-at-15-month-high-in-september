Canadian  factory sales  rose to the
highest in more than a year in September as automakers
introduced new models and grain mills resumed production after
maintenance shutdowns.  Sales rose 0.6 percent to C$49.9 billion ($47.7 billion),
the highest since June 2012, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. Economists forecast a 0.5 percent increase, according to
the median in a Bloomberg  survey  with 15 responses.  While production is 1 percent above year-earlier levels, it
remains 1.3 percent below the post-recession peak set at the end
of 2011, with demand hobbled by an inconsistent global recovery.
The  Bank of Canada  has said that business investment and exports
remain weak in an economy led by  consumer spending , as companies
wait for clearer signs of expansion abroad.  “We may see a moderation in sales in the last quarter of
the year,” said  Krishen Rangasamy , senior economist at National
Bank Financial in  Montreal . “New orders fell significantly, not
just in September but three declines in a row.” New factory
orders  declined  2.6 percent to C$48.3 billion in September.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.1 percent to C$1.0472 per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:31 a.m. in Toronto. Yesterday it touched
C$1.0526, the lowest level since Sept 4. One dollar buys 95.49
U.S. cents.  Motor vehicle assembly rose 5.4 percent to C$4.70 billion
in September, and auto parts sales increased 2.5 percent to
C$1.96 billion. Food manufacturing rose 2.6 percent to C$7.46
billion, the fastest since December, led by grain and oilseed
mills that re-opened after shutdowns.  Sales Volumes  Sales rose in 11 of 21  categories  tracked by  Statistics
Canada , accounting for 55 percent of production.  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales rose 1
percent in September.  Inventories fell 0.9 percent to C$68.2 billion, with the
ratio of factory stockpiles to sales falling to 1.37 from 1.39.  Unfilled orders fell 2.2 percent to C$71.9 billion, as a
stronger U.S. dollar pared the value of aerospace orders
recorded in local currency, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
