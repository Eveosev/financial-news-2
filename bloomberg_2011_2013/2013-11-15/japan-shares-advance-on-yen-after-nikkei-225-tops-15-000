Japanese shares rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  climbing above 15,000 for the first
time since May, after the yen weakened past 100 to the dollar on
the outlook for U.S. stimulus.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets about 70 percent of its revenue from
outside Japan, jumped 3.4 percent. Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co.
added 6.6 percent after raising its profit forecast. Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc., the nation’s biggest bank by market
value, gained 2 percent after boosting its net-income outlook.
Japan Airlines Co. fell 2.3 percent, with the sector the only
decliner among the Topix’s 33 industry groups.  The Nikkei 225 gained 1.9 percent to 15,165.92 in  Tokyo ,
its first close above 15,000 since May 22. The gauge jumped 7.7
percent this week, the biggest weekly advance since December
2009. The  Topix index  increased 1.7 percent to 1,239.04, its
highest close since May 22. The yen fell to as low as 100.31.  “The risk-on flow is helping the yen weaken to 100 to the
dollar, a big driver for exporter shares,” said Juichi Wako, a
Tokyo-based equity strategist at Nomura Securities Co., Japan’s
biggest brokerage. “Compared to the Nikkei 225 at 15,000 in
May, there isn’t any sense of overheating in today’s market.”  The Nikkei 225 surged 80 percent from November 2012 to its
highest close in 5 1/2 years on May 22, amid optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  will lead the country
out of the deflation. The gauge then slumped 20 percent through
June 13 to enter a  bear market , before recovering to close today
at its highest since the May peak.  Yellen Comments  Global equities advanced yesterday after  Janet Yellen , a
nominee to lead the  Federal Reserve , said she will ensure
monetary stimulus isn’t removed too soon. Asked about stock
prices, she said she doesn’t see “bubble-like conditions.”  “I consider it imperative that we do what we can to
promote a very strong recovery,” Yellen said in response to a
question during her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee in
 Washington . “It’s important not to remove support, especially
when the recovery is fragile and the tools available to monetary
policy, should the economy falter, are limited given that short-term  interest rates  are at zero.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1
percent today. The equity benchmark gained 0.5 percent to extend
a record high yesterday after Yellen’s testimony, pushing this
year’s surge to more than 25 percent and on course for the best
annual gain in a decade.  The yen yesterday breached 100 per dollar for the first
time in two months ahead of the Bank of Japan meeting next week,
and following data that showed third-quarter growth slowed. It
also weakened after Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said at a
parliamentary committee it was important for the nation to
retain the option to intervene in  currency markets , in response
to a question about the foreign-exchange accounts law.  Exporters Advance  Exporters jumped. Sony climbed 3.4 percent to 1,846 yen.
Panasonic Corp., which gets almost half its sales outside Japan,
rose 2.8 percent to 1,060 yen.  Sharp Corp. (6752) , a TV maker that
generates about 60 percent of sales abroad, rose 2.1 percent to
286 yen.  A gauge tracking brokerages climbed 4.7 percent, the most
among the Topix’s industry groups, amid a surge in trading.
Nomura Holdings Inc., the biggest company in the sector, gained
4.8 percent to 790 yen. Daiwa Securities Group Inc., the second-biggest, added 4.2 percent to 994 yen.  Volume on the Nikkei 225 was 49 percent above the 30-day
average today. The number of shares changing hands on the Topix
was up 31 percent on its 30-day average.  The Topix Insurance Index jumped 4.1 percent today, the

net-income forecast 54 percent to 57 billion yen, beating the
40.9 billion-yen estimate of 13 analyst surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank Forecasts  Mitsubishi UFJ increased 2 percent to 658 yen, the second-biggest  boost  to the Topix. The lender raised its full-year
profit forecast to 910 billion yen from its previous outlook for
760 billion yen. Mizuho Financial Group Inc., which boosted its
profit guidance to 600 billion yen from 500 billion yen, rose
1.9 percent to 218 yen.  Nintendo Co. added 5.2 percent to 13,070 yen, its highest
since August. The gaming console maker bought a stake in Dwango
Co., which provides content through mobile phones, according to
a statement filed with the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.  The Topix Air Transport index  dropped  1.2 percent.  Japan
