German stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index heading for a sixth straight weekly
advance, as investors awaited U.S. industrial-output data.  K+S AG (SDF)  increased 1.2 percent after Bankhaus Lampe KG
upgraded the shares. SAP AG, the largest maker of business-management software, rose 1 percent after Barclays Plc raised
its recommendation on the stock.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  climbed
1.2 percent after the airline said sales of first-class tickets
have risen more than 10 percent.  The DAX fell 0.1 percent to 9,141.45 at 9:29 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The gauge has risen 0.7 percent this week after
gaining 0.8 percent last week when better-than-forecast U.S.
economic growth and payrolls data was published. It has surged
20 percent this year as central banks around the world pledged
to leave  interest rates  low for a prolonged period. The broader
HDAX Index was also little changed today.  Manufacturing in the New York region grew at a  faster pace 
in November after slowing for three consecutive months,
according to the median economist projection in a Bloomberg
survey. The Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkâ€™s index probably
rose to 5, rebounding from a five-month low. Positive readings
signal expansion in New York, northern  New Jersey  and southern
Connecticut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
