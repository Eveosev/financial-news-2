We sent Anthony Doerr to the Arctic, to dive with polar bears and embrace the cold of northern Canada. He sent us back this letter from the ice… For even more Arctic excitement, read Anthony's full tale of his adventure here and see additional photos of his sea dives and ice hikes. Hello from the frozen ocean, north of the northernmost part of Alaska! I'm typing this in my tent out on the frozen sea ice this morning as we pack up during a storm to head 45 miles back to Pond Inlet, the town I flew into last week. I'm wearing four shirts and three pairs of long underwear, and I can see my breath as I type. The wind is blowing about thirty or forty miles an hour and the walls of the tent are shaking like crazy. Our departure (we ride in long sleds pulled behind snowmobiles) has been delayed until noon in the hope that the wind will settle a bit. We've had a strange and sublime week wandering around out here and looking for animals--we saw two polar bears, and several whales, and about a million (no exaggeration) birds, and lots of icebergs. But of course the experience has been far more than that.  Hope you're somewhere warm--I cannot wait to see a green plant again! Yours,  Anthony Doerr More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
