The Stockholm International Water
Institute agreed to host the first Unesco center with a focus on
defusing transboundary water disputes that could potentially
lead to war.  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization decided to set up the research center in  Sweden , to
be run by SIWI in collaboration with Uppsala University and the
University of Gothenburg, to increase cooperation and assist
“in regions where conflict over shared waters is strong.”  SIWI organizes World Water Week annually in Sweden’s
capital and will with the “one of a kind” center now highlight
cross-border waters. The center will “concentrate on how to
establish and develop effective water partnerships despite
contexts of political conflict,” SIWI said.  Climate change , population pressures and water demands from
agriculture to energy raise the risk of violence, according to
the UN. The majority of countries “share water resources in
some form such as rivers and lakes,” SIWI said.  “Cooperation
with other states on this vital resource is essential.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
