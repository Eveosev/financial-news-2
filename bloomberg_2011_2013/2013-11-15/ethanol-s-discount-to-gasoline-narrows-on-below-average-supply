Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on speculation that stockpiles are inadequate to meet
demand for the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, contracted by 2.5 cents to
88.07 cents a gallon as an Energy Information Administration
report yesterday showed  inventories  down 15 percent from a year
ago, while  ethanol refinery inputs , a measure of demand, were at
the highest since July.  “It’s tight,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL
FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “The market’s not yet satisfied.
It’s a  spot market  and it’s firm.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery slipped 0.1 cent to
$1.777 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
dropped 19 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery decreased 2.6 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.6577 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  “Logistics are a big chunk of this,” Blackford said.
“We’ve got a huge corn crop to move, a huge soybean crop to
move, we’re still moving a lot of crude oil by rail. It’s
backing everything up.”  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S., with one
bushel making at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  Corn for December delivery fell 4.5 cents to $4.22 a bushel
in  Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the difference between a
bushel of the grain and a gallon of ethanol, was 24 cents, up
from 23 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol Mandate  A 2007 energy law requires the use of ethanol in gasoline.
Biofuel and petroleum interests have battled over how much
should be consumed and whether the U.S. should abandon the
mandate.  The Environmental Protection Agency today proposed to
reduce the amount to be used next year to 13 billion gallons
from 13.8 billion this year and the 14.4 billion that was called
for under the law.  That will lead to reduced sales for producers of the fuel,
according to Bloomberg Industries.  The agency’s proposal comes just as ethanol  production  has
swelled 20 percent to 927,000 barrels a day as of Nov. 8, from a
record low in January, data from the EIA show.  That’s the highest level since Feb. 10, 2012, according to
the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  RINs Pricing  The EPA uses Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
tracking certificates attached to each gallon of ethanol to
track compliance with the mandate.  Corn-based RINs decreased 4 cents to 18 cents, while
advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol tumbled 4 cents to 22 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago jumped 12.5
cents to $2.05 a gallon; in the U.S. Gulf prices rose 10.5 cents
to $2.13; on the West Coast the additive gained 7 cents to
$2.15; and in  New York  prices climbed 3 cents to $2.29 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed 9.5 cents to
24 cents, while the West Coast’s premium to the Gulf contracted
3.5 cents to 2 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
