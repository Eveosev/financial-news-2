The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency proposed a range of 15 billion to 15.52 billion gallons
of renewable fuel in 2014, according to a notice to be released
today.  That range for fuels such as corn-based ethanol and
biodiesel compares to a quota in 2007 legislation that called
for 18.15 billion gallons. The agency said it will release the
full proposed regulation at 2 p.m.  New York  time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
