Robusta coffee jumped the most in 15
months on signs of dwindling supplies of the beans to back
futures contracts in London.  Robusta  stockpiles  with a valid grading certificate in
warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe fell 8 percent in the past
two weeks, extending declines since May 17, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Traders are expecting rain-induced
harvest delays in  Vietnam , the world’s biggest grower, said Toby
Donovan, an analyst at BGC Brokers LP in London.  “The general perception is that any delays will be felt
more in the January-March 2014 spread rather than just the flat
price,” Donovan said by e-mail today. “The continued declines
in certified stocks is already well noted by the trading
community but a likely contributor to today’s strength.”  The beans for January delivery jumped 3.4 percent to $1,496
a metric ton by 2:56 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London  and earlier
today climbed as much as 3.9 percent, the most for a most-active
contract since July 19, 2012. Robusta dropped 22 percent this
year.  The spread between January and March robusta rose to $7
today from $3 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
