Stocks in Switzerland  were little
changed, with the benchmark Swiss Market Index heading for its
second weekly gain, as investors awaited U.S. industrial data.  Swiss Life Holding AG, the country’s biggest life insurer,
added 1.3 percent after Berenberg Bank upgraded the shares.
Julius Baer Group Ltd. retreated 1.9 percent after the wealth
manager reported a drop in gross margin.  The  SMI (SMI)  added 0.1 percent to 8,315.07 at 10:12 a.m. in
Zurich. The index has gained 0.9 percent this week and has
surged 22 percent this year, heading for the biggest annual gain
since 2005. The broader Swiss Performance Index climbed 0.2
percent today.  U.S. data today will probably show industrial production
rose 0.2 percent last month, slower than the 0.6 percent
increase in September, economists forecast before the Federal
Reserve
releases the figures at 9:15 a.m. in  Washington .  Manufacturing in the New York region grew at a  faster pace 
in November after slowing for three consecutive months,
according to the median economist projection. The Fed Bank of
New York’s index probably rose to 5, rebounding from a five-month low. Positive readings signal expansion in New York,
northern New Jersey and southern  Connecticut .  To contact the reporter on this story:
