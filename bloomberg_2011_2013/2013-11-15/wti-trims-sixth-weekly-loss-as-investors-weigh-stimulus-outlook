West Texas Intermediate crude headed
for a sixth weekly decline, the longest in 15 years, as rising
supplies in the U.S. countered speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will maintain economic stimulus.  Futures have lost 0.5 percent in  New York  this week, poised
for the longest weekly losing streak since December 1998. U.S.
 crude inventories  climbed to the highest level since June as
expanding production caused stockpiles to increase at the
storage hub in Cushing,  Oklahoma , data yesterday from the Energy
Information Administration show.  Janet Yellen , the nominee for
Federal Reserve chairman, said she will ensure the central
bank’s asset purchases program doesn’t end too soon.  “The numbers were mildly bearish as the Cushing build
would limit the upside in WTI,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in  London .  WTI for December delivery increased 34 cents to $94.10 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:52 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures traded was
42 percent below the 100-day average.  Brent for January settlement declined 31 cents to $107.97 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
December contract expired yesterday after rising 1.3 percent to
$108.54. The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $13.24
to WTI for the same month, compared with $14.78 yesterday, the
highest based on closing prices since March.  Oil Stockpiles  Crude inventories surged 2.64 million barrels last week,
more than triple the median 800,000 barrel-gain estimated in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts. Supplies climbed to 388.1
million as  output expanded  to the highest since January 1989,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Stockpiles at Cushing the delivery point for WTI contracts
and the nation’s largest oil-storage facility, climbed by 1.7
million barrels to 38.2 million.  Gasoline stockpiles  fell by 838,000 barrels to 209.2
million, the lowest level since November last year, said the
EIA. A 900,000 barrel decline was forecast in the survey.
Distillate, including heating oil and diesel, shrank 481,000
barrels, compared with a projected drop of 1 million.  U.S. Stimulus  WTI prices plunged to a 12-year low near $10 a barrel in
December 1998 as demand fell after the Asian financial crisis,
while the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed
to implement an agreement made in June of that year to cut
supplies.  WTI may advance next week on signs the Fed will maintain
stimulus, according to a separate Bloomberg survey. Nine of 23
analysts and traders, or 39 percent, forecast futures will rise
through Nov. 22. Eight respondents projected little change and
six said prices will decrease.  Yellen said she’s committed to promoting a strong economic
recovery. Her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee in
 Washington  yesterday signaled she may maintain the strategies of
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , whose term ends on Jan. 31.  “Dovish comments from Yellen are providing support,” said
 Michael McCarthy , a chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
“Some of those funds that are being redeployed across asset
classes are flowing into oil. The fundamentals, the supply side
in particular, are pointing in the other direction and that’s
another reason why today looks like investment support.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
