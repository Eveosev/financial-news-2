SABMiller Plc, (SAB)  the world’s second-biggest brewer, said Chairman Graham Mackay is taking a further
leave of absence after a “recent sudden worsening” of his
health following brain surgery earlier this year.  Deputy Chairman John Manser has been re-appointed as acting
chairman, a role he held for five months during Mackay’s initial
recovery, the London-based company said today in a statement.  Mackay only returned as chairman two months ago, having
been off work following treatment for a brain tumor.  In April, he stepped down early as the brewer’s chief
executive officer, a role in which he masterminded a slew of
acquisitions, including the A$10.5 billion ($9.8 billion)
takeover of Foster’s Group Ltd. in 2011. Alan Clark, a company
veteran of more than two decades, replaced Mackay as CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
