United Nations Emission Reduction
Units posted their biggest weekly decline since January after
the European Commission said it would upgrade credits awaiting
approval for use in its carbon market, boosting supply.  ERUs for December fell 31 percent to close at 22 euro cents
($0.30) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London , the lowest since July 17. They earlier plunged as much
as 56 percent and ended last week at 31 cents.  The commission announced today it would upgrade ERUs to
eligible from pending/ineligible on Nov. 21. Next month’s
futures expire on Dec. 16. The move probably prodded some
traders to sell, Mark Owen-Lloyd, trading director at Clean
Energy Group Ltd. in London, said today by e-mail.  The EU market allows factories, power stations and airlines
to use UN offsets for a portion of compliance needs. The bloc is
seeking to fix a glut in supply in its greenhouse gas program,
the world’s largest by traded volume. The oversupply reached 18
percent of total emissions of 9.8 billion tons in the five years
through 2012, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  UN Certified Emission Reductions for December closed at 42
cents, 13 percent less than yesterday. European Union carbon
permits for December dropped 2 percent to close at 4.50 euros a
ton, paring the weekly gain to 1 cent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
