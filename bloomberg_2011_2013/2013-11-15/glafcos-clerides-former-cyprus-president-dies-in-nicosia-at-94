Former Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides died in Nicosia today aged 94. President Nicos Anastasiades confirmed his predecessor’s death in comments
televised live on state-run RIK TV.  Born April 24, 1919, Clerides volunteered at the outbreak
of World War II to serve in the British Royal Air Force and
remained a prisoner of war until the end of the conflict after
his plane was shot down over  Germany  in 1942.  A lawyer by profession, he defended in the late 1950s
several arrested members of the National Organisation of Cypriot
Fighters who fought for the end of British rule in Cyprus. He
was elected a lawmaker for the first time in 1960 after Cyprus
gained independence and was chosen in the same year to be the
Cypriot parliament’s first speaker, a position he held until
1976.  Also in 1976, he founded the center-right Democratic Rally
party, the political movement of Anastasiades. Clerides served
as acting president from July 23, 1974 to Dec. 7, 1974 after a
coup forced President Archbishop Makarios III to flee the
country and  Turkey  invaded the island. The politician’s personal
physician Iosif Kasios first announced his death in comments
televised live on state-run RIK TV.  Clerides was twice elected president serving from 1993 to
2003 when he oversaw Cyprus’s preparation for the country’s
accession to the European Union in 2004. He supported
reunification of the two sides of Cyprus in a referendum in the
same year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
