Canadian existing home  sales  fell
3.2 percent in October from the previous month, the biggest drop
in more than a year, as the prospect of lower-for-longer
 interest rates  eases pressure on buyers.  Unit home sales fell to 39,235 during the month, down from
40,545 in September, the  Canadian Real Estate Association  said
in a  statement  today on its website.  Home prices  fell 1.1
percent during the month to C$388,277 ($370,900).  The decline in sales was the first since February, ending a
seven-month run that reflected a flurry of purchases as buyers
rushed to beat expected mortgage-rate increases. That pressure
diminished last month when Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz
dropped language about the need to raise rates, citing prolonged
downward pressure on inflation.  “Now that interest rates appear to be going nowhere fast,
sales activity in the near term may be held in check by
homebuyers who are in less of a hurry to purchase,” said
Gregory Klump, the real estate association’s chief economist.  Sales in  Vancouver  fell 10.1 percent in October from a
month earlier, while sales in Toronto were down 4.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
