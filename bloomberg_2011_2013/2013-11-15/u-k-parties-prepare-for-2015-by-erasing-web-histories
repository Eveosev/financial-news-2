Britain’s political parties are
preparing for the 2015 election by clearing out evidence of past
policy commitments -- some from as recently as last year.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s  Conservative Party  confirmed
a magazine report on Nov. 13 that it had removed from its
website speeches that predated the party taking power in 2010,
as well as placing markers on its site asking  search engines  to
remove these from their archives. The opposition  Labour Party 
has eliminated all news items from before  Ed Miliband  was
elected its leader in September 2010 from  its website .  Both these are outdone by the U.K. Independence Party,
which has no record of any speeches made before March this year.
The  earliest news item  is leader Nigel Farage’s New Year 2013
message. In one of the few references to 2012 remaining on the
site, Farage heralded a “remarkable year” for his party.  UKIP spokesman Michael Heaver confirmed that the party’s
2010 election manifesto had been removed. While the party now
opposes the planned high-speed north-south rail line, the 2010
document advocated building three new routes. “We’re in the
process of updating everything,” Heaver said by telephone.
“We’re going through a policy review.”  Only the Liberal Democrats, the junior partner in the
governing coalition, admit the existence of a time before 2010
on  their website . There, speeches date back to 2008, and the
party’s 2010 election platform is still available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
