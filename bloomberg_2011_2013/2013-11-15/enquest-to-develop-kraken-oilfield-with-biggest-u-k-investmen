EnQuest Plc (ENQ) , a North Sea oil and gas
producer, said it will spend $1.4 billion to bring the Kraken
oilfield to production in 2017.  “This is the largest investment in the U.K. North Sea this
year,” Chief Executive Officer Amjad Bseisu said in a telephone
interview. “This should bring us up to 50,000 barrels a day of
production.”  Kraken, a discovery containing 137 million barrels of oil,
will attract 4 billion pounds ($6.4 billion) of investment over
the 25-year life of the field, EnQuest said today. The project
will help EnQuest reach a goal of more than doubling output from
about 23,000 barrels a day in the first 10 months of 2013.  EnQuest maintained its production forecast for this year of
22,000 barrels to 24,500 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The
outlook for 2014 is “positive,” Bseisu said.  Shares were little changed at 134.4 pence as of 8:45 a.m.
in  London . The stock has gained 12 percent this year.  EnQuest arranged a $1.7 billion credit facility in the
fourth quarter, which gives it the ability to make acquisitions
and develop more projects, Bseisu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
