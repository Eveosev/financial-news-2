Yuan  forwards fell to a one-month
low after a Communist Party meeting this week that signaled a
loosening of exchange-rate controls without giving details.  China will make markets “decisive” in allocating
resources, according to a Nov. 12 communique from the third full
meeting, or plenum, of the party’s 18th  Central Committee . The
People’s Bank of China weakened the  reference rate  by 0.06
percent to 6.1351 per dollar, after raising it to a record
yesterday. The fixing, from which the onshore spot rate can
diverge a maximum of 1 percent, was little changed from Nov. 8.  “There was disappointment there wasn’t a lot of reform
measures being put in black and white,” said Ho Woei Chen, a
Singapore-based economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. The
yuan’s weaker fixing today is “to encourage two-way trading,”
she said.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.11 percent
this week to 6.1645 per dollar as of 4:46 p.m. in  Hong Kong ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts declined
0.05 percent today and were trading at a 1.2 percent  discount  to
the spot rate. They touched 6.1675, the weakest since Oct. 14.  In Shanghai, the yuan slipped 0.03 percent this week and
was steady today at 6.0922 per dollar, China Foreign Exchange
Trade System prices show. It reached 6.0802 on Oct. 25, the
strongest level since the government unified the official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993, and has appreciated
2.3 percent in 2013.  Lew Visit  “Market participants had expected a detailed road map of
further financial sector liberalization, in particular, a
timetable of full capital-account convertibility,” Andy Ji, a
currency strategist in  Singapore  at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , wrote in a report today. “Details of reforms are
expected to be announced in coming weeks and months.”  U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew is meeting with
People’s Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  and Vice Premier
Wang Yang in Beijing today, the U.S government said in a
statement. China should speed its move to a market-determined
exchange rate and open up its markets more, Lew wrote in a Nov.
12 editorial in The Wall Street Journal Asia.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.05
percent this week to 6.0770 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility in the
onshore yuan, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, this week to 1.66 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
