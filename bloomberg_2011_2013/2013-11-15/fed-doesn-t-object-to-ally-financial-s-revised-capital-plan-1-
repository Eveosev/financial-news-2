The  Federal Reserve  said it does not
object to a capital plan submitted by  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the
auto finance firm majority-owned by U.S. taxpayers.  Ally was required to resubmit its 2013 capital plan as part
of the Fed’s stress tests. The result of tests released by the
Fed in March showed that Ally would be unable to withstand a
deep recession and maintain its capital above a regulatory
minimum. Ally was the only firm out of 18 to fail the test.  “Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve objected to Ally’s
2013 capital plan based on both quantitative and qualitative
assessments,” the Fed said in a statement today in Washington.
The Fed “has not objected to a re-submitted plan” from the
company, the central bank said, without providing details of the
plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
