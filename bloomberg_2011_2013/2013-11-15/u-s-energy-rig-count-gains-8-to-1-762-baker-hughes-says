Rigs targeting oil and natural gas
in the U.S. rose by eight this week to 1,762, according to  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  increased two to 1,385, data posted on the
company’s website show. The  gas  count gained five to 370, the
Houston-based field services company said. Miscellaneous rigs
were up one to seven.  The  U.S. total count  is down from 1,809 a year earlier even
as domestic oil output has surged to the highest level in more
than two decades, boosted by new technologies that have
increased the yield from wells and shortened drilling times. Oil
output per rig in  North Dakota ’s Bakken formation,  Texas ’s Eagle
Ford play and the Marcellus Shale in the eastern U.S. are
forecast to rise to records next month, the Energy Information
Administration said in a Nov. 12  report .  Producers’ use of “new drilling and completion  techniques
is maximizing the resource potential of each play,” Mehdi Menouar, oil and gas services analyst for Bloomberg Industries
in Skillman,  New Jersey , said in a research note yesterday.
“Longer horizontal lateral drilling, more frack stages and
lower well spacing has helped increase oil and gas production
per rig sixfold on average.”  U.S. oil output jumped 1.6 percent to 7.98 million barrels
a day in the seven days ended Nov. 8, the highest level since
January 1989, according to data compiled by the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. Crude  stockpiles  climbed 0.7
percent to 388.1 million barrels, the highest level for this
season in at least 10 years.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 14
cents to $93.90 at 1:06 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , up 9.9 percent in the past year.  U.S. gas stockpiles  rose 20 billion cubic feet last week to
3.834 trillion, the EIA said yesterday. Supplies were 2 percent
below year-earlier inventories.  Natural gas for December delivery gained 3.9 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.644 per million British thermal units on the
Nymex, down 1.6 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
