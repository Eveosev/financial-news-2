Flybe Group Plc (FLYB) , Europe’s largest
regional airline, plans to shut bases in Aberdeen and Inverness
in  Scotland , Newcastle upon Tyne in northern  England  and on
 Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man as it cuts almost 500 jobs.  Some 160 posts will go at the bases to be closed, together
with 116 at its headquarters in Exeter, southwest England. A
further 217 jobs will be lost in  Belfast , Northern Ireland,
Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland, and Birmingham, Manchester,
and Southampton in England, Flybe said in a statement today.  The company, also Britain’s biggest domestic airline, said
it has commenced “constructive” collective consulation with
the Unite and Prospect unions and the British Airline Pilots’
Association, together with employee representatives.  Chief Executive Officer Saad Hammad said Flybe remains
committed to serving the U.K.’s regions and will continue
flights to the affected airports event after bases are closed.  Hammad had said Nov. 11 that 500 posts would be cut from a
payroll of about 2,750 to deliver 7 million pounds ($11 million)
of savings in the 12 months ending March 31 and 26 million
pounds annually from fiscal 2014. That’s after Flybe doubled its
annual savings goal to 50 million pounds in June.  Balpa said separately in a statement that the Flybe plan
will see a reduction in pilots at all bases except Manchester,
and that the job cuts are “extemely disappointing” and should
be kept to a minimum.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
