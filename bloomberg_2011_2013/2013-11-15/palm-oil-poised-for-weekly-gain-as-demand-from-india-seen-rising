Palm oil headed for a weekly advance
on speculation that imports from  India  would increase amid
reduced supplies of cooking oils in the second-largest consumer.  The contract for January delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
2,599 ringgit ($812) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia 
Derivatives by the midday break in Kuala Lumpur, set for a 3.6
percent gain this week. Palm rose to 2,628 ringgit on Nov. 1,
the highest close since September 2012 and 21 percent more than
the 2,167 ringgit settlement on July 29, meeting the common
definition of a bull market.  Purchases by India probably climbed in October as a delay
in the oilseed harvest reduced cooking oil stockpiles to the
lowest level in nine months, according to a Bloomberg survey
published on Nov. 13. Crude and refined palm oil imports
advanced 14 percent to 710,000 tons from a month earlier, the
survey showed. The Solvent Extractors’ Association of India is
scheduled to release the data today.  “The numbers from India will give some clues to show how
demand is growing,” said James Ratnam, an analyst at TA
Securities Holdings Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Even though the
price difference with soybean oil has narrowed substantially,
palm oil is still cheaper.”  Soybean oil’s  premium  was at $102.08 a ton today, compared
with $259.56 a year earlier, showed data compiled by Bloomberg.
Soybean oil for January delivery increased 0.4 percent to 41.39
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in January rose 0.1 percent to $13.1525 a bushel.  Palm oil exports from Malaysia, the second-largest
producer, fell 4.6 percent to 744,975 tons in the first half of
this month from the same period in October, Intertek said today.  Refined palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
6,320  yuan  ($1,038) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange and
soybean oil advanced 0.3 percent to 7,306 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
