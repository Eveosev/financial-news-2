Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced, narrowing a weekly loss, as higher  iron ore 
prices helped offset a weaker demand outlook in winter.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, gained as much as 0.4 percent to
3,636 yuan ($597) a metric ton, before trading at 3,632 yuan at
10:28 a.m. local time. The contract lost 0.8 percent this week.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by
The Steel Index gained 0.4 percent yesterday to $136.60 a dry
ton, bringing this week’s gain to 0.5 percent. Demand for rebar
usually wanes in winter as construction slows during the colder
months, according to Jiang Yuying, an analyst at Chengdu
Brilliant Futures Co. in Shanghai.  “There are some bargain-hunting buying in rebar as higher
production costs are supporting prices,” said Jiang. “The
upside might be limited due to the lack of positive news from
policy makers and weak seasonality.”  The Communist Party’s senior leaders concluded a policy
meeting this week with a communique stating that markets will
become “decisive” in allocating resources while the state
remains “dominant” in the economy, without providing
specifics.  Iron ore for May delivery on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
rose 0.2 percent to 939  yuan .  Rebar for immediate delivery tracked by Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. was little changed yesterday at
3,548 yuan a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
