Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s biggest
carmaker, said the market in several European countries is
stabilizing and confirmed a target to sell 9.5 million vehicles
this year as the race to become the global leader gathers steam.  Volkswagen’s ten-month sales rose 4.7 percent compared with
a year earlier to 7.85 million vehicles, the company, that
includes the Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini luxury brands,
said in a statement today. Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg,
Germany, has a goal to overtake  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  General
Motors Co. (GM)  by 2018 and sell more than 10 million cars per year.  “We are seeing the first signs that the markets in  France 
and Spain as well as Italy are stabilizing,” Christian Klingler, VW’s head of sales, said in the statement. “The
delivery situation in  China  remains very encouraging.”  Growth in China, Volkswagen’s single biggest market, has
helped the company offset the muted demand in Europe, where
deliveries are expected to reach a 20-year low this year.
Volkswagen’s China sales increased 17 percent to 2.65 million
vehicles in the year to October. Deliveries in Europe contracted
1.8 percent to 3.05 million cars and sport-utility vehicles.  Sales were fueled by demand for Audi’s Q3 SUV and A3
compact family as well as a recovery at VW’s Spanish Seat unit.
Volkswagen’s namesake brand sold 4.88 million vehicles globally,
an increase of 3.4 percent compared to last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
