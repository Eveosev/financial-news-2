Etihad Airways PJSC, the third-biggest Gulf carrier, will follow regional No. 1 Emirates in
adding more than 1,500 seats a week on services to Munich,
intensifying competition at the Deutsche  Lufthansa (LHA)  AG hub.  Etihad will switch to double-daily flights from  Abu Dhabi 
starting Feb. 1, it said today. Like the existing daily service,
the trips will be operated by Airbus SAS A330-300s with eight
first-class seats, 32 in business and 191 in economy.  The expansion comes after Emirates said Nov. 13 it would
use Airbus A380 superjumbos on both daily flights from Dubai
instead of a single A380 and a smaller Boeing Co. 777, adding
almost 1,800 extra seats a week from March 30. The twin moves
ramp up pressure on Lufthansa, for which Munich ranks second
only to  Frankfurt  in terms of international connections.  “Munich is among our most successful destinations in
Europe, as it has constantly high business and leisure travelers
alike,” Etihad said in a statement today, adding that the route
is attracting more traffic in both directions.  A bilateral treaty currently limits carriers from the
 United Arab Emirates  to three destinations in Germany. With
Etihad and Emirates both flying to Frankfurt and Dusseldorf and
Emirates also serving Hamburg under a special permission, the
pair are able to expand there only by adding frequencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
