A  Lucian Freud  portrait, a
prizewinning lesbian film, a Mexican restaurant and an army of
jazz stars are our choices for  London  this weekend.  STAGE  Olympic swimmer meets aspiring artist. They fall in love.
As their hearts pull them together, their lives pull them apart.  This classic scenario for a play is given a twist by Martin
Sherman’s “Passing By.” The lovers are two men, their romance
overshadowed by illness -- real and imagined. The paranoia of
Toby (an excellent Rik Makarem) infects his partner Simon (James
Cartwright) in more ways than one.  At Tristan Bates Theatre, Tower Street, London WC2H 9NP,
through Nov. 30. Information:  http://tristanbatesthreatre.co.uk   DINING  Foxlow is the new restaurant from the owners of Hawksmoor.
The focus of the 100-seat venue, which opened yesterday near
Smithfield market, is cuts of meat from ethically reared
animals. There’s a charcoal grill and also a range of salads and
cocktails:  http://www.foxlow.co.uk/  or +44-20-7014-8070.  Mexican food isn’t London’s strongest culinary suit. That
may be changing with new restaurants such as Peyote, in Mayfair.
It’s the new establishment of Arjun Waney, the restaurateur
behind Coya, and focuses on indigenous Mexican ingredients, with
classic and modern dishes, and drinks. Information:
 http://peyoterestaurant.com/  or +44-20-7409-1300.  VISUAL ARTS  A portrait of Lucian Freud is on show at the  National
Portrait Gallery  -- not the $142.4 million Francis Bacon
triptych, but a steely-eyed sculpture of the artist as a young
man.  It’s by Jacob Epstein, whose daughter Kitty was married to
Freud for four years. “That spiv Lucian Freud turned out a nasty
piece of work,” Epstein was quoted as saying. His chilling Freud
head and a T.S. Eliot bust are the best things in the small
display.  While you’re there, get a taste of Tudor life in “Elizabeth
I & Her People” -- including a poor seagoer’s linen tunic and
trousers (1590-1650), still bearing tar marks.  Information:  http://www.npg.org.uk  or +44-20-7306-0055.  MUSIC  The London Jazz Festival starts this weekend with gigs from
South African horn player Hugh Masekela and crooner Paolo Conte.  Also recommended: songwriter and pianist Jon Regen, who
plays the Pheasantry, Kings Road, on Nov. 16 and 17.  Coming up between now and Nov. 24: Wayne Shorter,  John
McLaughlin , Brad Mehldau and Carla Bley, among others.
Information:  http://londonjazzfestival.org.uk .  The premiere of John Tavener’s “Three Shakespeare Sonnets”
is going ahead tonight in Southwark Cathedral.  The composer started the week with a BBC radio interview
expressing hope that he would overcome illness to write new
music, following up on his “Sonnets.” Two days later he died at
the age of 69.  The choral work is presented by the Chamber Choir of South
Iceland. Information:  http://bit.ly/17mTfKe   OTHER LONDON OUTINGS  The movie that won the  Cannes Film Festival  is finally out
in London: “Blue is the Warmest Colour” tracks teenage Adele’s
passionate love affair with the blue-haired Emma. Worth seeing:
