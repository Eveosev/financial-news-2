David Tepper , the billionaire co-founder of the Appaloosa Management LP hedge fund, donated $67
million to  Carnegie Mellon University  to expand its campus.  The gift, the largest in school history from an alumnus,
will be used to create the David A. Tepper Quadrangle, the
Pittsburgh-based university said today on its  website .  Tepper, 56, who received an MBA at Carnegie Mellon,
previously donated $55 million to the university’s business
school, which is also named for him. After working for Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Tepper helped found  Short Hills , New Jersey-based Appaloosa in 1993, specializing in buying distressed debt.
Tepper, a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers football
team, is worth $7.9 billion and is the 158th richest person in
the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Today’s gift was announced on the day the university inaugurated
President Subra Suresh.  “I’m excited by President Suresh’s and the university’s
vision to make CMU the foremost entrepreneurial academic
institution in the nation,” Tepper said in a statement on the
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
