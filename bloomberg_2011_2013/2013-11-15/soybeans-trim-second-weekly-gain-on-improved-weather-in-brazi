Soybeans declined for a second day,
trimming a second week of gains, on expectations that favorable
weather would improve prospects of the crop in  Brazil , the
world’s top exporter. Wheat gained.  Soybeans for January delivery dropped as much as 0.3
percent to $13.09 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
were at $13.1225 by 10:33 a.m. in  Singapore . Futures are heading
for a 1.3 percent advance this week, after climbing 3.6 percent
in the previous five-day period.  Rain in southern Brazil next week will carry northward by
the weekend and is expected to bring relief for drier soybean
and corn in central and northeast areas, Commodity Weather Group
LLC said in a report yesterday. There will be no sustained heat
in  Argentina  and rains today may reach over half of the
country’s corn and wheat, the forecaster said.  “As we get closer to the South American crop, better
weather certainly helps,” said Graydon Chong, a grains and
oilseeds analyst at Rabobank International in Sydney. “That
will obviously impact prices looking toward the new crop.”  Corn for March delivery was unchanged at $4.365 a bushel,
set for a 2.3 percent weekly gain for the most-active contract,
the first such advance in four weeks. Futures touched a 38-month
low of $4.155 on Nov. 8, amid forecasts that production in the
U.S. will reach a record.  Wheat for March delivery increased 0.2 percent to $6.5675 a
bushel, extending this week’s advance for futures to 1.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
