Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. (MGMB)  and the
producer of the James Bond films said they acquired all rights
to the fictional British secret agent held by the estate and
family of the late screenwriter Kevin McClory.  The accord ends legal and business disputes that have
arisen over 50 years, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the distributor of
the films, and Danjaq LLC, the longtime James Bond producer,
said yesterday in a statement. The terms weren’t disclosed.  McClory is credited with co-writing and producing 1965’s
“Thunderball” and 1983’s “Never Say Never Again,” according
to  Imdb.com , an industry website. He helped develop
“Thunderball” with author  Ian Fleming  and won a 1963
settlement that gave him an interest in that story, according to
John Cork, co-author of “ James Bond : The Legacy.” McClory died
in 2006, Imdb.com said.  The James Bond franchise is among Hollywood’s most
enduring. Twenty-four films dating back to 1963’s “Dr. No”
have grossed $1.91 billion in U.S. theaters, according to
BoxOfficeMojo.com, an industry researcher. The most recent, last
year’s “Skyfall,” took in $304.4 million domestically.  Closely held MGM,  Sony Corp. (6758)  and Danjaq plan to release the
next Bond film in October 2015 in the U.K and in the U.S. the
following month, according to a July statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
