Russian stocks  gained for a second
day as commodity producers rallied on bets the  Federal Reserve ’s
next chairman will continue stimulus efforts, spurring appetite
for riskier assets.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.6 percent to 1,499.48 by 12:10 p.m.
in Moscow, set for a 0.7 percent advance in the week. OAO
Mechel, the nation’s biggest coking coal producer, climbed 2.7
percent to 65.30 rubles, paring a 35 percent slump this week.
OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel increased 1.7 percent to 7.842
rubles.  Janet Yellen  signaled her determination to use bond buying
to strengthen the economy during her confirmation hearing
yesterday to be the next Fed chairman. Emerging-market stocks
headed for the biggest weekly gain in a month. Crude oil,
 Russia ’s main export earner, rose 0.3 percent to $94.04 a barrel
in  New York .  “The market is responding to the idea that Yellen will
continue stimulus measures,” Andrey Vashevnik, who manages $25
million as chief investment officer at R&B Investment Fund Ltd.
in Moscow, said by phone.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will probably wait to
taper its bond buying to $70 billion at its March 18-19 meeting
from current pace of $85 billion a month, according to the
median estimate of 32 economists in a Bloomberg survey Nov. 8.  Mechel (MTLR) , which is seeking to obtain a waiver from debt
covenants, tumbled as much as 47 percent on Nov. 13. The Moscow-based company is the  worst performer  on the benchmark gauge this
year, with a drop of 68 percent.  ‘Purely Speculative’  “Investors sold off Mechel this week out of fear that they
won’t be able to repay their debts, but apparently the situation
isn’t all that grim,” Vashevnik said.  The Russian company, whose  net debt  was $9.55 billion as of
June 1, has as much as $2.48 billion due next year, according to
a June presentation on its website. The Nov. 13 sell-off was
“purely speculative” and covenant talks are on schedule to be
completed by the end of the month, Mechel spokesman Arseny
Palagin said by phone.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  increased 0.9 percent to 1,446.66. Russian
equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21 emerging
economies monitored by Bloomberg, with shares on the Micex
trading at 4.3 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with
a multiple of 10.5 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
