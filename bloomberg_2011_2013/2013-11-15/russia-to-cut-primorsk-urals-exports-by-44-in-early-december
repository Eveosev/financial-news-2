Russian shipments of Urals crude
from Primorsk are set to drop by 44 percent in the first six
days of December from the same period a month earlier.  Exports from the Baltic Sea port will be 600,000 metric
tons from Nov. 30 to Dec. 6, compared with 1.07 million tons
this month, according to a preliminary loading program obtained
by  Bloomberg News .  Russian refineries are returning to full capacity after
seasonal maintenance, leaving less crude available for export.
Processors will have 1.19 million tons of capacity offline for
repairs in November, an average of 290,000 barrels a day, while
19,000 tons will be shut next month, according to a Nov. 14
forecast from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit.  Urals exports from the Baltic port of Ust-Luga will be
400,000 tons from Nov. 30 to Dec. 5, unchanged from the same
period this month, according to the plan. Novorossiysk on the
 Black Sea  will ship 600,000 tons of crude from Dec. 1 to Dec. 6,
also stable from November.  An official from OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, declined to immediately comment on the drop of exports
from Primorsk. She asked not to be identified because of company
policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
