In L. Frank Baum’s 1900 novel, “The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” as well as the subsequent cartoon,
stage musical and silent movies, Dorothy’s slippers are silver.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Wanting to replicate Disney’s Technicolor success with
“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” Louis B. Mayer bought the
film rights to Baum’s book and hired Judy Garland to star. With
the new visual technology, silver footwear appeared pallid and
dull.  MGM Studios costume designer Gilbert Adrian found that red
silk fabric slippers looked orange under the bright lights, so
he had 2,300 dark burgundy, almost brown, sequins sewn in rows
onto the shoes. To make Dorothy look more innocent, at George
Cukor’s request he also added butterflies.  In 1938, it cost about $15 to make the ruby slippers. In
2011, one pair of the four known to exist from the film, sold
for $2 million at auction.  The  Smithsonian  has a pair of authenticated ruby slippers
on display -- it’s one of the most popular exhibitions at the
museum.  I spoke with Richard Kurin, author of “The Smithsonian’s
History of America in 101 Objects,” on the following topics:  1. From 137 Million to 101  2. Franklin’s Staff  3. Lincoln’s Silk Hat  4. Woolworth Lunch Counter  5.
