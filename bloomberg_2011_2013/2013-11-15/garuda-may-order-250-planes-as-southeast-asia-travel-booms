PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) , the national
airline, may purchase 250 aircraft in the decade ending 2025 to
take advantage of a surge in  travel demand  in Southeast Asia.  The carrier is completing its plan and will decide in the
first quarter of next year, Chief Executive Officer Emirsyah Satar said in an interview in Hong Kong today. The new planes
will help expand its fleet and retire older aircraft.  From  Indonesia  to Vietnam, carriers in Southeast Asia are
buying new aircraft as about 600 million people -- or the
combined population of the U.S., Germany and Brazil -- fly more.
 Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS, the world’s two biggest planemakers,
both count on Asian airlines to buy more aircraft in the next
two decades as economic growth in the region enables more people
to take flights.  Garuda aims to have about 350 aircraft by 2025, up from a
fleet of 194 planes by 2015, Satar said. The airline, which is
adding 120 pilots every year to meet the fleet expansion, hasn’t
decided whether to buy Airbus or Boeing aircraft, he said.  PT Lion Mentari Airlines, the nation’s biggest carrier,
already has 700 planes on order and expects to have ordered
1,000 aircraft within two to three years, its Chief Executive
Officer Rusdi Kirana said in March. The Jakarta-based carrier
agreed to buy 230 Lion in Talks to Buy 50 Bombardier Planes on
Asian Travel Growth Boeing 737 planes last year and ordered 234
planes from Airbus in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
