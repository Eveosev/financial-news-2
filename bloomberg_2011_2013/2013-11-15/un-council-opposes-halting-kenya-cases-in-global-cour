Kenya  failed to win the  United
Nations  Security Council’s approval for a one-year halt to
International Criminal Court cases against Kenya’s two top
leaders.  A resolution proposed by 13 African nations and Azerbaijan
wasn’t adopted after eight of the 15 members abstained and seven
voted in favor. Adoption would have required at least nine votes
in favor and none of the five permanent council members
exercising their veto power.  Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President
 William Ruto  are accused of committing crimes against humanity
linked to a disputed election in 2007 that led to violent
clashes and the murder of more than 1,100 people. Kenya, backed
by the  African Union , has sought a delay in line with a
provision which allows a postponement of the international
court’s proceedings for as long as a year if approved by the
council.  All of the eight active cases before the court are against
Africans, prompting complaints that the tribunal is unfairly
targeting the continent.  The court last month delayed Kenyatta’s trial to Feb. 5
from Nov. 12 under an agreement between the defense and
prosecution, the Hague-based court said in an e-mailed statement
on Oct. 31.  Kenyatta, 51, is the second sitting president to be
indicted by the court after Sudanese leader Umar al-Bashir, who
is wanted for suspected  war crimes  and genocide in Sudan’s
western Darfur region. Kenyatta and Ruto deny the accusations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
