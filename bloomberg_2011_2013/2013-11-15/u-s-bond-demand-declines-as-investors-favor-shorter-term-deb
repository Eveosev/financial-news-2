Treasury’s auction of $16 billion in
30-year bonds drew lower-than-average demand as investors
favored the three- and 10-year note sold this week on signs the
 Federal Reserve  will push on with its bond-buying stimulus.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio at yesterday’s bond sale, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 2.16, the least since August and less than the
average of 2.48 at the past 10 auctions. The sale attracted the
lowest demand in seven months from indirect bidders, a class of
investors that includes foreign central banks. A $24 billion
sale of 10-year notes on Nov. 13 attracted the most demand in
five months from indirect bidders while a $30 billion auction of
three-year notes on Nov. 12 saw the most demand since March.  Treasuries strengthened yesterday after Fed Chairman-nominee  Janet Yellen  told Congress she will promote the central
bank’s unprecedented stimulus program until economic growth is
stronger. Inflation control is important and the central bank’s
bond-buying program “will not continue indefinitely,” Yellen
testified yesterday at her confirmation hearing to lead the Fed.  “In a recovering economy, rates tend to drift higher over
time,” said  Zach Pandl , a Minneapolis-based senior interest-rate strategist at Columbia Management Investment Advisers,
which oversees $340 billion. “The activist Fed is already
priced in.”  Market Prices  The current 30-year yield dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.79 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.625 percent
bond due in August 2043 rose 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000 face
amount, to 97 1/8. The yield fell as much as six basis points.  Investors have bid $2.87 for each dollar of the $1.855
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this
year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  The 30-year bond sale drew a yield of 3.81 percent,
compared with the 3.793 percent average forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of seven of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.  Indirect bidders purchased 35.3 percent of the bonds, the
lowest level since April. Direct bidders bought 18.3 percent of
the securities, the lowest level since August.  Auction Demand  At the 10-year sale the previous day, indirect bidders
purchased 47.7 percent of the notes, the highest level since the
June 12 offering of the securities and higher than an average of
38.7 percent for the past 10 sales.  At the three-year sale, investors bid 3.46 times the amount
of debt on offer, exceeding the average  bid-to-cover  ratio, as
the measure is known, at the previous 10 auctions of 3.32 times.  Indirect bidders purchased 33.3 percent of the three-year
notes sold, compared with an average of 29.4 percent for the
past 10 sales.  The week’s sales raised $6.5 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $63.5 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporter on this story:
