Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  said it’s
looking at closing an Irish engine-repair arm that employs 400
people as demand for its services falters.  Lufthansa Technik, the carrier’s maintenance unit, will
begin talks with unions and staff immediately on the shuttering
of Dublin-based Airmotive Ireland, according to a  statement 
today. The business overhauls engines made by CFM International,
a venture of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and Safran SA, among others.  The Irish division’s specialization in CFM56-3 and CFM56-7
series turbines, designed for the first and second generations
of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 737 single-aisle plane, is proving a burden as
Lufthansa streamlines around Airbus SAS A320 jets. Lufthansa
Technik gets close to half of sales from the parent company.  The decision follows an “extensive review” of the unit,
which saw revenue fall with no opportunities in the maintenance
market to compensate for that, Lufthansa said. Set up by  Aer
Lingus Group Plc (AERL)  in 1980, Lufthansa bought a 60 percent stake in
the company in 1997, before taking full ownership 2 years later.  Lufthansa Technik is the world’s largest maintenance,
repair and overhaul (MRO) provider for the aviation industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
