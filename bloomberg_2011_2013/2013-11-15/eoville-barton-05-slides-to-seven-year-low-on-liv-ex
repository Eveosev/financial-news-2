Five cases of 2005 Chateau Leoville
Barton, a Bordeaux second-growth wine estate, fetched 615 pounds
($989) each on Liv-ex this week, taking the vintage to a seven-year low amid muted demand for the region’s wines.  The sale on Nov. 12, accompanied by two other cases of the
same vintage fetching 630 pounds each the same day, was the
lowest level for the wine since July 2006, according to data on
London-based Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website. A case also sold for
620 pounds on the U.K.-based Cavex wine market on Nov. 8.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, fell 1.5 percent in October, its sixth month of declines
in the past seven, extending a slide which has taken it down
about 8 percent since mid-March. While the index tracks first
growths, there are signs of a revival in broader buying interest
as wines, including some Bordeaux second growths and Burgundy
vintages, have outperformed it.  “It’s Bordeaux that’s been on a slide for the last few
months,” Stephen Maunder, chief executive officer of Cavex,
said. “We’re seeing a pick-up in activity in the last couple of
days. The market’s on the move.”  This month’s trading in Leoville Barton ’05 compares with
the high of 920 pounds a case it reached on Liv-ex in April 2008
during a three-year  bull market  in Bordeaux wine prior to the
onset of the global financial crisis. It is within the range of
516 pounds to 660 pounds at which the wine traded on Liv-ex in
June 2006 soon after its release to the market.  Eighteenth-Century Roots  The 2005 Leoville Barton ranks among the estate’s four most
expensive of the past 15 years, according to merchant prices
collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  The Barton family, owner of the estate, traces its history
in Bordeaux back to 1725, when Thomas Barton arrived in the city
from Ireland and went on to found a wine merchant which became
Barton & Guestier. For the past three decades the estate has
been run by Anthony Barton, who took it over from his uncle
Ronald.  Leoville Barton is in the Saint-Julien district north of
Bordeaux and is a neighbor of Chateau Langoa Barton, owned by
the same family. Leoville Barton was designated a second-growth
vineyard in the classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855
Paris Exhibition, which remains in force.  Leoville Barton, covering 45 hectares (111 acres), is
planted to 72 percent Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, 20 percent
Merlot and 8 percent Cabernet Franc, according to Leoville
Barton’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
