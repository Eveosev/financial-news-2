Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. Chairman
Robert Wildrick said the clothing chain is evaluating other
possible takeover targets after terminating its bid for Men’s
Wearhouse Inc.  “We’re looking at other potential acquisitions,” Wildrick
said in a telephone interview today. “The main thing we’re
looking for is something similar to what we’re doing. Men’s
Wearhouse was at the top of our list of strategic alternatives,
now we have to look at the other things on our list.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
