South Korea , the world’s second-largest buyer of liquefied natural gas, boosted imports of the
fuel by 19 percent in October amid increased demand for power
generation.  Shipments climbed to 3.19 million metric tons from 2.68
million a year earlier, according to data on the Korea Customs
Service’s website today. Imports advanced 29 percent from
September.  Domestic sales by state-run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the company
that buys the most LNG globally, were up 18 percent in October
from a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing on Nov.
12. Demand from electricity producers rose by 39 percent, while
local city-gas providers used 1.8 percent less of the fuel.  South Korea imports most of its LNG under long-term
contracts with suppliers including Qatar, Indonesia,  Malaysia 
and Oman. It was the largest buyer after  Japan  in 2012 with
purchases of 36.77 million metric tons, according to the
industry-funded  International Group  of Liquefied Natural Gas
Importers in Paris.  South Korea paid $2.39 billion for LNG in October, compared
with $1.81 billion in the same month last year, the data show.
The average price rose to $749.97 per ton, from $675.62. That’s
equivalent to $14.42 per million British thermal units, compared
with $12.99 the year before, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on the customs data.  The most expensive supply was from Oman, at an average
$16.95 per million Btu for 307,450 tons. Russia delivered three
cargoes at $4.37 per million Btu, the lowest paid in October.  Spot Cargoes  Asian buyers typically import more spot LNG in October and
November to replenish inventories before heating and power
demand peaks during winter in the northern hemisphere.  South Korea purchased six spot shipments in October,
according to the data.  Peru , South America’s sole producer of
the fuel, supplied 72,237 tons while  Nigeria , Africa’s largest
natural gas exporter, sent 304,604 tons. A standard LNG tanker
can carry about 60,000 tons.  Two of the Nigerian cargoes were delivered by the Seri
Angkasa and LNG Ogun on Oct. 4 and Oct. 15, respectively, ship
transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
