Infinis Energy Plc, a renewable-energy company backed by financier  Guy Hands , raised 234 million
pounds ($376 million) in its London initial public offering
after pricing shares at the bottom of the range.  Infinis at 260 pence per ordinary share values the
Northampton, England-based company at 780 million pounds, the
U.K.’s largest generator of power from landfill gas said today.
That compares with an initial range of 260 pence to 310 pence.  Hands’s Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. is among the
private equity companies plowing money into green energy with
its investment in Infinis, the U.K.’s third-biggest renewable
power producer. Global volumes of sales from private equity-backed listings this year have almost doubled, according to data
from Ernst & Young LLP.  Infinis is involved in 147 sites including 121 landfill gas
areas and 16 land wind farms. It has 600 megawatts more of
turbines under development and produced about 7 percent of the
U.K.’s renewable power in the year through March, it said. Its
chairman is Ian Marchant, former chief executive officer of
Britain’s second-biggest energy supplier SSE Plc.  The offer comprised 90 million ordinary shares excluding
over-allotments, representing 30 percent of the company’s share
capital on admission, according to the statement. Terra Firma
holds 69 percent of ordinary shares that will be reduced to 65
percent should an over-allotment option be exercised.  Conditional trading started today on the London Stock
Exchange under the symbol INFI. The company is expected to begin
trading with 300 million ordinary shares on Nov. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
