Chevron Corp. (CVX)  had a furnace fire in
the “cracking 2 area” at its Pascagoula refinery in
Mississippi that caused the death of one worker.  The fire occurred at 2 a.m. local time at the 330,000-barrel-a-day plant on Mississippi’s Gulf Coast,  Kurt Glaubitz , a
 San Ramon , California-based spokesman for the company, said in
an e-mailed statement.  The cracking 2 unit has been shut, Terry Jackson, Jackson
County deputy director of  emergency services , said by phone. The
rest of the refinery isn’t shut, he said.  Refinery personnel responded to the fire and secured the
site, Glaubitz said. He wouldn’t say if the fire has been
extinguished, nor whether any portion of the refinery has been
shut down in response. Allison Cook, a Pascagoula-based
spokeswoman for the company, identified the location of the fire
in a message on a community hot line.  The refinery produces 130,000 barrels of gasoline, 68,000
barrels of diesel and 50,000 barrels of jet fuel a day,
according to a company website. It also produces bunker fuel,
liquefied petroleum gases and other products.  The plant processes heavy, high-sulfur crude. In August, it
imported 278,000 barrels of oil a day from Brazil, Canada,
Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. Two of its shipments from
Colombia were the highest-density crudes imported to the U.S.
that month, according to Energy Information Administration data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
