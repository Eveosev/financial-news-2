PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , which is
seeking new partners as it burns through cash, hasn’t changed
its policy toward its holding in auto-parts maker  Faurecia. (EO)   Peugeot has repeatedly said in recent months that a sale of
its 57 percent holding in Faurecia isn’t planned. Reuters
reported today that the Paris-based carmaker is considering a
sale and has hired an adviser to explore options, citing people
with knowledge of the situation.  “We don’t comment on rumors,” Peugeot spokesman Jonathan Goodman said today by phone. “Our policy regarding Faurecia
hasn’t changed.”  Peugeot is reviewing its strategic options including a
deeper partnership with China’s Dongfeng Motor Corp. as it seeks
to stem losses in Europe. Dongfeng and the French state are
considering taking equal stakes in Peugeot as part of capital
increase, people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
