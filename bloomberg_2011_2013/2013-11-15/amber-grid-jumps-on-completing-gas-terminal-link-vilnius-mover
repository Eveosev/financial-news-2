Amber Grid AB,  Lithuania ’s gas
transmission company, rose to the highest level since its stock
started trading in August after completing a link needed for the
country’s liquefied natural gas terminal.  The shares rose as much as 2.3 percent and closed up 2.1
percent at 0.72 euro in Vilnius, valuing the company at 128
million euros ($173 million). Volume of 27,758 shares was four
times the three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Amber Grid completed the 165-kilometer (103-mile) gas link
across western Lithuania,  linking  Jurbarkas to the Baltic Sea
port of Klaipeda, about two months ahead of plan, the company
said in a statement today. The new pipeline will ease gas
distribution in the region and will handle imported supplies
from the floating liquefied natural gas terminal the government
plans to open in Klaipeda from late 2014, it said.  “This infrastructure boosts the security and capacity of
our gas distribution system,” Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said in an e-mailed statement. The completion of the
200 million-litai ($78 million) project shows Amber Grid, which
was spun off from gas utility Lietuvos Dujos AB this year, is
functioning well, he said.  Amber Grid said European Union structural funds paid 77
million litai of the cost of the new pipeline, work on which
Lietuvos Dujos began in 2007.  Lithuania holds 18 percent of Amber Grid,  Germany ’s  EON AG (EOAN) 
owns 39 percent and  Russia ’s  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  has 37 percent,
according to the company’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
