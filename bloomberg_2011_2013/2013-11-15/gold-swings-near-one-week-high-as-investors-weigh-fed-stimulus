Gold fluctuated near a one-week high
as investors assessed the  Federal Reserve ’s commitment to
maintain stimulus. Billionaire investor  John Paulson  kept his
holdings in the largest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund.  Bullion for immediate delivery traded at $1,288.02 an ounce
at 9:18 a.m. in Singapore after climbing to $1,294.42 yesterday,
the highest since Nov. 8. Prices that are set for a third weekly
loss advanced 1.5 percent in the two days through yesterday as
Fed Chairman nominee  Janet Yellen  said she’s committed to
promoting a strong economic recovery.  Gold lost 23 percent in 2013 amid speculation that the Fed
will start to reduce the $85 billion-a-month of bond buying as
the economy strengthens. Data yesterday showed more Americans
than forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last
week as Yellen said she will ensure monetary stimulus isn’t
removed too soon.  “Continuing ultra-accommodative monetary policies are
supportive of  gold prices ,” Howard Wen, an analyst at HSBC
Securities (USA) Inc., wrote in a note. “A lack of follow-through buying may leave gold vulnerable to a pull-back.”  Gold for delivery in December traded at $1,286.40 an ounce
on the Comex in  New York  from $1,286.30 yesterday, when prices
gained 1.4 percent, the most in three weeks. Trading volume was
41 percent below the average for the past 100 days at this time.  Paulson & Co., the largest investor in the SPDR Gold Trust,
held 10.23 million shares as of Sept. 30, unchanged from June
30, according to a government filing yesterday. Assets in the
SPDR have shrunk 36 percent this year as Paulson cut holdings by
more than half in the second quarter.  Global bullion demand fell 21 percent in the third quarter
as investors continued to dump holdings of the metal through
exchange-traded funds and central banks slowed purchases, the
World Gold Council said yesterday.  Spot silver fell 0.1 percent to $20.7768 an ounce and is
3.4 percent lower this week, heading for the biggest such
decline in two months. Platinum gained 0.2 percent to $1,449.72
an ounce and palladium was little changed at $739.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
