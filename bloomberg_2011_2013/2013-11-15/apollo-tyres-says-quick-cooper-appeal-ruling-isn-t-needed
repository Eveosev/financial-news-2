Apollo Tyres Ltd. (APTY) , which had agreed
to buy Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. for $35 a share, told Delaware
Supreme Court justices in a filing that there’s no need to fast-track the appeal of a decision in its favor.  A Delaware Chancery Court judge ruled Nov. 8 that all
contract conditions hadn’t been met, and that he couldn’t force
Apollo, which seeks a lower price, to complete the $2.5 billion
buyout. Cooper appealed and asked the state’s top court to rule
by Dec. 31.  Cooper needed to release third-quarter financial statements
within 45 days of the end of the fiscal quarter -- by yesterday
-- and hasn’t, Apollo lawyers wrote.  “Accordingly, neither Cooper nor Apollo is in a position
to compel funding of the transaction financing,” and there is
“no good cause” to hurry up the case, Apollo argued.  Cooper, based in Findlay,  Ohio , said June 12 it would be
bought by Gurgaon, India-based Apollo. When Apollo failed to
close the deal as scheduled on Oct. 4, Cooper sued.  The financial release has been stymied by officials at
Cooper’s Chinese subsidiary, Chengshan Group Co., which operates
Cooper’s biggest plant and stopped making Cooper tires on July
13 in protest of the Apollo deal. The unit is barring Cooper
officials from entering the facilities and won’t provide
financial information needed to complete Cooper’s report.  “At most, Cooper could seek money damages, which does not
require an expedited appeal,” Apollo contends in the filing.  Cooper fell 22 cents to $23.67 at 10:05 a.m. in  New York 
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
