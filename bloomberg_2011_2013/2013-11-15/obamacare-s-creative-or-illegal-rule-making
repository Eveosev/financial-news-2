The fix for the canceled health-insurance plans  announced yesterday  by President Barack Obama amounts to throwing the insurers under the bus -- “underbusing them,” as a friend calls it. The administration said that it was going to allow noncompliant plans to continue to be sold, putting the onus on insurers and state insurance regulators to find some way to sell them -- even though there isn’t a lot of time to get the systems reprogrammed and approved by regulators, who aren't  all on board , and the customers re-enrolled. Mostly, it’s a political move that allows the White House to duck blame for the cancellations, even if it’s too late to actually reverse them. If the insurers follow through, it could throw off all their actuarial calculations, costing them a bunch of money. I wrote yesterday that this was a pretty bold -- or desperate -- move, considering that the administration still needs a fair amount of cooperation from insurers. The insurers are putting in a lot of work helping to get the exchanges working, and they will be very necessary allies indeed if Democrats don't want to go into next year’s midterms just as insurers are announcing their 2015 rates, and indeed, whether they’ll be staying in the insurance market. But it seems that the administration is looking for ways to sweeten the deal for insurers. Politico  reports , “Administration officials say they can take care of that problem. They're going to look at ways to adjust special payment mechanisms built into Obamacare, called  'risk corridors,'  that pay health plans if they have higher costs than they expected.” I’ve been  skeptical  of the argument that the risk corridors will fix things; they’ll mitigate insurer losses if the patient mix is too sick, but they don’t turn losses into profit. It’s a mechanism meant to deal with individual insurers who miscalculate their actuarial risk, not a whole marketplace filled with sicker and older patients than expected. But this is a bit different; the administration is clearly looking for a way to increase the payments so that they defray more of the unexpected costs. Only looking at the statute, I don’t see how they can. The language is extremely clear: Don’t worry, I don’t expect that you’ve read the whole thing. But if you did, you’d see that the payments are quite firmly set as a percentage of allowable costs that exceed expectations -- and “allowable costs” is quite precisely defined. I am not a lawyer, of course, but this doesn’t seem to offer bureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services much discretion to run a slush fund. The administration is already too reliant on creative rule-making to make the law work, such as their decision to delay the employer mandate even though it’s pretty firmly set into law. But now they’re reaching the limits of this strategy. There is always discretion in the implementation of any law, but that discretion is not infinite. Moreover, this most recent exercise may  create other problems . Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law who is involved in one of the lawsuits against Obamacare’s implementation, points out in an e-mail that “the president's action doesn't make these policies legal, it just says the feds won't enforce. State insurance commissioners may approve, but federal law still prohibits these policies.” Which makes me wonder: If those policies end up in court, will a judge go along with their creative approach? And if a judge doesn’t go along with it, what sort of chaos will envelop the insurance market? That’s leaving aside the civic problems with having an administration that simply waives by fiat any rule that gets in the way of their grand designs. President Obama, who  used to be so sharply critical of George W. Bush’s use of executive power , is now pioneering his own expansive views of what the president may do. The White House seems to believe that they are allowed to shinny around any rule, as long as they wrote it. I’d argue that this is exactly backward: They have an especial duty to uphold the laws that they themselves constructed, because if they don’t, why should the rest of us go along?
