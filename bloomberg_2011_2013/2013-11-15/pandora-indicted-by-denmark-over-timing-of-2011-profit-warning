Pandora A/S (PNDORA) , the Danish maker of
charm bracelets, said it will defend itself after being charged
by a local prosecutor with failing to inform the market sooner
that it would miss financial targets more than two years ago.  The Danish Office of Public Prosecutor for Serious Economic
Crimes served an indictment against the jeweler in a court in
Glostrup, where Pandora is based, according to a  statement 
released today. The office alleges that executives knew as early
as July 7, 2011, that revenue growth forecasts would be
significantly lower than expected, but waited until Aug. 2 to
inform the market.  Pandora said in a separate statement that it will plead not
guilty, adding that it “acted properly during a swift and
unexpected downturn in sales.”  Shares in the jeweler fell 65 percent on Aug. 2, 2011 after
the company lowered forecasts due to a collapse in demand that
led to the ousting of its then Chief Executive Officer Mikkel Vendelin Olesen. Pandora has since turned a page and its shares
have more than doubled this year as earnings have improved,
helped by strong sales of new products.  “This is a matter of principle that is of great importance
to the shareholders in Pandora as well as for public confidence
in the market and an even-handed treatment of investors,”
public prosecutor Jens Madsen said in a statement issued by the
court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
