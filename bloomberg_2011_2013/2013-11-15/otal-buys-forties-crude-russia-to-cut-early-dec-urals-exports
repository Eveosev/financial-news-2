Total SA bought North Sea Forties
crude at a higher level than the last deal. Gunvor Group
purchased Russian Urals, the first trade in the Platts window
for one month.  Shipments of Urals crude from Primorsk are set to drop by
44 percent in the first six days of December from the same
period a month earlier.  North Sea  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold Forties cargo F1201 for Dec. 2
to Dec. 4 loading at a premium of 5 cents a barrel to Dated
Brent, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That’s 5 cents more than
the last trade done between Mercuria Energy Trading SA and Shell
on Nov. 11.  Total failed to buy Ekofisk crude for Dec. 5 to Dec. 9
loading at Dated Brent plus 90 cents a barrel, the survey
showed. Mercuria offered the grade yesterday at the same level
without finding a buyer.  Brent for January settlement traded at $108.17 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $108.33 in the previous session. The February
contract was at $107.74, a discount of 43 cents to December.  Urals/Mediterranean  Vitol Group sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals for Dec. 3 to
Dec. 7 loading to Gunvor, at a discount of $1.05 a barrel to
Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey
showed. That’s 90 cents more from the last trade on Oct. 16.  Gunvor Group Ltd. didn’t manage to buy 85,000 tons of CPC
blend for Dec. 3 to Dec. 7 loading at a premium of $1.15 cents
to Dated Brent delivered to Augusta,  Italy . The company bid for
the grade at plus 95 cents yesterday.  Urals exports from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk will be
600,000 metric tons from Nov. 30 to Dec. 6, compared with 1.07
million tons this month, according to a preliminary loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Russian refineries are returning to full capacity after
seasonal maintenance, leaving less crude available for export.
Urals exports from the Baltic port of Ust-Luga will be 400,000
tons from Nov. 30 to Dec. 5, unchanged from the same period this
month, according to the plan. Novorossiysk on the Black Sea will
ship 600,000 tons of crude from Dec. 1 to Dec. 6, also stable
from November.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. issued a second tender to buy crude for

Bonny Light, EA and Escravos from Shell, Total and Chevron Corp.
in its first tender.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, is

delivery to its Cilacap refinery in Java, according to a tender
document obtained by Bloomberg News.  Offers, due at 3 p.m. Singapore time on Nov. 18, are to be
valid until 6 p.m. on Nov. 19, the document shows.  In earlier tenders, Jakarta-based Pertamina bought 600,000
