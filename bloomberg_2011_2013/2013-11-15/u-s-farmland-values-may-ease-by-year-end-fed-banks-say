U.S. farmland values may ease by the
end of the year as bigger harvests drive crop prices lower and
curb producer income, surveys from three Federal Reserve banks
showed.  An increasing number of agricultural bankers say farmland
values will “plateau,” the  Kansas  City Fed said in a report
today, citing its survey of 219 farm banks that cover seven
states. Lenders expect “further erosion” in land values this
quarter, the St. Louis Fed said in its survey of 47 banks in
seven states. Twenty-one percent of 195 bankers in a Chicago Fed
report yesterday projected lower values.  Quality farmland in the Eighth District, which includes all
or parts of  Arkansas , Illinois, Indiana,  Kentucky ,  Mississippi ,
Missouri and Tennessee, averaged $5,332 an acre in the third
quarter, down 6 percent from the previous three months, and cash
rents averaged $181 an acre, down 1.1 percent from the second
quarter, the St. Louis Fed said. The bank conducted its
quarterly survey from Sept. 11 through Sept. 30.  Non-irrigated farmland values rose almost 19 percent and
irrigated farmland more than 21 percent in the third quarter in
the Tenth District, which includes Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, Wyoming,  New Mexico  and Missouri, the Kansas City Fed
said.  The gains outpaced increases in cash rents, signaling the
“potential for a future adjustment in farmland values,” the
Kansas City Fed said. Land prices and cash rents may fall 10
percent to 20 percent over the next few years, a banker in
Southeast Nebraska said in the survey.  U.S. farmers will produce a record 13.989 billion bushels
of corn this year as fields recover from last year’s drought,
the worst since the 1930s. Through yesterday, futures in Chicago
tumbled 49 percent from the all-time high of $8.49 a bushel in
August 2012. Soybean production is projected to be 3.258 billion
bushels, the third-biggest ever. The price has dropped 6.8
percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
