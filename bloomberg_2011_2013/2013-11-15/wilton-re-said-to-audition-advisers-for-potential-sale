Wilton Re Holdings Ltd., a life
reinsurer backed by Stone Point Capital LLC, is interviewing
investment banks to advise it on a potential sale or initial
public offering next year, people familiar with the matter said.  The two options could provide Wilton’s private-equity
backers with a return on the $1.5 billion they’ve invested in
the company since 2004, the people said, asking not to be
identified discussing private information. Wilton has about $2
billion in book value, one person said.  Wilton, based in Hamilton,  Bermuda  helps life insurers
reduce risk by backing some of their policies, and it acquires
businesses that have stopped issuing new coverage. Its
subsidiaries include Redding Reassurance Co., Wilton Reassurance
Life Co. of New York and Texas Life Insurance Co., according to
its website.  Stone Point Chief Executive Officer Charles Davis and Ray Eckert, a Wilton Re spokesman, didn’t return calls for comment.
Wilton has also raised money from  Kelso & Co. , Vestar Capital
Partners Inc. and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe LLC, according to
company statements.  Stone Point invested in Wilton from a $1.1 billion fund
that it closed in 2004, when the private-equity firm was still
part of Marsh & McLennan Cos., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Buyout funds typically have a life of nine years.  Stone Point, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based firm that
invests in financial services, is seeking $4.5 billion for its
latest fund, two people familiar with the matter said in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
