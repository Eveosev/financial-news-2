Spot metallurgical coal in the U.S.
was unchanged amid lower demand, IHS Inc.’s Energy Publishing
Inc. said.  Low-volatility coal held at $141.25 a ton, the Knoxville,
Tennessee-based data provider said.  “While things are quiet on the U.S. metallurgical coal
market front, there is some concern about recent global price
weakness,” it said.  IHS Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
