The World Series champion Boston  Red
Sox  raised ticket prises for their 81 games at Fenway Park next
season by an average of 4.8 percent.  The team also will charge more for tickets to 16 high-demand games and less for 16 low-demand games, the team said in
an e-mailed statement. The premium games include opening day and
the nine home games against the  New York  Yankees, the team said.  The rest of the games will be placed into one of five tiers
of pricing based on expected demand.  The Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals last month to win
their third Major League Baseball championship since 2004.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
