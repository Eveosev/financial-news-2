Crude options volatility fell as the
underlying futures were little changed a second consecutive day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money January options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
17.74 percent at 3:35 p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange,
down from 18.37 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for January delivery added 8 cents
to settle at $94.49 a barrel on the Nymex. WTI crude for
December delivery rose rose 8 cents to $93.84.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 58
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were December $94 calls, which dropped 35 cents to 12
cent a barrel with 3,964 lots trading as of 4:49 p.m. December
$94 puts fell 43 cents to 16 cents on volume of 2,767.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 53 percent of
the 117,394 lots traded. December $93 puts declined 10 cents to
21 cents a barrel on 8,352 contracts. December $92 puts fell 6
cents to 8 cents on volume of 6,935 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for December $80 puts,
with 43,234 contracts. Next were December $85 puts with 36,672
lots and December $90 puts with 32,788.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
