optimism  China  will soon release details of economic reforms.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  surged beyond 15,000 for

disappointment with the plenum and that’s coming with all the
good news about the Fed stimulus outlook,” Adrian Zuercher, a

the equivalent of $404 billion. “Any policy changes are going
to be in the right direction and improve market stability.”  Shares in China and Hong Kong fell on Nov. 13 on investors
disappointment after the Communist Party plenum. Expectations
that the government would release details of discussions soon at

Kong-based chief Asia and emerging-market strategist at Morgan
Stanley, said in an interview from Singapore yesterday.  Regional Gauges  Japan’s broader  Topix (TPX)  index gained 1.7 percent. South

gained 0.5 percent to a record yesterday. Yellen, nominated to
succeed Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, told the Senate that
removing monetary stimulus too soon would threaten a fragile
economic recovery. Asked yesterday about stock prices, Yellen
testified she doesn’t see “bubble-like conditions.”  “This wasn’t just music to the ears of stimulus-hungry
investors, it was like listening to Beethoven’s Ninth
Symphony,” said Matthew Sherwood, head of investment markets
research in Sydney at Perpetual Investments, which manages about
$25 billion.  The S&P 500 has rallied more than 25 percent this year,
putting it on pace for the best  annual gain  in a decade. The
