Cargotec (CGCBV)  Oyj, the world’s biggest
maker of container-lifting gear, said a new China venture may
post annual sales of as much as 5.8 billion yuan ($912 million)
as growing global trade spurs demand for port equipment.  The venture may reach that target in six years, Chief
Executive Officer and President Mikael Makinen told reporters in
Shanghai today. The company and partner  Jiangsu Rainbow Heavy
Industries Co. (002483)  today started work on a two-year project to build
the venture’s main facility in Taicang, near Shanghai.  Cargotec is investing 30 million euros ($38 million) of
equity into the new business, which will make port-handling
systems, cranes and other heavy equipment, as manufacturing in
China spurs sea-cargo shipments to the U.S. and  Europe .
Container volumes at Chinese harbors have risen more than 8
percent from a year earlier for the last four months, according
to Ministry of Transport data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
