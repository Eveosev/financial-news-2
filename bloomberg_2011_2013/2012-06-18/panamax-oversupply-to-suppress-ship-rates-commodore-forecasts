Hire (BDIY)  costs for Panamax vessels that
carry  iron ore , coal and grains may be suppressed by an
oversupply of new ships next year, according to Commodore
Research & Consultancy.  There are 595 Panamaxes, the largest vessels to navigate
the Panama Canal, scheduled for delivery by the end of 2013,
including 355 vessels this year and 240 next, the New York-based
consultant said in an e-mailed report today. That compares with
an order book of 235 Capesize ships, the largest carriers of
iron ore and coal, by the end of next year.  “In 2013, the Panamax market is poised to become the most
oversupplied of all of the dry-bulk vessel classes,” said
 Jeffrey Landsberg , managing director of Commodore. “While near-
term prospects for Capesize rates remain bleak due to the
tremendous amount of Capesize vessels that will remain available
in the market, a strong case can be made that future prospects
for Panamax rates are considerably worse.”  Daily charter  rates  for Panamaxes gained 1.8 percent to
$8,469 a day on June 15, according to data on Bloomberg. Hire
costs have fallen 34 percent this year. Capesize rates will
average less than $10,000 this year, Arctic Securities ASA, an
Oslo-based investment bank, said in a June 14 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
