Oil dropped for the first time in
three days as the worsening  European debt crisis  threatened to
slow global economic growth and reduce demand for crude.  Prices declined 0.9 percent as Spanish borrowing costs rose
to a euro-era high. More loans  went unpaid  in April, Bank of
 Spain  data showed, suggesting the country’s recession is forcing
more companies and consumers into default. Weekend elections in
Greece eased concern that the country will exit the euro.  “There is a bearish economic contagion in Europe and it’s
essentially bringing prices down,” said  Michael Lynch ,
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
Massachusetts. “Although the Greek news was positive, people
are more concerned now about Spain.”  Oil for July delivery fell 76 cents to settle at $83.27 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are down 19
percent in the second quarter and 16 percent this year.  Brent oil for August settlement dropped $1.56, or 1.6
percent, to $96.05 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  The 10-year  Spanish bond  yield jumped above 7 percent for
the first time since the creation of the euro. Bad loans as a
proportion of total Spanish lending rose to 8.72 percent in
April, the highest level since 1994.  Euro Declines  The euro fell 0.5 percent against the dollar. A weaker euro
and stronger dollar reduce oil’s value as an investment
alternative.  “Once the reality set back in and we saw bond yields
climbing, oil started falling,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief
market strategist and founder of Iitrader.com in Chicago. “If
the market does trigger that $80 price, it would fall quickly
another $5 to $75 or below.”  In  Greece , Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy
party, said he and Pasok leader  Evangelos Venizelos  agreed on
the need to forge a unity government, easing concern that Greece
would reject austerity measures needed to qualify for aid.  Oil’s decline “is clearly a rejection of the Greek
elections,” said  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the Energy
Overview newsletter in New York and previously an oil trader at
MF Global. “The market is not going to play that game
anymore.”  Global  oil prices  might drop 25 percent if multiple euro-
area economies ran into severe difficulties at the same time,
 Andrew Burns , the  World Bank ’s director of global economic
trends, said in an interview in Brussels.  Falling Demand  Oil consumption in  Europe  will fall 340,000 barrels a day
this year and a further 230,000 in 2013, the Energy Department’s
Energy Information Administration forecast in its monthly  Short-
Term Energy Outlook  report on June 12. Demand in the U.S. will
also decline in 2012, the EIA said.  Raymond James & Associates Inc. cut its forecasts for West
Texas Intermediate crude and Brent oil by $12 a barrel each. WTI
will average $87.63 a barrel this year and Brent $102.12,
Raymond James analysts, including Marshall Adkins in Houston,
said in the report. The company forecast a fourth-quarter
average of $75 and a 2013 average of $65.  Oil dropped 2.4 percent in intraday trading before paring
losses as stocks rebounded from their lows on speculation that
central banks will move to bolster global economic growth. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.1 percent at 3:21 p.m. after
falling as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  Federal Reserve  Federal Reserve  policy makers will meet tomorrow as slowing
employment growth at home and a deepening crisis in Europe weigh
on the economic outlook. Group of 20 nations are discussing a
mix of measures to secure the global recovery, a Canadian
official said.  “Oil is still going to be very quiet in a tight range
until we get the news from the Fed,” Ilczyszyn said. “If the
Fed doesn’t act, it’s going to be very bearish for oil.”  Money managers cut bullish oil wagers for a sixth week,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitment of Traders Report.  Net-long positions  fell by 2,541,
or 1.9 percent, to 130,508 futures and options combined in the
seven days ended June 12.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 487,614
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 460,330
contracts on June 15, 17 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.47 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
