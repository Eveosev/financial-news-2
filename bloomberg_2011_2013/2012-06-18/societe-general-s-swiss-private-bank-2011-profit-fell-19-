Societe Generale  SA’s Swiss private
bank said full-year profit fell as the euro-region debt crisis
reduced investor confidence in financial markets and income from
trading and commissions declined.  Net income fell 19 percent to 33.1 million Swiss francs
($34.8 million) from 40.7 million francs a year earlier, the
 Geneva-based unit  said in its annual report sent by e-mail
today.  “While 2011 represented a further chapter of the years of
crisis we have been experiencing since August 2007, its
challenges were particularly difficult to overcome against a
backdrop of heightened political, economic and financial
mistrust,” Guillaume Lejoindre, the unit’s chief executive
officer, said in a letter published in the report, adding that
he expected “improved fundamentals” in the economy and markets
this year.  Net income from commission and trading activities dropped
1.4 percent, while operating expenses were up 8.5 percent as the
firm added staff and salary increases outpaced inflation, it
said. Assets under management advanced 4 percent to 25.9 billion
francs, helped by net client inflows of 1.5 billion francs.  Paris-based Societe Generale (GLE) ,  France ’s second-biggest bank
by market value, oversaw 85.4 billion euros ($108 billion) for
wealth-management clients worldwide at the end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
