Spanish Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro called on the  European Central Bank  to prop up the
nation’s bond market as yields surged beyond the 7 percent level
that prompted bailouts in other euro nations.  “The ECB should respond with all firmness,” Montoro told
lawmakers in the Senate in  Madrid  today, echoing a call made by
other members of the government. Doubts that remain about the
currency region that need to be eliminated, he said.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield rose to a euro-era record of
7.15 percent today as the positive impact of the Greek election
result faded after about an hour of trading. Spain agreed to a
100 billion-euro ($126 billion) bailout for its banks on June 9,
and its borrowing costs have continued to rise amid speculation
the government will have to come back for a full rescue.  Montoro said  Spain  backs more fiscal and political union in
the 17-nation euro area as well as a so-called banking union.
The government has chosen the “path of responsibility” and
will meet its  budget-deficit  targets, he said.  Spain aims for a budget gap of 5.3 percent of gross
domestic product this year, compared with 8.9 percent in 2011,
even as the economy suffers its second recession since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
