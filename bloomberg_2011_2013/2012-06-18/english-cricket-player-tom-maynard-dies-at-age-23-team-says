was killed when he was hit by a  London Underground  train early
today, the Daily Telegraph reported. He was 23.  Maynard’s club, Surrey, confirmed his death in an e-mailed

a black Mercedes C250 which was being driven “erratically” at
4.15 a.m. The driver ran off and was found dead at 5.10 a.m. on
a railway line near Wimbledon Park station, the Telegraph said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
