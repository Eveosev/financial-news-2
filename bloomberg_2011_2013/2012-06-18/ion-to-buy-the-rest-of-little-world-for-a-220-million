Lion Pty., the Australian brewing
unit of  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503) , agreed to pay A$220 million ($223
million) to buy the 64 percent of  Little World Beverages Ltd. (LWB)  it
doesn’t already own to add faster growing boutique beers.  Lion will pay A$5.30 a share, Fremantle, Western Australia-
based Little World said in a statement today. After including
debt and the 36 percent Lion already owns, the deal values the
maker of Little Creatures beer at A$381.6 million.  The offer is 40 percent more than the previous closing
price of A$3.79 and values the company at 20.3 times earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for 2011,
Little World said in the statement.  The board plans to recommend the bid to investors subject
to a so-called independent expert’s report finding the offer is
in the best interests of Little World shareholders, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
