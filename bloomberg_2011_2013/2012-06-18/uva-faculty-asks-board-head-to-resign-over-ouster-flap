University of Virginia  professors
asked the head of the collegeâ€™s board to resign over the ouster
of President Teresa Sullivan.  The executive council of the faculty senate made the
request after meeting with Rector Helen Dragas, head of the
Board of Visitors, today to discuss the June 10 removal of
Sullivan, who has served less than two years, according to a
faculty statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
