Taiwan ’s dollar rallied for a fourth
day after parties that support  Greece ’s bailout won enough seats
to control parliament, boosting demand for emerging-market
assets.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency touched a two-week high as the MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of shares advanced by the most in a week. The New
Democracy and Pasok parties took 162 seats in the 300-member
parliament in weekend elections, easing concern the nation will
leave the euro. Taiwan’s central bank will hold its benchmark
 interest rate  at 1.875 percent on June 21, according to all 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “It looks like Greece has averted its immediate risks,”
said George Pu, a bond trader at Sinopac Securities Corp. in
Taipei. “Taiwan’s central bank will probably hold rates for now
as it’s in a cautious mode.”  The island’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.886
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.770 earlier, the strongest level since June 1.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, fell 34 basis points, or 0.34 percentage
point, to 5.30 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 was little changed at 1.19 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was
steady at 0.509 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
