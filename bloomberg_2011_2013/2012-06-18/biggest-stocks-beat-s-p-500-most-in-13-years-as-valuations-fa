The  largest U.S. companies  are
beating the average stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index by
the most in more than a decade, fueled by rising dividends,
valuations 31 percent below the historical average and fear.  Companies in the S&P 100 from Apple Inc. to  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  have gained 7.7 percent in 2012,  compared  with 5.1 percent
for a version of the S&P 500 that strips out weightings for
market value, the widest margin since 1999, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. With  price-earnings ratios  down 6.6 percent this
quarter to 12.7 and payouts at 2.2 percent of share prices,
analysts raised buy recommendations for the group to the highest
level since 2007.  The biggest stocks are showing corporate America’s
resilience even though  Mitt Romney , the presumptive Republican
candidate in this year’s national election, criticized President
Barack Obama earlier this month for saying the private sector is
“doing fine.” A second year of record profits is helping the
 S&P 100 (OEX)  beat every developed market index in the world as
investors seek the relative safety of the U.S. after $5.1
trillion was erased from global equities since March 27.  “The mega-caps are just cheap compared to other segments
of the stock market,”  Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-based
global chief investment strategist for the IShares unit of
BlackRock Inc., said in a June 14 phone interview. His firm
oversees $3.68 trillion. “There are a lot of things that are
wrong in the economy, to state the obvious, and these are
companies that have the wherewithal to survive.”  Return Reversal  The performance is a reversal of the  last three years . The
S&P 100, tracking companies with an average market value of
$82.2 billion, climbed 77 percent between March 9, 2009, and the
end of 2011, compared with 128 percent for the  wider index’s
average company , which has a market capitalization of $25.5
billion. The measure of larger companies is down 26 percent
since the peak of the 1990s Internet rally in March 2000
compared with a 75 percent increase in the equal-weighted index,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bigger companies in the  S&P 500  last beat the full index by
a greater margin in 1999, just as the  technology bubble  was
peaking. At the end of that year, the S&P 500’s 10 largest
constituents made up 25.2 percent of the index, compared with
less than 21 percent now. The S&P 100 climbed 31 percent and
beat the 500-member measure by 11.7 percentage points in 1999,
the largest gap since at least 1976, according to data that
began that year compiled by Bloomberg.  American Equity  The S&P 100, which accounts for about half of all American
market value, plunged 53 percent from its peak in March 2000
through the bear market low in October 2002, almost 4 percentage
points more than the broader index.  Stocks gained last week, with the S&P 100 climbing 1.5
percent to 614.84 and the S&P 500 adding 1.3 percent to 1,342.84
for the second straight advance. The  100-stock index  climbed 0.1
percent to 615.29 today, and the S&P 500 advanced 0.1 percent to
1,344.78.  Investors bought shares last week on speculation central
banks will take action to stimulate global growth should
Europe’s debt crisis spread and before Greek voters prepared for
elections that could determine if the nation stays in the euro.
Greek election winner Antonis Samaras raced to build a coalition
to keep bailout aid flowing after key rival, anti-bailout party
Syriza, rejected his offer to join a government.  Higher Forecasts  American shares have rallied as profits beat analyst
estimates and forecasts for economic expansion in 2012 rose to
2.2 percent from 2.1 in January, according to the median
forecast in a survey of 93 economists. While U.S. shares rose,
the  Stoxx Europe 600 (SXXP)  has slipped 0.1 percent this year and
Spain’s IBEX 35 Index is down 22 percent.  The S&P 500 has climbed 22 percent since reaching a one-
year low in October and is up 6.8 percent for 2012. It has
fallen 5.4 percent since reaching a four-year high of 1,419.04
on April 2. The gauge fell 2.5 percent on June 1 after a
disappointing report on American joblessness.  The U.S. added the fewest workers in a year to payrolls
last month and the  unemployment rate  rose, according to the June
1 report from the Labor Department. The Citigroup Economic
Surprise Index, which plots U.S. economic data against
projections in Bloomberg surveys, dropped to minus 60.6 this
month, indicating more economic reports are falling short.  Romney called Obama “detached and out of touch with the
American people” after the president said during a White House
news conference this month that the private sector was doing
fine. Obama later clarified the remark to say it is “absolutely
clear” that the economy is struggling.  Tipping Point  “We are at an extremely important tipping point here with
respect to the U.S.,” said  Michael Holland , chairman of New
York-based Holland & Co., which oversees more than $4 billion.
The stock market is “a factor in our daily lives now, so you
can’t avoid it and neither can Romney and Obama,” he said.  While the biggest stocks are winners this year, they
performed no better than the broader market when equities
tumbled since the financial crisis began. The S&P 100 fell 37
percent in 2008, compared with a 38 percent decline in the S&P
500. The gauge lost 18 percent between April and October 2011,
1.6 percentage point less than the 500-stock index, as the U.S.
debt ceiling debate led S&P to cut the country’s credit rating
and  Europe ’s debt crisis spread.  Should Spanish bank bailouts and Greek elections fail to
halt the spread of the region’s crisis, even the biggest U.S.
companies are vulnerable to another downturn, said  Walter Todd ,
who oversees about $940 million as chief investment officer of
Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina.  Europe Exposure  “A lot of these companies have exposure to Europe and that
certainly is a factor to consider,” Todd said in a June 14
phone interview. “Depending on what happens in the market and
with Europe, if it doesn’t get resolved, they’ll still get
hammered.”  The biggest companies in the S&P 500 derive more business
from around the world, getting about 49 percent of  sales  from
outside the Americas, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with the 46 percent for the broader index.  S&P 100 stocks may prove more resilient than their smaller
peers during a slower economic expansion because they are more
established companies that don’t depend on high-growth markets
for their main business. The U.S. advance was led by a 42
percent surge in Apple this year, a rally that boosted its
market value by $160.4 billion, more than the individual values
of Oracle Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank of America climbed
42 percent, leading financial companies in the S&P 500 to the
index’s fourth-biggest advance.  Costa Rica  Apple, the Cupertino, California-based maker of iPads and
iPhones, and Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Bank of America  are
forecast to earn a combined $53 billion in calendar year 2012,
more than the gross domestic product of Costa Rica.  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  in  San Jose , California, and Seattle-based
Amazon.com Inc. have advanced more than 26 percent in 2012 as
 consumer spending , which makes up about 70 percent of the  U.S.
economy , rose 0.3 percent in April, according to Commerce
Department data. EBay, the largest online marketplace, will
boost profit 16 percent this year and next, while Amazon’s
earnings will double in 2013, estimates compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Dividend yields in the S&P 100 reached 2.3 percent this
month, the highest of 2012, while the  valuation  has declined to
12.7 times annual earnings, 31 percent below the average since
1997. That compares with profit multiples of 28.9 in the  Russell
2000 Index (RTY)  of small-cap stocks and 17.2 in the S&P Midcap 400
Index. The large-cap gauge is up almost twice as much as both
measures this year.  Defensive Names  “We’ve shifted in this lull into big defensive names,
after all these concerns about Europe,”  Frederic Dickson , who
helps oversee about $32 billion as chief market strategist at
D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon, said in a June 13
phone interview. “They’ve continued to deliver and that’s what
people want right now.”  Earnings for U.S. companies  beat  analyst projections for
the past two years and are projected to reach records in 2012
and 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While analysts have
been boosting their ratings for U.S. stocks of all sizes,
they’ve been increasing calls on the biggest at a faster rate.
The average rating for the S&P 100 is at the highest level
relative to the broader S&P 500 since 2007.  “With risk-off clearly in effect, a focus on the largest
stocks around the world is natural,” Adam Parker, Morgan
Stanley’s U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note this month.
He’s advising clients to buy stocks with the highest revenue
from  emerging markets  and most cash generation.  Debt Reduction  The biggest companies have  cut debt  and costs while
boosting profits. Return on common equity, a measure of
profitability, for the top stocks reached a record last year,
and is about 3 percentage points higher in the 100-stock gauge
than the broader index. Free cash flow also reached a new high
in 2011, climbing 9.4 percent compared with an 8.1 percent
increase for the S&P 500.  “These are the names with the fortress balance sheets,”
 Peter Sorrentino , a senior  fund manager  at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, which oversees $14.7 billion, said in a
June 14 phone interview. “They have good growth potential, and
they have a lot of financial power and can act independent of
any financial crisis that might arise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
