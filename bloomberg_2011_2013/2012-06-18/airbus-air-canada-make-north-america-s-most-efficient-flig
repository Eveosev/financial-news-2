Airbus SAS and  Air Canada (AC/B)  are making
 North America ’s first “perfect flight” today as they combine
the most efficient aircraft, biofuel and even lightweight cabin
equipment to cut energy and carbon emissions to a minimum.  The commercial flight on an Airbus A319 from Toronto to
Mexico City uses a “state-of-the-art” aircraft, powered by
sustainable fuels and guided by “streamlined” air-traffic
control, Airbus said in an e-mailed statement.  Airlines won approval from the U.S. technical standards
body last July to fly passenger planes using a 50-50 blend of
petroleum-based fuel and biofuel. In October, Airbus and Air
France-KLM Group said they made the world’s greenest commercial
flight from Toulouse to Paris, using a cooking oil-based fuel,
taking the shortest available route and applying a so-called
continuous descent approach, cutting emissions in half.  “The aviation industry is in a strong position to reduce
emissions and fly many more perfect flights,” Airbus Chief
Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier said in the statement. “To
make this a day-to-day commercial reality, it requires now a
political will to foster incentives.”  Today’s flight will reduce carbon-dioxide output by an
estimated 40 percent compared with a regular flight, according
to Toulouse-based Airbus. The aviation industry is aiming to cut
emissions in half by 2050 from 2005 levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
