ITAB Shop Concept AB (ITABB) , a Swedish
seller of shop shelves and check-out counters, rose the most in
almost two weeks in Stockholm trading after agreeing to buy
Maxted Holding Group to strengthen its position in the U.K.  The shares rose as much as 6.1 percent, the biggest
intraday jump since June 5. ITAB was up 3 percent at 102 kronor
as of 11:08 a.m.  ITAB offered 22 million kronor ($3.1 million) in cash for
Maxted Holding Group, a company that produces and sells joinery
to clients such as  Gap Inc. (GPS)  and Debenhams Plc. The purchase will
strengthen ITAB’s position in the U.K. retail market and will
have a small positive effect on earnings per share, Jonkoping,
Sweden-based ITAB said today in a  statement.   “The company not only has well-developed project
management skills and excellent contacts in the specialty retail
sector, it also has its own joinery production that creates
synergies and opportunities for further strengthening our range
of concepts for ITAB in the U.K.,” Chief Executive Officer Ulf Rostedt said.  ITAB entered the British market for shop equipment in 2006
through the acquisitions of City Group and Radford CGC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
