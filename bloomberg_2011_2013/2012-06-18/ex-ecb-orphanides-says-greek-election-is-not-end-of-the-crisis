Former European Central Bank
Governing Council member Athanasios Orphanides said the outcome
of yesterday’s Greek election did not end the region’s debt
crisis and he’s “not surprised” by surging Spanish bond
yields.  Greeks voting for pro-bailout parties “was a very positive
result for  Europe  as a whole” as “it gives time to the
political leadership in Europe,” he said in an interview on
Bloomberg Radio today.  Orphanides, whose term at the ECB finished in May and who
will begin teaching at the MIT Sloan School of Management later
this year, urged European leaders to push for “greater
political integration which is necessary to put the crisis to
bed.”  Spanish 10-year bonds slid today, pushing yields to more
than 7 percent, after yesterday’s elections failed to assure
investors that politicians will be able to tame a debt crisis
that is now in its third year and has seen four countries
applying for bailouts. Europe’s leaders will pledge to
“mobilize all levers and instruments” to tackle the turmoil,
according to a draft document prepared for a June 28-29 summit
in Brussels.  Orphanides said he’s “optimistic that we’ll have the bold
political decisions” needed at the summit. At the same time, he
said he supports countries that reject common bonds and a fiscal
union “because we do not have the safeguards on spending by the
various member states to make that work in the long term.”  He said he backed the alternative proposal of a banking
union, including a euro-area deposit guarantee scheme, a banking
resolution authority and region-wide banking supervision, as
such a union would help “delink the sovereign from the banks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
