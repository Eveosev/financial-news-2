The Miami Heat hold a two-games-to-
one lead in the National Basketball Association Finals for the
second year in a row after withstanding a late  Oklahoma City 
Thunder rally for a 91-85 victory.  LeBron James  scored 29 points and  Dwyane Wade  added 25 last
night for the Heat, whose seven-point fourth-quarter lead was
cut to one in the closing minutes at AmericanAirlines Arena in
Miami. Oklahoma City missed its last three shots and the Heat
sealed the victory from the free-throw line, where they made 31
of 35 attempts, including 25 of their last 27.  “It was good to see us execute down the stretch, but more
importantly it was great to see that we were able to get
stops,” James, who added 14 rebounds, said in a televised
interview. “That’s where the game is won and we did that.”  Game 4 in the best-of-seven championship series is
scheduled for tomorrow in Miami. The Heat also led 2-1 in last
year’s NBA Finals before losing the next three games and the
series to the  Dallas Mavericks .  “It’s a tough loss,”  Kevin Durant , who led the Thunder
with 25 points last night, said at a news conference. “But it’s
not over. You’ve got to be ready for the next game.”  Russell Westbrook , who had 19 points for Oklahoma City,
missed a wide-open 3-point attempt with 29 seconds left that
could have tied the score.  “We know they’re not broken,” James said. “And we look
forward to the challenge in Game 4.”  The Heat, after splitting the first two games of the series
in Oklahoma City, led 26-20 after one quarter last night and had
a one-point lead at halftime. The Thunder trailed 49-46 early in
the third quarter before a 14-2 run, with eight points from
Durant, opened a 60-51 advantage.  Miami Streak  After Durant picked up his fourth foul, Miami closed the
third quarter with a 16-7 run to regain a two-point lead, 69-67.  “They made us stagnant and they came out in the third
quarter and attacked us and we didn’t attack back,” James said
at a news conference. “We did that in the last three or four
minutes of the third quarter.”  The Thunder went back in front, 77-76, with 7:31 left in
the final quarter before Miami scored eight straight points to
take the lead for good. Oklahoma City pulled within one point
with 1:30 left on a 17-foot jump shot by Westbrook.  James, Wade and  Chris Bosh , who had 10 points and 11
rebounds, each made free throws in the final 1:19. The trio
scored Miami’s last 15 points.  “We were able to make enough plays,” Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  said at a news conference. “It wasn’t pretty all the
way through, but here in Miami we like these wins because
they’re gritty and they speak a lot to the team’s character.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
