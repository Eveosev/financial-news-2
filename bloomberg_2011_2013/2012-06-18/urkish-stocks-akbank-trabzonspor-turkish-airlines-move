Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 0.2 percent to 58,324.86 at the close in Istanbul,
breaking its longest winning streak since August 1993 as Spanish
bond yields climbed to a euro-era record amid concern the
continent’s debt crisis is deepening.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  , Turkey’s second-biggest bank by
market value, led losses by lenders on the exchange, declining
1.3 percent to 6.04 liras while the Turkey Large Cap Bank Index
declined 1 percent, dropping for the first day in three.  Trabzonspor Sportif Yatirim & Futbol Isletmeciligi TAS (TSPOR) 
, the listed unit of Black Sea soccer club
Trabzonspor, jumped 6.9 percent to 11.70 liras after saying the
team agreed to sign defender Souleymane Bamba from England’s
Leicester City.  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, or Turkish Airlines, added
1.8 percent to 2.82 liras. Turkish Airlines will add a new route
to Houston and increased its number of flights to New York to
three a day in response to increased demand, it said in a
statement today. The number of passengers using the airline
jumped 18.9 percent in the first five months of the year, led by
a 33 percent increase in international passengers, the company
said on June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
