Standard & Poor’s , the world’s
largest credit-rating company, hired Don Howard as chief risk
officer.  Howard, 52, will be responsible for ensuring the company’s
employees comply with laws, regulations and internal policies
and will report to Douglas Peterson, the firm’s president, S&P
said today in a statement. He was formerly a managing director
at Promontory Financial Group LLC, where he assessed risk at
global banks.  Peterson, a former Citigroup Inc. executive, has been
reorganizing the management of the New York-based unit of
McGraw-Hill Cos. since he took over for Deven Sharma in
September. S&P received notice of a possible investigation from
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year and is
overseen by a new office of credit ratings created by the 2010
Dodd-Frank financial regulation law.  “Don is one of the finest risk managers in the financial-
services sector,” Peterson said in the statement. “During the
course of his career, Don has focused on many of the most
important aspects of risk management including credit, market
and regulatory risk; mergers and acquisitions, and model
validation.”  Before working at Promontory, Howard was a group chief risk
officer at HSBC Holdings Plc in  London , according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
