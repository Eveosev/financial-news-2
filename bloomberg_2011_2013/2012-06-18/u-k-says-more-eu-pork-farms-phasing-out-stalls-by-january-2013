U.K. pig farmers will be in a better
position to compete with other European Union producers next
year as more countries move toward phasing out sow stalls, the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  Individual sow stalls will be outlawed in the EU starting
Jan. 1, and 18 of the 27 member countries will likely be fully
compliant with the ban by the deadline, Defra said today in a
 statement  on its website, citing the European Commission. Sow
stalls have been illegal in the U.K. since 1999. In addition,
 Austria ,  Finland , Greece, Poland and Slovenia are expected to be
more than 90 percent compliant with the law, Defra said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
