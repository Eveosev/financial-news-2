TUI AG (TUI1)  Chief Executive Officer
Michael Frenzel said concern about extra charges for travel to
Greece this summer in the event of a currency change in the
country are unfounded,  Bild Zeitung  reported.  Tour operators negotiate hotel prices and air fares a year
ahead, Frenzel told the newspaper.  He advised travellers to bring extra cash in case Greek
ATMs arenâ€™t functioning, Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
