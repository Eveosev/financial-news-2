Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
rose to its highest in almost a month after founder Constantino de Oliveira Jr. stepped down as chief executive officer as the
airline works to return to profit.  Gol advanced 3.3 percent to 9.80 reais in  Sao Paulo , the
highest close since May 21. The benchmark Bovespa index rose 1.8
percent, while rival Tam SA gained 0.7 percent to 47.32 reais.  Paulo Kakinoff, Audi AG’s Brazil head, will take over as
CEO on July 2, the low-cost carrier said in a  statement  on its
website yesterday. Oliveira will become chairman.  “We view as marginally positive the fact that Mr. Paulo
Kakinoff was elected the new CEO of Gol as we believe he could
employ his extensive experience in management in favor of Gol’s
shareholders,” Banco Santander Brasil SA analyst Pedro Balcao-
Reis wrote in a note to clients today.  Gol is trimming 1,200 jobs from a workforce of about
20,500, mostly through attrition, Chief Financial Officer
Leonardo Pereira said in April.  Kakinoff worked for Audi parent  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  for 19 years
and has been a Gol director since 2010. He will leave the board
to become CEO, Gol said.  Gol started operations in 2001 and has grown to a fleet of
123  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 planes, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
