A spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel today queried comments by her foreign minister,  Guido Westerwelle , suggesting  Germany  was ready to give Greece more
time to fulfill the terms of its bailout.  Georg Streiter, Merkel’s deputy chief spokesman, told
reporters that while the outcome of Greece’s election yesterday
was good for Europe, “this is not the time for some sort of
rebates” for the country. “The terms of the bailout agreement
are still valid,” he said.  The remarks, in response to reporters’ questions at a
regular press conference in Berlin, followed comments made by
Westerwelle yesterday after the release of Greek exit polls.
Westerwelle, a member of the Free Democratic Party which serves
as Merkel’s junior coalition partner, said he can “imagine we
could do something in terms of the time frame,” while adding
that “one thing must be clear: the treaties must be valid in
substance. They can’t be canceled or renegotiated.”  Merkel’s government is awaiting a review of Greece’s record
of sticking to bailout pledges by the so-called troika comprised
of the European Commission, the  International Monetary Fund  and
the  European Central Bank , before weighing how to help Greece,
Streiter said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
