Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) , maker of
Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, plans to cut in half, by
2025, the amount of wood fiber newly taken from forests for use
in the company’s products.  Kimberly-Clark said it used almost 750,000 metric tons
(827,000 short tons) of primary wood fiber sourced from natural
forests last year. Its initiative will save the equivalent of
all the fiber needed to make more than 3.5 billion rolls of
toilet paper, the company said.  The company will use or test alternative sources of fiber,
such as bamboo and wheat straw, as part of its sustainability
efforts, Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark said today in a statement
disclosing the commitment.  “In the long run, we hope that one day all our fiber needs
will be met from sources that collectively have maximum land use
efficiencies while minimizing impact on people and our planet,”
Suhas Apte, the company’s vice president for global
sustainability, said in the statement.  Kimberly-Clark rose 0.4 percent to $82.79 at the close in
 New York . The shares have gained 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
