Webb Simpson  had four birdies in a
five-hole stretch midway through the final round to move into a
tie for the U.S. Open lead with fellow American  Jim Furyk .  Simpson, 26, who is playing in his second U.S. Open, is 2
under for the day and 1 over for the tournament at San
Franciscoâ€™s Olympic Club.  Furyk, 42, the 2003 U.S. Open champion, held the lead for
most of the day until a bogey on the par-3 13th dropped him into
a tie with Simpson.  Michael Thompson of the U.S., two-time champion Ernie Els
of South Africa and 2010 U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell of
Northern Ireland are a shot back at 2 over.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
