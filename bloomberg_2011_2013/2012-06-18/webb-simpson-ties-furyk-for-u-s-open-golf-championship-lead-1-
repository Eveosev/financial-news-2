Webb Simpson  had four birdies in a
five-hole stretch midway through the final round to move into a
tie for the  U.S. Open  lead with  Jim Furyk .  Simpson, a 26-year-old American who is playing in his
second U.S. Open, is 2 under par through 17 holes today and 1
over for the tournament at San Francisco’s foggy Olympic Club.  Furyk, 42, the 2003 U.S. Open champion, held the lead for
most of the day until a bogey on the par-3 13th hole dropped him
into a tie with Simpson. His bogey came one hole after he saved
par with a putt of about 35 feet.  Michael Thompson  of the U.S. finished his round at 2 over.
Graeme McDowell of  Northern Ireland , the 2010 champion, and two-
time champion Ernie Els of South Africa are among six players at
3 over.  Furyk’s bogey on 13, his second of the day, came after he
made a tough par 4 on the 12th hole. His first shot went into
the trees and his second shot landed in the sand. He blasted out
and left himself a long putt that he slid into the center of the
cup.  Furyk, McDowell and Els all are former U.S. Open champions.
Furyk, an American, won in 2003 at Olympia Fields south of
Chicago. McDowell won in 2010 at Pebble Beach, about 114 miles
(184 kilometers) south of the Olympic Club along California’s
Pacific Coast.  Els, who won the U.S. Open in 1994 and 1997, moved into
contention today with a 10-foot eagle putt on the seventh hole.  Woods Falls  Tiger Woods , who has a four-year winless drought in major
championships, shot a 3-over 73 today to end the tournament at 7
over.  “Today I got off to a bad start and never got it going
early, and unfortunately put myself out of it,” Woods told
reporters.  Beau Hossler, an amateur from Southern California who
hasn’t yet started his final year in high school, shot 6-over 76
today and ended the tournament at 9 over.  Five-time U.S. Open runner-up  Phil Mickelson , who turned 42
yesterday, shot an 8-over 78 in the fourth round and finished
the tournament at 16 over.  “If you played anything less than perfect golf it was
extremely penalizing, and I played far from perfect,” Mickelson
told reporters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
