The ruble appreciated against the
dollar for a second day and yields on  Russia ’s international
debt declined as gains by pro-bailout parties in Greek elections
eased concern the country will leave the euro.  The Russian currency added 0.2 percent to 32.45 per dollar
by the close in Moscow. The country’s $3 billion of Eurobonds
due July 2018 rose for the first day in three, lowering the
yield by 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 3.678
percent.  The New Democracy and Pasok parties won enough seats to
form a majority in the 300-member parliament yesterday,
according to an official projection, easing concern that  Greece 
would reject austerity measures needed to qualify for
international aid. Urals crude jumped 1.1 percent to $96.97 per
barrel.  “The rally’s just in line with the positive dynamic from
global markets, inspired by results in the Greek elections which
were better than they could have been,” Sergey Romanchuk, head
of foreign exchange and money markets at OAO AKB Metalinvest
Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail.  The ruble strengthened 0.6 percent to 40.8005 per euro and
0.4 percent to 36.2077 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket. Investors pared bets on the currency weakening,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.98 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 32.974 per
dollar on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
