The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 8 basis points to
180 basis points as of 10:50 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The gauge is set for its lowest close
since May 11, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan lost 6.5 basis points to 173.5 basis
points as of 8:53 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The index is headed for its lowest close
since May 8, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 6 basis points to 168 as
of 9:51 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The measure
is on track to close at its lowest level in more than two
months.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
