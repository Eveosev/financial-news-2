It is “extremely necessary” to
resume the United Nations observer mission in  Syria  on condition
of its full safety there, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a
 statement  on its website today.  The resumption of the mission’s work requires
“corresponding measures” from Syria’s government and
opposition forces to ensure the UN staff free and safe access to
various parts of the country, Alexander Lukashevich, the
ministry’s spokesman, said in the statement.  On June 17, the UN said its observer mission in Syria was
suspended because increasing violence posed “significant
risks” to its staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
