Armed guards on a commodity-carrying
ship in the  Gulf of Aden  fired at pirates, preventing them from
boarding the vessel, according to the International Maritime
Bureau, which tracks crime at sea.  The guards fired eight warning flares and followed up with
six warning shots after the pirates continued trying to get onto
the vessel, the London-based IMB said in a  notice  on its website
today. The pirates then abandoned the attack, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
