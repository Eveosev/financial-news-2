LGT Group, the  Princely House of
Liechtenstein ’s private bank, plans to double assets in  Asia  to
$24 billion in the next five years after adding staff and
investing in information technology.  LGT, fully owned since 1930 by the European principality’s
royal family, has $12 billion in assets in Asia and wants to
grow by 10 percent to 15 percent a year, Dominique Joye, chief
executive of the Singapore unit, said in an interview. The
bank’s global assets total $90 billion, he said.  The family aims to tap a rising level of personal wealth in
Asia, where economic growth is projected to outpace the rest of
the world this year. Joye said the bank, which employs 250
people in  Hong Kong  and Singapore, will add headcount in
marketing, without specifying a number.  LGT has been in Asia since 1986 with $8 billion in assets
currently booked in  Singapore , according to Joye.  Economic growth in Asia-Pacific will reach 6 percent this
year as the global expansion slows to 3.5 percent from 3.9
percent in 2011, the  International Monetary Fund  said April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
