Brazil  topped an index of best clean
energy opportunities among 26 Latin American and Caribbean
countries, the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-
American Development Bank and Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  They used 30 indicators to measure the ability of each
country to attract capital to expand economies based on
renewable types of energy, aggregated into scores from 0 to 5,
with 5 representing the best investing environment, the fund and
BNEF said in a statement today.  Brazil ranked the highest with its score of 2.6 indicating
“ample opportunity for improving conditions to attract more
capital for low-carbon and renewable energy capacity,”
according to the statement. The country was followed in the
rankings by  Nicaragua ,  Panama , Peru and Chile in that order.  Despite the region’s “extraordinary” renewable energy
resources and strong economic growth in recent years, the local
clean energy sector attracted less than 5 percent of an
estimated $280 billion invested worldwide last year, they said.  The fund and BNEF are launching “Climatescope,” the first
annual report, index and interactive web tool on the clean
energy market in the region, to be released June 19 during the
United Nations Conference on  Sustainable Development  in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
