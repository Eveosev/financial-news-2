The  European Central Bank  said
President  Mario Draghi  has urged European Union President Herman van Rompuy to quickly fill a vacant position on the ECB’s
Executive Board.  Draghi today sent a letter to van Rompuy stressing the
importance of filling the position opened by the departure of
Spain’s Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, whose eight-year term
concluded at the end of May, a spokesman for the Frankfurt-based
ECB said. The ECB needs all six board seats occupied to function
effectively, and politicians should accelerate the necessary
procedures so that the appointment can be made in the very near
future, Draghi said in the letter. He wrote a similar letter to
van Rompuy in December, the spokesman said.  European finance ministers, who meet later this week, have
delayed filling the ECB board seat after deadlocking over two
candidates in March: Luxembourg Central Bank Governor Yves Mersch and Spain’s Antonio Sainz de Vicuna, head of the ECB’s
legal department.  The appointment is part of a personnel package that the EU
decided to put off until after  France ’s presidential election,
won by  Francois Hollande  on May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
