Safira Energia , the Brazilian energy
trader, is negotiating a $30 million investment from a European
backer to build a wind farm as waning government incentives in
developed nations make renewable-power projects less profitable.  The company is talking to two funds and expects one of them
to provide the backing by early next year, Mikio Kawai Jr.,
director of the Barueri, Brazil-based company, said today in a
telephone interview. He didn’t name the funds.  European investors and utilities are seeking renewable-
energy projects to support in other regions after governments
including Germany and the U.K. trim subsidies, cutting into
profits, Kawai said.  “Projects here offer double-digit internal rates of
returns, which is far higher than what’s achievable in  Europe ,”
he said.  Safira Energia trades power and is starting to develop its
own generating assets. The company has plans to build as much as
500 megawatts of wind farms and 150 megawatts of solar projects
through 2020.  Power from its first planned wind farm in northeast  Brazil 
will be sold through government-organized auctions and to large
energy consumers on the free  electricity market , he said.  Electricity from renewable energy plants sells for about
150 reais ($72.72) a megawatt-hour on the free market, about 30
percent higher than through the auctions where more than two
thirds of the country’s power is contracted, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
