U.S. and European stocks extended
declines and the euro weakened further after German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said the new Greek government should not be
granted additional leeway on terms of its bailout.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent to
1,340.39 at 11:21 a.m. in  New York  and the Stoxx Europe 600
Index declined a similar amount. The euro weakened 0.6 percent
to $1.2567 after gaining for four straight days. Oil tumbled 1.6
percent to $82.71 a barrel.  “The imporant thing is that the new government sticks with
the commitments that have been made,” Merkel told reporters
today in the Mexican resort of Los Cabos before a Group of 20
summit. “There can be no loosening on the reform steps.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
