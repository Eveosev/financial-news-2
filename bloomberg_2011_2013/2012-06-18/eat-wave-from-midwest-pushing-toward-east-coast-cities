A wave of heat pushing in from the
Midwest will send temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32
Celsius) from Boston to Atlanta beginning June 20.  New York  may reach 97, 16 degrees above normal, on June 21
before temperatures start to fall back into the lower 80s and
upper 70s, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State College ,
Pennsylvania. The temperature in Washington is also expected to
peak that day at 97, 11 above normal, and another streak in the
90s is expected in the capitol the following week.  “We expect a rapid rise in cooling demand to come from the
surge in temperatures by midweek in the East,”  Bob Haas ,
weather operations manager for  MDA EarthSat Weather , said in a
statement from Gaithersburg,  Maryland . “Though short-lived,
this heat event is likely to surpass any so far this season.”  High temperatures may remain in the 90s in Richmond,
Virginia, and Charlotte,  North Carolina , into the first week of
July, according to AccuWeather. Richmond may have a high of 99
on June 30.  AccuWeather said high pressure will build across the Great
Lakes tomorrow, sending temperatures into the 90s from
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Louisville, Kentucky, then will shift
to the east the following day. Much of the Midwest has already
seen hot weather this year, while the East Coast has generally
been cooler.  Temperatures in Chicago today may reach 93, then decline to
as low as 70 by the middle of next week before heat builds
again, AccuWeather said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
