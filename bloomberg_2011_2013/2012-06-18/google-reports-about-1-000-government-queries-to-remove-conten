Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most popular Internet search engine, said it received more than
1,000 requests from governments to remove blog posts or videos
from its service in the last six months of 2011.  The queries included court orders as well as requests from
executives and police, and in some instances governments said
the content violated local laws against hate speech,
pornography, or defamation, Google said in a  report .  “Unfortunately, what we’ve seen over the past couple years
has been troubling, and today is no different,” the  Mountain
View , California-based company said on its blog, its fifth
release of statistics on removal  requests . “It’s alarming not
only because free expression is at risk, but because some of
these requests come from countries you might not suspect --
Western democracies not typically associated with censorship.”  For example, Google said Spanish regulators asked the
company to remove 270 search results that linked to blogs and
articles in newspapers referencing individuals and public
figures, including mayors and public prosecutors.  Google complied with an average of 65 percent of court
orders during the six-month period, and 47 percent of more
informal requests, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
