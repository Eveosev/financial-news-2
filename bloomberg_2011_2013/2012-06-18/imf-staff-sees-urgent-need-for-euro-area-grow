The 17-country euro region needs a
mix of in-depth reforms ranging from labor markets to pension
systems, in combination with short-term monetary and fiscal
support, according to International Monetary Fund staff.  “Fostering growth is always important; in the euro area it
has become urgent,” staff from the IMF European department said
in a report released today. “Attaining higher and more
sustainable growth, while containing risks along the path to
recovery, is central for a durable solution to the stress
observed in the last few years.”  The European financial crisis deepened and enveloped  Spain ,
raising pressure on German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  at a meeting
of world leaders in Los Cabos,  Mexico , to shift her stance on
measures to shield the global economy.  The IMF staff estimates that overhauling labor and product
markets as well as pensions could boost euro-area output by 4.5
percent over the next five years. At the same time, such
measures take time to show their impact, and risks to the
region’s stability also call for more immediate measures,
according to the report.  “It is important that this point not be dismissed as yet
another call for stimulus,” the staff wrote. “Rather, it is
consistent with fiscal consolidation proceeding rapidly where
market pressures are severe, and gradually elsewhere.”  “ Monetary policy  should also remain supportive,” they
added.  The report also recommends that nominal wages be restrained
in the south of  Europe  while the northern countries should let
wages rise somewhat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
