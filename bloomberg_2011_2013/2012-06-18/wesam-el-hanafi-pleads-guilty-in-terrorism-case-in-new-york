Wesam El-Hanafi, one of two men
accused in 2010 of providing support including money, computer
software and digital watches to al-Qaeda, pleaded guilty in
 Manhattan  federal court.  El-Hanafi, 37, today admitted to two criminal counts
charging him with providing material support to a foreign
terrorist organization and conspiracy to provide material
support.  Prosecutors claimed that El-Hanafi, a U.S. citizen born in
Brooklyn,  New York , traveled to Yemen in February 2008, where he
met with two members of al-Qaeda and swore an oath of allegiance
to the terrorist group. He received assignments and advised al-
Qaeda members on how to communicate secretly over the Internet.  “In July of 2009 I participated in a conversation with
others in which we discussed seeking out additional contacts
within al-Qaeda,” El-Hanafi said today at the plea hearing.  The government claimed that El-Hanafi recruited Sabirhan
Hasanoff, a  Brooklyn  man who holds joint U.S. and Australian
citizenship, into a “mini-terror cell.” Both men helped send
money to al-Qaeda, through couriers and wire transfers, the
government said. El-Hanafi and Hasanoff were both arrested in
the  United Arab Emirates  in 2010, according to the government.  U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said she will sentence El-
Hanafi Oct. 22. He faces as many as 20 years in prison.  Hasanoff pleaded guilty June 4. He’ll be sentenced July 23.  The case is U.S. v. El-Hanafi, 10-cr-00162, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
