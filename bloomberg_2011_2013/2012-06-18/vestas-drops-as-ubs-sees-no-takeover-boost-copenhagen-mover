Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , which
became the subject of takeover speculation after its market
value sank, fell from a nine-year low in Copenhagen trading
after UBS AG said potential acquirers may not pay more than the
company’s market price.  Vestas fell as much as 1.9 percent to 29.03, the lowest
since March 2003. The stock declined 0.23 krone, or 0.8 percent,
to 29.37 kroner at 11:15 a.m. in the Danish capital. Vestas’
market capitalization has dropped 96 percent since an August
2008 peak.  Chinese competitors have considered a bid for Vestas, the
world’s largest wind turbine maker,  Jyllands-Posten said  in
April. The newspaper didn’t identify its sources and Vestas
declined to comment at the time. Patrick Hummel, an analyst at
UBS, said today a possible bid may follow efforts by the Aarhus,
Denmark-based company to strengthen its capital through share
sales, diluting any future premium.  “Turn-around is far away,” Hummel said, cutting his price
estimate to 30 kroner a share from 60 kroner. He has a neutral
recommendation on the stock. “We see Vestas more than ever in a
very challenging situation, both in terms of earnings power and
balance sheet quality.”  Vestas reported on May 2 a first-quarter net loss of 162
million euros ($205 million), almost double its deficit a year
earlier and close to triple the estimated low in a Bloomberg
survey of eight analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
