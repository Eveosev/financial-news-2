Spanish bonds slid, propelling 10-
year yields to more than  7 percent , after yesterday’s Greek
election failed to convince investors that politicians will be
able to tame  Europe ’s financial woes.  Italian debt also fell and  German bunds  rose, reversing
earlier declines. Spain’s yields climbed to euro-era records as
a report today showed the nation’s bad loans increased in April.
The securities tumbled last week after the bloc’s fourth-largest
economy requested as much as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) of
aid on June 9 to support its banks. Greek bonds rose after pro-
bailout parties won enough seats to control parliament.  “The spotlight is now back on Spain,” said Christian Reicherter, a Frankfurt-based analyst at DZ Bank AG. “The
market is worried about the bad loans at the Spanish lenders,
which is pressuring the bonds. This goes to show that the
 European debt crisis  isn’t solved and we expect bunds to remain
well supported.”  Spain’s 10-year yield climbed as much as 41 basis points to
7.29 percent, the most since the euro was introduced in 1999. It
was 28 basis points higher at 7.16 percent at 4:44 p.m. London
time. The 5.85 percent security due January 2022 sank 1.835, or
18.35 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 91.085.  Five-year note yields climbed 42 basis points to 6.55
percent and rates on 30-year bonds jumped 22 basis points to
7.22 percent, also euro-era records.  Bad Loans  The yield on  Germany ’s 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark
government debt security, slid three basis points to 1.41
percent after jumping as much as 11 basis points to 1.55
percent. The nation’s one-year yield dropped below zero for the
first time since May 30 and the euro fell 0.5 percent to
$1.2571.  Spain became the fourth euro member to seek a bailout since
the debt crisis began almost three years ago when it asked for
aid to rescue its lenders earlier this month. The 7 percent
threshold on 10-year bonds helped trigger sovereign bailouts for
Greece, Ireland and  Portugal .  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending at Spain’s
financial institutions jumped to 8.72 percent in April from 8.37
percent in March, the Bank of Spain said on its website.  “Seven percent for Spain is not unsustainable, it is
uncomfortable,”  Holger Schmieding , chief economist at Berenberg
Bank, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The
Pulse” with  Maryam Nemazee . “The risk is always that it
doesn’t stop at 7 percent -- that it goes to 8 and 9 percent and
then we would have a full-blown panic.”  Yield Premium  The extra yield investors demand to hold the Spanish
securities instead of German bunds expanded to as much as 589
basis points, or 5.89 percentage points, today, the most since
the euro’s start.  The difference between the bid yield and offer yield on 10-
year Spanish bonds, an indicator of market liquidity, widened to
more than 10 basis points, the most in at least 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, before narrowing to
nine basis points. The bid-offer spread was half of one basis
point for German securities of similar maturity.  Spain ’s two-year notes also slumped, pushing the rate on
the securities up as much as 60 basis points to 5.59 percent,
the most since Nov. 30. The nation’s Treasury plans to sell as
much as 2 billion euros of debt due in 2014, 2015 and 2017 on
June 21. It will sell up to 3 billion euros of 364-day and 539-
day Treasury bills tomorrow.  Greek Coalition  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed as much as 25 basis points to
6.17 percent. The spread over bunds widened to 478 basis points.  Spanish bonds were the most volatile in euro-area markets,
as measured by 10-year yields, the two-, 10-year yield spread
and credit-default swaps.  The New Democracy party won 129 seats in  Greece ’s election,
enough to put together a majority coalition with third-placed
Pasok, according to final results. Leader Antonis Samaras now
begins his second bid in six weeks to build a coalition as euro-
area finance chiefs pressure him to form a government that will
keep bailout aid flowing.  European officials indicated a willingness to ease the
terms of rescue loans as long as Greece, with just weeks of cash
in the bank, recommits to their austerity demands. German
Chancellor Angela Merkel today said there could be no leeway on
Greece’s commitments. She spoke with reporters in Los Cabos,
 Mexico , as Group of 20 leaders gathered for a summit.  Ratings Risk  Greece’s 2 percent security due February 2023 advanced for
a fourth day, with the yield sliding 83 basis points to 26.30
percent.  Fitch Ratings  said the election results remove the
immediate risk of euro-zone rating cuts. Fitch said on May 17 it
would place all of the region’s sovereigns on Rating Watch
Negative following the weekend poll if the risk of a Greek exit
from the common currency was probable in the near term.  Officials from the G-20 will discuss a mix of measures to
secure the global recovery that will include  deficit reduction 
for some countries and pledges for additional stimulus by others
with sounder finances, a Canadian official said.  Host President  Felipe Calderon  said yesterday that world
leaders will agree to boost the $430 billion firewall the
 International Monetary Fund  announced in April.  German bunds handed investors a return of 3.1 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds have gained 6.9 percent and Spanish debt has lost 6
percent, the indexes show.  Since the last day of trading before Greece’s first
election on May 6, German securities have gained 1.3 percent,
while Spanish bonds have declined 5.4 percent and Italian
securities have dropped 3 percent.  Italian government bond futures contracts expiring in
September fell 0.9 percent to 98.33, extending last week’s 1.1
percent drop.  A break under 98.18, which is the midpoint of the recent
rally from 96.21 to 100.15, will “trigger a resumption of the
bearish trade” and “retest” the low of 96.21 reached on June
14,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy in
 London  at UBS AG in London, wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
