The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.1 percent to 583.40 at 5:20 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials gained
0.2 percent to 1432.318.  CRUDE OIL  Oil dropped from the highest level in a week as concern
that Europe’s debt crisis will reduce demand outweighed optimism
spurred by elections in  Greece .  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures extended last week’s 7.3 percent
advance in New York as Greek elections eased concern that the
country would leave the euro, threatening global economic
growth.  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore fuel oil’s premium to Dubai crude narrowed to 19
cents a barrel from $1.29 on June 15, PVM data showed. The fuel
traded above crude for a fifth day, signaling refiners are
making profits from the residue.  Fuel oil  typically trades at a
discount to crude.  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures increased $7.89, or 27 percent, to $37.50 a metric ton,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on PVM data. The
spread, a measure of refining profitability from the fuel, has
widened for a third day.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold dropped for the first time in seven days in  London  as
official projections showed pro-bailout parties won enough seats
to control Greece’s parliament, curbing demand for a protection
of wealth.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$1,617.90 an ounce by 9:07 a.m. in London. August-delivery
futures were 0.6 percent lower at $1,618.50 on the Comex in  New
York .  BASE METALS  Copper extended last week’s advance to the highest level in
more than two weeks as gains by pro-bailout parties in Greek
elections eased concern the country would leave the euro.  The metal rose as much as 1.4 percent to $7,615 a metric
ton, the highest price since May 30, on the London Metal
Exchange and traded at $7,558.25 by 3:15 p.m. in Singapore.
Copper climbed 3 percent last week, the first gain in seven.
Futures gained 0.9 percent to $3.421 a pound on the Comex.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Rubber jumped to the highest level since June 1 as parties
that support Greece’s bailout won enough seats to control
parliament, easing concern that the nation may quit the euro and
worsen  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The November-delivery contract climbed as much as 3.9
percent, the biggest gain since June 7, to 257.4 yen a kilogram
($3,246 a metric ton) before settling at 255.6 yen on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures extended last week’s 4.3 percent
advance, the first increase in six weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
