Citrix Systems Inc., (CTXS)  maker of
software that lets people access work files from home, was told
to pay a  Maryland  company $10 million for infringing patented
technology for virtual-private networks.  A federal jury in Marshall,  Texas , today said Citrix
infringed one of two patents owned by closely held SSL Services
LLC of Potomac, Maryland.  The suit, filed in 2008, is over a way to communicate
between computers over a secure network. The jury said the
Access Gateway and NetScaler products infringed one patent,
Citrixâ€™s GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting and GoToAssist products were
cleared of infringing a second SSL patent.  Citrix, which reported $2.2 billion in sales last year,
uses cloud networking through NetScaler and Access Gateway to
provide lower-cost data centers.  The SSL patents relate to an authentication and encryption
program. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Citrix argued that it
uses a different method of sending information than what is
covered by the two patents.  Lawyers for both sides declined to comment on the verdict
outside the courtroom.  The case is SSL Services LLC v. Citrix Systems Inc.,
08cv158, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
(Marshall).  To contact the reporter on this story:
