U.K. commercial real estate values
fell for the seventh straight month in May as Britain’s economy
weakened, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses
declined 0.5 percent from April, led by retail properties, IPD
said in a statement today. Total return, which combines the
change in real-estate values and rental income, was zero for
May, compared with 0.2 percent in April.  “Total return has fallen to its lowest level since June
2009, which is bleak reading for an industry still struggling
with refinancing,” Phil Tily, a managing director at London-
based IPD, said in the statement. Total return over the 12
months through May was 5.4 percent.  The worsening sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe  is casting a
“long shadow” over Britain’s economy,  Bank of England  Governor
 Mervyn King  said last week. The slowdown has caused shops to
close and business owners to defer decisions on leasing office
buildings and warehouses, adversely affecting returns for
investors.  The value of office properties leased to companies in the
City of  London  financial district rose 0.9 percent and West End
properties in the U.K. capital rose 0.3 percent in May.  “The fact that London can continue to grow, even in such
difficult times, lends cheer to an otherwise challenged
marketplace,” Tily said.  The IPD index was compiled from appraisals of 3,602
properties worth 33.4 billion pounds ($52 billion) at the end of
May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
