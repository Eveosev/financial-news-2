Failure to invest more in broadband
and other telecommunications infrastructure risks undermining
 Europe ’s economy, the European Union said.  European citizens and businesses “are generating enough
digital demand to put Europe into sustainable economic growth,
but failure to supply enough fast internet, online content,
research and relevant skills is  undermining  this potential,”
the EU said today in a report on the digital economy. “Nearly
half of the  labor force  is not confident their computer and
internet skills are sufficient in this labor market,” it said.  Commercial investments in telecommunications research is
declining while  government spending  in this area “is well below
the 6 percent annual growth needed to double public investment
by 2020, according to the report.  “Europeans are hungry for digital technologies and more
digital choices, but governments and industry are not keeping up
with them,” EU Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in
the report. “We are shooting ourselves in the foot by under-
investing.”  Costs for consumers of mobile services declined, according
to the report, with the average revenue per user declining to
221 euros ($279) in 2010 from 244 euros in 2009. Mobile
termination rates, the fees networks charge other networks for
delivering mobile voice calls, went down to 3.87 cents per
minute last year from 5.47 cents per minute in 2010, the report
showed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
