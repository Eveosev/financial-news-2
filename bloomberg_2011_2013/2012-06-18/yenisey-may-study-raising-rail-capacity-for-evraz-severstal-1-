Yenisey Industrial Co. may consider
more than doubling capacity of a rail project in  Russia â€™s Tyva
region so  Evraz Plc (EVR)  and OAO Severstal can use it to ship coal.  Yenisey may boost capacity to 37 million metric tons a year
from a planned 15 million tons, with the state-backed railroad
development scheduled to be completed by 2016, shareholder and
Chief Executive Officer Ruslan Baisarov told reporters today.  The company will spend 93.5 billion rubles ($2.9 billion)
on construction and is in talks with Evraz and Severstal about
their participation, Baisarov said.  Separately, Sberbank may be offered 5 percent to 7 percent
in Yenisey Industrial in exchange for loans, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
