Pan Africa Insurance Holdings Ltd. (PAIL) ,
the Kenyan unit of South African insurer  Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , jumped to
almost a year’s high on bets Hubris Holding Ltd. will boost its
stake in the company.  The  shares  rose 9 percent to 39.50 shillings at the close
in Nairobi, the strongest level since July 11. The volume of
shares traded surged to more than six times the stock’s three-
month average, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  “The stock is being actively traded on anticipation that
Sanlam’s decision to raise its stake is likely to happen in the
near future,” Francis Mwangi, an analyst at Standard Investment
Bank Ltd. in Nairobi, said by phone. “We expect the stake to
rise by 10 percent.”  Hubris Holding, a unit of Sanlam, said in a statement April
28 it planned to acquire additional stake.  Sonja Conradie, a member of Sanlam’s external
communications team, didn’t immediately respond to a message
left on her mobile phone or to e-mailed questions. Kennedy
Irungu, Sanlam Kenya portfolio manager, indicated he was not in
a position to comment about the transaction, when contacted by
phone today.  Sanlam is  South Africa ’s largest insurer by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
