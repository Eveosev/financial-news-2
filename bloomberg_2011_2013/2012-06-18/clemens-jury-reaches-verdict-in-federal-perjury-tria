A jury has reached a verdict in the
obstruction trial of former  New York  Yankees pitcher  Roger Clemens  almost a week after beginning deliberations in a
Washington courthouse.  Last week, the panel of eight women and four men were urged
both by lawyers for Clemens and prosecutors to use common sense
when deciding whether he intentionally lied to Congress to cover
up his use of steroids and human growth hormone.  Before the jury began discussions, federal prosecutors said
in closing arguments that Clemens gave false testimony about
using performance-enhancing drugs to safeguard his image as one
of Major League Baseball’s best pitchers.  “Why? So as not to tarnish his name, that Clemens brand we
heard about,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Gilberto Guerrero said at
the time. “He had to keep the secret safe -- the one he and
 Brian McNamee  knew.”  The case is U.S. v. Clemens, 1:10-cr-00223, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
