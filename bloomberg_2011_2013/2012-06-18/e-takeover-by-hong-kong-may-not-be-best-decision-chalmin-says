The London Metal Exchange’s proposed
takeover by the Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. may not be
the best move for “the sake of the markets,” said  Philippe
Chalmin , an economics professor at the University of Paris-
Dauphine and adviser to the French government. He made the
following comments in a phone call from Paris on June 16.  “For the sake of the markets, I don’t think it’s a good
decision. The Hong Kong Exchanges has no experience in the
 commodities markets . It makes sense for the Chinese to get
control of the markets. It makes sense for the LME because they
would have a basis to expand their warehouse network. But the
LME could easily have done a joint venture with the Shanghai
Exchange instead. The China market right now is limited to
Chinese participants. It’s relatively protected. To put the LME
under the  Hong Kong  Exchanges control when it has no experience
in the commodities market I don’t think it’s a good idea. The
LME has a very important role to price six base metals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
