Canadian natural gas rose as above-
normal temperatures were predicted for the U.S. West and South
into next month, increasing the likelihood of demand for the
power-plant fuel to help run air conditioners.  July gas in  Alberta  advanced 7.7 percent after MDA
Information Systems Inc., of Gaithersburg, Maryland, predicted
temperatures 3 degrees Fahrenheit (2 Celsius) to 14 degrees
warmer than usual in the Rockies and southern U.S. from June 23
to July 2.  “The core of the heat here will be focused over the
Rockies, where several days of ‘much-aboves’ appear likely,”
Eric Wertz, a meteorologist at MDA, wrote in a note to clients
today. “Some of this warmth will likely extend southeastward
across the Plains and into the Southeast.”  Alberta gas for July delivery gained 14.5 cents to C$2.035
a gigajoule ($1.88 per million British thermal units) as of 4:35
p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian internet market. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system. NGX gas
is down 23 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 16.8 cents to settle at $2.635 per million Btu.  The high for Denver on June 23 will be 97 degrees
Fahrenheit, 12 above normal, said Accuweather.com of  State
College , Pennsylvania. Temperatures in parts of  Virginia  and
 North Carolina  may be above 90 from June 20 through the first of
July.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
8.34 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $2.5338 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas advanced 6.67 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.2148
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices gained 2.91 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.3226.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet at 4:30 p.m.  New York  time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.3 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.97 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 692 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.86 billion cubic feet today, or 73 percent
of normal capacity of 2.55 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.01
billion cubic feet at 3:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
