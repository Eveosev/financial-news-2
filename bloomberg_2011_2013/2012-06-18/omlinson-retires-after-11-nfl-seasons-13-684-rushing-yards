LaDainian Tomlinson retired from the
 National Football League  today, ending an 11-year career in
which he set a record for touchdowns in a season and compiled
the fifth-most rushing yards in history.  Tomlinson, who spent the past two seasons with the  New York
Jets  after nine years with the  San Diego Chargers , re-signed
with the Chargers today and then announced the end of his
playing career during a news conference. Tomlinson said he went
“back and forth” for months on whether to retire.  “When I finally made the decision to retire, I knew it was
the right thing to do,” Tomlinson said. “I’m going to be 33
years old and never had a serious concussion or anything like
that. At this point, I’m taking a big risk going back out there,
possibly blowing my knee out. Now, I’m walking around good and
will be for the rest of my life.”  The 32-year-old Tomlinson rushed for 12,490 yards while
playing for the Chargers, and his  career total  trails only
 Emmitt Smith , Walter Payton,  Barry Sanders  and  Curtis Martin .
His  145 rushing touchdowns  are second to Smith and his  31
touchdowns  scored during the 2006 season remains a record.  “Some guys you watch play and say, ’I wonder if he will
wind up in the Hall of Fame?’ LT answered that question a long
time ago,” Chargers General Manager A.J. Smith said. “He is
one of the greatest and most versatile running backs to ever
play the game.”  Rushing Stats  Tomlinson rushed for more than 1,100 yards in each of his
first eight NFL seasons with the Chargers, while catching more
than 50 passes out of the backfield each year. He was released
after rushing for 730 yards and averaging a career-worst 3.3
yards a carry during the 2009 season.  Tomlinson then joined Shonn Greene in the Jets’ backfield
and rushed for 914 yards in 2010 to help New York reach the
American Football Conference’s championship game. He had an even
more limited role last year, when he rushed for 280 yards and
one touchdown on 75 carries, and had said at the end of the
season that he might retire.  “His humility and work ethic made it clear why he will be
remembered as one of the game’s best players,” Jets owner  Woody Johnson  said in a statement. “Without question, his next stop
will be the Pro Football Hall of Fame.”  A three-time All-Pro and five-time Pro Bowl selection,
Tomlinson set an NFL record with 28 rushing touchdowns in 2006,
breaking the record of 27 shared by Priest Holmes and Shaun Alexander. His 31 touchdowns that year are three better than the
28 Alexander scored in 2005 and his 186 points scored broke the
single-season mark of 176 set by Paul Hornung in 1960.  Tomlinson leaves the NFL with 162 career touchdowns, third
all-time behind  Jerry Rice  (208) and Smith (175).  To contact the reporter on this story:
