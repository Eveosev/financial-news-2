Nigeria ’s naira appreciated for the
first time in four days as the central bank sold dollars and
gains by pro-bailout parties in Greek elections boosted demand
for riskier assets.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer gained 0.5
percent to 163.73 per dollar on the  interbank market  at close in
Lagos, the most since June 6. The advance pared this year’s
decline to 0.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $400 million at a foreign-
currency auction today, matching the amount sold on June 13,
which was the most since Feb. 8, at 155.90 naira per dollar, the
Abuja-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. Emerging-market
stocks advanced after  Greece ’s New Democracy and Pasok parties
won enough seats in parliament to forge a majority government,
reducing concern the country would abandon the euro.  “The positive election outcome in Greece will ease global
 risk aversion ,” Adedayo Idowu, a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva
Capital Management Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed note to clients
today. This may lead to increased inflows of foreign funds into
Nigeria, he wrote.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due 2018 rose one
basis point to 15.58 percent, according to the June 15 data on
the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 increased two basis
points to 5.594 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.9275 per dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
