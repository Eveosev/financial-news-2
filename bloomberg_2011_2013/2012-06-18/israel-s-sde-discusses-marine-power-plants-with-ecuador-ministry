SDE Energy Ltd. , an Israeli marine-
technology developer, is in talks with Ecuador’s Ministry of
Electricity and  Renewable Energy  to develop several power
projects as the nation seeks to cut its use of fossil fuels.  The company plans to develop facilities at the Galapagos
Islands and a 15-megawatt facility near the mainland, by the
town of Jaramijo, that may be expanded to 100 megawatts, Tel
Aviv-based SDE Energy said today in an e-mailed statement.  Ecuador is pushing for more production of energy from
renewable sources to reduce its dependence on oil, according to
the statement.  SDE is seeking investors to fund 40 percent of the
project’s cost, which wasn’t disclosed, the company said.
Ecuador may provide the remaining funds and purchase the
electricity for a period of 15 years.  The South American nation pays producers of clean energy as
much as $400 a megawatt-hour, according to the statement.
Production costs for SDE’s power may be as low as $20 a megawatt
hour making it cheaper than other renewable-energy technologies
like wind farms.  SDE’s power plants use ocean swells to produce hydraulic
pressure, which is then transformed into electricity, according
to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
