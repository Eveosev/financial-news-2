Germany ’s  Bundesbank  said there is
greater uncertainty over the country’s economic outlook as a
consequence of the euro region’s debt crisis.  “It remains to be seen to what extent the recent
intensification of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area
and signs of a global slowdown further damp prospects for the
German economy,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its
monthly report published today. “Overall, recent indicators
suggest that economic momentum could pick up gradually in the
second half of the year after a weaker spring quarter.”  Since posting growth of 0.5 percent in the first quarter,
Germany’s economy has cooled. Factory orders dropped the most in
five months in April, industrial production declined and
business confidence fell to the lowest level in six months in
May. Still, the Bundesbank on June 8 lifted its 2012 growth
forecast to 1 percent and said  Europe ’s largest economy may
expand 1.6 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
