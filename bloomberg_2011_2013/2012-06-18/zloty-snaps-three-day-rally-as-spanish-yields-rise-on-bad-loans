The Polish zloty weakened the most
in a week as record-high Spanish bond yields reflected concern
the euro zone’s debt crisis may not be contained in  Greece ,
hurting the riskier emerging-market assets.  The zloty depreciated 0.7 percent to 4.2777 per euro as of
4:27 p.m. in Warsaw, snapping a three-day rally and recording
the steepest loss among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Spain ’s 10-year yields climbed to more than 7 percent for
the first time since the euro’s creation today as a report today
showed the nation’s bad loans increased in April. The New
Democracy party won 129 seats in Greece’s election, enough to
put together a majority coalition with third-placed Pasok,
according to final results. Leader Antonis Samaras now begins
his second bid in six weeks to build a coalition as euro-area
finance chiefs pressure him to form a government that will keep
bailout aid flowing. Poland relies on the euro area for 55
percent of its exports, according to the statistics office.  “There is a clear underperfomance in the zloty today,”
 Luis Costa , an emerging-market strategist at Citigroup Inc.
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “The steady advance in
Spanish yields continues to hamper a lot of progress in”
central and east European currencies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
