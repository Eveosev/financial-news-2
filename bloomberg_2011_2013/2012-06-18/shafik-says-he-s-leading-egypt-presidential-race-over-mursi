Egyptian presidential candidate
Ahmed Shafik said he’s leading the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed
Mursi in the vote count after polls closed yesterday.  The Shafik campaign said on its Facebook page that the
candidate, a former air force commander who served as premier
under ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , has between 51.5 percent
and 52 percent of the vote. Mursi’s campaign earlier said it has
won about 52 percent of the vote, based on a preliminary count.
Final results are due on June 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
