Television ratings for NBC’s
broadcast of the final round of golf’s  U.S. Open  rose 29 percent
from a year earlier as Webb Simpson captured his first major
championship, with the tournament ending during prime time on
the U.S. East Coast.  The 6 1/2-hour coverage of the tournament yesterday at San
Francisco’s Olympic Club was seen on the  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  network
in 6.6 percent of homes in the top 56 U.S. television markets,
Adam Freifeld, a spokesman for the network, said in an e-mail.
That’s 29 percent higher than the 5.1 rating the network drew
when Rory McIlroy won the event last year at Congressional
Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland. The 2011 tournament ended
around 7:30 p.m. Eastern time.  The broadcast ratings this year increased each half-hour
between 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. New York time, peaking at 8.1 as
former U.S. Open winners Graeme McDowell and  Jim Furyk  failed to
birdie the 18th hole and force a playoff, sealing Simpson’s
victory.  The prime-time finish put the year’s second golf major in
competition with Game 3 of the National Basketball Association
Finals, which generated a 10.4 big-market rating on  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) ’s ABC, the network said in a news release.  LeBron James scored 29 points and Dwyane Wade added 25 as
the Miami Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 91-85 in Miami,
taking a 2-1 advantage in the best-of-seven series.  Through three games, the matchup is the highest rated since
2004 and second highest ever on ABC, the network said, citing
 Nielsen Holdings NV. (NLSN)  The series is averaging an 11.3 big-market
rating, up 5 percent from 10.8 last year, when the Heat lost to
the  Dallas Mavericks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
