Lynas Corp. (LYC) , the Australian company
building the world’s largest rare earths refinery in  Malaysia ,
rose the most in three weeks in Sydney after the Southeast Asian
nation rejected a bid to cancel its license.  Lynas advanced as much as 15 percent to A$1.01, the biggest
gain since May 28. The shares were 10 percent higher at 97 cents
at 11:13 a.m. local time,  compared  with a 1.6 percent gain for
 Australia ’s benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index. (AS51)   Malaysia’s minister of innovation, science and technology
rejected an appeal by local residents against Lynas’s temporary
operating permit on June 15, while imposing extra conditions on
the plant. The permit granted in February, subject to
conditions, has been held up due to appeals by protesters to
government and in court.  “Lynas has passed every review it has been subject to, and
we now look forward to the issuance” of the license, Executive
Chairman Nicholas Curtis said today in a statement.  Rare earths, 17 chemically similar elements, are used in
Apple Inc.’s iPod music players, flat-screen televisions,
magnets and hybrid cars. Lynas’s plant in the eastern state of
Pahang would be capable of processing 22,000 metric tons a year
should a second phase be completed, it said in November.  Lynas can satisfy the new conditions announced by the
Malaysian government, the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
