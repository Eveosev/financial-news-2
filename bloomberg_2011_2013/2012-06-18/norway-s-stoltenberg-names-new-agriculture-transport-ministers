Norwegian Prime Minister Jens
Stoltenberg named new agriculture and transport ministers.  Marit Arnstad was named transport minister, taking over
from Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa, while Trygve Slagsvold Vedum will
replace Lars Peder Brekk at the Agriculture and Food Ministry,
the government said today in a statement.  Stoltenberg’s coalition of the Labor, Socialist Left and
Center parties in 2009 became the first Norwegian government to
be reelected in 16 years after guiding the nation out of a
recession by increasing spending.  Arnstad, 50, is a Center Party member and was oil minister
from 1997 to 2000. Vedum, 33, also of the Center Party, has been
a member of parliament since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
