Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said European countries need to press ahead with deeper
integration in order to deal with the region’s crisis on an
“ongoing” basis.  Speaking at an event on the sidelines of the Group of 20
summit in Los Cabos,  Mexico , Harper said that while the crisis
facing the 17 nations who share the euro is “severe,” the
region has the means to tackle the crisis.  Harper said he is seeking “clear commitments that they are
prepared to take all of the actions, all of the necessary
actions, that are within their capacity to deal with these
problems.” Europe also needs to do “the structural changes
necessary to create a genuine financial union in  Europe  that can
deal with these problems on an ongoing basis,” he told
reporters.  Boosting economic growth should be the focus of every G-20
leader, Harper said, adding that promoting trade is part of
Canada’s pro-growth agenda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
