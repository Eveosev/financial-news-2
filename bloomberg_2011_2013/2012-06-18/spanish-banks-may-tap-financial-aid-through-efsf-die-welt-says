Spain ’s distressed banks may gain
financial help from the euro-area’s temporary rescue fund as
political leaders consider ways to expand the availability of
bailout resources, the  Die Welt  reported, citing no one.  Tapping the European Financial Stability Facility to help
Spain before the fund is superseded by the permanent European
Stability Mechanism next month would in effect widen bailout
finance, the German newspaper said.  Regarding the feasibility of such a proposal, Germany’s
 Finance Ministry  told Die Welt that current arrangements mean
aid of as much as 100 billion euros ($127 billion) for Spain
must be booked as obligations in the new ESM’s accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
