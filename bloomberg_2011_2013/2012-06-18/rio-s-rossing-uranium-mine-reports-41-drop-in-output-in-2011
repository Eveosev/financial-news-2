Rio Tinto Plc’s (RIO)  Rossing uranium mine
said output declined 41 percent to 2,148 metric tons in 2011
from a year earlier, missing its target, as above-average
rainfall at the start of the year cut production.  Low grades, low crushing-plant availability, a planned two-
week maintenance shutdown and industrial action during the
second half of the year also curbed output, the company said in
a statement handed to reporters today in Windhoek, Namibia’s
capital. The output target was 3,100 tons for the year, External
Affairs Manager Jerome Mutumba said Nov. 28.  Rossing, which posted a loss of 471 million Namibian
dollars ($57 million) for the year, expects to return to
profitability in 2014, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
