CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
snapped six days of declines, leading gains for the countryâ€™s
shares after pro-bailout parties won Greek general elections,
boosting demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The stock climbed as much as 1.7 percent and traded up 1.4
percent to 733 koruna by 9:38 a.m. in Prague, after a 4 percent
drop in the previous six sessions. The  PX (PX)  index of 14 equities,
where CEZ has a 21 percent weighting, added 0.78 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
