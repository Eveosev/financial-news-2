Peru ’s sol rose to a one-month high
as concern eased that Greece may be forced out of the euro zone,
spurring demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.6455 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close in Lima, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. It
was the strongest level since May 8.  “The market has taken the result of the elections in
Greece positively, said Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru in Lima. “The sol has basically
recovered most of its losses so the pace of appreciation should
slow. The currency will probably consolidate around 2.64 this
week.”  Peru’s central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot
market  today, it said on its website.  Emerging market stocks gained after Greece’s New Democracy
and Pasok parties won enough seats in parliament to forge a
majority government, easing concern the country was headed for
an exit from the 17-nation monetary union.  The sol weakened 2.7 percent last month as concern Europe’s
debt crisis is deepening curtailed exports and foreign
investments to  emerging markets .  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due in August 2020 decreased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.09 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price advanced 0.22 centimo to 118.08 centimos
per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
