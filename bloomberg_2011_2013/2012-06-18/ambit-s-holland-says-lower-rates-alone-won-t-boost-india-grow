Andrew Holland, chief executive
officer at Ambit Capital Pvt., comments on the outlook for
interest rates after the  Reserve Bank  of India unexpectedly kept
rates unchanged today.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left the benchmark repurchase
rate at 8 percent. The decision contrasts with rate cuts in
Brazil and  China  in the past three weeks. The central bank’s
next scheduled meeting is on July 31.  Holland spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  “The market was hoping for a rate cut given the slowing
growth. But with inflation remaining high and the monsoon below
expectations, the bank probably wants to keep the powder dry at
the moment.  ‘‘The move shows that it has thrown the ball back to the
government to undo bottlenecks and go ahead with reforms. The
RBI can’t do it all. Low  interest rates  cannot boost growth and
you’ll have to only look at the European countries to see that.
Growth needs confidence. And there’s no confidence right now.  ‘‘It’s more likely than not that the RBI will cut rates in
July. But a month is a long time. And if by then nothing’s
really changed in terms of reforms and the monsoon is not very
good, I would expect a rate cut of at least 0.25 percent.  ‘‘Though I don’t think rate cuts alone will help growth.
You can’t buy confidence with rate cuts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
