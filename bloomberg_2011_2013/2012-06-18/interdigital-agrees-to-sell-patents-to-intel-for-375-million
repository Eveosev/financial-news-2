InterDigital Inc., the wireless-
technology company that tried to find a buyer for itself, surged
the most in 11 months after agreeing to sell about 1,700 patents
to  Intel Corp. (INTC)  for $375 million.  The shares climbed 27 percent to $29.08 at the close for
the biggest increase since July 20. The  stock  had dropped 47
percent this year through June 15.  The transaction involves patents for 3G and LTE, or long-
term evolution, wireless, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based
InterDigital and Santa Clara, California-based Intel said today
in a statement. Separately, InterDigital said it would double
its existing share repurchase program to $200 million.  InterDigital had said in July that it hired  Evercore
Partners Inc. (EVR)  and  Barclays Capital  to explore a possible sale of
the company, seeking to capitalize on a boom in demand for
patents. InterDigital’s patents cover technology used to
transfer information wirelessly.  “This transaction, which involves a small portion of our
overall patent portfolio, marks an important milestone of
InterDigital’s stated strategy of expanding the monetization of
its large and growing intellectual property portfolio,” said
Scott McQuilkin, senior executive vice president for strategy
and finance at InterDigital, in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
