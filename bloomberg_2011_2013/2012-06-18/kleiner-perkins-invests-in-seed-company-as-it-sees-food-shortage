Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers,
the U.S. venture capital firm that provided startup financing to
Amazon.com Inc. and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , is investing in a seed company
as it forecasts food will become a “global problem of huge
dimensions” over the next decade.  “We just invested in a seed company that is essentially
collecting seeds from around the world,” Randy Komisar, a
partner at Kleiner Perkins, said in an interview from Lisbon
today.  “One of the biggest problems we see in the horizon on the
next 10 years is food,” he said. “If you identify a problem
like food, you have to begin to start to experiment with
solutions.”  Komisar declined to provide the name of the seed company as
the deal has not been made public yet.  With 15 funds under management valued at “several
billion” dollars,  Kleiner Perkins  is also investing in water
companies as a lack of water resources in the “next few years”
may become a problem, Komisar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
