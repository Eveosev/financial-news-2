Mauritius’s rupee weakened the most
more than seven months as the central bank bought dollars to
increase its reserves, improving the coverage for imports.  The currency of the Indian Ocean island nation depreciated
1.2 percent to 30.5750 per dollar by 2:24 p.m. in Port Louis,
the biggest retreat since Nov. 1 on a closing basis. The rupee
extended its decline to 4 percent this year, becoming the
fourth-worst African performer against the U.S currency after
Gambia’s dalasi,  Nigeria ’s naira and  Ghana ’s new cedi.  The Bank of Mauritius plans to buy as much as $900 million
to increase the imports’ coverage from 4 1/2 months to 6 months,
according to Governor Rundheersing Bheenick. For the week
through June 15, the Port Louis-based central bank bought $25.1
million from the domestic market, 62 percent more than it did in
the previous week, the bank said in  statement  on its website.  “The decision to increase the reserves is legitimate,”
Oumesh Mungroo, a treasurer at Barclays Plc’s Mauritian unit,
said in a phone interview from Ebene today. “It’s a substantial
amount.”  The process, known as Operation Reserves Reconstitution,
“have already started,” Jaywant Pandoo, the head of markets at
the central bank, said in an e-mailed response to queries after
the market closed June 15. The rebuilding of reserves “will
largely depend on the capacity of the market to supply,” he
said.  Against the euro, currency of its main trading partner, the
rupee weakened 2.1 percent to 38.6328 today, widening its
decline this month to 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
