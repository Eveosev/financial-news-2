Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
against New York futures as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  resumed routine
operations at the Lake Charles refinery in Louisiana after a
power loss.  A partial electrical outage at the 240,000-barrel-a-day
plant occurred on June 16, according to a National Response
Center filing.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) â€™s Beaumont refinery in Texas
flared gases because of operating conditions within the plant.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.5 cent to 7.88 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:47 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery dropped
3.58 cents to $2.5822 a gallon.  The Beaumont refinery can process 345,000 barrels of crude
a day. Kathleen Jackson, an Exxon spokeswoman in Beaumont,
declined to comment on the incident.  The same gasoline in  New York  Harbor weakened 0.63 cent to
a discount of 3.88 cents a gallon to futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
