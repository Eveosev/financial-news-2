Solar manufacturers led by LDK Solar
Co. and  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  rose to the highest in a month after
Japan approved subsidies that will encourage at least $9.6
billion in new installations in the country.  The  Bloomberg Industries Global Large Solar Energy Index (BISOLAR)  of
17 companies rose 2 percent to $12.77 at the close in New York,
the highest since May 17.  Japan announced prices today for solar electricity that are
triple what industrial users pay for conventional power. The
subsidy is expected to spur 3.2 gigawatts of new installations,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The output is roughly
equivalent to three nuclear reactors.  Japan “definitely is one bright market in the solar
industry,” Ben Kallo, research analyst at Robert W Baird & Co.
in  San Francisco , said in an interview today.  American depositary receipts for Xinyu, China-based LDK
climbed 1.8 percent to $2.21, each ADR is worth one ordinary
share. Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar, the world’s largest
maker of thin-film panels, gained 3.7 percent to $14.47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
