A proposal by venture capitalist and
Conservative Party donor Adrian Beecroft that would permit
employers to dismiss staff at will is about to be rejected by
the U.K. coalition government after businesses were divided over
support for the plan, the Financial Times reported.  In 135 responses to a government request for comment from
business, 38 percent supported the plan, 32 percent were against
it and 30 percent were uncertain, the FT said, citing Employment
Relations Minister Norman Lamb.  Lamb said of the Beecroft plan that at present he doesn’t
“see the case for it,” according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
