Mexican bond yields fell to a record
low as investors sought refuge for their money outside of  Europe 
after  Spain ’s borrowing costs rose to a euro-era high.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024
dropped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 5.92
percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest closing level since
the securities were issued in January 2005. The price increased
0.93 centavo to 135.98 centavos per peso. The peso appreciated
0.7 percent to 13.8284 per dollar.  The Latin American nation’s securities rallied after a jump
in bad Spanish loans sent yields on its  10-year bond  above 7
percent for the first time since Europe’s currency was
introduced in 1999. The correlation in performance between
Mexican peso bonds and U.S. Treasuries, considered the world’s
safest debt, turned positive this month for the first time since
November.  “The driver continues to be the overall European saga of
potential insolvency on the sovereign side,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of Latin America fixed-income research at
IdeaGlobal in  New York .  The 120-day correlation coefficient between 10-year Mexican
 government bonds  and similar-maturity Treasuries is 0.08. A
reading of 1 means the two securities move in lockstep while -1
indicates they move in opposite directions. The yield on 10-year
U.S. Treasuries was little changed at 1.57 percent, after
earlier touching 1.56 percent, the lowest intraday level since
June 8.  Bad loans as a proportion of total Spanish lending jumped
to 8.72 percent in April, the highest since 1994, from 8.37
percent in March, the Bank of Spain said on its website today.  Hunt for Yield  While the correlation with Treasuries is helping push
Mexican bond yields down, investor demand for higher-yielding
assets is the longer-term driver for the securities’ rally,
according to Alvarez.  “The lower yields that we’re seeing in  Mexico  are a result
of these unsustainable yields that you’re seeing in Spain and
 Italy , which telegraph that you’re going to have a more profound
European crisis to come,” Alvarez said by phone.  Italian 10-year bond yields increased 16 basis points to
6.08 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They rose
even as Greek parties backing a bailout won enough seats to form
a government, easing concern  Greece  would leave the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
