Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
largest social-networking website, acquired Face.com, adding
technology that enables facial recognition in photos.  Terms weren’t disclosed.  Face.com  helps users tag photos
and find images online by distinguishing facial features on
social networks and photo-sharing sites.  Menlo Park , California-
based  Facebook  already uses some of Face.com’s applications. The
startup announced the purchase today in a  blog posting .  “People who use Facebook enjoy sharing photos and memories
with their friends, and Face.com’s technology has helped to
provide the best photo experience,” said Ashley Zandy, a
Facebook spokeswoman, in an e-mailed statement. “This
transaction simply brings a world-class team and a longtime
technology vendor in house.”  Facebook, which first sold shares to the public a month
ago, has been making  acquisitions  to bring on talented
developers, add features to the site and bolster the company’s
mobile offerings. Since the beginning of April, Facebook has
agreed to purchase photo-sharing site Instagram, location-based
application Glancee and social-gifting company Karma.  Face.com, based in  San Francisco  and Tel Aviv, is backed by
 Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s most-used search engine, and investing firm
Rhodium.  Facebook  rose  4.7 percent to $31.41 at the close in New
York, marking a gain of 15 percent over the past three trading
days. The stock is still 17 percent lower than its initial
public offering price of $38 on May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
