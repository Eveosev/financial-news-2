Japanese and Australian stock
futures fell as borrowing costs in  Spain  climbed to a euro-area
record and optimism faded that Greece’s election will calm
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese
consumer electronics exporter that gets a fifth of its sales in
Europe, slid 0.9 percent. ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,
Australia’s second-biggest oil producer, fell 0.9 percent as
crude prices dropped for the first time in three days.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,680 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,730
in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,680 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index declined 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.1 percent in Wellington.  “We are positioned quite negatively,” said Tim Riordan,
of Parker Asset Management Ltd., a hedge fund in Sydney that has
about $200 million under management. “We see  Europe  escalating
rather than solving its problems. The focus is rolling on to
Spain, and with bond yields going over 7 percent, this has been
a red flag in the past. You’re in a bit of a downward spiral and
this leads us to be fairly cautious.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell less than
0.1 percent today. The gauge advanced just 0.1 percent yesterday
as surging Spanish bond yields tempered optimism about Greece’s
attempts to form a coalition government.  Spain, which has asked euro-region governments for as much
as 100 billion euros ($126 billion) to help shore up its banks,
reported a jump in bad loans in April to 8.72 percent of total
lending, the highest since 1994.  No Leeway  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Greece should not be
given more leeway to comply with austerity measures needed to
secure international aid after pro-bailout parties won enough
seats to form a majority in parliament.  Group of 20 chiefs began a two-day meeting in Mexico
yesterday as Spanish borrowing costs soared above 7 percent to a
euro-era record. With elections in Greece failing to damp the
threat of contagion, policy makers are discussing ways to
stimulate the world economy if necessary, a Canadian official
said. Merkel, who last week criticized U.S. debt levels, said
June 15 she’ll press the G-20 to hold to prudent  government
spending .  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP)  Index, which lost 10 percent through
yesterday from this year’s highest level in February, is trading
at 1.2 times book  value , compared with 2.1 times for the S&P 500
and 1.3 times for the Stoxx 600, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A number below one means companies can be bought for
less than value of their assets.  Oil for July delivery fell 76 cents to settle at $83.27 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are down 19
percent in the second quarter and 16 percent this year.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies gained 1.1 percent in New York yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
