IGas Energy Plc (IGAS) , a U.K. developer of
coal-bed methane and shale gas fields, has appointed the
investment bank  Greenhill & Co. (GHL)  to help find an investor in a
U.K. shale discovery.  The announcement marks the beginning of a formal process to
sell part of IGas’s stake in the Bowland Shale prospect in
northwest England in the next four to five months. The company
also reiterated that it has the potential to double its estimate
of gas in place of 4.6 trillion cubic feet, it said in a
statement in London.  “We have already received a number of expressions of
interest from world-class companies to partner with us for what
looks to be a highly significant opportunity,” IGas Chief
Executive Officer Andrew Austin said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
