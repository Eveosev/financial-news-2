Nansei Sekiyu K.K.,  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4) â€™s Japanese unit, halted berthing operations at its
Nishihara refinery on Okinawa island yesterday as typhoon Guchol
approached, a company official said.  The refiner may stop oil-product shipments by trucks from
the 100,000 barrel-a-day facility if weather conditions become
worse, said the official who asked not to be identified because
of company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
