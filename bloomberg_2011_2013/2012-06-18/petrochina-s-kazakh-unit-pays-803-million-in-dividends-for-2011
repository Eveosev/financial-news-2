producer half-owned by PetroChina, paid out 119.6 billion tenge
($803 million) in 2011 dividends to holders of ordinary shares.  The company also paid 1.2 billion tenge to holders of

jump in profit to 157.3 billion tenge last year.  -- Editors: Amanda Jordan, Ana Monteiro  To contact the reporter on this story:
