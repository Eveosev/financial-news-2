Quest Software Inc. (QSFT) , a maker of
tools to help companies manage computer systems, accepted a
sweetened $25.75-a-share bid from Insight Venture Partners and
agreed to the addition of Vector Capital to the buyout group.  Insight’s new cash offer of about $2.17 billion topped a
per-share bid of $25.50 that Quest received last week. That
offer came from personal-computer maker  Dell Inc. (DELL) , a person
familiar with the matter said today. The deal’s termination fee
was increased to $25 million from $6.3 million, the  Aliso Viejo ,
California-based software maker said in a statement today.  Quest said on March 9 it agreed to be acquired by Insight
for $23 a share, and two months later said it received several
other proposals that it anticipated would lead to a superior
offer. Chief Executive Officer Vincent Smith prefers a sale to
Insight over Dell because it would allow him to keep running the
company, said the person, who asked not to be named because the
negotiations are private.  David Frink , a spokesman for Dell, declined to comment.  Quest has  advanced  43 percent this year to $26.52, giving
it a market value of $2.24 billion, after the competing bids
emerged. Quest’s software helps businesses administer databases
and servers, as well as back up information and recover lost
data. New York-based Insight specializes in software and
Internet businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
