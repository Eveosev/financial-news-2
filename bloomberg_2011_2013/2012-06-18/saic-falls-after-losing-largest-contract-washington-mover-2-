SAIC Inc. (SAI)  fell the most in seven
months after losing its largest government contract to  Lockheed
Martin Corp. (LMT)   Shares of SAIC, based in McLean,  Virginia , declined 3.1
percent to close at $11.86 in  New York . They fell as much as 5.2
percent, the most since Nov. 9, 2011, in earlier trading.  Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Maryland, on June 15
beat SAIC for a Defense Department contract valued as high as
$4.6 billion to operate a communications network known as the
Global Information Grid.  The contract is for as long as seven years if all options
are exercised, and its estimated value for the three-year base
period is $1.91 billion, Alana Casanova, a spokeswoman for the
 Defense Information Systems Agency , said today in an e-mail.  SAIC, the eighth-largest contractor on the Bloomberg
Government top 200 list, has received at least $3.6 billion for
the work since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  It was SAIC’s biggest contract with the U.S. government,
according to Stifel Nicolaus, a St. Louis-based investment bank.
The firm cut its fiscal 2014 earnings estimate to $1.26 a share
from $1.38 a share and maintained its hold rating on the shares.  SAIC will probably protest the contract loss,  Michael
Lewis , an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets in New York, said
yesterday in a note to clients.  “We have seen protests turn the tables on a winning firm
before,” Lewis wrote. “While it is still too early to make
this call, there remains a possibility that this contract could
make its way back” to SAIC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
