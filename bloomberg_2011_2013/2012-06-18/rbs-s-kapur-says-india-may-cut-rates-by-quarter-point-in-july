Gaurav Kapur, senior economist at
Royal Bank of  Scotland , comments on the outlook for  India ’s
interest rates after the  Reserve Bank  of India unexpectedly kept
the repurchase rate unchanged today. Kapur was among the four
economists out of 25 surveyed by Bloomberg News that predicted
the outcome. Nineteen expected a 0.25 percentage-point cut and
the remainder a half-point reduction. The next scheduled meeting
is on July 31.  Inflation Focus:  “The RBI rate action does not come as a surprise as the
case for a rate cut was not a straightforward one given the
upside risk to already high inflation. The central bank has once
again reiterated its focus on inflation for the time being, and
perhaps has recognized the limited ability of monetary policy to
prop up growth, especially considering that the investment
slowdown is not necessarily interest-rate driven.  July Review:  ‘‘That said, in the July policy meeting the RBI will take a
more sympathetic approach towards growth and cut the repo rate
by 25 basis points. For liquidity infusions, the RBI seems to
prefer open-market purchases of bonds at this stage rather than
a reduction in lenders’ cash-reserve requirements.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
