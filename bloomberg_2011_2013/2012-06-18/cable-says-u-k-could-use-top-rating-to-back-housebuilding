Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
suggested the British government could use its top  credit rating 
to fund housebuilding projects in an effort to push money into
the economy and ease a shortage of homes.  Speaking in London today, Cable contrasted housebuilding in
the current economic slump with that of the 1930s, when in 1934
alone 300,000 homes were constructed, creating jobs. Britain
began construction on 139,430 homes last year.  “There are now some interesting ideas out there for
government guarantees that could trigger a significant volume of
housing investment, replicating the recovery model of the 1930s
and leading hopefully to a virtuous circle of new building
lending to increased affordability and also increased private
demand,” Cable said. He said the potential for “co-financing
private housebuilding” was “large.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
