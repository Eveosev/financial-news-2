U.K. natural gas for next-day
delivery rose for a second day as pipeline imports from  Norway 
and the Netherlands dropped amid higher demand. Next-day power
also advanced.  Gas for tomorrow gained as much as 1.1 percent to 55 pence
a therm, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.
Imports to the U.K. from Norway were at a rate of 48 million
cubic meters a day versus a five-month average of 80 million,
Gassco AS data showed. Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow
will be 192 million cubic meters, up from 181 million in the
prior period,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Next-day gas  climbed 0.2 pence, or 0.4 percent, to 54.6
pence a therm at 9:32 a.m. London time. That’s equivalent to
$8.55 per million British thermal units and compares with $2.49
per million Btu of next-month U.S. gas.  Norway’s Aasgard natural-gas field halted at 12:38 a.m.
Oslo time and may be closed for 24 hours, according to Gassco
AS, the country’s pipeline operator. The unplanned stoppage will
reduce production by about 24 million cubic meters today, the
company said on its website.  Gas for this winter declined 0.2 percent to 65.03 pence a
therm as relief over the result of the Greek election faded,
sending crude lower. Antonis Samaris, whose New Democracy party
placed first in yesterday’s voting, began his second bid in six
weeks to build a coalition as euro-area finance chiefs pressured
him to form a government that would keep bailout aid flowing.  Short Network  Greece  will run out of money in mid-July, the Syriza party,
which placed second in yesterday’s election, said on June 13
after being briefed by Acting Finance Minister Giorgios Zanias.  Exports to  Belgium  were halted for a sixth day as the
pipeline run by Interconnector U.K. Ltd continued with
maintenance scheduled to end on June 27.  The network will contain 313 million cubic meters of gas at
6 a.m. tomorrow, down from an  opening linepack  of 337 million 24
hours earlier, National Grid data show.  Inventories at Rough, the U.K.’s largest gas- storage 
facility, climbed 0.8 percent yesterday to 29,450 gigawatt-
hours, about the same as last year. Medium-range storage
increased 1.2 percent to 4,045 gigawatt-hours, versus about
5,800 12 months earlier.  Power for tomorrow traded at 42.36 pounds ($66.43) a
megawatt-hour, 1.1 percent higher than the price for today at
the end of last week, broker data show.  Winter electricity 
dropped 0.4 percent to 48.0 pounds a megawatt-hour.  Gas accounted for 38 percent of U.K. power at 9:55 a.m.,
grid data show. Coal generated 37 percent, nuclear 21 percent
and wind 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
