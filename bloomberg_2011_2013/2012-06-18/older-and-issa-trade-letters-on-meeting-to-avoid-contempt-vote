U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
and Representative  Darrell Issa  continued to negotiate over
meeting to head off contempt proceedings against the nation’s
leading law enforcement official for withholding documents
related to a federal gun probe.  The two men traded letters today on how Holder can avoid a
vote by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for
contempt of Congress. Issa, the panel chairman and a California
Republican, proposed a 5 p.m. meeting tomorrow in a
congressional office building.  Tracy Schmaler , a Justice Department spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately respond to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment
on whether Holder is available then. Holder had suggested
meeting at 11 a.m. in a letter released earlier today.  Issa has said the Justice Department hasn’t fully
cooperated with a congressional investigation of Fast and
Furious, a law enforcement operation that let illegal U.S.
weapons purchases wind up in  Mexico . The  Justice Department  said
it has provided more than 7,600 pages of documents.  The department must turn over additional documents in
advance of the meeting before any decision is made about
postponing the contempt vote scheduled for June 20, Issa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
