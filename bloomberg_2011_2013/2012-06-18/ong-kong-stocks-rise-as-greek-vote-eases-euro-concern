Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index capping its biggest two-day gain since January,
as projections showed pro-bailout parties won control of
 Greece ’s parliament in an election viewed as a referendum on
whether the debt-strapped country will stay in the euro.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest bank, rose 1 percent.
China Mengniu Dairy Co. gained 6.8 percent after  Denmark ’s Arla
Foods said it plans to buy a stake in the milk producer. Hong
Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. fell 4.5 percent after Morgan
Stanley said the bourse’s bid for the London Metal Exchange was
“extremely expensive.”  The Hang Seng Index climbed 1 percent to 19,427.81 at the
close. The gauge capped a two-day gain of 3.3 percent, the most
since Jan. 18. All but five of 49 companies on the gauge
advanced, with volume 11 percent below the 30-day average. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks rose 0.8
percent to 9,818.76.  ‘We’ve avoided the potential pitfalls of Greek exit from
the Eurozone,” said  Tim Schroeders , a portfolio manager who
helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
 Melbourne . “I expect markets will be a bit happier in the short
term before addressing longer-term issues.”  Hong Kong’s  benchmark index  rose 4 percent last week, its
first weekly advance in six and the biggest increase since Jan.
20, amid speculation central banks will take steps to bolster
economic growth in the face of Europe’s debt crisis. Companies
on the Hang Seng Index traded at 9.9 times estimated earnings on
average on June 15, compared with 12.9 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 10.2 for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  Greek Election  New Democracy  won 129 seats, enough to put together a
coalition with Pasok, easing concern that Greece would reject
austerity measures needed to qualify for international aid. The
parties would have 162 seats if they agree to govern together in
the 300-member parliament, according to Interior Ministry
projections with 99 percent of yesterday’s vote counted.  “Greece’s election is a good result and will provide some
short-term relief,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of
dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages almost $100 billion. “This will put to rest for a
little while the prospect of Greece leaving the euro.”  Stocks also advanced after German Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s government signaled willingness to loosen Greece’s
austerity requirements so long as the nation abides by its
obligations under the bailout program.  HSBC, Esprit  HSBC rose 1 percent to HK$67.45.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a

percent to HK$10.24. Cosco Pacific Ltd., which operates a port
in Greece, climbed 2 percent to HK$10.14.  China Mengniu jumped 6.8 percent to HK$21.15 after
Denmark’s Arla Foods said it plans to buy about a 6 percent
stake in the milk producer.  Samsonite International SA (1910) , the world’s largest branded-
luggage maker, jumped 7.6 percent to HK$13 after saying its
products were safe following a report some contained carcinogens.
The shares tumbled 16 percent on June 15 after the Hong Kong
Consumer Council said handles of some Samsonite luggage
contained materials which could cause cancer. The immediate
danger is minimal, it said.  Chinese developers rose even after home values fell in a
record 54 of 70 cities tracked by the government in May as
developers cut prices to boost sales amid housing curbs. China
will continue to conduct differentiated housing credit policies,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing an unidentified
official from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural
Development.  Hong Kong Exchanges dropped 4.5 percent to HK$107.40. The
bourse said after the market closed on June 15 it has agreed to
pay 1.39 billion pounds ($2.15 billion) for the LME. The price
was “extremely expensive” and the bourse will probably sell
shares to finance the purchase, Morgan Stanley wrote in a report
dated yesterday.  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  futures expiring this month climbed 0.7
percent to 19,459. The HSI  Volatility Index (VHSI)  tumbled 12 percent
