Hidroelectrica SA, Romania’s state-
owned hydro-power generator, filed for insolvency last week,
without mentioning the reason, the Economy Ministry said in an
e-mailed statement.  The first court hearing on Hidroelectrica’s request was set
for June 20,  Mediafax  news service said today, citing a court
document.  The government pledged to the  International Monetary Fund 
and the European Union to renegotiate some bilateral contracts
of the country’s biggest power producer with some companies such
as  Alro SA (ALR) , which are under investigation by the EU’s
competition regulation for possible state aid on selling power
at below-market prices.  Romania plans to sell a 10 percent stake in Hidroelectrica
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
