Dogus Holding AS, a Turkish company
with interests in banking, construction and tourism, will buy
four marinas that  Greece  is selling to raise cash,  Milliyet 
reported, citing Group Chief Executive Husnu Akhan.  Istanbul-based Dogus applied to the Greek tourism ministry
for clearance to acquire the marinas in Athens, Corfu Island,
Lefkas Island and the Peloponnese for 20 million euros ($25
million), Akhan said, according to the newspaper.  The marinas have a total anchorage capacity of 3,755, about
50 percent more than the companyâ€™s capacity in  Turkey , Akhan
said. Dogus said on April 30 that it had bought Marina Dalmacija
and Marina Borik in Croatia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
