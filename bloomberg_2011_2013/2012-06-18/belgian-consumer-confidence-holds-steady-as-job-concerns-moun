Belgian  consumer confidence 
stabilized in June as households became more positive about
the economic outlook and their future financial situation
amid deteriorating employment prospects.  The consumer sentiment index for  Belgium , the sixth-largest
economy in the 17-nation euro currency union, was at minus 10 in
June, unchanged from a month earlier, the Brussels-based
 National Bank of Belgium  said today in an e-mailed statement.  A sub-index gauging householdsâ€™ assessment of the economy
in the coming year rose to minus 5, the highest value in a year,
from minus 9 in May. A gauge measuring concerns about rising
unemployment climbed to 35 from 31, for the biggest increase
since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
