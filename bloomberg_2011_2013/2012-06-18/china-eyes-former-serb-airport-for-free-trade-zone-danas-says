China  is considering three locations
offered by the Serb government to open a free-trade zone,
including the former military airport Ponikve near the western
city of Uzice,  Danas  newspaper reported, citing the Uzice mayor.  The city, which owns the 550-hectare (1,360-acre) airfield,
is offering it to Chinese investors as a potential logistics
base in the Balkan country, the report quoted Jovan Markovic as
saying. The two other locations are in the southeast near Pirot
and on the Danube river, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
