Spaniards expect the 100 billion-
euro ($127 billion) rescue the European Union approved for the
country’s banks will fail to clean up the industry and most
disapprove of the government’s handling of the deal.  A poll by Sigma Dos published in El Mundo today showed 68
percent of respondents expect the bank bailout to collapse and
65 percent said Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s management of the
negotiations was mediocre or worse compared with 25 percent who
approved.  The voters’ reaction mirrors the response of investors who
dumped Spanish bonds last week after Rajoy announced the rescue
package to recapitalize the country’s banks. The yield on
Spanish 10-year debt touched a euro-era record on June 14 as
voters questioned whether he can control public borrowing within
the constraints of the euro without a full bailout.  A minority of respondents questioned  Spain ’s membership in
the single-currency region, with 24 percent saying there was a
chance the country would leave or be forced out of the euro and
19 percent saying they would be better off outside the monetary
union.  Madrid President  Esperanza Aguirre ’s plan to reduce the
number of lawmakers in her regional assembly was backed by 77
percent of respondents while 62 percent said Rajoy isn’t doing
enough to slim down Spanish bureaucracy.  Sigma Dos interviewed 1,000 potential voters between June
12 and June 14 and the margin for error was 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
