Travelers Cos., the lone insurer in
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , agreed to pay $10.5 million to
settle a California regulatorâ€™s probe of excessive charges.  The payment, which includes $9 million in refunds and a
$1.5 million fine by the New York-based insurer, is tied to a
review of conduct in 2006, according to an e-mailed statement
today from state Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
