Opel,  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s European
unit, has earmarked 500 million euros ($635 million) for the
possible closure of its plant in Bochum, Germany, yet the cost
could be higher, according to Rainer Einenkel, who heads the
plant’s works council, the  Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported in a preview of an article to be published today.  The total cost could be 1 billion euros when environmental
clean-up costs are factored in, Einenkel told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
