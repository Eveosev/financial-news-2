JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
 U.S. bank , said it will bolster the capital of its Mexican units
by $250 million.  The move brings the firm’s total capital in Mexico to $653
million, JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement.  The bank plans to use the added resources, which are still
subject to regulatory approval, to increase lending limits, and
it may also apply the money to boost equity activity at its
Mexican brokerage unit, according to the statement.  Mexico is a country “where the bank is making significant
investments in recruiting and developing staff, as well as in
state of the art systems,” Eduardo Cepeda, senior country
officer for JPMorgan in Mexico, said in the statement.  JPMorgan has operated as a financial institution in Mexico
since 1994.  To contact the reporters on this story:
