Italy leads Ireland 1-0 at halftime
in the final round of Group C matches at soccerâ€™s European
Championship, while defending champion Spain is tied 0-0 against
Croatia.   Italy needs a victory against already eliminated Ireland in
Poznan, Poland to have a chance of advancing to the
quarterfinals. At present, Croatia, playing in Gdansk, would
drop to third in the group and be eliminated.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
