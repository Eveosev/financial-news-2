Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  hired
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Rob Irwin as co-head of its
transportation and autos investment-banking business.  Irwin will work with co-head Andrew Horrocks, according to
a memo from the bank that was confirmed by Jack Grone, a
spokesman. Irwin will be based in New York and report to Andy Lipsky and Mark Echlin, co-heads of the global industrials
group, and Peter Matt, Americas head of global industrials.  Credit Suisse is adding a second leader to a group whose
clients include airlines, railroads, shipping, trucking and
logistics companies. Irwin, who has worked with United Parcel
Service Inc. and Ceva Logistics, led transportation investment
banking at Bear Stearns Cos. starting in 2001 and continued in
that role at JPMorgan after the firm acquired Bear Stearns in
2008.  Irwin will begin his new role in September, the memo shows.
Horrocks, the current head, joined from Moelis & Co. in 2010 to
run the unit.  Zurich-based Credit Suisse ranks fifth among financial
advisers on industrial deals so far this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
