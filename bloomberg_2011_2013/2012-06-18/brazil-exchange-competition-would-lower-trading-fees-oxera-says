Ending BM&FBovespa SA’s monopoly on
 stock trading  in Brazil would lower fees and help spur economic
growth, Oxera Consulting Ltd. said in a report commissioned by
the country’s securities regulator.  Increasing competition in the industry would “likely”
reduce fees, Oxera said in the  report  posted on the regulator’s
website. “The reduction in trading and/or post-trading prices
can be expected to have some impact on the cost of capital for
Brazilian-listed companies, which, at the margin, is likely to
stimulate investment and economic growth,” the report said.  While Sao Paulo-based BM&FBovespa operates the only stock
exchange in Brazil, U.S.-based Direct Edge Holdings LLC
announced in 2011 it plans to open an electronic trading
platform that will be based in  Rio de Janeiro , pending
regulatory approval.  Brazil’s securities regulator, known as CVM, said in a
 statement  on its website that Oxera’s findings don’t necessarily
reflect its views on the issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
