Indian stocks dropped, reversing an
earlier advance, after the country’s central bank unexpectedly
left  interest rates  unchanged.  State Bank of India , the nation’s biggest lender, sank 3.3
percent, erasing an intraday gain of 2.2 percent.  Tata Power
Co. (TPWR) , the largest non-state-owned generator, fell 2.5 percent.
The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  slid 1.2 percent to 16,753.73 at
12:21 p.m. in Mumbai. The 30-stock gauge had risen as much as
0.9 percent before the  Reserve Bank  of India’s announcement.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left the key repurchase rate at 8
percent, a stance that contrasts with rate cuts in Australia and
China in the past two weeks as the impact of Europe’s debt
crisis fans through Asia and dominates the agenda of a Group of
20 summit starting in Mexico today. Subbarao’s room to counter
the weakest Indian growth in almost a decade is being limited in
part by a plunge in the rupee, which has stoked an  inflation
rate  already above 7 percent.  “This is a shocker,” said D.K. Aggarwal, who manages
about $100 million of local assets as chairman at SMC Wealth
Management Ltd. in  New Delhi . “A rate cut was a must because
the growth was slowing. The confidence has taken a beating.”  Only four of 25 economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted
the RBI’s decision, with 19 expecting a 0.25 percentage-point
cut and the remainder a half-point reduction.  Growth concerns have pushed down the Sensex 9 percent from
this year’s high set on Feb. 21. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
is grappling with an economy hobbled by record trade and budget
deficits, corruption scandals and infighting in the coalition
that has stymied his efforts to lure more foreign investment.  Junk Status  Gross domestic product  climbed 5.3 percent in the quarter
ended March from a year ago, the least since 2003, imperiling
the prime minister’s goal of 9 percent annual gains to reduce
poverty. Standard & Poor’s has warned it may cut the country’s
credit rating to so-called junk status.  “While growth in 2011-2012 has moderated significantly,
headline inflation remains above levels consistent with
sustainable growth,” the RBI said today.  Inflation accelerated to 7.55 percent in May, the fastest
pace in the BRIC group of largest  emerging markets  that also
includes Brazil, Russia and China. The government’s projected
fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent of GDP in the year through March
2013 is the group’s widest.  India  VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, sank 8.6 percent to 23.34.
The Nifty shed 1.1 percent to 5,083.65 while its June futures
traded at 5,075. The  BSE-200 Index (BSE200)  fell 1 percent to 2,053.08.
Combined trading volume on India’s top two exchanges was 694
million shares on June 15, compared with a 12-month daily

stocks and taking total investment in 2012 to $8.6 billion, data
from the regulator show. They cut holdings by $273 million in
May, a second consecutive month of net sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
