South Korea’s won rose to a one-
month high and  government bonds  declined as official projections
showed that politicians who support Greece’s bailout won enough
seats in an election to form a majority in parliament.  The support for the New Democracy and Pasok parties eased
concern the nation would reject austerity measures needed to
qualify for a bailout and leave the euro. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index
rallied 1.8 percent to its highest close since May 15. Leaders
from the Group of 20 nations meet today to discuss Europe’s debt
crisis and the  Federal Reserve  will announce its projections for
the  U.S. economy  on June 20.  “Concerns surrounding Greece disappeared and this will
have a positive effect on the market supporting the won,” said
Lee Jin Ill, a Seoul-based currency trader for Hana Bank.
“Players are now focusing on the policies to be announced at
the Fed meeting and the G20 summit, and steep gains in the won
may be limited with concerns moving to Spain issues.”  The won gained 0.7 percent to 1,157.25 per dollar at the
close in  Seoul , advancing for a fourth day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,156.75 earlier,
the strongest since May 15. Its one-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped
106 basis points to 9.38 percent.  Sales at major South Korean department stores rose 1
percent in May from a year earlier, following a 3.4 percent
decline the previous month, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy 
said in a statement yesterday. The  yield  on Spanish 10-year
bonds reached 6.998 percent on June 14, a euro-era record.  Short-term uncertainties are likely to ease on Greece while
mid to long-term risks still persist, South Korea’s finance
ministry commented in an e-mailed statement today.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.5 percent bonds due March 2017
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, today to 3.44
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year debt
futures fell 0.14 to 104.67 and one-year  interest-rate swaps 
rose four basis points to 3.32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
