U.K. prosecutors will decide whether
to charge two journalists in relation to the phone-hacking
scandal at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s British unit after receiving new
evidence from London police.  London’s  Metropolitan Police Service , which has been
probing illegal voice-mail interceptions by News Corp. reporters
since January 2011, gave the U.K.  Crown Prosecution Service 
evidence on a sixth and seventh journalist on June 15 as part of
the probe known as Operation Weeting. The journalists weren’t
identified by the CPS.  The agency received evidence on June 11 on five journalists
who are suspects in the case. Police have arrested more than 50
people in three probes into phone hacking, computer hacking and
bribery of public officials involving News Corp.’s now-defunct
News of the World tabloid and its Sun newspaper, the best-
selling daily title in Britain.  Prosecutors said they are unable to give any timetable on
how soon they could reach decisions on charging the suspects.  The cases “are being considered very carefully and
thoroughly, and the decisions will be made as soon as is
practicable,” CPS spokesman Calum Grant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
