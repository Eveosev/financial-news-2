Ivan Seidenberg , who led Verizon
Communications Inc. for more than a decade, has joined Perella
Weinberg Partners as an advisory partner.  Seidenberg, 65, will work with co-founders Joseph Perella,
Peter Weinberg and Terry Meguid, the New York-based firm said
today in a statement. The executive, who has more than 45 years
of experience in telecommunications, stepped down as  Verizon’s (VZ) 
chief executive officer last year.  Under Seidenberg, Verizon’s wireless division overtook AT&T
Inc. as the largest mobile-phone company in the U.S. At Perella,
he will provide advice to the co-founders on how to expand the
firm, according to the statement.  “As we enter our seventh year, we continue to prioritize
the strategic growth of our franchise,” Joseph Perella said in
the statement. “We are delighted that Ivan has decided to join
the firm as an advisory partner to assist with this task.”  In March, the investment bank named former Lazard Ltd.
President Charles Ward as a partner in its advisory business to
meet with top clients and prospects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
