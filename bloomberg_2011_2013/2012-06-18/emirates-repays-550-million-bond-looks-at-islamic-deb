Emirates, the world’s largest
airline by international traffic, will look at Islamic debt for
future financing after paying a $550 million sukuk.  “With the Eurozone debt crisis ongoing it’s likely that
Islamic financing, with its large pool of liquidity, will play
an increasingly important role for us moving forward,” Chairman
Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed  Al Maktoum  said in a statement today.
“The repayment of our first-ever sukuk bond is part of
Emirates’ varied financing strategy and reflects our robust
financial position.”  Emirates is building the world’s largest fleet of Airbus
superjumbo jets to establish Dubai as a long-haul travel hub and
win passengers from  Air France-KLM (AF)  and Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
The Dubai-based airline is one of the biggest buyers of Airbus
SAS A380 superjumbos and the Boeing 777s, and in November signed
a deal valued at $18 billion with  Boeing Co. (BA)   The carrier repaid the seven-year Islamic bond, listed on
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, in full on its maturity date
today. The floating bond last traded at 99.36 cents on the
dollar on June 15, according to Bloomberg data. The yield on the
airline’s 5.125 percent bond maturing June 2016 fell 16 basis
points last week to 4.46 percent.  Earlier this year, Emirates raised 1.9 billion dirhams
($517 million) from an Islamic facility for the purchase of
three aircraft. The 12-year loan will finance the purchase of
planes including Boeing’s 777-300ERs and Airbus’s A380.  To contact the reporter on this story:
