Things were going badly for the
Doors, packed into a tiny Hollywood rehearsal room.  It was late 1970, and  Jim Morrison  was drunkenly talking of
becoming a full-time poet. Their long-term producer Paul
Rothschild had walked out in disgust after the first ragged
sessions, saying the band was veering toward cocktail jazz.  The story of how this chaos turned into the excellent
“L.A. Woman” is clear for the first time on the 40th-
anniversary edition. We hear shaky starts until Morrison gets
the idea of updating 12-bar blues. Things fall into place.  “Cars hiss by my window,” he sings, “like the waves down
on the beach.” He repeats it, like John Lee Hooker, adding a
payoff “I got this girl beside me but she’s out of reach.”  Not all the outtakes are revelatory, with Morrison sounding
bored with the mantra “Riders on the Storm.” Still, this is a
landmark release lovingly restored. Morrison headed off for
Paris after, and was dead within months at age 27. Rating: ****.  Janis Joplin , who also died at 27 the year before, went out
on a note of boozy excess. “The Pearl Sessions” adds outtakes
and jams for what was planned as her solo breakthrough. The
promise unfulfilled is heartbreaking. Rating: ***.  “Live at the Carousel Ballroom,” a record she made with
 Big Brother  and the Holding Company, is at last on CD. It’s an
improvement on the better-known “Cheap Thrills,” with Joplin’s
unhinged vocals meshing with guitar freakouts. Rating: ****.  Paul Simon ’s Grammy-winning “Graceland” is back in a
25th-anniversary issue. It includes demos, live tracks and the
film “Under African Skies,” where Simon says he wasn’t aware
of a United Nations cultural boycott when recording in
apartheid-era  South Africa . He brought the country to wider
attention by mixing township beats and his urbane lyrics.  Those words remain clever: “‘Senorita that’s astute,’ I
said. ‘Why don’t we get together and call ourselves an
institute?’”  Rating: *****.  This month, another of rock’s greatest recordings gets a
40th-anniversary edition:  David Bowie ’s “The Rise and Fall of
Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars.”  This album was one of the first I bought. It still is in my
top 10 best. Back then, I imagined all records would be this
good. I was wrong.  The story is set five years before the world ends, with
Stardust as the ultimate rock star offering a live-today,
forget-tomorrow message in “Moonage Daydream.” He hurtles
through fame (“Hang on to Yourself”) until he breaks up the
band and his world falls apart in “Rock ’n’ Roll Suicide.”  The second side of the original LP was almost perfect, an
18-minute brain-bruise, now in an even crisper mix that makes
the outtakes and remixes almost irrelevant. Rating: *****.  Pink Floyd ’s reissue program peaked last year with the big
boxes of “Dark Side of the Moon” and “Wish You Were Here.”  After that, I was rather dreading “The Wall,” which was
always bloated. Now, it’s even more overdone, with a seven-disc
set. Beautifully presented, it’s only for obsessives with time
to fritter and money to splurge. Rating: ***.  The Beatles have a slew of reissues and outtakes, which
will appeal to fans though they won’t to enhance the group’s
legacy. Amid the genius, “Yellow Submarine” was a low note. A
new version tries to put the case for its rehabilitation.  The film has been restored, with hand-painted psychedelic
colors. The plot’s still pathetic and the dialogue’s terrible.
George Martin’s orchestrations remain silly, such as “Sea of
Holes,” a title which says it all. At least the soundtrack now
has more genuine Beatles songs on it. Rating: ***.  George Harrison 's “Early Takes Volume 1” is, as advertised, 
a collection of outtakes that should have been left on the 
cutting room floor. The “Volume 1” note is ominous. Rating: **.  Paul and Linda McCartney's “Ram” is the latest of Macca's 
LPs to be remastered. Paul has just turned 70. Even in this 
buffed-up form, “Ram” is far from his best. Rating: **.  This year has also seen some exceptional reissues by acts 
as varied as My Bloody Valentine (“Loveless,”) Can (“The Lost 
Tapes” follows “Tago Mago”), the Lucy Show (“Remembrances”) and 
 Johnny Cash  (“Bootleg Vol. IV: The Soul of Truth”).  The Doors are on Elektra, Joplin and Simon on Sony Legacy,
Bowie on EMI and the Beatles on Parlophone, McCartney on Hear 
Music and Harrison on UMe. Prices start at about $10 with the
Simon expanded box set for $85, Bowie at $33, Pink Floyd at $20
or $110 for the bigger “Immersion” set.   Information:  http://www.thedoors.com ,
