Trading in options to buy June
European Union carbon permits at 7 euros ($8.84) a metric ton
jumped fourfold last week, with the contractâ€™s price more than
doubling as the underlying futures rose above its strike level.  Trading volume in calls linked to the June contract
increased to 2.2 million tons, from 500,000 tons the week
before, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Call options give the
buyer the right to purchase at a certain price. Puts give the
right to sell.  The price of the 7-euro  call option  more than doubled to 42
euro cents a ton on June 15 from 20 cents on June 14, the data
show. Permits for delivery in June surged 9.6 percent last week
to 7.23 euros a ton as EU regulators may favor delaying sales of
as many as 1.2 billion tons of carbon allowances from 2013 in a
bid to deal with oversupply that has built up in the market, two
people with knowledge of the matter said. Prices surged on that
news at about 4 p.m. on May 15.  The option to buy at 7 euros has open interest of 4.3
million tons as of June 14, a record for that contract and more
than any other June call option. The contract expires on June
20, according to ICE. The June put option at a strike of 5 euros
has open interest of 4.5 million tons. Open interest is a
measure of trading positions that have not been closed,
liquidated or delivered. ICE publishes open interest figures the
day after the trading day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
