Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  expects to boost
capacity on its Seaway pipeline by 250,000 barrels to 400,000
barrels a day by the end of this year.  The line, which can currently transport 150,000 barrels a
day, is operating at “capacity,” Enbridge President Al Monaco
said today in Toronto.  Enterprise Products Partners LP, which owns the pipeline
along with Enbridge, previously said the line’s capacity would
be increased by the first quarter of 2013.  Oil began flowing on the reversed line from Cushing,
Oklahoma, to the U.S. Gulf Coast May 19 and the first delivery
reached the destination by June 6, the companies said in a
statement at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
