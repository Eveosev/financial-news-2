 A fire damaged a government-owned
oil and grease plant in an industrial area of Benghazi in
eastern  Libya  on June 16, the Libya Herald, an English language
online newspaper reported.  The blaze lasted six hours before it was extinguished and
nobody was injured, though the plant and nearby businesses were
damaged, the report said.  The Supreme Security Committee of the Ministry of Interior
said it suspected supporters of the former government of the
late  Muammar Qaddafi  of causing the fire. Several state-owned
facilities in the eastern city have burned in recent months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
