Ethanol futures advanced the most in
11 weeks on concern that hot weather will raise production costs
for the biofuel.  Prices gained as a heat wave blanketing parts of the U.S.
Midwest threatened corn crop development. The grain is the
primary feedstock in U.S.-made ethanol, with one bushel
distilling into at least 2.75 gallons of the gasoline additive.  “It’s just a big weather rally in corn,” said  Jason Ward ,
an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments in  Minneapolis .  Denatured ethanol for July delivery surged 5 cents, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $2.077 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since June 8 and the biggest one-day
gain since March 30. Futures have fallen 5.7 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.10 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.03 and in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.09 a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol
on the West Coast jumped 5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.225.  Corn for December delivery increased 28 cents, or 5.5
percent, to $5.34 a bushel in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
