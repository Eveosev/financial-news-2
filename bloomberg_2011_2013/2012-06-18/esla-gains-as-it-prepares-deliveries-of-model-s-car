Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  rose the most in
almost a month as the maker of electric cars prepares to deliver
its first Model S models this week.  The Palo Alto, California-based company led by Elon Musk
increased 6.5 percent to $31.84 a share at the close in New
York, the biggest gain since May 22.  The Model S, the company’s first model designed and built
in-house, has a range as much as 300 miles (483 kilometers) per
charge. The Model S has a base price of $57,400, half that of
the company’s Roadster, a battery-electric sports car made under
contract with Group Lotus Plc that debuted in 2008. Sales of the
Roadster ended earlier this year.  “While we have been broadly encouraged by the company’s
execution to date, we recognize that the stakes are high” with
the Model S, Barclays Plc said in a report. “We continue to
view the shares favorably ahead of what we consider is a
multiyear product cycle.”  The Model S is being built at Tesla’s Fremont, California,
plant that was previously a joint venture owned by  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  and the predecessor of  General Motors Co. (GM)  Toyota, Daimler
AG and  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  are investors in Tesla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
