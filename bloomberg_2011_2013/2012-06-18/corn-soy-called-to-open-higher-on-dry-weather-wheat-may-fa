What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade as the condition of the U.S. crop
declined amid hot, dry weather, said  Terry Reilly , an analyst at

week earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a
report today.  -- Soybean futures may open up 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel in
Chicago after the USDA rated 56 percent of the crop in good or
excellent conditions as of yesterday, down from 60 percent the
prior week, Reilly said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent higher per pound, and soybean-meal
futures may open $2 to $4 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent lower on the CBOT,
the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  as the U.S. spring crop was rated 76 percent good or
excellent versus 75 percent the prior week, Reilly said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
