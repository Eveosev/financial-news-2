The European Union will withhold aid
payments to Greece until the next review by international
monitors, said  Thomas Wieser , head of the group that prepares
meetings for euro-area finance ministers.  “There will be no new decisions on disbursements before
the new MOU has been negotiated and signed,” Wieser told
reporters in Vienna.  He said he was referring to a review by the so-called
troika, which comprises the European Commission, the European
Central Bank and the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
