Spanish President  Mariano Rajoy  said
the results of Greeceâ€™s parliamentary elections are good news
for his country, Greece and the euro zone, according to EFE
newswire.  Rajoy, in comments to reporters upon his arrival to Los
Cabos, Mexico for a meeting of Group of 20 leaders, said he was
certain that a victory by the pro-bailout New Democracy party
would clear the way for a period of economic growth and  job
creation  in Greece, the Spanish newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
