Campaigning began today in  Libya ’s
first national parliamentary election since the overthrow of
 Muammar Qaddafi , with security in the North African nation a
continuing issue.  A total of more than 3,700 candidates are vying for seats
in the 200-seat legislature, the election commission reported on
its website. The commission said that 142 parties are running in
the election, and that women account for 539 of the total number
of candidates.  The ballot, delayed to July 7, comes as Libya’s interim
leadership struggles to restore order in a nation ruled for 42
years by Qaddafi. It has been unable to curb the militias who
played a key role in the uprising, and the east has moved to
form a semi-autonomous region. Two British close-protection
officers were wounded last week in a rocket attack in Benghazi
on the U.K. ambassador, while bombs have targeted the  Red Cross 
in Misrata and the U.S. mission in Benghazi this month.  Qaddafi was killed by rebel militiamen in October following
a seven-month long, United-Nations authorized campaign against
his forces by combat aircraft from France, the U.K. and the U.S.  Meanwhile, the economy has stumbled despite the nation’s
oil wealth. Libya sits atop North Africa’s largest crude
reserves.  The new legislature will be charged with appointing a new
prime minister and Cabinet and drawing up the country’s new
constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
