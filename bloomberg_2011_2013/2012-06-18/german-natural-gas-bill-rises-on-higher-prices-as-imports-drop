Germany  had to pay more to import
less natural gas in the first four months of the year as import
prices for the fuel rose 23.5 percent, the  Economy Ministry 
said.  German gas imports fell about 7 percent to 1.37 million
terajoules at a value of about 11.5 billion euros ($14.5
billion), the ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. The
country in the same period last year imported 1.47 million
terajoules at a cost of 10 billion euros.  Russia accounted for about 485,000 terajoules of gas
imports, followed by Norway (about 445,000 terajoules) and the
Netherlands (about 377,000), the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
