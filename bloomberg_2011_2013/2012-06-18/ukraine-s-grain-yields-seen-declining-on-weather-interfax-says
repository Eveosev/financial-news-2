Ukraine’s grain harvest will decline
year-on-year because hot weather and rainfall cut yields,
 Interfax-Ukraine   news agency  reported, citing Mykola Kulbida,
head of the country’s weather center.  Rainfall caused grain diseases and pests to spread in the
western part Ukraine, while high temperatures damaged crops in
southern and eastern parts of the country, Kulbida said,
according to Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
