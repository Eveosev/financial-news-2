Former  McKesson Corp. (MCK)  Chairman
Charles McCall lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to overturn his
conviction and 10-year prison sentence for a scheme to inflate
company revenue.  The justices, without comment, refused to consider McCallâ€™s
appeal. The former executive argued that improper jury
instructions at his 2009 trial let jurors find him guilty
without proving that he intended to break the law.  McCall was convicted on five counts of  securities fraud ,
making false statements in Securities and Exchange Commission
filings and circumventing accounting rules. Prosecutors charged
that McCall and others backdated contracts and took other steps
to manipulate sales figures and meet quarterly revenue targets.  When McKesson disclosed in April 1999 that sales had been
prematurely booked, leading to a restatement, the shares lost 47
percent of their value. McKesson, based in  San Francisco , is the
largest U.S. drug distributor.  McCall was sentenced in March 2010 to 10 years in prison
and fined $1 million.  The case is McCall v. U.S., 11-882.  To contact the reporter on this story:
