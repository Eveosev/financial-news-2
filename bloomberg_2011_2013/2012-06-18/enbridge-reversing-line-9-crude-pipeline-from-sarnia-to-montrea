Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said it will reverse
all of its 240,000-barrel-a-day Line 9 crude oil pipeline from
Sarnia, Ontario, to  Montreal .  “In reversing the flow of one of our existing lines, Line
9, Ontario and Quebec refineries will have access to lower-cost
Canadian feedstock,” Enbridge President Al Monaco said in a
speech in Toronto today.  The Calgary-based company said a year ago it planned to
reverse a portion of the line between Sarnia and Westover,
Ontario. The company said May 16 it would reverse the portion
from Westover to Montreal.  The reconfigured line may provide an outlet for Canadian
crude if another system, the line from Portland, Maine, to
Montreal, is reversed. Alberta oil could then be loaded on
tankers for transport to refineries in the U.S. Northeast.  Enbridge Chief Executive Officer Patrick Daniel said Oct. 6
the company was in discussions with Valero Energy Corp. and
other refiners about reversing Line 9 to ship crude produced in
 North Dakota  and Canada to the Atlantic coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
