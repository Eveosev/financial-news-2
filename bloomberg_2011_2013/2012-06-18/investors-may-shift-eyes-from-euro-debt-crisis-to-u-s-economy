Tomomi Yamashita, a  fund manager  in
 Tokyo  at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees about $6.6
billion, commented on the Greece election’s impact on equities.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.8 percent to 8,720.27 as of
11:30 a.m. trading break in Tokyo.  On results of Greek election:  “Strong concern that Greece may separate from the euro has
calmed down. Whether the country will exit the euro hasn’t been
determined yet, but investors’ worries have eased and shares are
rebounding.”  On going forward with the debt crisis:  “We can’t see the next steps of how the financial crisis
will be dealt with not only in Greece but the euro overall. The
markets will remain uneasy, with uncertainty about which steps
policy makers will take in the direction of growth or austerity.  On investors’ focus  “Investors were focusing on the  European debt crisis  but
they will gradually shift their eyes to U.S. monetary policy and
the nation’s macro economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
