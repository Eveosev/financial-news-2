Kenya ’s shilling gained for the
fourth straight day to the highest in a month on dollar inflows
from agri-based suppliers and as the central bank reduced  money
supply  through its repo and term-deposit auctions.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
0.5 percent to 84.45 by 3:06 p.m. in Nairobi, on course for its
strongest closing level since May 18, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “The shilling firmed against the dollar, lifted by decent
inflows from the agricultural sector,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank
Ltd. (NICB)  said in a note e-mailed to investors today. Foreign
investors have also paid for “Kenya Airways’ rights issue  that
raised 14.5 billion shillings ($170.7 million).”  Kenya’s central bank has mopped up 119 billion shillings in
seven-day repurchase agreements since April 27 and 25.4 billion
shillings in term-auction deposits since June 6, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank today offered 5 billion shillings in  repurchase
agreements  and term-auction deposits, tightening money supply.
It accepted 850 million shillings of bids for seven-day
repurchase agreements, paying a weighted average rate of 17.765
percent, a central bank official who asked not to be named in
line with policy said. The regulator accepted 4.15 billion
shillings in bids for 14-day and 28-day term-auction deposits at
17.772 percent and 18 percent, respectively, the official said.  The central bank on June 5 re-introduced the deposits as a
measure for “liquidity management,” according to a statement
on its website.  Term-auction deposits offer maturities of 14, 21 and 28
days and are paid back with interest, while the tenor of repos
is typically seven days or less and the securities are offered
at a discounted yield, according to a research note from
Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd e-mailed June 11.  Uganda ’s shilling gained 0.6 percent to 2,489.77 per
dollar, the first time in three days, while Tanzania’s currency
appreciated for a second day, up 0.3 percent to 1,580 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
