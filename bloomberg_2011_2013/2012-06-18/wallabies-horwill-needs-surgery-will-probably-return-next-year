Wallabies captain  James Horwill 
needs surgery on his hamstring that will probably sideline him
until next year’s Super Rugby competition, the Australian Rugby
Union said.  Second-row forward Horwill, who ruptured his right
hamstring on May 26 while playing for the Queensland Reds, will
have the operation in Sydney tomorrow after consulting with
specialists today, the ARU said in an e-mailed statement.  “While there is still some hope that Horwill may recover
in time to feature on the Wallabies spring tour in November, it
is more likely that he will not be ready to return until next
year’s Super Rugby competition,” the governing body said.  In Horwill’s absence during this month’s international Test
matches, openside flanker  David Pocock  led the Wallabies to a
suprise 9-6 loss to Scotland and a series win against Wales.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
