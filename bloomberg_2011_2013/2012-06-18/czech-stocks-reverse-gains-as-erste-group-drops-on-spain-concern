The Czech Republic’s equity index
reversed earlier gains, led by a drop in  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , as
Spanish yields rose to a euro-era record, overshadowing a
victory of Greek pro-bailout parties in general elections.  The  PX (PX)  gauge of 14 companies slid 0.2 percent to 883.40 at
3:23 p.m. in Prague, after earlier increasing as much as 1.1
percent. Austria’s Erste, which has a 17 percent weighting in
the Czech benchmark, dropped 2.2 percent to 360 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
