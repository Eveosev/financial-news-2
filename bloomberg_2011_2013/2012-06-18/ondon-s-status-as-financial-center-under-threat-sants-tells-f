London’s role as an international
financial center is at risk because business models aren’t
responding quickly enough to a new political and regulatory
reality, Hector Sants, the outgoing Financial Services Authority
chief executive officer told the Financial Times in an
interview.  Sants cautioned that banks, brokers and insurers all
require “radical re-engineering” over the following five years
to reflect changes in savings patterns, the movement of growth
to  emerging markets  and stricter rules on a range of things,
from capital and liquidity to remuneration and marketing,
according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
