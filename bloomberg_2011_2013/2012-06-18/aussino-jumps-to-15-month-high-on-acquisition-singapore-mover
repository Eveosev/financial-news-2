Aussino Group Ltd. (AUS)  surged toward its
highest level in more than 15 months after announcing an
acquisition that would transform the maker of towels and bed
linens into a petroleum retailer in Myanmar.  Aussino climbed 21 percent to 10.3  Singapore  cents as of
3:20 p.m. in Singapore, heading for its highest close since
February 2011. The company said it agreed to buy Max Strategic
Investments Pte, which plans to operate gas stations in Myanmar,
for S$60 million ($47 million) in an all-share deal.  “The proposed acquisition presents an opportunity for the
company to acquire a new operating business with growth
potential in an emerging market,” the company said in a
statement.  Myanmar is wooing companies to invest after about five
decades of military rule left it among  Asia ’s poorest countries.
The U.S. and European Union eased sanctions after April by-
elections gave  Aung San Suu Kyi ’s party 43 of 45 seats, allowing
it some representation in the 664-member parliament still
dominated by President Thein Sein.  The transaction constitutes a “reverse takeover” that
will result in a change for the company’s controlling
shareholder, according to the statement. Aussino’s existing
businesses will be divested upon completion of the acquisition,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
