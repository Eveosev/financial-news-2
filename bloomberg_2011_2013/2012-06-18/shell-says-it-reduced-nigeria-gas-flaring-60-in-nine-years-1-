Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , operator of
Nigeria’s largest oil fields, said the flaring, or burning, of
natural gas at its deposits in the West African country fell by
more than 60 percent in the past nine years.  “Flaring dropped by more than 60 percent from over 0.6
billion cubic feet of gas a day to about 0.2 billion cubic
feet,” the company said today in an e-mailed statement from
Lagos, the commercial capital. The decline followed investments
of more than $3 billion to build gathering facilities since
2000, Shell said.  Nigeria, holder of  Africa ’s largest  gas reserves  of more
than 187 trillion cubic feet, flares most of the fuel it
produces along with oil because it lacks the infrastructure to
process it. Shell has 17 gas projects, including the integration
of the Forcados oil and gas development, which will start in the
first quarter to 2015, the company said on its website. The
projects will cost  $6 billion  when completed, it said.  About 45 percent of  Nigeria ’s domestic gas demand is
provided by Shell, most of which is used to generate electricity
in Africa’s most populous nation. Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil
Corp., Total SA and Eni SpA are the other major suppliers.  Nigeria  is Africa’s top oil producer. Shell operates a
joint venture in the nation where it holds a 30 percent stake
and state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. owns 55
percent. Total has a 10 percent stake and Eni has 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
