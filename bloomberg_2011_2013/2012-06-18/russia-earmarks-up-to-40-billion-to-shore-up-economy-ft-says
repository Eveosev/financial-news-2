Russia has earmarked as much as $40
billion for this year and next to bolster its economy in the
event the euro-region crisis widens and spreads and is also
renewing a plan to permit the government to recapitalize the
nation’s banking system, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview with Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.  Siluanov said the government is planning to create a
reserve mechanism worth 500 billion rubles ($15.4 billion) for
2013 to provide for financing “anti-crisis measures,” the
newspaper said.  The FT cited the minister as saying that the amount would
include support for people who are “socially needy” and the
recreation of a 2009 program that was not implemented at that
time by which  government bonds  would be issued to recapitalize
banks in exchange for shares.  Siluanov was speaking ahead of the G-20 meeting in  Mexico ,
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
