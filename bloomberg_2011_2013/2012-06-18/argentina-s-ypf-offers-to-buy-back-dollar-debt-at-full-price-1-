YPF SA (YPFD) , the Argentine oil producer
that was seized by the government in April, is offering to buy
back dollar-denominated bonds after the takeover triggered a
change-of-control clause in the securities.  Investors have until July 6 to exercise the put option on
the debt due 2028 and will be paid at 100 cents on the dollar on
July 20, according to a notice sent to holders dated June 1.  The price on the securities has risen 2.5 cents this month
to 97 cents on June 15, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
Trace data show no trades today. YPF shares rose 1.3 percent
today to 75.50 pesos at 4:43 p.m. in  Buenos Aires .  A clause in the bonds’ prospectus says a put option may be
exercised if the Argentine government takes control of 49
percent or more of the company’s outstanding stock. President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  nationalized 51 percent of the
company in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
