Yunnan Tin Co. (000960) , the worldâ€™s largest
producer of the metal, is poised for the biggest gain in three
months in Shenzhen trading after announcing a special dividend
following a surge in profit.  The  stock  gained as much as 5.1 percent to 22  yuan , heading
for the biggest gain since March 19. The company ended the
morning session 4.6 percent higher at 21.82 yuan, beating the
0.6 percent gain in the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index.  Yunnan Tin will pay 1.30 yuan for every 10 shares held to
shareholders registered on June 21, the company said yesterday
in an exchange filing. The company is making the payment after
profit surged 92 percent to 703 million yuan ($111 million) last
year as tin prices rose and it increased sales of lead.  Tin prices on the London Metal Exchange averaged about
$25,996 a metric ton last year, up 27 percent from the year
before.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
