European stock futures advanced on
optimism  Greece  will stay in the euro after projections showed
pro-bailout parties won enough seats in yesterday’s election to
form a government with a workable majority. U.S. index futures
and Asian stocks also rose.  BHP Billiton Plc, the world’s biggest mining company,
rallied in Australian trading.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  may climb after ABG
Sundal advised buying the mobile-phone maker’s shares.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, a benchmark for the
euro area, jumped 1.8 percent to 2,204 at 7:06 a.m. in  London .
Contracts on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index expiring in September
increased 0.9 percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index climbed 0.4 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
increased 1.5 percent.  “The Greek election result signaled a green light for the
resumption of buying in higher-yielding assets,”  Tim Waterer ,
senior trader at CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote. “A messy Greek
exit is just something that financial markets do not want to
deal with right now, so traders had no hesitation in rejoicing
the pro-bailout party win.”  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index has dropped 11 percent
from its peak on March 16 and more than $5 trillion has been
erased from global equities on concern that the euro area’s
sovereign-debt crisis has triggered a slowdown in global
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
