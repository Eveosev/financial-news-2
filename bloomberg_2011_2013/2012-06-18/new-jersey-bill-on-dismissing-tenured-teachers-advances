A New Jersey Senate panel advanced
changes to tenure laws that would make it easier for
administrators to fire ineffective public-school teachers.  The measure, sponsored by Senator Teresa Ruiz, a Democrat
from  Newark  who heads the Senate Education Committee, was
approved unanimously today by the chamber’s budget panel.
Governor  Chris Christie , a 49-year-old Republican, has pushed
for similar changes since last year.  “We have been supportive of Senator Ruiz’s efforts on
tenure reform and will await the final bill,”  Michael Drewniak ,
a Christie spokesman, said by e-mail.  Under the Ruiz measure, school districts could strip
educators of tenure if they are deemed ineffective in two
consecutive performance reviews. The bill would also lengthen to
four years the time it would take to earn tenure.  “We are sending a great salute to the most important
profession in New Jersey,” Ruiz said in Trenton. “As a person
in my household who was the first to go to college, education
becomes a crucial tool, the most important.”  Ruiz said the legislation would set common teaching
standards statewide and would benefit students by ensuring they
have effective instructors. The bill next heads to the full
Senate. It must pass both legislative chambers to move to
Christie’s desk for consideration.  The state’s biggest teachers’ union, the  New Jersey 
Education Association, supports the bill in its current form.
President Barbara Keshishian cited the removal of a provision
that would have ended basing job cuts on seniority, a change
advocated by Christie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
