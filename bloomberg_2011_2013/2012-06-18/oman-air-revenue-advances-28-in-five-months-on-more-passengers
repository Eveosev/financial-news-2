Oman Air  increased passenger revenue
28 percent in the first five months of the year as the state-
owned carrier attracted more travellers.  The Middle Eastern carrier that serves 41 destinations
flew 19 percent more passengers, compared with a year earlier,
it said in an e-mailed statement today. Cargo revenue rose
47 percent.  The airline plans to start flights from the Omani capital
of Muscat to Tehran,  Iran , on Sept. 1 and is scheduled to
receive two Embraer E175 regional jets in the third and fourth
quarters this year. It has orders for six  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 planes
for delivery in 2014-15, in addition to six 787 Dreamliners from
the U.S. manufacturer planned to join the fleet starting 2015.  Chief Executive Officer Wayne Pearce said in an interview
in May that Oman Air was looking to add planes after a surge in
bookings to  Saudi Arabia ,  Thailand  and the  Indian subcontinent .  To contact the reporter on this story:
