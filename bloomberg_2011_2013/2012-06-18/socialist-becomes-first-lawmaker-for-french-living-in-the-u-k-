French Socialist party candidate
Axelle Lemaire was elected as the first lawmaker to represent
the French citizens living in the U.K. at the National Assembly
in Paris.  Lemaire, 37, a London mother of two, won 54.6 percent of
the votes in the constituency that includes the U.K. in Sunday’s
French parliamentary elections, which expatriates were allowed
to take part in for the first time. She ran against UMP
candidate Emmanuelle Savarit, also a Londoner.  “I’m told the floor is mine,” Lemaire, a former lawyer,
said on her Twitter account late yesterday. “So a huge merci to
those who believed in me, to my team and to voters. Pride,
responsibility.”  Lemaire’s chance of victory in the district was boosted
after  Francois Hollande  beat  Nicolas Sarkozy , in the May 6
election, taking 50.8 percent of the British vote. The French
voters living in the U.K. represent about 80 percent of the
registered voters in the constituency, which also includes
countries such as Norway and Ireland.  Lemaire’s victory shows that the U.K.’s French community,
once dominated by mathematicians and City dealmakers, has grown
broader as it has increased in size. There are 300,000 to
400,000 French people in the U.K., making it the sixth or
seventh-largest French city. Their numbers began swelling in the
mid-1990s, when the cross-channel Eurostar rail service opened,
linking Paris and London in about three hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
