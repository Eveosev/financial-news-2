Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the largest daily
coupon website, rose the most in a month after Morgan Stanley
analysts upgraded the stock to overweight from equalweight,
citing international sales opportunities.  Groupon advanced 11 percent to $11.15 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest jump since May 14. The Chicago-based
company’s shares have fallen 44 percent since an intial public
offering in November.  The coupon site, which generates revenue by selling
discounts -- known as Groupons -- from businesses such as
restaurants and nail salons, is trying to rebuild investor
confidence after losing about $5.8 billion in market value since
the IPO. Revenue in the first quarter increased 89 percent to
$559.3 million, with international accounting for 57 percent of
sales during the period.  “Groupon has deployed systems in the U.S. that enhance its
ability to send relevant and personalized deals,” which helped
the company accelerate revenue growth in the first quarter,
analysts  Scott Devitt  and Zachary Arrick, wrote in an investor
note. “We view Groupon extending these systems to its
international regions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
