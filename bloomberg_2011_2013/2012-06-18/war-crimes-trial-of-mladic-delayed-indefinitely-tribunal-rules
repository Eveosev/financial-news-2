The war crimes trial of former
Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic has been suspended until
further notice, according to a  statement  on the website of the
Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
 Yugoslavia .  The trial delay began in May because of an error in the
disclosure of documents to the defense and had been scheduled to
resume on June 25, according to  information on the Tribunal
website . It is now delayed indefinitely, according to the
statement.  The full decision and reasoning will be made public in due
course, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
