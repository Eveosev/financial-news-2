Group of 20 nations are discussing a
mix of measures to secure the global recovery that will include
deficit reduction for some countries and pledges for additional
stimulus by others with sounder finances, a Canadian official
said.  G-20 officials at Los Cabos,  Mexico , were still negotiating
last night the language to be used in their communique to be
issued at the summit’s conclusion. The talks included
discussions over budget issues that are similar to those that
took place at the summit in Cannes,  France  last year, the
official told reporters on condition of anonymity.  At  Cannes , G-20 countries made varying commitments to
support the global economy, with some European countries
pledging to reduce deficits while  emerging markets  and those
with healthier finances saying they’d boost demand if needed.
G-20 leaders will issue a statement at the end of their two-day
summit in Los Cabos on June 19.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti , speaking to reporters
upon his arrival to the beach resort, said growth will be an
“important theme” at the summit.  “I think we are getting closer to a common position,”
Monti said.  Canada was pushing for language in the communique that
would call for European nations to take strong action, the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
