China National Petroleum Corp. and
its partners will raise output at  Iraq ’s Halfaya oil field
sevenfold in the first week of July, the director general of the
Iraqi state Missan Oil Co. said.  Production will rise to 70,000 barrels a day from 10,000
barrels currently, Ali Muarej said today in a telephone
interview. The increase in output is ahead of schedule, he said.  CNPC and partners Paris-based  Total SA (FP)  and Petroliam
Nasional Bhd., the Malaysian  oil company  known as Petronas, have
drilled 22 wells in Halfaya where production is forecast to
increase to 535,000 barrels a day by 2017, he said.  Missan Oil Co. is Iraq’s third-largest state-owned oil
company and oversees Halfaya. CNPC has a 50 percent share in the
project, while Total and Petronas each own 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
