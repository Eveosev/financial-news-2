The European Commission has only
narrow scope to offer  Greece  more flexibility regarding its
fulfillment of bailout conditions, the EU Budget Commissioner
Janusz Lewandowski told the  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  The commission has already shown flexibility toward Greece
and the country must adhere to its savings targets to receive
more aid, Lewandowski is cited as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
