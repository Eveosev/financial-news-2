Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , owner of the most
popular U.S. Internet portal, has appointed  Google (GOOG)  Inc.’s
Michael Barrett as chief revenue officer as the company looks
for new areas of growth under interim leader  Ross Levinsohn .  Barrett will be responsible for advertising revenue and
operations globally, Yahoo said in a statement. Barrett, who
will report directly to Levinsohn, was chief executive officer
of AdMeld, acquired by Google last year for about $400 million.  Levinsohn took the position of interim CEO last month after
Scott Thompson resigned following an inquiry into errors in his
academic record. Thompson had come on board in January after his
predecessor, Carol Bartz, was fired from her job amid Sunnyvale,
California-based Yahoo’s struggles to keep pace with online
digital advertising rivals Google and  Facebook Inc. (FB)   “Barrett is regarded as one of the most successful and
influential executives in media and technology,” Levinsohn said
in the statement. “His deep industry experience and
relationships will help us drive our strategic vision.”  Barrett, who will join in July, helped lead Google’s
integration of AdMeld, a provider of technology services to Web
publishers for managing online advertising. Barrett, who joined
AdMeld in 2008, previously was executive vice president at News
Corp.’s Fox Interactive Media, according to the statement. He
worked closely with Levinsohn, a former president of Fox
Interactive Media, the company said. Barrett also held earlier
positions at AOL Inc. and Yahoo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
