U.K. 10-year gilts rose for a third
day as Spanish borrowing costs surged to more than 7 percent
after  Greece ’s weekend election failed to reassure investors
that the debt crisis will be contained.  Two-year note yields slipped to a record following the
release of a report that showed bad loans at Spanish lenders
jumped in March, boosting demand for the relative safety of U.K.
debt. The pro-bailout  New Democracy  and Pasok parties won enough
seats to control Greece’s 300-member legislature should they
form a coalition government. Anti-bailout party Syriza came in
second behind New Democracy. Sterling weakened against the
dollar.  “The relief rally after the Greek election was short-
lived,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA
Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Demand for gilts and other
core bonds is underpinned by the fact that there are still a lot
of hurdles in  Europe . People look at Spanish bond yields and
they start to wonder whether the country will need a sovereign
bailout.”  Ten-year yields fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 1.66 percent at 4:28 p.m. London time. The 4 percent
security due March 2022 rose 0.04, 40 pence per 1,000-pound
($1,565) fact amount, to 120.90. Two-year  yields  rose three
basis points to 0.25 percent after dropping to 0.17 percent.  While gilts handed investors a 1 percent loss this month,
they outperformed German securities, which fell 1.5 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Sterling Falls  Spain ’s 10-year yield climbed 29 basis points to 7.16
percent, after rising to 7.29 percent, the most since the euro
was introduced in 1999. The nation requested as much as 100
billion euros ($126 billion) of aid to support its banks on June
9.  The pound strengthened 0.2 percent to 80.27 pence per euro.
It gained 0.6 percent last week as investors shifted out of the
euro before the Greek election. The U.K. currency lost 0.4
percent to $1.5652.  Sterling has appreciated 1.9 percent this year, the second-
best performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, after the  New Zealand
dollar , as investors sought U.K. assets as a haven from Europe’s
debt crisis. The euro dropped 2.3 percent.  Futures traders increased their bets that the British pound
will decline against the  U.S. dollar , figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on
June 15.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the pound compared with
those on a gain was 23,112 on June 12, compared with net shorts
of 2,867 a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
