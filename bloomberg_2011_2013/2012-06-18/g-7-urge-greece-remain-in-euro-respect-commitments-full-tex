The following is a reformatted
version of a joint statement by the Group of Seven, released
late yesterday. Leaders from the Group of 20, which includes the
G-7, meet today in Los Cabos,  Mexico .  Taking note of the Greek elections, we look forward to
working with the next government of  Greece , and believe that it
is in all our interests for Greece to remain in the euro area
while respecting its commitments. We welcome the commitment of
the euro area to work in partnership with the next Greek
government to ensure they remain on the path to reform and
sustainability within the euro area.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
