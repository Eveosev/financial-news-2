Morgan Stanley (MS)  appointed Salvatore
Orlacchio as head of European fixed-income sales to replace
Darragh McCarthy, who left after 18 years with the New York-
based bank.  Orlacchio, who became head of European rate sales last
year, will report to London-based Robert Rooney, who is head of
fixed income for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and global
head of fixed-income client coverage, according to Sebastian
Howell, a Morgan Stanley spokesman in London.  McCarthy was relocated to London last year from New York,
where he held positions including U.S. head of fixed-income
sales.  Morgan Stanley’s fixed-income underwriting business
generated $1.36 billion in  revenue  last year, 32 percent of the
company’s investment-banking total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
