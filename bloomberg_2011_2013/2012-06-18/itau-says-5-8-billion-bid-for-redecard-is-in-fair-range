Redecard SA (RDCD3) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest
card-payment company, rose the most in more than four months
after a second appraisal of  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) ’s 11.8
billion-real ($5.7 billion) offer to take the company private is
in line with a previous assessment.  Redecard gained 5.2 percent to 33.36 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , the biggest gain since Feb. 7, when Itau
announced its bid. It was the second-best performance on the
benchmark  Bovespa index , which rose 0.2 percent. Itau fell 0.7
percent to 30 reais.  “The chances of Redecard’s tender offer succeeding have
now increased,” Francisco Kops and Rafael Ferraz, analysts at
Banco J.Safra in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note to clients today.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , which conducted the second
appraisal at the request of a minority Redecard investor,
calculated shares to be worth from 34.66 reais to 38.12 reais,
according to a regulatory filing after markets closed on June
15. Itau,  Latin America ’s largest bank by market value, said its
35-real offer is therefore “accounted for” by the appraisal,
according to a June 16 e-mailed statement from the Sao Paulo-
based lender.  Lazard Asset Management LLC, which owns 10 percent of
Redecard, requested a second appraisal in April, arguing that
the first, by NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd., undervalued the
company. Rothschild valued the stock at between 34.18 reais and
37.59 reais, according to an April 5 regulatory filing by
Redecard. The bank achieved the range using a free-cash-flow
calculation and another one based on the share price of  Cielo
SA (CIEL3) , Redecard’s larger competitor.  Itau’s Plans  Itau, which is Redecard’s  largest  shareholder with a 50
percent stake, declined to comment on whether it would change
its offer to take Redecard private. The bank previously said it
had no plans to raise its offer and may give up its buyout plan
entirely, according to an April 30 filing. Lazard is the second-
biggest investor.  “We expect Itau to proceed with its tender offer,”  Mario Pierry , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in an e-mailed
report. “Minorities do not have many options, as Itau’s 35
reais offered price is within the valuation range of both
Rothschild and Credit Suisse.”  Before today, Redecard had  fallen 1.1 percent  in Sao Paulo
since Itau announced the offering Feb. 7, compared with a gain
of 22 percent for Cielo. Brazil’s benchmark stock index dropped
14 percent in the same period.  2007 IPO  The card-payment processor and its shareholders raised 4.07
billion reais selling 150.8 million shares at 27 reais each in
an initial public offering in July 2007. In March 2008,
Citigroup Inc. sold 40.69 million Redecard shares at 26 reais
each in a public offering of 1.06 billion reais. The New York-
based bank sold another 82 million Redecard shares at 24.50
reais, raising 2.01 billion reais, in March 2009.  On Feb. 7, Credit Suisse equity analyst  Marcelo Telles 
wrote in a note to clients that he considered Itau’s offer to be
fair.  To contact the reporter on this story:
