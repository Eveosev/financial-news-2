Germany should end mandatory rebates
and price limits on drugs now that its insurers are profitable,
Hanspeter Spek, president of global operations at  Sanofi (SAN) , said
in an interview with the newspaper  Der Tagesspiegel  today.  The French drugmaker aims to derive 40 percent of sales
from  emerging markets  by 2017, Spek told the newspaper. Revenue
from emerging economies was more than 10 billion euros ($12.7
billion) in 2011 and should grow about 10 percent annually over
the next five years, he said in the interview. The biggest sales
growth potential is in China, followed by Russia, Brazil and
Mexico, he was cited as saying.  The Paris-based company has 2 billion euros to 3 billion
euros to spend on acquisitions and wants to expand in diabetes
and animal medicine, Spek told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
