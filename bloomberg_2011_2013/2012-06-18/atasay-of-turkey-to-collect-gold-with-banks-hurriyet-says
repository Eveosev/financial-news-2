Atasay, a Turkish jewelry maker,
will work with  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS, the country’s biggest bank
by assets, and  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the biggest listed
bank by market value, to collect gold jewelry from the public to
be stored in gold deposit accounts,  Hurriyet newspaper  reported.  Atasay’s 400 shops in Turkey will hand certificates for
gold jewelry brought in by customers who open gold deposit
accounts for the equivalent Turkish lira amount at the banks,
Hurriyet said, citing Atasay chairman Cihan Kamer.  Atasay is also in talks with Turkiye Halk Bankası AS, the
largest listed state-run bank, TC Ziraat Bankasi AS, the biggest
state-owned bank and  Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , a lender taken over by
Russia’s  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , to start similar arrangements, Kamer
said, according to the Istanbul-based newspaper. Banking
industry deposits have declined over the past year.  Turks have about 5,000 metric tons of gold “stashed under
their pillows,” Ozcan Halac, head of the Istanbul Gold
Exchange, said in a Bloomberg HT interview on March 7.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
