makes up more than 7 percent of the index, gained for a second

worsen the debt crisis that threatens demand.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL) 
, the world’s biggest commodity producer, added 1.9
percent to 240.49 rand.  Ellies Holdings Ltd. (ELI)  , jumped to the highest since

324.5 rand. The company’s Tanzanian unit posted a 37 percent
increase in full-year profit as sales jumped.  Woolworths Holdings Ltd. (WHL)  , a South African food and
clothing retailer, advanced 2.1 percent to 49.92 rand, its first
gain in four days. The FTSE/JSE Africa General Retailers Index
rose to the highest since at least 1995 as bets increased the

lowest in more than 30 years, encouraging spending by
households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
