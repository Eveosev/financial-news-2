Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell for a
fifth day, pushing the yield to the highest level this month, on
speculation an increase in interbank rates is damping demand for
 government securities . The dong was steady.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  rose for an eighth day,
adding seven basis points to 4.47 percent, according to data
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It has surged 3.02 percentage
points in June.  “The rebound in  interest rates  on the interbank market
raises the risk of holding long-term bonds,” Nguyen Duy Phong,
a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co.,
wrote in a research note today.  The yield on the five-year bonds increased two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.63 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest
level since May 30.  The dong was little changed at 20,965 per dollar as of 2:10
p.m. in Hanoi, compared with 20,958 on June 15, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
