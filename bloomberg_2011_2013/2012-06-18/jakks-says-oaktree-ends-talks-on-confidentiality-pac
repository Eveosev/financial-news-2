Jakks Pacific Inc. (JAKK)  said Oaktree
Capital Management LP ended negotiations on a confidentiality
and standstill agreement about a potential takeover of the
toymaker.  Oaktree is unwilling to accept terms Jakks has asked for
and remains open to future discussions, according to a letter
Malibu, California-based Jakks included in a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filing today.  Jakks agreed in April to meet with Los Angeles-based
Oaktree and said it would add two independent directors. Sales
at the maker of action figures, electronics and dolls have
fallen for three straight years.  Jakks dropped 0.5 percent to $18.53 on June 15. The  shares 
have gained 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
