China Mengniu Dairy Co. (2319) , the
country’s largest milk producer, rose the most in 14 months in
 Hong Kong  trading after saying Denmark’s Arla Foods amba plans
to buy a 6 percent stake.  The shares climbed 6.8 percent to close at HK$21.15, the
most since April 4 last year. The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose
1 percent.  Mengniu Dairy will develop and market Arla Foods’ products
in China and other countries, and was also selected to set up a
China-Denmark milk technology center, according to the company.
The investment by Arla, the Nordic region’s biggest milk
producer, comes as China set up new measures to improve food
safety and  Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co. (600887)  recalled
some baby formula after finding abnormal levels of mercury.  The agreements coincide with a visit to  Denmark  by Chinese
President Hu Jintao last week. Arla said it will invest 1.7
billion kroner ($289 million) in China, including the
acquisition of about 6 percent in Mengniu, to help boost sales
in the nation fivefold by 2016. Last year Arla’s revenue from
China was about 700 million kroner.  The companies didn’t provide pricing details for the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
