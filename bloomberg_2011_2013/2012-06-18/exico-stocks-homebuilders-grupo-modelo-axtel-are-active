The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico City trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IPC index  rose 0.9 percent to 38,060.82.  A beermaker and a phone company were among the worst-
performing companies on the benchmark index amid concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening after Spanish bond yields
climbed to a euro-era record.  Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC)  , Mexico’s largest brewer,
fell 1.8 percent to 95.99 pesos.  Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO)  ,
Mexico’s second-largest land-line phone company, declined 2.9
percent to 2.71 pesos.  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
confidence index rose to 29 in the U.S., the highest since May
2007, from a revised 28 in May that was lower than first
estimated. The gauge exceeded the median estimate of 28 among
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  , Mexico’s largest
homebuilder by sales, climbed 2.6 percent to 29.60 pesos.  Corp.
GEO SAB (GEOB)  , Mexico’s second-largest homebuilder, advanced
2.8 percent to 12.72 pesos.  Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB (URBI*)  , Mexico’s third-largest homebuilder, rose 0.8 percent to
11.22 pesos.  Grupo Elektra SA (ELEKTRA*)  , the retail and banking
company controlled by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas , plunged 8
percent to 408.79 pesos amid growing speculation it will exit
the benchmark index. Elektra has plummeted 68 percent since
April 11, when the Mexican stock exchange changed its
requirements for eligibility on the benchmark gauge, saying
shares tied up in derivative instruments couldn’t be counted
toward the free-float prerequisite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
