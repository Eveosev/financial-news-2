Oak Investment Partners  and Gobi
Partners said a  New York  state judge granted their requests to
attach $60 million in assets they claim they’re owed by
 VisionChina Media Inc. (VISN)  in a breach-of-contract lawsuit.  The venture-capital firms say VisionChina, an operator of a
mobile television advertising network, made baseless fraud
allegations against them to avoid paying for its 2010
acquisition of Digital Media Group Ltd., a company in which they
owned shares, according to court documents.  “It is undisputed that VisionChina failed to remit the
deferred payments,” Justice Charles Ramos wrote in a June 15
ruling in Manhattan, Oak and Gobi said in a statement today.  Colin Wang, a spokesman for VisionChina, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mailed message seeking comment on the ruling and
didn’t answer a telephone call after business hours in Shenzhen,
 China .  Ramos refused to rule completely for Oak and Gobi in the
16-page decision, finding that VisonChina may have valid
defenses to the breach-of-contract claims.  “At the very least, these assertions raise triable issues
of fact sufficient to defeat” Oak’s and Gobi’s requests for
partial summary judgment, the judge said.  The case is Shareholder Representative Services v.
VisionChina Media, 650526-2011, New York State Supreme Court,
New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
