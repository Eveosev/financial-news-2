The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26
raw materials rose 0.3 percent to 1,433.45, led by natural gas.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24  prices  fell 0.2
percent to settle at 581.45 at 3:45 p.m. in  New York .  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas surged to the highest in more than three weeks
on speculation that hotter-than-normal weather will boost demand
from  power plants  to run air conditioners.  Commodity Weather Group LLC in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said
that many cities in the Midwest and East this week will have the
hottest conditions so far in 2012.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gas futures for July
delivery rose 6.8 percent to $2.635 per million British thermal
units, the highest settlement since May 24.  U.K. gas for next-day delivery was little changed as
pipeline imports from  Norway  and the Netherlands dropped amid a
decline in demand.  Gas climbed 0.03 pence, or 0.1 percent, to 54.43 pence a
therm at 3:44 p.m.  London  time. That’s equivalent to $8.53 per
million British thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn surged the most since March on signs that unusually
hot, dry weather is eroding crop conditions in the main growing
region of the U.S., the world’s largest producer and exporter.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for December
delivery jumped 5.5 percent to $5.34 a bushel, the biggest gain
for a most-active contract since March 30.  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 1.9 percent to
$13.3925 a bushel.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 3.3 percent to
$6.725 a bushel.  LIVESTOCK  Hog prices climbed the most this month on signs of
increasing demand for U.S. pork.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for August
settlement increased 2.2 percent to 93.225 cents a pound, the
biggest gain since May 31.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 1.1 percent to
$1.17975 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.1
percent to $1.56125 a pound.  BASE METALS  Copper gained for the fourth straight session after U.S.
builder confidence at a five-year high helped ease concerns that
a deepening debt crisis in  Europe  signals lower demand.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for September
delivery increased 0.4 percent to $3.4025 a pound.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months was little changed at $7,510 a metric ton ($3.41 a
pound).  Aluminum, nickel, tin, lead and zinc fell in London.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell, ending the longest rally in almost 10 months, as
the dollar rebounded and pro-bailout parties won enough seats to
control  Greece ’s parliament, curbing demand for the precious
metal as an alternative investment.  On the Comex, gold futures for August delivery fell 0.1
percent to $1,627 an ounce.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
July delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,484.10 an ounce. Palladium
futures for September delivery advanced 0.4 percent to $633.15
an ounce.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil dropped for the first time in three sessions on
concern that the worsening  European debt crisis  will slow global
economic growth, reducing energy demand.  On the Nymex, oil futures for July delivery fell 0.9
percent to $83.27 a barrel.  Brent oil for August settlement dropped 1.6 percent to
$96.04 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Morgan Stanley purchased a cargo of North Sea Forties blend
from Statoil ASA at a lower price than the previous session.
Gunvor Group Ltd. sought to sell Russian Urals at a smaller
discount to Dated Brent than the last trade in the
Mediterranean.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest producer, will boost its
daily crude exports for August to the highest in six months, a
preliminary loading plan obtained by Bloomberg showed.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline slipped as increasing Spanish borrowing costs
indicated concern that Europe’s debt crisis may widen,
threatening economic growth and fuel demand.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for July delivery fell 1.5
percent to $2.6609 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for July delivery slid 1.1 percent to
$2.6177 a gallon.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee futures fell to a two-year low on concern that the
faltering economy in Europe will curb demand.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, arabica coffee for
