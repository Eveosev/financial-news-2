Azerbaijan accused  Turkmenistan  of
starting exploration at the disputed Kapaz deposit in the
 Caspian Sea  and said it would take “appropriate measures” if
the Central Asian nation didn’t stop.  The Turkmen ambassador in Baku, Toyly Komekov, was summoned
to the Azeri Foreign Ministry today and handed a protest note
over the exploration work, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement. Exploration at the field, also known as Serdar,
before a resolution of the dispute violates an agreement signed
by the two countries in 2008, according to the statement.  Azerbaijan “strongly protested the Turkmen side and said
that Turkmenistan’s illegal activities are unacceptable,” the
ministry said. “Azerbaijan preserves the right to take
appropriate measures to defend its sovereign rights in the
Caspian.”  The five littoral states,  Russia , Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan and Iran, have failed to agree on the maritime
boundaries of the Caspian Sea after the disintegration of the
former Soviet Union in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
