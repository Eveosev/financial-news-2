OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
producer, won an injunction preventing any move by OAO Phosagro
to reduce or suspend apatite-concentrate supplies until a court
case into a contract dispute is heard.  Acron won the order against Phosagro’s  Apatit  unit on June
15, the Velikiy Novgorod-based producer said today in a
statement. It’s seeking to uphold a contract to buy the mineral
at a price of 3,671.36 rubles ($113.16) a metric ton this year.  Phosagro will appeal the decision, the company’s press
service said today by e-mail, adding that it will observe the
ruling in the interim. The company plans to agree on a supply
schedule with Acron shortly, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
