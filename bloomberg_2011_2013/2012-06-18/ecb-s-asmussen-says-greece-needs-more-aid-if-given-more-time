European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said any proposal to give  Greece 
more time means it will need more aid.  “As long as a country has a primary deficit,” giving it
more time to meet its fiscal targets automatically means “that
there is an additional external financing need,” Asmussen said
at a panel discussion in Berlin today.  Greek election winner Antonis Samaras is seeking to build a
coalition to keep aid flowing after key rival, anti-bailout
party Syriza, rejected his offer to join a government. The vote
forced Greeks, in a fifth year of recession, to choose open-
ended austerity to stay in the euro or reject the terms of a
bailout and risk the turmoil of exiting the union.  The so-called troika of representatives from the ECB,
 International Monetary Fund  and European Commission will visit
Greece as soon as a government has been formed, Asmussen said.  Greece’s primary deficit, which excludes interest payments,
was 2.4 billion euros in the year’s first five months, down from
4.6 billion euros a year ago, the Athens-based  Finance Ministry 
said June 12. The target was 4.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
