(Corrects date of sentencing to June 22 from June 21 in

was found guilty of terrorism charges for communications he had
with a rebel leader and faces as many as 10 years in prison,
Judge Mulugeta Kidane said today.  Abdirahman Sheikh Hassan will be sentenced on June 22 for
participating in the activities of the banned Ogaden National
Liberation Front, Mulugeta said today in the Federal High Court
Third Criminal Bench in the capital,  Addis Ababa . The conviction
is based on intercepted phone conversations, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
