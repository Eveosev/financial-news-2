The Bovespa stock index fluctuated,
with the gauge heading to a weekly advance, as companies
reported lower-than-forecast earnings, offsetting a gain for oil
producers.  Beef producer  JBS SA (JBSS3)  and homebuilder MRV Engenharia &
Participacoes SA tumbled after fourth-quarter earnings trailed
analysts’ estimates and unemployment rose last month. Oil
companies OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA and  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  rose as crude climbed for a fourth day.  The Bovespa fell 0.1 percent to 67,717.21 at 10:45 a.m. New
York time, after earlier rising as much as 0.3 percent. The
measure is up 1.2 percent this week. Thirty-nine stocks gained
on the index, while 29 fell. The real was little changed at 1.66
per  U.S. dollar .  “Unemployment data shows the economy is slowing down,”
said Rodrigo Mello, who helps manage 260 million reais as
partner at Oren Investimentos in Rio de Janeiro. “Less growth
with higher  interest rates  and inflation will hurt some
companies harder than others. Those issues are especially
important for homebuilders.”  Unemployment in February rose to 6.4 percent from 6.1
percent in January, higher than the median forecast of 6.3
percent from 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The pace of  job creation  may slow in coming months as
higher borrowing costs and steps to curb  consumer credit  take
effect, the central bank said in the minutes of its March 1-2
meeting.  Higher Rates?  Traders are wagering that policy makers will raise
borrowing costs by 0.5 percentage point for a third straight
meeting, to 12.25 percent, on April 20, to cool inflation that
is close to the top of the central bank’s target range,
according to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures.  MRV reported fourth-quarter net income of 152.1 million
reais, below a 202 million reais forecast by JPMorgan Chase &
Co. The shares dropped 5 percent to 13.39 reais, the most since
Feb. 28.  JBS fell 3 percent to 5.90 reais, the most since Feb. 4.
The company had a fourth-quarter net loss of 145.7 million
reais, compared with net income of 127.9 million reais a year
earlier. The meat producer was expected to report a loss of
102.3 million reais excluding some items, according to the
average estimate of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey. JBS
fell 1.3 percent to 6 reais. average estimate of three analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Oil Rises  JBS paid 521.9 million reais in December to  Brazil ’s
development bank, known as BNDES, after it delayed an IPO of its
U.S. unit. In 2009, BNDES purchased $2 billion of bonds from JBS
in a private placement that gave the bank the right to either
convert the debt into shares of the U.S. unit or the parent
company. JBS paid the fee to extend the deadline into 2011. The
real strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.6580 per U.S. dollar.  Oil gained as much as 0.9 percent as fighting in  Libya 
heightened concern that Middle East exports will decline. Crude
rose as the U.K. launched further attacks by submarine against
Libyan air-defense systems. Libyan government troops increased
military action, killing 16 people yesterday in the towns of
Misrata and Zentan, an opposition spokesman said. of the U.S.
unit’s initial public offering.  Petroleo Brasileiro was little changed at 28.61 after
rising as much as 0.6 percent earlier. OGX advanced 1.6 percent
to 19.89 reais.  Embraer Agreement  Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-largest aircraft maker,
gained 1.4 percent to 14.04 reais. The company signed an
agreement with ABC Financial Leasing Co., which may provide as
much as $1.5 billion in loans for aircraft sales in  China  and
other countries over the next five years. Embraer announced the
memorandum of understanding with the unit of  Agricultural Bank
of China  in an e-mailed statement.  The Bovespa lost 2.2 percent this year through yesterday
after homebuilders and banks retreated on concern rising
inflation will limit growth, outweighing gains in oil and steel
producers. The index trades at 10.6 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares to a ratio of 13.7 for the Shanghai Composite Index,
7.2 for  Russia ’s Micex, and 16.7 for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
