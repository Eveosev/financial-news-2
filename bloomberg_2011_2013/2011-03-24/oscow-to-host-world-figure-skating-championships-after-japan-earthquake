The world figure skating
championships, originally scheduled for this week in Tokyo, will
be switched to Moscow as  Japan  deals with the aftermath of the
earthquake and tsunami, the  International Skating Union  said.  “In the light of the dramatic situation in Japan the
staging of sporting events becomes relatively secondary and a
solution satisfying all involved is extremely difficult,” the
ISU said in a statement on its  website . “Nevertheless, it is
in the best interest of the ISU and its members to hold the
championships as soon as possible.”  Japan’s Daisuke Takahashi is the men’s defending world
champion, while his compatriot Mao Asada is the title-holder in
the women’s event.  Moscow will host the championships from April 24 through
May 1. They had initially been scheduled for March 21-27 at the
Yoyogi National Gymnasium in  Tokyo , 135 miles (217 kilometers)
from the stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic complex.  The official death toll from the 9.0 magnitude quake and
ensuing tsunami that struck Japan 13 days ago rose to 9,737,
while 16,501 were still missing as of 3 p.m. local time today,
according to the  National Police Agency  in Tokyo. The Japanese
government has restricted shipments of milk, spinach and other
vegetables in Fukushima and neighboring prefectures as radiation
from the damaged reactors contaminated agricultural products.  The ISU on March 14 called off the Tokyo event because of
safety concerns and after consultation with the Japan Skating
Federation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
