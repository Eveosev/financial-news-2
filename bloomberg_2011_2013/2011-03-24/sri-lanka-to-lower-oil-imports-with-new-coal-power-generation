Sri Lanka  plans to reduce its
annual oil imports to 20 billion barrels from 30 billion barrels
as it begins electricity generation from a new coal-power plant,
Treasury Secretary P.B. Jayasundera said in the capital  Colombo 
today.  Sri Lankaâ€™s reduced oil bill will ease the burden on its
balance of payments, Jayasundera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
