Enagas SA, the operator of  Spain ’s
natural-gas grid, forecasts domestic demand this year will climb
1.5 percent from 2010, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Llarden
said.  “Demand for natural gas will increase 1.5 percent in
2011,” Llarden told reporters at a briefing in  Madrid  today.
“We aim to provide an update of this figure in June.”  Winter demand for gas rose 1.5 percent from the same period
a year ago, Llarden said, reaching a consumption record both in
December and January.  The Medgaz pipeline, which will transport natural gas from
 Algeria  to Spain, will begin operating in April, Enagas said.
There’s a need for more connections to transport fuel between
European countries, it said. The company has no plans to acquire
any gas assets at the moment, according to Llarden.  Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa, Cajastur and Caja Murcia, through
Sagane Inversiones SL, each have 5 percent stakes in  Enagas. (ENG) 
Bancaja Inversiones SA last month sold its 5 percent stake in
the company. Enagas, which has 72 percent of shareholders
outside Spain, doesn’t expect any of the savings banks to sell
their stakes, Llarden said.  “I’m happy with our institutional investors,” he said.
“I don’t expect them to sell their stakes but if it happens, it
wouldn’t affect us at all.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
