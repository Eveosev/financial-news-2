A Bulgarian bank robber released
all five hostages and an injured guard after holding up an
Investbank AD branch in the southern city of Sliven, Interior
Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said.  The holdup marked  Bulgaria ’s worst recent hostage crisis
and started around 4 p.m. yesterday, Tsvetanov said in an
interview with radio Hoizont in Sofia today.  The assailant released overnight four female bank employees
and let the guard, who was shot, be taken to hospital, Tsvetanov
said. A fifth hostage, also a guard, was released later today.  “The hostage drama is over,” Bulgarian Prime Minister
 Boiko Borissov  told reporters in parliament in Sofia today.
“Hoping he is listening to radios, I urge him surrender.”  Borissov thanked the robber for keeping his word and
releasing the women and offered a guarantee he wouldn’t be shot
or mistreated by police if he surrendered.  Investbank is Bulgaria’s 16th biggest by assets among 30
lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
