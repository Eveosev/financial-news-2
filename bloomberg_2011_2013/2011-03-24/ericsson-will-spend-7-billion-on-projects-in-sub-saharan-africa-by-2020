Ericcson AB plans to spend about $7
billion on projects in sub-Saharan  Africa  by 2020, Jonas
Stringberg, the company’s chief financial officer for the
region, said.  The Stockholm-based company sees an opportunity in Africa
for mobile devices because of the poor connectivity of fixed-
line phones, Stringberg said today at a conference in Gaborone,
Botswana’s capital.  The company, part of a business delegation from Sweden
visiting the southern African country, is doing research on how
to boost connectivity in rural communites in  Kenya , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
