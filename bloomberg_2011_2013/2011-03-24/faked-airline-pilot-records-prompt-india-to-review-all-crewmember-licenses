India  is reviewing the licenses of
all of the 4,000-plus airline pilots working in the country, as
police investigate at least 18 people suspected of using forged
documents to win promotions or certification.  Every captain is being “systematically” verified,
followed by co-pilots and other license-holders, Director
General of Civil Aviation E.K. Bharat Bhushan said today by
phone from  New Delhi . The industry regulator is also planning to
announce improvements in its policies and procedures in about 10
days’ time, he said without elaborating.  New Delhi Police have also started investigating government
officials to determine whether they helped pilots use faked
records, Deputy Commissioner Ashok Chand said in an interview
yesterday. The scandal, following similar cases in China,
highlights the competition for qualified pilots in fast-growing
emerging markets.  “All of them will be seen as culprits unless proved
otherwise,” said Pattabhi Raman, director of  Rajiv Gandhi
Aviation Academy , which is in the southern state of  Andhra
Pradesh . “Flying is not a joke. People’s lives are involved.”  Air India , IndiGo  In New Delhi, one pilot each from Air India Ltd. and IndiGo
have been arrested for using forged paperwork to win promotions,
Chand said. Another three, including one more from closely held
IndiGo, are being investigated, he said. All five were properly
qualified co-pilots, he said. The pilots face up to seven years
in jail on charges including forgery, Chand said.  Nationwide, there were 4,084 pilots, including expatriates,
in India as of Jan. 1, 2010, according to government data.  Jet Airways (India) Ltd., the nation’s biggest carrier,
fell 1 percent to 435.15 rupees in Mumbai trading, reversing
earlier gains.  SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET) , a discount carrier, fell 0.4
percent. The benchmark Sensex Index gained 0.8 percent.  State-owned Air India has grounded two pilots and is
investigating “around a dozen,” it said in an e-mailed reply
to Bloomberg News questions. IndiGo, the nation’s biggest
discount carrier, has stopped two from flying, it said in an e-
mailed statement.  “We are treating this matter with utmost seriousness,” it
said. “There can be absolutely no compromise on safety.”  SpiceJet said March 18 it had fired two pilots after being
told by the regulator that the crewmembers had inflated flying
hours to get licenses. The carrier is helping with an
investigation, it said.  “If they are reviewing every license and every document,
that’s fair,” said Rishabh Kapur, general secretary of the
Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association. “Also, they should find
out what the flaw is and who is responsible for finally clearing
these documents.”  Rajasthan Probe  In Rajasthan state, five pilots have been arrested and
eight more are being sought on suspicion of using faked records
to win licenses without performing the mandatory amount of
training, Ajit Singh, additional director general, Rajasthan
Police, said by phone yesterday. Two flying-school officials
have also been detained, he said.  The aviation regulator has suspended the licenses of all of
the pilots involved in the New Delhi and Rajasthan cases, which
aren’t directly linked, Bhushan said.  An investigation in  China  in 2008 found 192 pilots had
insufficient flying experience, according to the Civil Aviation
Administration of China. All of them were given compulsory
training before they were permitted to fly again, the regulator
said in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
