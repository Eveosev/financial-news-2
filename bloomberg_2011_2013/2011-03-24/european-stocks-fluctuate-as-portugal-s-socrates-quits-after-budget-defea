European stocks advanced as
mining shares rallied. Asian stocks rose and U.S. futures
fluctuated.  BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group led a rally in basic-
resource shares as the mining companies won a battle over tax
credits in  Australia .  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.3 percent to
273.9 at 9:01 a.m. in  London  after earlier swinging between
gains and losses at least 12 times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
