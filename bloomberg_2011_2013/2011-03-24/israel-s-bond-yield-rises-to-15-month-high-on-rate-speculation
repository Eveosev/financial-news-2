Israeli 10-year government bond
yields rose to the highest level in more than a year before a
likely rate increase next week to curb accelerating inflation.
The shekel weakened for a third day.  Inflation, which quickened to 4.2 percent in February, will
increase 3.1 percent in the next 12 months, according to the
average forecast in a Bank of  Israel  poll released March 22.
Governor  Stanley Fischer  has increased the benchmark rate for
two consecutive months to combat rising prices. Fifteen of 20
analysts in a Bloomberg survey expect Fischer to boost the rate
by a quarter percentage point to 2.75 percent at the March 28
meeting. One expects an increase to 3 percent and four predict
the rate will remain at 2.5 percent.  “Unless the  Bank of Israel  raises  interest rates  by a
sharp 50 basis points to combat inflationary pressure, we expect
yields to remain at a high level as the economy continues to
grow at a fast pace,” Effi Cohen, a bond trader at Leader
Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by telephone.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020 fell,
pushing the yield up 2 basis points to 5.26 percent at 12:39
p.m. in Tel Aviv, the highest since December 2009. The shekel
weakened 0.2 percent to 3.5512 per dollar. The currency has lost
0.5 percent this week.  The country’s index of leading economic indicators rose a
preliminary 0.4 percent in February, led by exports of goods and
services and manufacturing, the central bank said March 17.
Israel bounced back from the global recession faster than many
developed economies, with growth accelerating to 7.7 percent in
the last quarter of 2010, the fastest pace in four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
