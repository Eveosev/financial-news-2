Sugar may fall next week on bets
that commodity demand will slow as European debt woes, Middle
East turmoil and the earthquake and nuclear crisis in  Japan 
derail global growth.  Seven of 13 traders, analysts, and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar traded in New York and refined
sweetener in  London  will decline, while five said prices will
gain. One was neutral. Before today, the commodity slid 0.9
percent for the week to 27.45 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S.  Refined sugarâ€™s premium over raw sweetener will narrow,
according to seven of 13 people surveyed. Three said it will
widen, and three expect it to be little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
