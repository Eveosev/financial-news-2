Arctic sea ice, a benchmark for the
earth’s warming temperature, this month tied the smallest size
on record for winter coverage on the northern ocean, the U.S.
 National Snow and Ice Data Center  said.  The ice mass probably reached its largest expanse on March
7 this year, extending 14.64 million square kilometers (5.65
million square miles), the Boulder, Colorado-based center said
in a  statement  on its website. That’s about equal with the 2006
level for the smallest in a data series that goes back to 1979.  Every year, the area of ocean covered by ice expands in
winter and shrinks in summer. Scientists have highlighted
declining Arctic sea ice as an indicator of global warming, with
the ice in recent years shrinking to below the 1979-through-2000
average in both winter and summer.  Last winter, the sea ice carried on expanding until the
last day of March, the latest start for the melt season on
record. The ice’s peak extent then was 15.25 million square
kilometers, still short of the long-term average of 15.86
million square kilometers. The data center said it will publish
a detailed analysis of ice cover next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
