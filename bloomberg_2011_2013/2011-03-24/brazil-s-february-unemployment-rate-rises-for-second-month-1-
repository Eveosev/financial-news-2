Brazil ’s unemployment rate rose in
February for the second straight month as policy makers took
steps to cool economic growth.  Unemployment in February rose to 6.4 percent from 6.1
percent in January, higher than the median forecast of 6.3
percent from 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The jobless rate
was down from 7.4 percent in the same month a year ago.  The pace of job creation may slow in coming months as
higher borrowing costs and steps to curb  consumer credit  take
effect, the central bank said in the minutes of its March 1-2
meeting. Traders are wagering that policy makers will raise
borrowing costs by 0.5 percentage point for a third straight
meeting, to 12.25 percent, on April 20, to cool inflation that
is close to the top of the central bank’s target range,
according to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures.  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
12.80 percent, at 8:05 a.m. New York time. The real rose 0.3
percent to 1.6563 per dollar from 1.6604 yesterday.  Latin America’s largest economy expanded 7.5 percent in
2010, its fastest pace in more than two decades, as  job creation 
and credit growth bolstered consumer demand, while commodity
exports surged.  Record Job Creation  Brazil generated 280,799 registered jobs in February, a
record for the month, according to the Labor Ministry. The
country will create 3 million jobs this year, Labor Minister
Carlos Lupi said March 15.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini said in Senate
testimony March 22 that policy makers may adopt new measures to
rein in credit growth in a bid to cool domestic demand and slow
inflation.  Tombini said he has “confidence” that interest rate
increases, fiscal cuts and curbs on credit will slow inflation
to the midpoint of the government’s target range next year.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  Brazil’s annual inflation rate rose to 6.13 percent in mid-
March from 6.08 percent a month earlier, the  national statistics
agency  reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
