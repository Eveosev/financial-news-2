Angola ’s central bank has sold $3.2
billion to commercial banks this year as demand for foreign
currency remains “too high,” Governor Jose de Lima Massano
said.  The sales compare with the $11.6 billion sold to the banks
over all over last year, Massano told businessmen and reporters
late yesterday in Luanda, the capital.  Rising oil prices have enabled  Africa ’s second-largest
crude producer to build up its foreign currency reserves, even
as its steps up dollar sales, Massano said. He called on
Angolans to stop using foreign currency for domestic purchases
and said the bank is investigating where the currency is used.
The Banco Nacional de Angola will also specify conditions under
which commercial banks can give loans in dollars, he said.  “The exercise we’re doing is to clarify how foreign
currency should be used,” Massano said. One of the challenges
facing Angola is to lower  interest rates  and making its
nationals “trust” the kwanza, he said.  The central bank is also at an “advanced” stage in the
introduction of factoring and leasing as financial instruments
and will make an announcement at the beginning of next month,
Massano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
