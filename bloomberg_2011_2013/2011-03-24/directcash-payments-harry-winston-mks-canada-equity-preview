Canadian stocks dropped as energy
shares fell on a U.K. plan to raise oil-extraction taxes and a
smaller decline in U.S. natural gas inventories than most
analysts had forecast, while gold retreated from a record high.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, slipped 1.2 percent.
 Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-biggest gold producer by
market value, lost 2.4 percent.  Imax Corp. (IMAX) , the maker of giant-
screen movie-projection systems, advanced 12 percent on plans to
open 75 more theaters in  China .  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 57.81
points, or 0.4 percent, to 14,029.37.  “Why it’s put a little bit of pressure on energy companies
is you can see some government copycat legislation,” said
Youssef Zohny, who helps oversee about C$50 million ($51
million) as a money manager at Van Arbor Asset Management Ltd.
in  Vancouver . “Governments around the world are essentially
looking to raise revenue. There’s some concern globally that
commodity producers are being targeted.”  The S&P/TSX gained 4.2 percent from March 16 to yesterday,
narrowing its monthly decline to 0.4 percent, as oil and
precious-metal prices rebounded. The equity benchmark gauge has
not had a monthly drop since June.  Supplementary Charge  Oil and gas producers dropped a day after U.K. Chancellor
of the Exchequer  George Osborne  raised the supplementary charge
on North Sea oil profits to 32 percent from 20 percent. Greg Pardy, an analyst at Royal Bank of  Canada , cut his share-price
estimates for Canadian Natural and  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , citing the U.K.
tax in a note to clients.  Today, the U.S. Energy Department said natural gas
inventories fell by 6 billion cubic feet, compared with the
median analyst forecast of 8 billion cubic feet. The fuel slid
as much as 2.8 percent.  Canadian Natural declined 1.2 percent to C$47.76. Nexen
lost 1.2 percent to C$23.89 after plunging 7.9 percent
yesterday.  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the country’s second-largest oil
and gas producer by revenue, decreased 1.4 percent to C$49.28.  Emerge Oil & Gas Inc. (EME) , which produces oil in western
Canada, slumped 9.4 percent to C$3.08 after reporting a 2010
loss that exceeded the average of six analyst estimates by 29
percent, excluding certain items. The shares’ tumble was their
biggest in a day since the company began trading in January
2010.  Gold Futures  Gold futures retreated for the first time in seven days as
technical indicators led traders to sell the precious metal.
Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and prices
to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or index.  Goldcorp fell 2.4 percent to C$47.65.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ,
the world’s largest gold producer, dropped 1.4 percent to
C$50.32. Silver reseller  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  declined 3.6
percent to C$42.45, ending a five-day streak of gains.  Diamond producer  Harry Winston Diamond Corp. (HW)  lost 4.2
percent in Toronto Stock Exchange trading to C$14.05 after
 Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  said it sold its 7.1 million Harry Winston
shares for about C$100 million ($102 million). Harry Winston had
gained 27 percent this year through yesterday.  Imax jumped 12 percent to a 10-year high of C$29.21 after
saying it will open 75 more cinemas in China with Wanda Cinema
Line Corp. by the end of 2014. In an interview, Imax Chief
Executive Officer Richard Gelfond said China will replace the
U.S. as its biggest market.  BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  advanced 2.6
percent to C$62.49 before the release of its fourth-quarter
financial results.  ‘Seeing Strength’  “We expect another very solid quarter, with guidance that
is much higher than Street estimates,” Tim Long, an analyst at
Bank of Montreal, wrote in a note to clients. “Our checks
indicate that RIMM is seeing strength in all regions outside
 North America , despite a lack of new products.”  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, climbed for the first time in five days, increasing
2.9 percent to C$53.39.  Vector Aerospace Corp. (RNO) , which repairs  aircraft engines ,
soared 11 percent to a record C$11.13 after European Aeronautic
Defence & Space Co. said it is in acquisition talks with the
Toronto-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
