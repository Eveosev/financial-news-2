MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the
mining company controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ,
said it posted a profit for the second consecutive quarter as
iron-ore production expanded.  Net income was 83.8 million reais ($50.5 million) in the
fourth quarter compared with a loss of 65.2 million reais a year
earlier, the company said in a regulatory filing today. MMX was
expected to post a profit of 51.8 million reais on an adjusted
basis, according to the average of five analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  MMX’s iron-ore production increased 23 percent to 2.1
million metric tons in the quarter from 1.7 million metric tons
last year, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said. The company
said on March 14 that it has 1.5 billion metric tons of iron ore
resources certified by independent auditing firm SRK Consulting.  “We expect the company’s positive outlook to become
increasingly clear when important milestones are reached in the
coming years,” Rodrigo Barros and Silvia Baracaldo, equity
analysts at Deutsche Bank AG in  Sao Paulo , said in a report Feb.
