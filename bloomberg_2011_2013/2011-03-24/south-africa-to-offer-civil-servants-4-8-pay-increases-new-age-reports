South Africa ’s government will
offer wage increases of 4.8 percent for civil servants, falling
short of the 10 percent demanded by labor unions, The New Age
reported, citing a leaked draft copy of the agreement plan.  Salary increases will be based on the  Consumer Price Index 
for the period from April 2010 to March 2012, which will be
based on forecasts from National Treasury, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper said. If inflation is different to Treasury’s
projections, salaries will be adjusted accordingly in the
following year, it said.  The government plans to implement the proposals on May 1,
The New Age said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
