The European Commission isn’t
prepared to accept further cost increases for the Galileo
satellite project,  Handelsblatt  said, citing European Union
Industry Commissioner Antonio Tajani.  Tajani said he met with executives from European Aeronautic
Defence & Space Co.,  OHB Technology AG (OHB)  and Thales Alenia Space
SAS to argue that increases beyond the 1.9 billion-euro ($2.69
billion) announced in January wouldn’t be acceptable to
taxpayers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
