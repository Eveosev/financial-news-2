Portuguese Prime Minister  Jose Socrates ’s resignation “complicates” the process of securing
any potential international rescue package, said  William White 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  “I’m sorry he had to resign, because it’s going to
complicate the issue,” White, chairman of the OECD’s Economic
and Development Review Committee, said in an interview with
Deirdre Bolton on Bloomberg Television’s “Inside Track” today.
“If there is going to be funds provided to the Portuguese to
ease the adjustment in the context of conditionality, the
question is who does the negotiation if there isn’t even a
government? That is going to make things a bit tricky.”  Portuguese borrowing costs rose to the highest level since
the euro’s inception in 1999 after the country’s parliament
rejected budget-cutting measures yesterday, pushing the nation
closer to a bailout and prompting Socrates to resign. European
leaders meet in Brussels today to sign off on measures aimed at
drawing a line under the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  If  Portugal  does “move down the road to saying ‘We do have
a problem, we do need support,’ help from the Europeans and from
the  International Monetary Fund , that would be a welcome step,”
White said from Paris.  “The concern that the markets have is that this is not a
problem of short-term liquidity, but rather that the debt-
servicing requirements of some of these countries -- Greece and
Ireland -- is so great that it seems almost inevitable to the
market participants that there will be a degree of social and
political tension that will call into question that debt
servicing over time,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
