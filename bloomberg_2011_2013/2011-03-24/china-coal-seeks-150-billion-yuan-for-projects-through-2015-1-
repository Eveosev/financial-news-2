China  Coal Energy Co., the nation’s
second-biggest producer of the commodity, is seeking to raise
150 billion yuan ($22.9 billion) in funds to finance projects
through 2015, the company’s chief financial officer said.  The coal producer will raise funds through bonds and loans,
Weng Qing’an told reporters in Hong Kong today. The proposal to
sell as much as 70 billion yuan of medium-term notes and
commercial paper through 2013 is part of the company’s fund-
raising plan for the next five years, Weng said.  China will rely on coal to meet more than half of its
energy needs by 2015 even as the government increases the use of
cleaner-burning fuels, data from the National Energy
Administration show. China Coal will focus on coal exploration
in the next five years while developing its coal-to-chemicals
and power generation businesses to diversify income sources,
Board Secretary Zhou Dongzhou told reporters.  “Energy demand will still expand rapidly over the next 10
years and coal will still play an important role,” Dai Yande,
deputy director-general of the Energy Research Institute under
the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a
conference in Beijing today.  The country’s largest coal producer after China Shenhua
Energy Co. aims to produce at least 200 million metric tons a
year of coal by 2015, Zhou said. Output reached 122.5 million
tons last year, the company’s 2010 earnings statement shows.  Operating Costs  The shares have fallen 9 percent in the past 12 months in
Hong Kong trading, compared with the 9.1 percent gain in the
benchmark  Hang Seng  index. China Coal dropped 1.9 percent to
close at HK$10.54 today.  The unit of China National Coal Group Corp. reported on
March 22 annual profit that missed analyst estimates after
operating costs jumped 38 percent.  “A significant increase in low-margin coal trading
transactions, expanded operations and higher raw-material prices
boosted operational costs,” China Coal said.  Coal exploration and production accounted for 79 percent of
China Coal’s revenue last year, while coking operations
contributed 7 percent. Domestic sales accounted for 98 percent
of the company’s total revenue.  Capital spending  will rise 72.8 percent to 34.2 billion
yuan this year, Zhou said today.  -- Wang Ying . With assistance from Chua Baizhen in Beijing.
