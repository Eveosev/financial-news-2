SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD)  put volume
rose to a record after a single trade, as the oil and natural-
gas producer heads to its highest close since October 2009.  An investor bought 20,000 September $11 puts and sold the
same number of September $9 puts, a strategy known as a spread,
and sold 10,000 September $14 calls, according to a report by
 Patrick Mortimer , director of options trading at Pipeline in  New
Hope ,  Pennsylvania , and data compiled by Bloomberg.  More than 43,800 puts to sell the stock changed hands as of
3:42 p.m. in  New York , 7.5 times the four-week average and 1.5
times the number of calls to buy. The September $11 puts,
September $9 puts and September $14 calls were the most-active
contracts and accounted for almost seven-tenths of all options
volume. Oklahoma City-based SandRidge rose 2.1 percent to
$11.72. It almost tripled from its Aug. 27 low.  “An investor is using the recent rally to open a defensive
position, either looking for the shares to give back at least
half of its 2011 increase or protecting a long equity position
through the summer months,” Mortimer wrote.  Yesterday an investor sold 10,000 September $13 calls, a
report by options strategists at Susquehanna Financial Group
LLLP in  Bala Cynwyd , Pennsylvania, said.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
