Japanese water treatment companies
and beverage makers surged on speculation demand will increase
after Tokyo authorities said tap water may be unsafe for babies
following radiation leaks from a nuclear plant damaged by the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  Nihon Trim Co., a maker of water purifiers, surged by its
upper daily limit of 400 yen, or 21 percent, to 2,300 yen at the
close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Organo Corp. (6368)  fell 0.3 percent
to 578 yen after jumping as much as 9.5 percent.  Tokyo authorities will distribute bottled water to families
with infants, a municipal official said at a televised briefing
late yesterday. Radioactive iodine levels taken two days ago at
a water treatment facility in Katsushika ward were double the
recommended limit for babies.  Beverage makers  Ito En Ltd. (2593)  advanced 3.9 percent to 1,445
yen, while Coca-Cola West Co. increased 3.9 percent to 1,511 yen.
The companies distribute bottled water. Japan Foods Co., which
makes canned drinks, soared by its daily upper limit of 150 yen,
or 17 percent, to 1,010 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
