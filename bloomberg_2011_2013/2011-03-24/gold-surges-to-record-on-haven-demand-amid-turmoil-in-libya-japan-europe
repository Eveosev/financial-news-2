(Corrects today’s price in fourth paragraph.)  Gold futures jumped to a record of
$1,448.60 an ounce as turmoil in  Libya , Japan and Europe spurred
demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.  U.S. and allied warplanes carried out further strikes
against Muammar Qaddafi’s ground forces and hit an air base deep
inside the country. Moody’s Investors Service cut the ratings of
30 Spanish banks, and Portugal’s prime minister offered to
resign amid a debt crisis. Japanese equities fell as the world’s
third-largest economy recovers from an earthquake.  “Geopolitical risk remains very high,” said  Matthew Zeman , a market strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago.
“You need to be owning gold as Middle East unrest is spreading.
There’s renewed debt concerns in the euro zone and continued
uncertainty in  Japan .”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $8.40, or 0.6 percent,
to $1,446.40 at 11 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . The previous
all-time high was $1,445.70 on March 7.  Gold for immediately delivery climbed to a record of
$1,447.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
