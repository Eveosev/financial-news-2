Per Callesen, deputy governor of
the Danish Central Bank, urged businesses and consumers to spend
money they saved during the economic crisis, Borsen reported,
citing a speech Callesen gave yesterday.  There is potential for growth in consumption and
investments, the Copenhagen-based newspaper said, citing
Callesen. Households and businesses have amassed money which
they now should use, Borsen said, citing the deputy governor.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
