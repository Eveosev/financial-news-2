Ed Balls , Treasury spokesman for
Britain’s opposition  Labour Party  and a former adviser to Prime
Minister  Gordon Brown , has apologized for his part in the
regulatory failures that led to the 2008 banking crisis.  In a televised response to yesterday’s budget statement
from Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Balls said the
government’s deficit-reduction strategy was driven by a desire
to cut services rather than economics.  “It was the irresponsible actions of banks all around the
world that got us into that mess,” Balls said. “But it was
also the fault of governments and central banks, including
Britain’s, who did not see the financial crisis coming and
should have been tougher in regulating the banks. I’d like to
say sorry for the part I and the last Labour government played
in that.”  Since his appointment to the post of shadow chancellor in
January, Balls has come under fire from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative-led coalition over his decade as Brown’s
chief economic adviser and his time as a Treasury minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
