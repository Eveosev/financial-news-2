The pound slipped to the lowest in
a week against the dollar before a report that’s expected to
show U.K. retail sales slumped in February.  Britain’s currency was little changed against the euro.
Sales probably slipped 0.6 percent from the previous month, when
they gained 1.9 percent, according to the median forecast of 24
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The pound depreciated 0.1 percent to $1.6218 at 8:03 a.m.
in  London , its second straight decline. It touched $1.6201, the
lowest since March 18. Against the euro, sterling strengthened
less than 0.1 percent to 86.75 pence.  Two days ago, Sterling advanced to $1.6401, the strongest
level since Jan. 19, 2010, on speculation the Bank of England
would raise  interest rates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
