LCH Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe ’s largest
clearing house, will raise the extra deposit it charges to trade
Irish  government bonds  to  35 percent  after yields on Irish 10-
year debt rose relative to a benchmark of AAA securities.  The additional fee will be reflected in a margin call
tomorrow, LCH said in a statement on its website. It applies to
“long” positions, while “short positions will pay a
proportionally lower margin,” the company said.  The clearing house had lowered the additional margin on
Irish government bonds to 30 percent from 45 percent on Dec. 6,
after increasing the deposit three times in November as yields
soared to more than 600 basis points above the Bloomberg Fair
Value benchmark of AAA euro-region sovereign debt. The yield
spread reached a record 671 basis points today and was at 660 as
of 8:13 a.m. in  London  today.  Irish bonds declined, extending the drop for two-year and
10-year securities to a fourth day, amid speculation Ireland has
yet to come to grips with its banking crisis.  Clearing houses such as LCH guarantee investors’ trades are
completed by standing in the middle of two counterparties, and
raise margin requirements to protect themselves against losses
should one side of the trade fail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
