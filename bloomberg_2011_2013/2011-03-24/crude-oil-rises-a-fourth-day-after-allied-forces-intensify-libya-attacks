Oil rose for a fourth day,
advancing as much as 0.5 percent, after attacks on Libyan leader

Africaâ€™s third-biggest producer will fall.  Crude for May delivery gained as much as 48 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $106.23 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $106.10 at 4:11 p.m.
