The Philippine peso led gains in
Asian currencies as the nation raised  interest rates  for the
first time since August 2008. Thailand’s baht and Malaysia’s
ringgit fell as rising oil prices and renewed concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis cooled demand for emerging-market assets.  The peso traded near the highest level since March 10 as
the central bank raised its overnight borrowing rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent, a move predicted
by 10 out of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Oil prices
climbed for a fourth day as the conflict in Libya and protests
in the Middle East heightened concern supplies will be disrupted.
Portugal’s lawmakers rejected a plan to cut its  budget deficit ,
pushing the country closer to seeking an international bailout.  “Asian nations depend on imports for their oil needs and
rising crude prices are negative, weighing on their
currencies,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “Europe’s debt problem
is a lingering problem.”  The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 43.435 per dollar as
of the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to prices from Tullett
Prebon Plc. South Korea’s won and  India ’s rupee rose 0.3 percent
to 1,121.15 and 44.72, respectively. The baht and the ringgit
retreated 0.1 percent to 30.28 and 3.0280, respectively.  Thailand’s consumer confidence fell in February for the
first time in three months after fuel and food prices surged,
according to an index released by the University of the Thai
Chamber of Commerce on March 10. Crude gained 0.5 percent today
to $106.31 a barrel. It touched $106.95 a barrel on March 7, the
highest level since September 2008.  Malaysian Inflation  The ringgit fell for the first time in seven days after
 Malaysia ’s central bank said yesterday inflation may double this
year because of higher commodity prices.  Bank Negara Malaysia forecast consumer prices will rise by
2.5 percent to 3.5 percent this year, compared with a 1.7
percent gain in 2010. Prices rose 2.7 percent in February from a
year earlier, the most since April 2009, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey before official data
tomorrow. They increased 2.4 percent in January.  “The market is focusing back on the Europe situation and
there’s some light follow-through selling,” said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a foreign-exchange trader at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd.
in  Kuala Lumpur . “The central bank is still hawkish and people
still want to buy the ringgit as it gets cheaper.”  Elsewhere,  China ’s yuan fell 0.04 percent to 6.5618 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Indonesia’s
rupiah and the Taiwan and Singapore dollars were little changed
at 8,719, NT$29.583 and S$1.2629, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
