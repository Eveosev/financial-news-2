Burkina Faso ’s army apologized for
damage done to shops in Ouagadougou, the capital, following a
protest by soldiers earlier this week where at least 10 people
were injured.  Military leaders asked five Burkinabe soldiers whose jail
sentences sparked the March 22 demonstration to “speak to their
companions,” said General Dominique Djindjere after meeting with
shopkeepers.  The West African nation’s main city returned to normal
today following the protests. The jailed soldiers, who were
imprisoned after their involvement in a dispute with civilians
last month, were released and may be re-tried, Djindjere said.  Merchants that suffered damage should tally the losses and
report it to the government, said Jerome Bougouma, Minister of
Territorial Administration. “We are going to find the funds to
compensate them,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
