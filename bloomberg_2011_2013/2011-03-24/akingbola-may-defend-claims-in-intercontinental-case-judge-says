Erastus Akingbola, the former
 Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON)  chief executive officer charged in
Nigeria with making bad loans before a bailout, can defend the
bank’s U.K. lawsuit against him, a judge ruled.  Akingbola may defend claims that he improperly made loans
totaling at least 77.8 million pounds ($125.7 million) for his
own financial gain if he pays an unspecified security to the
court, Justice Michael Burton ruled today at the  High Court  in
London. The bank had sought a ruling before a trial.  Akingbola’s defense against some of the claims is “very
shadowy indeed,” Burton said in the judgment. “I consider the
explanations wholly improbable.”  Intercontinental in January 2010 won a U.K. court order
freezing 83 million pounds of Akingbola’s assets. It accused him
of using bank money to buy apartments in  London , enriching
entities he controlled and wrongfully directing the lender to
buy its own shares, resulting in a loss. Akingbola argues the
transactions were either valid or mischaracterized in the
lawsuit.  Intercontinental’s lawyer, Segun Osuntokun of Berwin
Leighton Paisner LLP in London, declined to comment.  Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission charged
Akingbola in August 2010 with granting unauthorized loans and
share-price manipulation. Akingbola, who faces 22 charges,
pleaded not guilty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
