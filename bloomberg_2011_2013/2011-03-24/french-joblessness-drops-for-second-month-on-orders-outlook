The number of jobseekers in  France 
fell for a second month in February as stronger order books and
improving confidence among manufacturers spurred hiring.  The total of unemployed people actively looking for work
dropped by 2,100, or 0.1 percent, from the previous month, the
Labor and Finance ministries said in a joint statement in Paris
today. The total number of jobseekers was 2.701 million, down
from a revised 2.703 million in January.  Confidence among manufacturers unexpectedly rose in March
to the highest in three years as an accelerating global economy
buoyed exports, national statistics office Insee said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
