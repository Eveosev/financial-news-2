Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (PLX)  rose
the most in a week after saying it plans to start human clinical
trials of a drug treating Fabry disease this year and a
medication against rheumatoid arthritis in early 2012.  The shares of the Israeli  biotechnology company  climbed as
much as 2.2 percent, the biggest increase since March 16, to
21.55 shekels. They gained 1.4 percent at 1:06 p.m. in  Tel Aviv ,
paring the loss for the week to 3.5 percent.  “We continue to advance other drugs we have in our
pipeline at full force,” Protalix’s President and Chief
Executive Officer David Aviezer said in an interview at the
company’s office in the Tel Aviv suburb of  Ramat Gan . “We
believe the Fabry disease and anti-TNF rheumatoid arthritis
drugs will be in clinical development in humans already in the
year to come, ready for sale within the next five years.”  The market for drugs to treat Fabry disease, an illness
that leads to fat build-up which affect kidney or heart
functions, may reach about $850 million by 2019, said Steven Tepper, an analyst at Harel Finance Ltd. Sales of drugs such as
the rheumatoid-arthritis treatment, which seeks to block a
protein called tumor necrosis factor, may total $6.2 billion by
then, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
