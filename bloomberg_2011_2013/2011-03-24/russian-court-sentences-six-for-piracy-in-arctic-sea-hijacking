A Russian court sentenced six
pirates to a total of 66 years in prison for the hijacking of
the Maltese-flagged freighter Arctic Sea in 2009.  Alexei Andryushin, Dmitry Bartenev, and Alexei Buleev were
sentenced to 10 years, while Vitaly Slepin, and Evgeny Mironov,
received seven years. All had pleaded guilty. Igor Borisov, who
didn’t plead guilty, was sentenced to 12 years, said Arkhangelsk
regional court spokeswoman Kseniya Solovyeva.  “This was an unprecedented case in the history of the
Russian investigation and judicial system as there has never
been a case of piracy on sea,” Solovyeva said.  The disappearance of the 98-meter (320-foot) cargo ship
created an international mystery after the armed pirates boarded
the vessel near  Sweden  pretending to be police officers. They
sailed on through the North Sea and the  English Channel  to the
Atlantic. Russian forces found the Arctic Sea among the Cape
Verde islands off the west coast of  Africa .  Two other pirates involved in the case had already been
sentenced to prison terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
