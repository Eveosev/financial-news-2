Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) ’s
outgoing Chief Executive Officer Ray Irani, who was the highest
paid energy CEO in 2009, had his compensation more than doubled
last year to $76.1 million.  Irani’s pay included $40.3 million in stock awards and
$31.6 million in cash incentives, according to a filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. His total compensation
from Occidental, the largest onshore crude producer in the
continental U.S., was $31.4 million for 2009.  Occidental, based in  Los Angeles , announced in October that
Irani, 76, would take a pay cut and retire this year in the wake
of shareholder complaints about his earnings. The company issued
a new compensation formula and said President Stephen I. Chazen
would become CEO.  “It’s easy to make an argument that compensation’s too
high,” said  Philip Weiss , an analyst with Argus Research in  New
York  who has a “buy” rating on Occidental shares and owns none.
“I can’t dismiss that.”  Weiss said the pay for Irani is “less offensive” than for
some other leaders in the industry because of his Middle East
contacts and Occidental’s stock performance. “If I’m a
shareholder and I’m getting good returns, I shouldn’t get too
upset,” Weiss said.  Occidental fell 31 cents to $99.79 as of 4:06 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 21
percent in 2010, outpacing the 15 percent increase in U.S. oil
future prices.  ‘Outstanding’ Performance  Irani’s pay in 2010 included more than $58 million in both
cash and stocks related to an incentive plan based on the
company’s returns, established in 2007. He had a salary of $1.19
million, a bonus of $1.40 million and other compensation,
including security services, of $1.69 million last year. Irani
will remain chairman through 2014.  The board believes Occidental’s “outstanding short-,
medium-and long-term performance has more than justified Dr.
Irani’s compensation,” Richard Kline, an Occidental spokesman,
said today in a telephone interview.  Compensation reported during the next three years will show
a phase-out of the former plan and implementation of a new one,
he said. Kline said changes “are expected to substantially
reduce the chairman and CEO compensation levels and to make them
consistent” with peer-group companies.  Chazen’s compensation for 2010 was $38.1 million, compared
with $13.5 million in 2009. Last year’s total included $21.8
million in stock awards and $14.4 million in non-equity
incentive plan pay.  Exxon Mobil Corp., the world’s largest oil company, paid
its CEO, Rex Tillerson, a total of $27.2 million in 2009, the
last year for which figures were available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
