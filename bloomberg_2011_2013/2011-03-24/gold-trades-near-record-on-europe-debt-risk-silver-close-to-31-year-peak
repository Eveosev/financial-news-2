Gold rose for the seventh straight
session, nearing a record, as fighting in  Libya  and Europe’s
debt crisis spurred demand for an alternative investment. Silver
climbed to a 31-year high.  U.S. and allied warplanes carried out further strikes
against Muammar Qaddafi’s ground troops as Libyan government
forces increased their attacks on cities. Portuguese Prime
Minister  Jose Socrates  tendered his resignation, pushing the
country closer to an international bailout. Engineers at Japan’s
damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant were evacuated from one
reactor after three men suffered radiation burns.  “Gold and silver are justifying their reputation as safe
havens,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  in
Frankfurt, said in a report. “In addition to the war in Libya,
the unrest in the Arab region and the disaster in  Japan , the
debt crisis in euro-zone periphery countries has also returned
with a vengeance. Gold and silver are likely to profit
further.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $2.70, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,440.70 an ounce at 10:07 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $1,442.70, nearing the record of
$1,445.70 reached on March 7.  The precious metal will rise to $5,000 in the next three to
four years as governments across the globe fuel money supply and
raise the prospect of currency debasement, Robert McEwen, the
chief executive officer of miner U.S. Gold Corp., told Bloomberg
Television.  Financial Uncertainty  Gold is in for a “big cycle,” McEwen said. Portugal’s
debt problems and a possible bailout by the European Union
“means more uncertainties for financial markets and is positive
for  gold prices ,” he said.  Gold rallied 30 percent in 2010, the 10th straight annual
gain, as governments kept interest rates low to spur growth.  Gold rose even as the dollar strengthened, a signal of the
metal’s bullishness, said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and
editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  “Gold is strong,” Gartman said. “When gold rises as the
dollar strengthens, our interest is obviously piqued.”  Silver futures for May delivery rose 54.7 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $37.745 an ounce, after touching $37.925, the
highest since February 1980. The metal that year reached a
record $50.35.  Silver’s gain is due to “continuing strong industrial and
investment demand and tight supply,” analysts at  GoldCore Ltd. 
in Dublin said in an e-mail. “Many investors are seeing silver
as a cheaper safe-haven substitute than gold. Silver looks set
to target $40 an ounce, and in the longer term, many investors
see the record highs as a very viable price target.”  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $7.90, or 1.1
percent, to $757.20 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Platinum futures for July delivery rose $1.60, or 0.1
percent, to $1,765.80 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
