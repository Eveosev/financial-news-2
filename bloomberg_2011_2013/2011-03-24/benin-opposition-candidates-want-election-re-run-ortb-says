Benin  presidential candidate
Abdoulaye Bio Tchane formed a coalition with seven others who
contested the March 13 vote to reject the outcome that handed
President Thomas Boni Yayi a second term, state-owned Office de
Radiodiffusion et Television du Benin reported.  The group called on the West African nation’s electoral
commission to re-run the vote, the Cotonou-based broadcaster
cited Rene Dossa, a lawyer and spokesman for the coalition, as
saying.  Adrien Houngbedji, another candidate who also rejected the
outcome, filed a complaint with the country’s Constitutional
Court after it released provisional results giving Boni Yayi
victory, Alain Adihou, Houngbedji’s spokesman, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
