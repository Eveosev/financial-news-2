The rupee advanced to its strongest
level in almost three months after global funds added to
holdings of Indian assets to benefit from growth in Asia’s
third-biggest economy.  Overseas investors bought $69.7 million more Indian shares
than they sold yesterday, boosting net purchases for March to
$375 million, exchange data show. The rupee has advanced 1
percent this month on optimism the government will meet its
target of reducing the  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of gross
domestic product in the fiscal year starting April, from 5.1
percent in the prior 12 months.  “The resolve to control fiscal slippages has played a big
part in restoring the confidence of overseas investors,” said
 Vishnu Varathan , an economist at  Capital Economics  (Asia) Pte in
 Singapore . “The economic growth momentum looks robust.”  The rupee gained 0.2 percent to 44.755 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It earlier touched 44.715, the strongest level since Jan. 4.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.53 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.68
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  India ’s $1.3 trillion economy will expand as much as 9.25
percent in the year starting April 1, the fastest pace since
2008, the government forecast last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
