Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) , the
nation’s second-biggest producer, used more energy than the
global average as its ageing mills burnt more coal in the past
12 months, the government’s chief accountant said.  The state-run company consumed 6.72 giga calories per
metric ton of crude steel, compared with 6.17 giga calories at
bigger rival Tata Steel Ltd. and the world average of 5.5 giga
calories, the Comptroller and Auditor General said in a report
released today.  “The main reason is that their plants are old,” Sunil
Verma, deputy comptroller and auditor general, told reporters
today at a media briefing in  New Delhi .  Still, Steel Authority’s energy use has decreased over the
past five years, according to the report. The company, which
plans to invest 35 billion rupees ($782 million) by 2012 to
upgrade its plants, also consumed more raw materials than Tata
Steel and the world average.  Steel Authority’s plants used as much as 3.38 tons of  iron
ore , coking coal, limestone and scrap steel to make a ton of
crude steel this fiscal year, compared with the global average
of 2.6 tons, and Tata Steel’s 3 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
