President Barack Obama spoke with
Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  about the military campaign in
Libya and the unrest in the Middle East during a telephone call
this morning, according to a White House statement.  Obama “expressed his appreciation for Russia’s support for
the implementation of United Nations  Security Council Resolution
1973  and subsequent positive statements that President Medvedev
has made regarding the resolution’s mandate,” the statement
said, referring to the UN mandate for imposition of a no-fly
zone over Libya.  The two leaders also discussed Russia’s progress toward
becoming part of the  World Trade Organization  this year, the
White House said. Obama reaffirmed U.S. support for Russia’s
entry this year, and the two leaders talked about ways to bolster
trade relations between their nations.  Obama and Medvedev agreed to hold separate talks when they
both attend a meeting of the Group of Eight nations at the end
of May in  France .  To contact the reporter on this story:
