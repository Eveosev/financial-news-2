(Corrects 2010 sales in fourth paragraph)  Royal Philips Electronics NV, which
for 10 years has limited its emphasis in the oral health-care
industry to toothbrushes, plans to broaden its product range to
grab a bigger share of the $50 billion market.  The oral health-care market is growing at more than 5
percent annually, said Eef van Elsberg, senior vice president of
Oral Healthcare at Philips in a telephone interview.  “In the past 10 years not much happened in the innovation
field,” Van Elsberg said. “Currently we’re focusing on about
10 percent of this market and we’re looking to expand that to 40
percent in the next couple of years.”  The maker of Sonicare electronic toothbrushes is seeking
ways to push top line growth and synch with aging population and
healthy lifestyle trends. Sales excluding takeovers, disposals
and currency shifts grew 4 percent last year. For the period to
2015 Philips targets revenue to increase 2 percentage points
faster than global economic growth. The worldwide recession
prevented the company from raising sales by an average 6 percent
per year.  Growth in the oral health-care division will come from new
product innovations, and add-on acquisitions. Philips last year
bought tooth-whitener maker Discus Holdings, and it’s
introducing an air powered floss to markets this year.  “The potential of this product is huge,” Van Elsberg
said, without quantifying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
