BP Plc is preparing to shut the No.
4 ultraformer at its Whiting refinery in  Indiana  for planned
work scheduled to last 60 days, two people with knowledge of the
plans said.  An alkylation unit and several other units will undergo
maintenance during the turnaround, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information isn’t public.  The ultraformer is scheduled to be shut by April 4, said
one person. A sulfur recovery unit will also undergo work during
the turnaround, said the other person.  Scott Dean , a spokesman for BP based in Warrenville,
Illinois, didn’t immediately return a telephone call.  The Whiting refinery has a capacity of 420,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The plant is
located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Chicago on Lake
Michigan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
