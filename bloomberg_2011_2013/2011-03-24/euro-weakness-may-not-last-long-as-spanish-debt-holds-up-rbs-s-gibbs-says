The euro’s decline against the
dollar may be short-lived because Spanish bond yields aren’t
rising relative to benchmark German bunds at the same rate as
Portuguese debt, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “If the problems in  Portugal  fail to spread to Spain then
downside for the euro should be relatively limited,”Greg Gibbs, a currency strategist in Sydney said today. “At this
stage it is hard to conclude that this retreat will be long
lasting.”  The euro was little changed at $1.4081 as of 6:52 a.m. in
 London  today after sliding 0.8 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
