Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.
may introduce products based on the raw materials that  China 
consumes the most, said Chief Executive Officer Charles Li.  “We’re talking about providing solutions for people that
use commodities,” said Li in a speech today to the Hong Kong
Investment Funds Association. “China needs to develop those
capabilities. It needs to have those pricing inflows in the
global scheme in all the major areas where China is a big
consumer.”  China is the world’s biggest user of copper, lead and
aluminum and the second-largest energy consumer. The Shanghai
Futures Exchange already trades raw materials, including copper,
lead, aluminum and steel, while the Hong Kong Mercantile
Exchange offers futures contracts based on gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
