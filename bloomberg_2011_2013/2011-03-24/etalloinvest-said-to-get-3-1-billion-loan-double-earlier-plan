OAO Metalloinvest,  Russia ’s biggest
iron ore miner, will more than double the size of a new loan to
$3.1 billion as it seeks to add assets and refinance debt,
according to a person with knowledge of the agreement.  Metalloinvest will get a $3 billion, five-year loan and a
$100 million seven-year loan, after initially hiring  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  and BNP Paribas SA to arrange a $1.2 billion five-year
pre-export facility in February, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the transaction is confidential.  “We need this loan to refinance our debt and to buy new
assets,” said Eduard Potapov, chief executive officer of
Moscow-based Metalloinvest, without commenting on the proposed
size of the facility or elaborating on the company’s acquisition
plans.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  can’t comment on the size of the loan until the
deal is concluded, Helen Guillemot, a spokeswoman for the Paris-
based bank, said by e-mail. Sebastien Avot, a London-based
spokesman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
