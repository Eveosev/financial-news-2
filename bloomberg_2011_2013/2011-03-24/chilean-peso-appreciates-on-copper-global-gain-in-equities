Chile ’s peso strengthened for the
first time in three days as copper, the nation’s main export,
touched a two-week high and global stocks climbed.  The peso climbed 0.4 percent to 479.80 per  U.S. dollar  from
481.76 yesterday.  “Everything’s positive, the market’s calm and copper is
recovering,” said Flavio Magnasco, an economist at Banco
Falabella in Santiago. “There is a pension fund that has been
buying dollars in the last few days and has kept the  exchange
rate  at the same level. The bet today is whether that pension
fund keeps buying or whether it has run out of bullets.”  Emerging-market stocks have gained for the past week. The
MSCI Emerging-Market Index climbed as much as 1.1 percent today.
Copper for May delivery reached a two-week high of $4.4545 a
pound on the Comex in  New York . The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
increased as much as 0.9 percent.  Foreign investors in the forwards market increased bets
that the peso will weaken against the dollar to $2.8 billion on
March 22, from $2.4 billion on March 21, according to the latest
central bank data.  Chile’s central bank bought $50 million at an average of
480.18 pesos per U.S. dollar today as part of a $12 billion plan
to weaken the peso, according to data published on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
