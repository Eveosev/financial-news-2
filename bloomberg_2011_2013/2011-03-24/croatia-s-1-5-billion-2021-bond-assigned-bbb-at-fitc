Croatia ’s $1.5 billion bond
maturing in 2021 was rated BBB- by  Fitch Ratings , in line with
the Adriatic Sea nation’s long-term foreign currency rating.  The bond that was issued on March 16 has a coupon of 6.375
percent and matures on March 24, 2021. Fitch has Croatia on a
negative outlook. BBB_ is Fitch’s lowest investment grade
ranking.  “The ratings reflect Croatia’s poor growth performance,
its worsening fiscal situation, high gross external financing
requirement and the large foreign currency exposure of public
and private sector balance sheets,” Fitch said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The rating is supported by high levels of gross domestic
product per capita, a well-capitalized banking sector, as well
as a track record of stable inflation and prospective accession
to the European Union, the ratings company said.  Croatia had its long-term sovereign  credit rating  reduced
in December to one step above junk at  Standard & Poor’s , which
cited the country’s “deteriorated fiscal position and
continuously weak external financing.”  Croatia’s economy may expand for the first time since 2008
and grow an estimated 1.5 percent this year, according to a
government estimate in November. The country is in the final
stage of negotiations with the EU and hopes to join the bloc in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
