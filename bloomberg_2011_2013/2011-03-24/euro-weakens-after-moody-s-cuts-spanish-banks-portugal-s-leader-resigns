The euro weakened versus the dollar
and the yen after Moody’s Investors Service cut the ratings on
30 Spanish banks to reflect  Spain ’s sovereign downgrade.  The single currency slumped yesterday after Portuguese
Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  tendered his resignation following
parliament’s rejection of plans to cut the budget, pushing the
country closer to an international financial bailout.  “This does weaken the outlook” for the euro region, said
Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “It’s always been the case that whilst
the size of any Portuguese bailout would be relatively moderate,
Spain, being a far more substantial economy would be far more
costly.”  The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.4057 as of 7:40 a.m. in
London. It dropped 0.3 percent to 113.61 yen.  Moody’s cut the ratings of 30 Spanish banks by at least one
step after Spain’s downgrade to Aa2, it said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
