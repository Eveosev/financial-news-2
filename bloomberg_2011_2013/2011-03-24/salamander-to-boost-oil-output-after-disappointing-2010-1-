Salamander Energy Plc (SMDR) , a U.K.-based
oil and gas explorer, said it plans to boost production after
reporting “disappointing” exploration results during the first
half of 2010.  The explorer said it will increase 2011 production to
between 22,000 and 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.
Average daily production climbed to 20,300 barrels of oil per
day from 13,600 barrels a year earlier, it said in a statement.  “This year we’re looking at a very different complexion of
drilling program,” Chief Executive Officer James Menzies said
on a conference call with journalists today. The average risk is
that one well out of three drilled will be successful, he said.
The company’s 2011 drilling program doesn’t “have the frontier
nature” that it did a year earlier, he said.  The company plans to drill 13 exploration and appraisal
wells in 2011, targeting 312 million barrels of oil equivalent,
he said. Salamander’s 2013 production target is 30,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day, Menzies said. The Bualuang oil field
will make up half the explorer’s production base, he said.  Salamander abandoned and plugged wells in Laos and  Vietnam 
last year. Salamander in August also had to trim reservoir
estimates of its Kambuna gas-condensate field off  Indonesia .  The pre-tax loss for the year was $114 million, compared
with a loss of $3 million in 2009. Sales more than doubled to
$323 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
