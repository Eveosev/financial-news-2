U.S. mortgage rates increased,
making borrowing more costly as the housing market struggles to
recover amid slow sales and falling prices.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan rose to 4.81
percent in the week ended today from 4.76 percent, according to
 Freddie Mac . The average 15-year rate was 4.04 percent, up from
3.97 percent a week ago, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-
 finance company  said in a statement.  The U.S. housing market remains weak even as other areas of
the economy improve. Purchases of new homes plunged 16.9 percent
in February to the lowest level on record, the Commerce
Department said yesterday, as builders compete with a glut of
foreclosures that is discounting prices for existing properties.
The median price for a new house dropped 8.9 percent from a year
earlier to the lowest in more than seven years.  Previously owned home purchases tumbled 9.6 percent in
February, the National Association of Realtors said March 21.
The median price dropped to the lowest in nine years.  Mortgage applications in the U.S. increased 2.7 percent in
the week ended March 18, according to the  Mortgage Bankers
Association ’s index. The Washington-based group’s measures of
purchases and refinancing also rose 2.7 percent.  Home loan rates began climbing from a record low of 4.17
percent in the week ended Nov. 11 and reached a 10-month high of
5.05 percent in February. Borrowing costs have declined since
then as turmoil in the Middle East and  Japan ’s nuclear crisis
increased demand for Treasury bonds, reducing the yields that
serve as a benchmark for consumer loans.  The monthly payment of a $300,000 mortgage is about $1,576
after this week’s drop, down from $1,620 at the February high.  The U.S. Treasury Department said March 21 that it plans to
sell $142 billion in mortgage securities guaranteed by Freddie
Mac and  Fannie Mae . The department began buying the bonds after
seizing the agencies in 2008 as it sought to reduce the cost of
home loans during the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
