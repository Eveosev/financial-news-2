TPS Eastern Africa Ltd. (TPSEA) , the Kenyan
holding company for the Serena chain of hotels, said full-year
profit jumped 40 percent as revenue climbed.  Net income increased to 531.1 million shillings ($6.3
million), or 4.39 shillings per share, in the 12 months through
December from 380.4 million shillings, or 3.59 shillings per
share a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement e-mailed by the stock exchange yesterday. Sales grew
15 percent to 4.46 billion shillings, it said.  From the third quarter of 2010, “the tourism sector in
East Africa witnessed positive business trends and encouraging
signs of recovery as growth within source markets returned,”
Company Secretary Dominic Ng’ang’a said in the statement.  While foreign-exchange rates, weather patterns and global
commodity prices are expected to be unpredictable in 2011, the
company is “cautiously optimistic and confident” of
maintaining its market share, Ng’ang’a said.  TPS directors have recommended a dividend of 1.25 shillings
per share.  The stock jumped the most in a week, rising 0.8 percent to
67.5 shillings as of 11:33 a.m. in Nairobi, the first gain in
five trading sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
