Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) , the money-losing
wireless broadband provider, has canceled plans to sell its own
Clear-branded mobile phones after delaying their introduction
last year.  The Kirkland, Washington-based company will rely instead on
handsets used by partner  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  on its WiMax
fourth-generation network, John Stanton, chairman and interim
chief executive officer, said today in an interview at the CTIA
Wireless conference in Orlando,  Florida .  The company will focus on income from reselling its 4G
service to partners, who offer it to customers under their own
brands. Clearwire had said it was scaling back its plan to build
its own stores and release a smartphone for the faster 4G
network in December amid a cash crunch. The company, which
reported a $487.4 million net loss last year, has also slowed
down its network expansion, cut sales and marketing spending and
fired employees to save money.  Sprint, based in  Overland Park , Kansas, today offers three
4G handsets that run on Clearwireâ€™s WiMax network and will
introduce new handsets in the coming months.  Clearwire fell 1 cent to $5.34 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The Kirkland, Washington-based
company has gained 3.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
