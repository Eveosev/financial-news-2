European Aeronautic, Defense &
Space Co.’s Cassidian defense unit plans to cut 600 jobs in a
reorganization that will focus the company more on countries
such as India and  Brazil ,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing
an interview with Chief Executive Officer Stefan Zoller.  The revamp aims to save Cassidian about 400 million euros
($562 million) in three to four years and includes merging the
three main units and dissolving one management level, the German
newspaper reported. Cassidian also named Bernhard Gerwert chief
operating officer, SZ said.  Zoller expects about half of sales will “soon” come from
safety equipment for the police and border patrol, the newspaper
said. Revenue will double to about 12 billion euros in 10 years,
Zoller told the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
