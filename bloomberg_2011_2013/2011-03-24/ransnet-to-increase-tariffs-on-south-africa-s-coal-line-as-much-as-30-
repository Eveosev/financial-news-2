Transnet Ltd. will increase tariffs
to transport coal in South  Africa  by “as much as 30 percent”
effective March 26, spokesman Sandile Simelane said.  “We are in the process of expanding our services to coal
miners and we need to fund that expansion,” Simelane said by
phone from Johannesburg today. “Tariff rises to coal miners in
the past have been very low.”  While South Africa’s Richards Bay Coal Terminal, the
largest coal port in Africa, has the capacity to ship 91 million
tons out of the country each year, Transnet can carry only about
65 million tons to the terminal. That is limiting shipments by
port’s owners, including BHP Billiton Ltd.,  Anglo American Plc (AGL) 
and Xstrata Plc. Coal shipped through the terminal is used to
fire  power plants  in Europe, India and China.  Transnet said March 2 it will spend 110 billion rand ($16
billion) over the next five years to expand its rail network,
upgrade its ports and build a new fuel pipeline.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  has bilateral contracts with state-owned
Transnet, said company spokesman Pranill Ramchander.  The diversified miner “has commercial contracts and we
will negotiate the rates applicable to those contracts on a
bilateral basis,” Ramchander said in a text message. Anglo
American could not comment further “because of these
negotiations,” he said.  Calls to Exxaro Resources Ltd., another South African coal
miner, didn’t immediately answer calls seeking comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
