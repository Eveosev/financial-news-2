Tokyo  Narita Airport,  Japan ’s main
international gateway, has had a 60 percent drop in foreigners
arriving from overseas since an earthquake caused a crisis at a
nuclear-power plant.  About 67,000 foreigners landed at the airport from March 11
to March 22 on international flights, Taichi Iseki, a spokesman
for the Immigration Bureau of Japan’s Narita branch, said today
by phone. The number leaving was about 190,000, a “small
increase” from a year earlier, he said.  Tokyo has suffered power shortages and radiation concerns
since the March 11 magnitude-9 earthquake crippled the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant 220 kilometers (135 miles) north of Tokyo.
Engineers resumed efforts today to reconnect power at the plant
in a bid to prevent a meltdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
