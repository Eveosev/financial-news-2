Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  said it hired
Alix Bernard as a managing director in European credit sales as
the New York-based company expands its fixed-income division.  Bernard, who is based in Paris, joined from Liquid Capital
Securities Ltd., where she was head of European credit sales,
Jefferies said today in a statement. She previously headed
Dresdner Bank AG’s unit covering clients in  France  and the
Benelux countries and worked for 17 years at Calyon.  Revenue from Jefferies’s fixed-income business climbed to
$318.1 million in the three months ended Feb. 28 from $200.8
million a year earlier, the company said on March 22. Jefferies
has been investing in that department for the past three years,
according to Chief Executive Officer Richard B. Handler.  To contact the reporter on this story:
