Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  agreed to pay
$52 million to resolve claims by direct drug buyers that it
tried to harm competition when it quadrupled the price of its
HIV medicine Norvir in 2003.  The settlement, which is subject to court approval, would
resolve a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Abbott
customers that purchased Norvir, a boosting agent for other HIV
drugs, and a second medicine Kaletra, which includes Norvir,
according to an April 8 filing in federal court in Oakland,
California. Abbott denied wrongdoing, according to the accord.  Abbott increased the wholesale price of a Norvir capsule
containing 100 milligrams to $8.57 from $1.71, the Abbott Park,
Illinois-based company said in court documents.  GlaxoSmithKline
Plc (GSK)  and drug retailers and distributors sued, claiming other
drugmakers that used Norvir in their medicines couldn’t compete
on price with Kaletra, and the price increase penalized drug
customers that wanted to buy medicines that competed with
Kaletra.  Abbott said it increased Norvir’s prices for legitimate
business purposes and Kaletra lost market share after the price
increase.  CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) ,  Walgreen Co. (WAG) ,  Rite Aid Corp. (RAD)  and
retailers that sued opted out of the settlement, according to
court documents.  The case is Meijer v. Abbott Laboratories, 07-5985, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).  To contact the reporters on this story:
