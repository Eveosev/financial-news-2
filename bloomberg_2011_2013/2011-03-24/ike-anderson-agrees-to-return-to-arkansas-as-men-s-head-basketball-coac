Mike Anderson  agreed to become head
coach of the men’s basketball team at the University of
 Arkansas , where he spent 17 years.  Anderson, 51, takes over the Razorbacks after amassing a
200-98 record from the past five seasons at the  University of
Missouri  and four at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. He’s
earned 20 wins in a season seven times and led his teams to the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament six times.  “His teams play an exciting brand of basketball that has
already proven successful at both UAB and Missouri,” Arkansas
Athletics Director Jeff Long said in a statement on the school’s
website.  Anderson previously worked at Arkansas under his mentor,
former Razorbacks coach Nolan Richardson. Anderson succeeds John Pelphrey, who was fired March 13 by the Fayetteville, Arkansas-
based school after going 69-59 in four seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
