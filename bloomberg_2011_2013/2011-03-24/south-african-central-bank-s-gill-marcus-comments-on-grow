South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments on the country’s growth
prospects after a meeting of the bank’s monetary policy
committee in  Pretoria  today.  “Domestic growth prospects appear to have improved
moderately.”  The economy is now expected to grow “3.7 percent and 3.9
percent over 2011 and 2012 respectively.  These growth rates, while an improvement, are still too low
to have a significant impact on the unemployment rate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
