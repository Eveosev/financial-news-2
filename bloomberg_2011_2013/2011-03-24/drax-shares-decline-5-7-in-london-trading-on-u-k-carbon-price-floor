Drax Group Plc (DRX) , owner of the U.K.’s
largest power station, dropped for a third day in London trading
on concern the government’s floor price for carbon emission
permits will erode earnings.  Drax retreated 20.3 pence, or 5.2 percent, to 371.9 pence
as of the 4:30 p.m. London close. The stock has dropped 11
percent this week, valuing the utility at 1.36 billion pounds
($2.2 billion).  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced a so-
called carbon-price support in his annual budget presentation
yesterday in London. While he said the floor price will be 16
pounds a ton of carbon dioxide, rising to 30 pounds by 2020,
documents released later in the day showed the Treasury will
charge utilities a tax of 4.94 pounds a ton in 2013.  “Expect lots of share price gyration today,” Lakis Athanasiou, an analyst at Evolution Securities in  London , said
in a note to investors today. Drax’s share price will “come
back up when we see the impacts of the higher carbon prices
feeding through to electricity and gas prices.”  The levy is intended to encourage investors to finance
construction of five nuclear reactors in Britain and will reduce
utility emissions by 263 million metric tons through 2030,
according to Treasury estimates. The Treasury documents forecast
that the U.K. carbon levy may rise to 7.28 pounds a ton in 2014
and 9.86 pounds in 2015.  “The market is underestimating the impact of the minimum
carbon price with earnings for the coal generators - Drax,
Scottish & Southern Energy Plc and Iberdrola SA’s Scottish Power
unit - the most exposed,” UniCredit Bank AG analyst Scott Phillips said in a note to investors today. “This is because
the UK is a gas-led power market and thus the higher costs
cannot be passed on in full.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
