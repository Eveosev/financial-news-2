LinkedIn Corp., the first major U.S.
social-media company to sell shares to the public, may deserve a
valuation that more closely resembles those of business-software
makers such as  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  than Facebook Inc.  Demand for LinkedIn shares prompted the company to increase
the offering twice. The valuation of as much as $4.25 billion
implies a multiple of 11.3 times projected annual sales,
compared with 13.8 for Facebook and 8.3 for Salesforce.com.  LinkedIn is often compared with social networks such as
Facebook and Twitter Inc., which depend on advertising to
consumers. Yet LinkedIn gets 70 percent of revenue from business
subscriptions, a model that’s similar to Salesforce.com,
 SuccessFactors Inc. (SFSF)  and  NetSuite Inc. (N)  This dual appeal and
faster growth means LinkedIn warrants a higher valuation than
other business-software providers, said Brian Jacobs, general
partner at Emergence Capital Partners.  “It’s got aspects of the business software world but it
also has these aspects of the consumer world,” said Jacobs, who
is based in  San Mateo ,  California . “When you’ve got a product
that millions of people love, that helps the stock price.”
Emergence was an early investor in Salesforce and
SuccessFactors.  LinkedIn shares are expected to price later today. The
 Mountain View , California-based company yesterday increased the
range at which they’ll be sold to $42 to $45 apiece, from $32 to
$35 as planned last week. LinkedIn is offering 7.84 million
shares. At the high end, LinkedIn would raise as much as $405.7
million, if underwriters exercise an overallotment option.  Software Subscriptions  Some investors may purchase LinkedIn shares because they
view it as a proxy for social-media companies led by Facebook
that have put off IPOs to pursue growth outside the regulatory
glare that’s directed at publicly traded companies.  Still, LinkedIn said in its prospectus that a “substantial
portion” of revenue comes from a business that’s comparable to
the software-as-a-service model. That’s where companies deliver
software over the Internet, a market that is expected to climb
16 percent this year to $10.7 billion, according to Gartner
Inc., a research firm in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  “The long-term holders of the stock will be the ones that
evaluate it like an enterprise SaaS company versus the ones
looking for pure momentum,” said Dave Whorton, founder of
Tugboat Ventures in Palo Alto, California, and an early investor
in SuccessFactors. “They will have good visibility into what
the company is today and what it will be in the future without
having to speculate.”  SaaS companies, including Salesforce, NetSuite and
SuccessFactors, sell subscriptions over the Internet rather than
long-term licenses like traditional business-software companies.  Salesforce is the largest supplier of customer-management
software. SuccessFactors makes Web-based human resources
software, and NetSuite provides online accounting programs.  Social Network Valuations  Facebook and Twitter, social-networking sites that give
their services away, have higher private-market valuations than
LinkedIn based on potential revenue from advertisers aiming to
reach hundreds of millions of users. Facebook, the world’s
largest social-networking site, is valued at $55 billion on
secondary exchange  SharesPost Inc. , while micro-blogging service
Twitter is valued at $6.2 billion.  Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. are leading the offering. The stock is expected to begin
trading tomorrow under the symbol LNKD on the New York Stock
Exchange.  Personal Profiles  LinkedIn members use the site to search for jobs, recruit
employees and find industry experts. While users can create
personal profiles for free, the company introduced paid
subscriptions in 2005, giving recruiters more access to job
candidates and providing business professionals ways to
communicate with one another.  The hiring solutions business, targeted at recruiters,
accounted for about half of LinkedIn’s $93.9 million in first-
quarter revenue, with 30 percent coming from ads. The company’s
projected valuation of 11.3 times sales assumes first-quarter
revenue is replicated over the next three quarters. LinkedIn’s
net income rose 14 percent to $2.08 million in the first
quarter. Sales more than doubled.  “It is one of the most exciting companies to go public in
recent times,” said Jason Rosenthal, chief executive officer of
Ning Inc., a social media company in  Palo Alto . “They have
built a $250 million-a-year revenue business that’s profitable
and growing at a fast clip. Something like that deserves to be
highly valued.”  Premium Business  Some analysts are skeptical. Ryan Hunter of Wedge Partners
Corp. wrote in a report on May 16 that even at $3 billion,
LinkedIn may be overvalued. LinkedIn had previously planned a
sale that would have given it a valuation at that level.  Hunter sees a conflict between LinkedIn’s premium
subscription business and its advertising business. To satisfy
subscribers, the company may need to cut out ads to premium
members, hurting revenue, he wrote. Rising competition may also
force the company to eliminate premium fees to keep users, with
 Facebook  as a looming threat.  “Facebook users have a substantially higher level of
engagement than LNKD users,” wrote Hunter, who’s based in
 Greenwood Village ,  Colorado . “If Facebook creates a way for
users to feel comfortable managing their professional and social
networks on the same platform, we would expect LNKD’s value to
its users (and shareholders) to rapidly decline.”  In the planned IPO, about 62 percent of the shares in the
offering are being sold by LinkedIn, which said it plans to use
the proceeds to fund existing operations and to expand the
business, possibly including buying other companies or
technologies.  The sellers of the other shares include a venture capital
affiliate of Bain Capital LLC, McGraw-Hill Cos.,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  and founder and Chairman  Reid Hoffman , the prospectus
shows. Venture capital backers  Sequoia Capital ,  Greylock
Partners  and Bessemer Venture Partners aren’t selling shares,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
