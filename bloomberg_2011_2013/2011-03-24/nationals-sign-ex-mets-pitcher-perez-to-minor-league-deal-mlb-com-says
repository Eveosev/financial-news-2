Pitcher Oliver Perez reached
agreement on a minor-league contract with the  Washington
Nationals , two days after his release by the  New York Mets ,
MLB.com reported.  The accord, which was reached yesterday, will pay Perez the
league minimum of $414,000 if he makes the team,  MLB.com said ,
citing two unnamed baseball sources. John Dever, a Nationals
spokesman, declined to confirm the agreement in an e-mail.  Perez, 29, is owed $12 million by the Mets. He was cut
after posting a combined 3-9 record over the past two seasons
since signing a three-year, $36 million contract in February
2009.  Perez had season-ending knee surgery in August 2009 after
posting a 3-4 record with a 6.82 earned run average in 14
starts, missing most of May and June because of the injured
knee. He had an 8.38 earned run average over 9 2/3 innings in
spring training.  To contact the reporter on this story:
