The Czech Republic’s main equity
index advanced the most in almost seven weeks as  CEZ AS (CEZ)  jumped
to a two-month high after the country’s biggest power utility
said it expects rising electricity prices to improve earnings.  The PX gauge of 15 companies added 1.2 percent to 1,239.9
at the 4:27 p.m. close, its biggest one-day rally since Feb. 4.
CEZ, which has a 21 percent weighting in the index, advanced 0.8
percent to 856 koruna, its highest close since Jan. 24.  An increase in power prices after neighboring  Germany  shut
down seven of its atomic reactors will have a “positive
impact” on CEZ’s earnings, Trading Director Alan Svoboda said
in response to e-mailed questions from Bloomberg News.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA,
jumped 2.3 percent, the most in almost six weeks, to 4,270
koruna. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  added 1.8 percent to 886
koruna, its second day of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
