West African leaders have asked the
 United Nations Security Council  to give peacekeepers in  Ivory
Coast  more power to protect civilians from armed attacks and
help install  Alassane Ouattara  as president.  Presidents and other representatives of the Economic
Community of West African States who met today in the Nigerian
capital, Abuja, decided “time has come to enforce the
decisions” to recognize Ouattara as the winner of a November
election and use “legitimate force” to remove incumbent
President  Laurent Gbagbo  from office, according to resolutions
handed to reporters.  The West African country, which is the world’s leading
cocoa producer, has faced turmoil since Gbagbo rejected UN-
certified election results declaring Ouattara the winner,
sparking unrest in which 462 people have been killed since the
disputed vote.  Ecowas wants the UN mission in  Ivory Coast  to be empowered
“to use all necessary means to protect life and property and
facilitate the immediate transfer of power” to Ouattara,
according to the statement. More “stringent” sanctions should
be imposed on Gbagbo and his associates, it said.  An estimated 300,000 residents of Abidjan, the commercial
capital, have fled the city and are seeking shelter in safer
neighborhoods, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
