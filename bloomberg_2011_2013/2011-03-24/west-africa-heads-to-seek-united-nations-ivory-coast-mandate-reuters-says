West African leaders will seek a
mandate from the  United Nations  to allow military intervention
in  Ivory Coast  as a last resort to solve the crisis in that
country, Reuters said, citing James Gbeho, president of the
Economic Community of West African States commission.  Gbeho spoke on the sidelines of an Ecowas summit in Abuja,
Reuters said.  It wasnâ€™t clear whether Ecowas will seek permission for an
intervention by the African group or for UN peacekeepers in
Ivory Coast to take action, Reuters said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
