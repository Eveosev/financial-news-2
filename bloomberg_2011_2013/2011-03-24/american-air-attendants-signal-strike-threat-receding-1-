American Airlines ’ flight
attendants’ union told members it doesn’t expect to be released
from contract talks in the near future, lessening the threat of
a possible strike at the carrier.  The likelihood that  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American will report a loss
for the year and uncertainty about the national economy are
among reasons the  National Mediation Board  is unlikely to
declare talks at an impasse and allow the attendants to move
closer to a walkout, the union told members in a  hotline  today.  “Based on the totality of these circumstances we must,
reluctantly but realistically, conclude that the NMB will not
release the parties into a 30-day cooling off period anytime
soon,” Association of Professional Flight Attendants President
Laura Glading said in the message.  The union asked the board a year ago to release it from
further talks into a 30-day cooling off period. American and the
attendants have been in contract  negotiations  for almost three
years. The union represents 16,550 active duty flight
attendants.  While talks continue, the terms of the existing contract
remain in place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
