Turkey â€™s main Kurdish party plans a
campaign of civil disobedience to demand rights, electoral
changes and an end to conflict with Kurdish rebels, Sabah
newspaper reported.  The Peace and Democracy Party will begin the campaign with
a sit-in protest in Diyarbakir in the southeast today, the
newspaper said, citing party leader Selahattin Demirtas. Turkey
will hold nationwide general elections on June 12.  The party wants education in Kurdish, the release of
"political prisoners," an end to military operations against the
Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, and an end to the 10 percent
threshold that restricts small parties from winning seats in
parliament, Sabah said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
