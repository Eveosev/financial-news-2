Georgia is seeking foreign
investors for a 50-megawatt wind-power plant valued at $100
million, Deputy Energy Minister Mariam Valishvili said.  The plant, located in the west of the ex-Soviet satellite
state, is due for completion by 2015, Valishvili said in an
interview in the Georgian capital Tbilisi today. “Georgia is
trying to diversify its energy sources,” he said.  No potential investors have been confirmed yet,
Valishvili said. Georgia wants to raise $5 billion to develop
the hydropower industry over the next seven years, President
Mikheil Saakashvili said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
