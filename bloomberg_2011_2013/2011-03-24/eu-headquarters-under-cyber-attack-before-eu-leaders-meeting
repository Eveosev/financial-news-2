The European Union is investigating
a cyber attack on its headquarters’ computer network that
targeted EU officials’ data before a leaders’ summit in Brussels
that started today.  Antonio Gravili, a spokesman for the European Commission in
Brussels, said in a telephone interview that the attack on the
EU’s executive and its diplomatic arm, the European External
Action Service, was discovered on March 22 and “targeted the
data of certain commission officials.”  Gravili refused to give details on what information the
malware-based attack was trying to access. EU security officials
are investigating and have blocked remote access to e-mail and
the commission’s intranet, he said.  EU leaders are gathering in Brussels today for the start of
a two-day meeting on economic reforms amid high security and
expected protests. Police manned barbed-wire blockades outside
the EU’s headquarters as trade unions said up to 20,000 of their
members would march to the area to protest public-spending cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
