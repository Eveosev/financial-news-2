Ukraine won’t export barley before
July 1, the  Economy Ministry  said.  Exportable grains will be 13.7 million metric tons by June
30, the ministry said in an e-mailed response to questions.
Ukraine exported 7.7 million tons of grains from July 1 through
the end of last month, of which barley came to 2.4 million tons,
it said. Current barley stockpiles only meet domestic needs,
according to the ministry.  Quotas for grain exports are scheduled to run through March
31, and Ukrainian authorities have yet to say what will happen
after that date. Caps on shipments of wheat and corn may be
increased after the end of March, Agriculture Minister Mykola
Prysyazhnyuk said Feb. 22.  The government has drafted legislation that would replace
the quotas with export duties, agricultural researcher APK-
Inform said yesterday. The measure has yet to appear before
parliament, according to the  website  of the Kiev-based
legislature.  Corn exports in the current season reached 2.4 million tons
through the end of February, the Economy Ministry said today. It
predicted shipments of the grain of 5.8 million tons from July 1
to June 30 of this year.  Outbound shipments of wheat reached 2.8 million tons as of
the end of February, according to the ministry. Total wheat
exports in the current marketing year may be about 5.3 million
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
