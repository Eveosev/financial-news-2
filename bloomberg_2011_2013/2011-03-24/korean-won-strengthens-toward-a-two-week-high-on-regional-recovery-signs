South Korea ’s won rose toward a
two-week high as reports suggested a recovery in the Asia-
Pacific region was gaining traction before earthquakes in  Japan 
and  New Zealand  struck this year.  Japan reported today that export growth accelerated in
February, before the nation’s strongest earthquake on record
killed thousands, shut factories and caused power shortages. New
Zealand’s economy expanded faster than estimated in the final
quarter of 2010. Foreign investors bought more South Korean
stocks than they sold for a sixth day, the longest run of net
purchases in three months, and the benchmark Kospi index rallied
to its best close in six weeks.  “Japan’s data showed that before the earthquake trade was
improving, which is consistent with the sense that growth was
continuing in the region at the start of the year,” said  David Cohen , a Singapore-based economist for Action Economics who has
previously worked for the U.S. Federal Reserve. “Asia’s growth
should continue in 2011 which is positive for risk appetite.”  The won climbed 0.3 percent to 1,121.15 per dollar as of
the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,118.88 yesterday, the strongest level
since March 10.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose for a third day. The yield
on the 5 percent note due June 2020 slid four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 4.45 percent, according to prices from
Korea Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
