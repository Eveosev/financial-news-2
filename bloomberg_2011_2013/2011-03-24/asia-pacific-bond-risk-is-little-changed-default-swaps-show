The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment was little
changed, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 115 basis points
as of 8:59 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Credit Agricole SA.
The Markit iTraxx Australia index added one basis point to 109.5
as of 11:58 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 121.5 basis
points as of 9:51 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG.
The benchmark rose to a nine-month high of 147 basis points on
March 16, according to data provider CMA in  New York .  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
