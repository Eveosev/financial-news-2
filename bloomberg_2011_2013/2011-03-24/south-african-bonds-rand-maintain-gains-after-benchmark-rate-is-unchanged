South African bonds and the rand
maintained earlier gains after the central bank’s Monetary
Policy Committee left its benchmark interest rate at 5.5
percent, a 30-year low.  The 13.5 percent government bond due September 2015 added
11 cents to 12.19 rand by 3:19 p.m. in Johannesburg, reducing
the yield by 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.78
percent, equal to the yield before the announcement was made.
The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy traded 0.4 percent
stronger at 6.8935 per dollar and gained 0.3 percent to 9.7399
per euro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
