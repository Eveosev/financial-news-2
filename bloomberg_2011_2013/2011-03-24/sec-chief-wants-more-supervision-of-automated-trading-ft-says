Mary Schapiro , the chairman of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called on financial
regulators to increase supervision of algorithms and trading
technology, the Financial Times reported.  At a meeting of the Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association in  Las Vegas , Schapiro said the SEC should
compel market participants “to meet adequate standards for the
capacity, resiliency and security of their automated systems,”
given the presence of malevolent hackers and the possibility of
“algorithm-generated volume surges,” the newspaper reported.  There has been increasing scrutiny of automated trading
after a “flash crash” last May, when a large trading order,
placed by means of an automated algorithm, caused the U.S.
market to drop 6 percent in a few minutes, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
