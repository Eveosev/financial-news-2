Investors should buy  Aruba Networks
Inc. (ARUN)  call spreads because the company may benefit from tablet
computer adoption and has a 30 percent chance of being acquired
in the next 12 months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  Derivatives strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall recommended buying Aruba’s July $33 calls and selling
January $40 calls in a trade known as a “spread” because July
implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, is “in-
line” with three-month historical volatility but “high” over
one year. The Sunnyvale, California-based builder of wireless
networks rallied 6 percent to $33.29 today.  “We are in the early stages of what our tech team views as
a strong enterprise tablet adoption cycle,” the strategists
wrote in a note today. “Our analyst sees a high (30 percent)
likelihood that  Aruba  is acquired in 12 months,” citing data
networking analyst Kent Schofield. Options show “no premium for
mergers and acquisitions.”  Schofield rates Aruba a “buy” and has a price forecast of
$39 on the shares.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
