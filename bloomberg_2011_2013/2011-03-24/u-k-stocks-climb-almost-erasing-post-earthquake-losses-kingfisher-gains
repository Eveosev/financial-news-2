The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rallied
for a second day, erasing losses that followed  Japan ’s March 11
earthquake, after earnings from  Kingfisher (KGF)  Plc and Next Plc beat
estimates and Deutsche Bank AG recommended British retailers.  Kingfisher,  Europe ’s biggest home-improvement retailer, and
Next, the U.K.’s second-largest clothing retailer, jumped more
than 4 percent.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  climbed 3.7 percent.
 Premier Oil (PMO)  Plc led energy shares higher, rallying 4 percent.  The benchmark FTSE 100 climbed 1.5 percent to 5,880.87 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the highest level since March 9.
The gauge rose yesterday as minutes from the Bank of England
reduced speculation of an imminent interest-rate increase. The
 FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  gained 1.4 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index (ISEQ) 
advanced 1.9 percent today.  “Buy U.K. retailers,” Deutsche Bank strategists including
Joelle Anamootoo and Michael Biggs wrote in a report today. “We
expect general retailers to outperform as household spending
growth exceeds expectations in the second half of 2011.”  Stocks kept gains even after a U.S. report showed orders
for durable goods unexpectedly fell last month. Retailers and
mining shares helped European stocks advance today, outweighing
concern that  Portugal  will need a bailout after Prime Minister
Jose Socrates resigned. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  climbed 1
percent.  Kingfisher, Next  Kingfisher jumped 7.2 percent to 261.4 pence after the
retailer reported a 22 percent increase in full-year adjusted
pretax profit to 670 million pounds ($1.09 billion). That
compared with the average analyst estimate of 667.9 million
pounds. The company also said it plans to open more stores in
Russia and  China  and increase common product ranges.  Next (NXT)  rallied 4 percent to 2,043 pence after reporting a 9
percent gain in full-year pretax profit to 551 million pounds.
That topped analysts’ estimates of 549.3 million pounds. Next
also raised its final dividend by 13 percent to 53 pence.  Marks & Spencer, the U.K.’s largest clothing retailer,
advanced 3.7 percent to 358.1 pence and  Tesco Plc (TSCO) , Britain’s
biggest retailer, gained 2.3 percent to 389 pence.  Deutsche Bank named Kingfisher as its “top pick” and said
Marks & Spencer “could provide insulation” against rising
interest rates. The firm also said that Tesco should perform
better than other food retailers because of its “non-food
exposure.”  Premier Oil climbed 4 percent to 1,988 pence as the company
reported a 15 percent rise in full-year profit and forecast
production will reach 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in
the first quarter of 2012.  Production Taxes  Chief Executive Officer Simon Lockett also said the oil and
gas producer won’t have to bear the burden of higher North Sea
production taxes for the next few years because of a $1.1
billion tax allowance.  The shares dropped 4 percent yesterday as U.K. Chancellor
of the Exchequer George Osborne boosted the supplementary charge
on North Sea oil profits to 32 percent from 20 percent.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  also advanced, climbing 4.3 percent to 1,538
pence.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  increased 1.6 percent to 2,235
pence and  BP Plc (BP/)  jumped 2.3 percent to 480.9 pence.  Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc tumbled 14 percent to 54.2
pence after the telecommunications company said gross margins in
its legacy voice business will decline more next year than
previously forecast.  Invensys Plc (ISYS)  sank 4.5 percent to 341.2 pence. The maker of
controls for Whirlpool washing machines fell the most since
January after Chief Executive Officer Ulf Henriksson was
replaced by the company’s finance chief.  To contact the reporter on this story:
