PICC Property & Casualty Co.,
 China ’s biggest non-life insurer, said profit rose almost
threefold last year as the company reversed losses from its
underwriting business with tighter controls on claims and costs.  Net income climbed to 5.21 billion yuan ($794 million), or
0.468 yuan a share, from 1.78 billion yuan, or 0.16 yuan, in
2009, the Beijing-based company said in a statement to the Hong
Kong stock exchange. That’s higher than the 4.4 billion yuan
median estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The insurer posted an underwriting profit of 2.73 billion
yuan last year, compared with a 2.06 billion yuan loss in 2009.
Net premiums earned rose to 123 billion yuan as growing
automobile sales in the world’s biggest car market boosted
motor-insurance revenue, the company’s biggest source of
premiums.  Investment gains slid to 1.08 billion yuan from 1.71
billion yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
