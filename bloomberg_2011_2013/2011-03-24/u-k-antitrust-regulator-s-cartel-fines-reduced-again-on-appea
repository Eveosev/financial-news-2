Britain’s antitrust regulator
miscalculated fines against  Galliford Try Plc (GFRD)  and five other
construction companies in a bid-rigging cartel, a U.K. appeals
court said in a ruling cutting their total fines by 76 percent.  The  Office of Fair Trading  erroneously set the fines using
the companies’ revenue from the year before they were issued
instead of the year prior to the cartel’s end, the  Competition
Appeal Tribunal  ruled today in  London . The penalties were cut to
3.78 million pounds ($6.1 million) from 15.5 million pounds.  The tribunal also “accepted that the high turnover and low
margin nature of the  construction industry  was relevant to the
calculation of the penalties,” according to the judgment. The
result was “disproportionate and excessive fines,” it said.  The dispute is one of the biggest challenges to the OFT and
comes nine months after the agency’s first criminal antitrust
case collapsed at trial due to a evidentiary problems. Earlier
this month, builder  Kier Group Plc (KIE)  and five other U.K. members
of the cartel won the reduction of their fine in the case.  “Galliford Try does not condone any form of anti-
competitive activity and continues to maintain a rigorous
competition law compliance regime across all its businesses,”
the company said in a statement.  The OFT earlier said it will consider appealing the ruling
to the Court of Appeal after studying the judgment and the
rulings on the rest of the 25 companies that appealed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
