Denmark  needs to soften its
immigration rhetoric or risk hurting the economy’s prospects for
growth, Information reported, citing Tine Horwitz, head of the
Consortium for Global Talent.  Political discussion focuses too much on the threat to
Denmark’s welfare system that immigrants present and needs to be
more "nuanced" so it doesn’t drive away well-educated foreigners
whom Denmark needs, the Copenhagen-based newspaper said, citing
Horwitz. The consortium’s members are 15 of Denmark’s largest
companies.       Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
