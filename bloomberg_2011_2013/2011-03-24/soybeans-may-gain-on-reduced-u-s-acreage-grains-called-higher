What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as bigger returns from planting
corn and cotton will result in fewer acres sown with the
oilseed in the U.S., said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C
Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open steady to 0.1 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open up $1 to $2 for 2,000 pounds of
the animal feed.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  on speculation that weekend rains forecast for the
parched southern U.S. Great Plains will fail to boost crop
development, Gerlach said.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher on speculation that  China  will import the grain to
rebuild depleted inventories and slow rising food costs,
Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
