Fitch Ratings Ltd. Managing
Director of Sovereign Ratings  David Riley  told Sky News in an
interview that after the Spanish government “started taking
some pretty tough decisions” to bring  Spain ’s public finances
under control, the country is “decoupling from developments in
Portugal and Ireland in terms of what’s happening in the market,
with  interest rates  and bond yields.”  However, the country
“is not out of the woods yet,” Riley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
