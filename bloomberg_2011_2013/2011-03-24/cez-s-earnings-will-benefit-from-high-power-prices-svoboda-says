CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s
largest power producer, will profit in the coming years from
higher electricity prices caused by  Germany ’s decision to
temporarily shut down seven of its oldest atomic reactors,
Trading Director Alan Svoboda said.  “Given the fact that CEZ hadn’t pre-sold a significant
portion of its production for the next few years, the rise in
power prices will have a positive impact on our future
earnings,” Svoboda said in an e-mailed message.  The price of baseload power for 2012 has jumped 4.2 percent
since Chancellor Angela Merkel’s March 14 decision to close the
old plants for a 3-month inspection. CEZ, which operates six
nuclear reactors and plans to build at least two more, does not
need to take additional security measures because the  power
plants  are already under a very strict regimen, Svoboda said.  CEZ gained 1.2 percent to 859.5 koruna at 9:57 a.m. in
Prague. The stock has advanced 7.1 percent since March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
