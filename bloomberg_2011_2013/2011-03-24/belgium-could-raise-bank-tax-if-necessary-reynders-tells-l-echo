Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said fiscal measures could be used to rein in banks
should there be a return to former practices of paying excessive
bonuses,  L’Echo  reported, citing an interview.  “The easiest would be to increase the rate of tax levied
on bank profits rather than more tax on bonuses, which are
already at a level of 70 percent,” Reynders said, according to
the newspaper. “If banks have good results today, it is also
because taxpayers helped them to survive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
