Hungary’s forint continues to be
undervalued because investors have yet to fully acknowledge the
government’s economic policy, Debt Management Agency Chief
Executive Officer Gyula Pleschinger told HVG.  “The Swiss franc is very strong while the forint is
undervalued because the government’s achievements haven’t been
appreciated as much as they should have,” Pleschinger said,
according to the transcript of the interview published today in
the Hungarian weekly.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
