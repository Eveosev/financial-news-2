The U.K. government published today
a consultation paper that might allow  Northern Ireland ’s power-
sharing executive to reduce the region’s corporation tax rate to
12.5 percent.  “It is estimated that the level of investment in Northern
Ireland would be around 6 percent higher each year than it would
have been in the base case, where the Northern Ireland
corporation tax rate is not devolved and reduced to 12.5
percent,” according to the document, released at a press
conference in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, today.  The consultation period lasts until June 24, after which
the results will be presented to the U.K. government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
