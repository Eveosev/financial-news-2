U.K. natural gas and power prices
may increase because of the British carbon floor tax, according
to Evolution Securities.  Gas prices in 2013 may rise by about 4 pence a therm and
power by 4.70 pounds per megawatt hour, Lakis Athanasiou, a U.K.
utilities analyst at Evolution Securities in  London , said today
in an e-mailed note.  Negative market reaction yesterday in  Drax Group Plc (DRX) ’s
share price was “wrong-headed,” he said. “The additional CO2
price is being set three years in advance so that generators
will have time to include this rise in hedging activities,
minimizing basis risk. To the extent gas and coal generators are
unhedged for 2013/14, the impact of higher CO2 prices is
neutral.” Drax owns western  Europe ’s largest power station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
