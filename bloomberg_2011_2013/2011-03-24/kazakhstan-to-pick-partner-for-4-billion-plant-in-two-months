Kazakhstan plans to pick a partner
for its planned $4 billion polyethylene plant in the next two
months, said Deputy Oil and Gas Minister Aset Magauov.  The government will choose  South Korea ’s biggest chemicals
maker  LG Chem Ltd. (051910)  or  Abu Dhabi ’s International Petroleum
Investment Co., Magauov told reporters today in Almaty.  The Kazakh  gas chemicals complex  will be able to produce
800,000 tons of polyethylene, used to make plastics, and 500,000
metric tons of polypropylene a year at full capacity in 2015,
according to an Oil & Gas Ministry  plan  published on March 15 in
Kazakhstanskaya Pravda, the official newspaper.  South Korea’s Hanwha Chemical Corp.,  Japan ’s  Marubeni Corp. (8002) 
and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , known as Sinopec, had also
held talks on building the plant, the ministry said.  Sinopec last March won a contract to build a 300 billion-
tenge ($2 billion) polypropylene plant in western  Kazakhstan , as
a part of the complex.  TOO Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries ,
50 percent held by state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co.’s
London-traded unit, will be the operator for both plants.  LG Chem may arrange as much as $2.7 billion of financing
with South Korean financial institutions, he said. The remaining
$1.3 billion will be invested by partners, Magauov said. IPIC
hasn’t provided its detailed plan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
