French business confidence
unexpectedly rose in March as export demand and inventory
building at home boosted manufacturers’ orders.  An index of sentiment among factory executives rose to 109
from 106 in February, national statistics institute Insee said
today in an e-mailed statement from Paris. That’s the highest
since March 2008. Economists had forecast a drop to 105, the
median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  French executives are growing more optimistic as reviving
global demand boosts orders and earnings. Industrial output rose
more than economists forecast in January and unemployment
dropped in the fourth quarter. Still, surging energy costs are
driving up costs, prompting the  European Central Bank  to signal
that it’s ready to raise borrowing costs next month.  “The environment remains favorable” for business, said
Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas in
Paris. “Industry continues to be driven by the recovery in
domestic orders and exports.”  A gauge measuring the overall production outlook rose to 21
from 19 in the previous month, Insee said. Companies also grew
more optimistic about their own outlook, with an index rising to
25 from 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
