Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. lender by assets, said emerging markets have a better
outlook than those of the developed world and it remains focused
on growing operations in  Asia  and Latin America.  Citigroup plans to invest $3 billion to $4 billion over the
next two or three years in its consumer operations, mostly in
emerging markets, Manuel Medina-Mora, head of consumer banking
for the Americas, told reporters today in Santiago.  “We think that those emerging economies that weren’t
affected by the global financial crisis have favorable growth
prospects,” he said. “Developed markets still have too high
debt and unemployment levels.”  In Latin America,  Chile , Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru
are attractive growth markets, while  Panama  is also “advancing
very well,” Medina-Mora said.  Citigroup will relinquish its preferential right to buy new
stock in Banco de Chile, the country’s second-biggest lender,
Medina-Mora said.  Chile’s Luksic family and Citigroup each own 50 percent of
LQ Inversiones Financieras SA, Banco de Chile’s biggest
shareholder. Control of the bank remains in the Luksics’ hands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
