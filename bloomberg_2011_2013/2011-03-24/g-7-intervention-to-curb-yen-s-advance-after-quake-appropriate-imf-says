The Group of Seven’s intervention
last week to curb a surge in the yen was “appropriate” after
volatility that was “unhelpful” to the Japanese economy, an
official at the  International Monetary Fund  said.  While the yen “in real effective terms” is “broadly in
line” with its long-term fundamentals, short-term volatility of
the  exchange rate  can be concern, Mahmood Pradhan, a senior
adviser in the IMF’s Asia-Pacific department, told reporters in
 Washington  today. There’s been no evidence so far of Japanese
repatriation of assets from abroad that would drive the currency
higher, he said.  “The movements were disorderly and unhelpful for economic
and financial stability in a country that has just been affected
by a very large natural disaster,” Pradhan said. “In that
context the concerted intervention was appropriate.”  The G-7 on March 18 jointly intervened in the foreign
exchange market for the first time in more than a decade after
Japan’s currency soared, threatening its recovery from a March
11 earthquake and tsunami. Japan began the effort, with  Europe ’s
central banks following up in their markets, sending the
currency down the most against the dollar since 2008.  Pradhan also said that Japan has an “ample pool” of
resources for its reconstruction needs.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
