Lasko Products Inc. , a maker of
fans, humidifiers and Christmas tree stands, recalled 4.8
million box fans after seven fires were reported, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission said.  The fans’ motors are prone to electrical failure, the CPSC
said. Consumers should stop using the devices and contact  West
Chester , Pennsylvania-based Lasko for a free fused-plug safety
adapter, the agency said.  Two house fires and one barn fire have been reported,
resulting in extensive property damage, the CPSC said. The U.S.-
made fans were sold at retailers nationwide from July 2002
through December 2005 for $12 to $25, the CPSC said.  Lasko, which recalled 5.6 million fans in 2006, including
models branded Lasko, General Electric, Galaxy and Air King,
according to the CPSC’s  website . That action, which also was
pinned on faulty motor electronics, followed 42 fires, including
8 with extensive property damage.  The company recalled 107,500 portable electric heaters last
month after reports of an electrical connection overheating and
melting. Lasko offered free replacements for the Chinese-made
heaters. Other Lasko-made heaters were recalled in 2007 and
2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
