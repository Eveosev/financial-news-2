The nuclear crisis in  Japan  may
prompt the government to say that it may have difficulty
delivering on a pledge to cut emissions by 25 percent in 2020
from 1990 levels, said Artur Runge-Metzger, director for climate
strategy and negotiations at the European Commission.  Runge-Metzger spoke in an interview during a climate
seminar in Budapest yesterday.  Japan made the emissions-reduction pledge last year as part
of a political accord reached during United Nations climate
talks in Copenhagen in December 2009.  “It will certainly affect the debate in terms of
technology choices. I’m sure there will be a debate, in
particular with our Japanese colleagues. In policy terms, you’ll
probably see the biggest fallout in Japan, which is really hit
by the nuclear crisis.”  “They will probably revisit their  energy policy , and that
may have some implications for international negotiations. They
will have to look at the alternatives. If you don’t have almost
carbon-free nuclear energy, what else can you use?”  “Their back-up power is coal, so they may say that it’s
much more difficult for them to reduce emissions. They have made
the commitment of minus 25 percent, but that was made on the
assumption that nuclear will exist.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
