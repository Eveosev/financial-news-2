Swiss Reinsurance Co. mortality
bonds may have their rating cut because of uncertainty over the
death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan ,  Standard &
Poor’s  said.  The BB+ rated Vita Capital IV series III bonds, which
protect against higher costs from a “severe” increase in
deaths in countries including the U.S. and Japan, were put on
review for possible downgrade, S&P said today in a statement.  Risk Management Solutions Inc. estimated that an event
causing 50,000 deaths in Japan would result in a loss on the
bonds issues by the Zurich-based reinsurer, S&P said. The death
toll from Japan’s worst postwar disaster has climbed to 9,737,
with 16,501 people missing, according to the  National Police
Agency  in  Tokyo .  “We anticipate that if the deaths caused by the earthquake
and tsunami are around 20,000, the rating on the series III
notes is likely to remain” in the BB range, S&P said. “We
expect to resolve the CreditWatch placement once there is more
clarity regarding the number of deaths.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
