Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  took four months to
customize and package the C7 smartphone as the Astound for T-
Mobile, Nokia Vice President of Development and Technology Eric
Klein said according to the blog The Next Web.  Nokia’s partnership with Microsoft Corp. to produce
handsets and services based on Windows Phone 7 means that some
code from the Espoo, Finland-based company will run on
competitors’ handsets, the blog cited Klein as saying.  The companies are discussing how best to sell mobile
applications and could agree to let Nokia’s Ovi Store carry
Windows Phone apps, Klein said according to the blog.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
