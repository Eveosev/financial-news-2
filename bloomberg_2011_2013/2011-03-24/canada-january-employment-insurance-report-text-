The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment insurance report for Jan. released
by Statistics Canada.  The number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits declined by 13,300 (-2.0%) in
January to 640,200, the sixth decline in seven months. The
number of beneficiaries decreased in seven provinces, with
the fastest decline in Ontario.  Fewer Employment Insurance claims  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. There were 242,400 initial and renewal claims
received in January, down 4,900 (-2.0%) from December.
With this decline, the number of claims was similar to
levels observed last June.  The situation across Canada varied. Ontario experienced
the largest decline (-8,400), followed by Quebec (-1,600)
and  Alberta  (-500). Claims increased in all other
provinces and territories, most notably in  New Brunswick 
(+1,100).  Claims provide an indication of the number of people
who could become beneficiaries.  Largest declines in beneficiaries in Ontario, British
Columbia, Quebec and Alberta  All provinces except those in Atlantic Canada recorded
a fourth consecutive monthly decline in the number of
beneficiaries in January.  In Ontario, the number of regular beneficiaries fell by
11,200 (-5.5%) to 192,600, and was the largest of four
consecutive monthly declines in the province.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell
by 1,900 (-2.4%) in January to 76,100, while it declined
by 1,500 (-0.8%) to 184,000 in Quebec. In Alberta, the
number declined by 1,400 (-3.0%) to 44,800.  In New Brunswick, the only province with a notable
increase in January, the number of beneficiaries rose by
840 (+2.5%) to 34,300.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  Employment Insurance data by sub-provincial region, sex
and age are not seasonally adjusted and are therefore
compared on a year-over-year basis.  Year-over-year declines in most large centres continued  Between January 2010 and January 2011, the number of
regular beneficiaries fell by 98,900 (-11.3%) at the
national level, with decreases in 122 of the 143 large
centres (see map). The number of large centres reporting
year-over-year declines has been relatively stable over
the past 10 months. Large centres are those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  The five large centres in Newfoundland and Labrador all
had fewer EI beneficiaries in January. The fastest
decrease occurred in St. John's, where the number fell by
710 to 5,700. This was the 10th consecutive month of year-
over-year declines.  The number of regular beneficiaries fell in 29 of the
33 large centres in  Quebec  between January 2010 and
January 2011. The fastest declines occurred in Saint-
Georges, Granby, Dolbeau-Mistassini and Rouyn-Noranda.
Montreal recorded 7,800 fewer beneficiaries, the 11th
consecutive month of year-over-year declines. In the
census metropolitan area of Quebec, the number of
beneficiaries declined by 430, the first decrease in eight
months.  In Ontario, 36 of its 41 large centres posted declines
between January 2010 and January 2011. The most notable
declines were in Greater Sudbury, Windsor, Tillsonburg,
Leamington and Belleville. In Toronto, 80,400 people
received benefits in January, down 19,500 from 12 months
earlier. This was the 11th consecutive month of year-over-
year declines.  In Alberta, all 12 large centres had fewer regular
beneficiaries. The pace of decline was fastest in Brooks,
Grande Prairie, Red Deer, Camrose and Medicine Hat. In
Calgary, the number of beneficiaries fell by 6,200 to
14,600, the 10th consecutive month of year-over-year
declines. In  Edmonton , the number of beneficiaries
decreased by 3,200 to 15,300, also the 10th consecutive
decline.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell
in 21 of 25 large centres in the 12 months to January. The
fastest declines were in Fort St. John,  Williams Lake ,
Prince Rupert and Prince George. In Victoria, the number
of beneficiaries declined year over year for the 10th
consecutive month, down 370 to 4,400. In  Vancouver , those
receiving benefits fell by 3,800 to 34,800, the eighth
decline in a row.  Demographic groups  Faster year-over-year decline for men than women  Between January 2010 and January 2011, the number of
male EI regular beneficiaries fell by 79,000 (-13.4%) to
512,500. This was the  11th consecutive month with a year-
over-year decline.  For men, the fastest rates of decline occurred among
those aged under 25 years (-15.9%) and 25 to 54 (-15.7%).
Over the same period, the number of beneficiaries
decreased by 3.2% among men aged 55 and over.  The rate of decline was slower among female
beneficiaries. The number of women receiving regular
benefits decreased by 19,900 (-6.9%) to 267,200. This was
the eighth consecutive month of year-over-year declines.  For women aged under 25 years, the number of
beneficiaries decreased by 3,400 (-14.9%), while among
those aged 25 to 54, it decreased by 18,700 (-8.9%). In
contrast, the number of female beneficiaries aged 55 and
over rose by 2,200 (+4.1%).  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the
current labour market situation, using Employment
Insurance (EI) statistics and other sources. Earlier this
month, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of
overall labour market conditions, including unemployment,
total employment and those affected by changes in the
labour market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional
sub-provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details
by industry will follow with data from the Survey of
Employment, Payrolls and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from an administrative data
source from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada.
These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by
changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative
procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries and the
number of claims received for December 2010 and January
2011 are preliminary. In this release, large centres
correspond to those with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from January 9 to 15. This period
coincides with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There are always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries
reflects various situations, including people becoming
beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.
