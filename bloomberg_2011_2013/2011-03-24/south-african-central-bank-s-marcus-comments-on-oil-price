South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments on oil prices after a
meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria 
today.  “The biggest risks to the inflation outlook remain food
and administered prices, but in particular oil prices.  “International oil prices had already accelerated in the
latter part of 2010 in response to strong global demand.  “This upward trend has been reinforced by the political
events in North Africa and Middle East, which have raised
concerns about the security of oil supplies.  “Should these political pressures be resolved soon, the
underlying demand pressures are likely to still keep oil prices
at relatively elevated levels.  “I don’t think anybody knows what will happen to the oil
price.  “This is a huge risk on the upside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
