Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen,
 Germany ’s fifth-biggest state-owned bank, said full-year profit
declined 7.7 percent on lower trading revenue.  Net income fell to 298 million euros ($421 million) from
323 million euros a year earlier, the Frankfurt-based company
said in a statement today. Trading income dropped 53 percent to
148 million euros.  The bank, also known as Helaba, is “well prepared” for
this year’s stress tests planned by European Union regulators
because of its “conservative risk profile,” the lender said.
The company opposes stricter definitions of capital that would
exclude so-called silent participations in the stress tests,
echoing similar criticism by the Association of German Banks.  The bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial
strength, rose to 9.6 percent at the end of 2010 from 8.8
percent a year earlier. Helaba also forecast an increase in
profit in 2011 should the economic recovery continue and loan
losses remain stable.  The company’s full-year interest income declined 1.2
percent to 1.02 billion euros, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
