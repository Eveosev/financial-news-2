JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said it’s seeking to restructure its debt, which may
boost annual profit by about $1 billion over the next decade.  JBS is considering selling new bonds and bank loans, as
well as transferring about $2 billion of debt to its U.S. unit,
Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista said. The company may
decide on a debt-restructuring plan within 90 days he said.  “Our revenue is mostly in dollars and our costs too, so it
doesn’t make sense to have our debt in  Brazil ,” Batista told
reporters today in Sao Paulo.  The move would lower borrowing costs and provide additional
accounting benefits under Brazilian standards, which could add
about $100 million to net income a year over the next 10 years,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
