Ethanol futures gained for the
first time this week in  Chicago  on concern cold, wet weather in
the Midwest will hamper corn crops and narrow production margins
for the biofuel.  The grain-based additive increased the most in five
sessions and corn surged as MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy
Weather forecast cold weather to blanket much of the corn-rich
U.S. Midwest through March 28. Corn is the primary ingredient
used to produce ethanol.  “Weather is certainly an issue,” said Jerrod Kitt, an
analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “There’s concern about the
spring planting. You never know with these corn prices. They’re
just so volatile and you have to stay very well-protected.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 3.2 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.515 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 62 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.645 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive lost 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.475, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  fell 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.57 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive increased 0.5
cent to $2.70.  Corn for May delivery jumped 21.5 cents, or 3.2 percent, to
$7.025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes about 2.75 gallons
of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
