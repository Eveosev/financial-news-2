Germany  must pay its share of the
euro rescue fund to help protect savers,  Volker Kauder , the
caucus leader in parliament for  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
 Christian Democratic Union  said in an interview in  Bild .  The future euro rescue fund would only function if all
euro-area states paid in capital, Kauder said in the newspaper.
“We have to protect the euro, and also for all savers,” he was
quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
