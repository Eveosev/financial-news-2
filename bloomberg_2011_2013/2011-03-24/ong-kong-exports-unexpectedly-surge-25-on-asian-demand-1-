Hong Kong’s exports unexpectedly
surged 25 percent in February from a year earlier, buoyed by
demand within  Asia .  Overseas shipments gained to HK$227.8 billion ($29
billion) after rising 28 percent in January, the government
said on its website today. That topped the 10.3 percent
median estimate of 12 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
None of the analysts forecast such a large gain.  The impact of Japan’s earthquake will be reflected in
trade figures in coming months, the government said. At the
same time, exports should continue to benefit from “vibrant
economic conditions” elsewhere in Asia and recoveries in the
U.S. and the European Union, it said.  China ’s week-long Lunar New Year holiday distorts trade
figures in the first two months of each year.  Imports rose 25 percent from a year earlier, leaving a
trade deficit of HK$25.1 billion, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
