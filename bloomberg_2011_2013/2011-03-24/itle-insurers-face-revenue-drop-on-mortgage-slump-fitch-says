The U.S. title insurance industry,
led by  Fidelity National Financial Inc. (FNF)  and  First American
Financial Corp. (FAF) , will probably post lower revenue this year than
in 2010 as mortgage originations decline,  Fitch Ratings  said.  “Operating performance remains considerably weaker than
the strong profits reported from 2004 to 2007 and the industry
continues to face headwinds,” the ratings firm said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
