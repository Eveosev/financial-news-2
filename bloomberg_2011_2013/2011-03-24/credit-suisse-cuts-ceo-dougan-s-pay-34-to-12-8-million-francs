Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second-biggest bank, cut total compensation for
Chief Executive Officer Brady Dougan 34 percent for 2010 after
profit declined.  Dougan’s pay of 12.8 million Swiss francs ($14 million)
included a fixed salary of 2.5 million francs, which doubled
from 2009, and 10.26 million francs in bonus and other
compensation, the Zurich-based bank said in its  annual report 
published today. He was paid 19.2 million francs in 2009.  Credit Suisse cut the total 2010 bonus pool by 27 percent
to about 5.05 billion francs, as net income fell 24 percent to
5.1 billion francs. The decline in earnings was a result of
lower client activity in the second half of the year.  UBS AG,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, said earlier this month
that Chief Executive Officer  Oswald Gruebel  decided to forgo his
bonus for 2010 because the company’s shares didn’t rise in the
period. UBS cut compensation for the highest-paid member of the
executive board, investment bank head Carsten Kengeter, by 29
percent to 9.32 million francs.  The top-paid member on Credit Suisse’s executive board was
Antonio Quintella with total compensation of 15.63 million
francs. The former CEO of the bank’s Brazil business was
promoted to head the Americas region in July.  Deferred Pay  The 16-member Credit Suisse executive board received total
pay of 160.34 million francs, up from the 148.9 million francs
given to 13 individuals in 2009. Board members except for Paul Calello, who passed away last year, didn’t receive any cash
bonuses and on average got 24 percent lower variable
compensation that was fully deferred into future years, it said.  Managers who received bonuses as part of the so-called
performance incentive plan II, or PIP II program for 2005, will
probably not receive any payout when the awards settle in May
because Credit Suisse’s share price will probably be below the
47 franc target, the bank said today. Credit Suisse last April
paid out more than 3 billion francs of shares, including stock
worth about 71 million francs to Dougan, from the previous PIP I
awards plan.  The board of directors, headed by Chairman Hans-Ulrich Doerig, received total pay of 19.96 million francs, Credit
Suisse said. The bank proposed to shareholders the re-election
of Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Jean Lanier and Anton van Rossum to
the board at the annual meeting next month.  CoCo Bonds  Credit Suisse also asked for shareholders’ approval to
increase the amount of shares it can issue to 500 million from
100 million previously. The increase would allow the bank to
sell contingent convertible bonds, which turn into equity when
the bank’s capital drops below a certain level, to fulfill
regulatory proposals.  The bank last month cut its return on equity target to more
than 15 percent from more than 18 percent in response to
stricter regulation. The bank has already sold $2 billion in
contingent convertible bonds and agreed to exchange about $6.2
billion of existing hybrid debt held by shareholders in  Qatar 
and  Saudi Arabia  for CoCo notes after October 2013.  Credit Suisse is “well positioned to succeed in the
changing operating environment,” Dougan and Doerig said in the
message to shareholders today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
