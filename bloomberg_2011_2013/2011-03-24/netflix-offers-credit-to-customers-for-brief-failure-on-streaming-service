Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  offered customers a 3
percent credit for a brief failure this week of its online
streaming  service .  The Los Gatos, California-based company sent an e-mail to
customers who may have “attempted and were unable to instantly
watch TV episodes or movies” on March 22. The credit amounts to
24 cents back from Netflix’s $7.99 monthly streaming-only plan.  Netflix rose $1.26 to $230.32 at 12:52 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Before today, the stock had
