German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said that Portuguese Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  did the right
thing in putting a “far-reaching” program of austerity
measures to parliament.  Merkel, in a speech to lower-house lawmakers in Berlin
today, said that Socrates had been “right and courageous” in
presenting an additional round of budget cuts, and that she was
“grateful” to him for taking responsibility for his country’s
finances.  “I regret that there wasn’t a parliamentary majority for
it,” Merkel said, as she outlined her stance to lawmakers
before traveling to Brussels for a two-day European Union summit
on the debt crisis. The proposed Portuguese cuts, announced at
the last EU summit on March 11, were supported by the EU and
 European Central Bank , she said.  Merkel made the case to German lawmakers for a package of
measures to be ratified by EU leaders to tamp down the sovereign
crisis that threatens to engulf  Portugal  after spreading from
Greece and Ireland. Portugal was pushed closer to an
international bailout last night after parliament rejected plans
to cut the budget, prompting Socrates to tender his resignation.  There is no alternative to budget prudence, bolstering
competitiveness and “filling in the gaps” on the rules
governing the euro, Merkel said. It’s right to continue to
impose conditions on “solidarity,” she said.  “I would rather focus on the growing competitiveness in
Europe than constantly having to worry about rescue programs for
other countries,” Merkel said. “We’re ensuring that  Europe  as
a whole improves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
