Marine Current Turbines Ltd. and
 RWE AG (RWE) ’s Npower Renewables unit today sought permission to build
a 10-megawatt tidal power project off northwest Wales.  The companies plan to install seven twin-rotor tidal
turbines in the sea off Anglesey in 2015 at a cost of 70 million
pounds ($113 million), Marine Current Turbines said in an e-
mailed  statement . The offshore project by the companies’
SeaGeneration Wales Ltd. venture would harness enough power for
10,000 Anglesey homes, according to the statement.  The U.K. has estimated wave and tidal power could power 15
million homes by 2050. Marine Current Turbines in 2008 began
operating a device like an underwater windmill in the sea off
 Northern Ireland , the U.K.’s first commercial tidal power plant.  The Crown Estate, which administers most of the U.K. seabed
on behalf of the monarchy, a year ago awarded 10 contracts to
companies including  E.ON AG (EOAN)  and  Siemens AG (SIE)  of  Germany ,
Vattenfall AB and  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ’s ScottishPower unit to develop
as much as 1.2 gigawatts of wave and tidal power in Scotland, or
enough to power 700,000 homes. Siemens last year bought an
almost 10 percent stake in Marine Current Turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
