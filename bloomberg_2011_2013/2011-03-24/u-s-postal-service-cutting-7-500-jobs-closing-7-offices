The U.S.  Postal Service , which has
said it may run out of money this fiscal year, plans to
eliminate about 7,500 jobs and close seven administrative
offices to cut costs.  The agency plans an early retirement and financial
incentive program to move workers with a minimum of 20 years or
a total of 25 years at the postal service depending on age out
of its employee base, according to an statement e-mailed today.
The changes will save $750 million a year, the agency said.  “It’s critical that we adjust our workforce to match
America’s changing communications trends as mail volumes
continue to decline,” Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said
in the statement.  The Postal Service has a workforce of almost 575,000 after
cutting about 230,000 jobs through attrition since 2000. Donahoe
told a congressional subcommittee earlier this month that the
agency will eventually have a workforce in the “400,000
range.”  The seven district offices that are closing are Columbus in
 Ohio ; South East Michigan; Northern Illinois; South East New
England; South Georgia; Big Sky in Montana; and Albuquerque in
 New Mexico , the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
