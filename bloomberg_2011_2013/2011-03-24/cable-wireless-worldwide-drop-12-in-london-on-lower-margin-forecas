Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/) 
dropped the most in eight months after predicting the next
financial year’s gross margins in its legacy voice business will
decline more than the 10 percent previously forecast.
      Cable & Wireless Worldwide fell as much as 12 percent to
55.95 pence in London trading, the biggest decline since July
20. The stock was down 11 percent as of 9:43 a.m.  The company faces competitive pressure in the market for
pure data connectivity” and “price erosion on a number of
contract re-signs,” Cable & Wireless Worldwide said in a
statement today. “In addition, we are seeing inflationary cost
pressures in a number of specific areas such as power and
property rents where costs are expected to increase by around 10
million pounds in 2011/12.”  Cable & Wireless Worldwide, which provides
telecommunications services to customers including National Grid
Plc, separated from its parent company in March 2010.  “The outlook is definitely weaker,” Morten Singleton, an
analyst at Investec Securities, said in a note today. ”The
market reaction today should be negative.”  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
are now predicted to be on the same level in the 12 months
through March 2012 as in the previous year, Cable & Wireless
Worldwide said. The average prediction by analysts in a
Bloomberg survey is for Ebitda of 470 million pounds next year
after 443 million pounds this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
