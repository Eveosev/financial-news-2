Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s unit in
 Nigeria , sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy, said full-
year profit rose 16 percent to 9.5 billion naira ($61 million)
as it increased lending.  Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) ’s net interest income, the money
earned from loans, rose 5 percent to 26.4 billion naira as the
Lagos-based company declared a dividend of 39 kobo per share,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Nigerian lenders cut back on lending after a debt crisis in
2008 and 2009 threatened the industry with collapse. The Central
Bank of Nigeria fired the chief executives of eight of the
country’s 24 lenders and bailed out the industry with 620
billion naira. Stanbic IBTC was not one of the recipients of the
cash.  Stanbic IBTC’s shares gained 38 kobo, or 4.1 percent, to
9.65 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close of the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange . The stock has outpaced the bourse’s All-Share Index
this year, gaining 4.9 percent compared with the market’s 1.2
percent rise in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
