Greystar Resources Ltd. (GSL) , which last
week withdrew permit applications for a $1 billion mine project
in  Colombia  that sparked environmental opposition, can’t build
any project in a protected watershed area, the government said.  The company can’t build any underground mine that would
“compromise” the watershed, the Energy and Mines Ministry said
yesterday on its  website . Vancouver-based Greystar said March 18
it was studying alternatives that include an underground mine at
its Angostura deposit in northeastern Colombia.  Greystar had said in January that it needed environmental
approval by the end of June to start output at the site in 2013.
The company said then that Angostura would produce about 2
million ounces of silver and 500,000 ounces of gold annually.  On March 18, Greystar said a new plan under study would
produce 200,000 ounces of gold annually. The company also said
it would meet regulators to discuss “alternative options.”  Greystar slid 14 cents, or 5.4 percent, to C$2.44 as of
9:37 a.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  The company has the right to present a new plan to
regulators, according to yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
