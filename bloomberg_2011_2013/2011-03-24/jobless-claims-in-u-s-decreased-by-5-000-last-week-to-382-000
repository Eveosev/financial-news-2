Fewer Americans filed applications
for  unemployment benefits  last week, signaling the labor market
is mending.  Jobless claims declined by 5,000 to 382,000 in the week
ended March 19, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington, in line with the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The total number of people receiving
benefits dropped to the lowest level in almost three years.  Waning firings and a pickup in hiring are helping to ensure
gains in  consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent
of the economy. The report is consistent with Federal Reserve
policy makers’ assessment that the economic recovery is on a
firmer footing, even as they said the unemployment rate remains
“elevated.”  “The labor market recovery is on track,” said  David
Semmens , a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New
York. “The  unemployment rate  will see a slow-but-steady grind
down.”  Orders for long-lasting goods unexpectedly fell in
February, reflecting declines in demand for capital goods and
military aircraft, a report from the Commerce Department also
showed today. Bookings for goods meant to last at least three
years dropped 0.9 percent after a 3.6 percent gain the prior
month that was larger than initially reported.  Stock-index futures trimmed earlier gains after the
reports. The contract on the  Standard & Poor’s  500 index
maturing in June rose 0.6 percent to 1,299.3 at 8:36 a.m. in New
York. It had been as high as 1,302.7 before the data.  Median Forecast  Jobless benefits applications were projected to fall to
383,000 from 385,000 initially reported for the prior week,
according to the median forecast of 48 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Estimates ranged from 370,000 to 395,000. The Labor
Department revised the prior week’s figure up to 387,000.  There was “nothing unusual” in last week’s data, a Labor
Department spokesman said as the figures were released to
reporters. The report “appears to be clean,” he said. Claims
for one state,  Alaska , were estimated.  The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, fell to 385,250 last week, the lowest level
since July 2008, today’s data showed.  Total Benefits  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 2,000 in the week ended March 12 to 3.72 million, the
fewest since September 2008.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
13,000 to 4.34 million in the week ended March 5.  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, was 3 percent for a
fourth consecutive week.  Thirty-eight states and territories reported a decline in
claims, while 15 reported an increase. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  New York  saw the biggest drop in claims,
almost 17,000, as fewer transportation and services industries
fired staff.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  ‘Firmer Footing’  “The economic recovery is on a firmer footing, and overall
conditions in the labor market appear to be improving
gradually,” Fed officials said in a statement after their
meeting on March 15. “Currently, the unemployment rate remains
elevated.”  The jobless rate fell in February to 8.9 percent, the
lowest since April 2009 and the third straight monthly decline,
Labor Department figures showed March 4. More seasonable weather
helped boost payrolls by 192,000, the most since May. Employment
figures for March are due on April 1.  Improving demand is encouraging some companies to take on
more employees, cushioning earlier cutbacks.  General Motors Co. (GM) 
will recall the last of its laid-off workers by September,
United Auto Workers Vice President Joe Ashton said yesterday.  “We only have about 2,000 people now laid off and those
people will all be back to work in September,” Ashton, who
handles negotiations with GM, told union workers at the UAW’s
Special Convention on Collective Bargaining in  Detroit . A GM
spokeswoman said the company wasn’t predicting when it would
complete recalling laid-off workers.  Since October, the Detroit-based car maker has announced
plans to add shifts and a combined 1,350 jobs to assembly plants
in Flint and Lansing,  Michigan . An additional 1,550 workers will
be retained at a factory in Orion Township, Michigan, scheduled
to reopen this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
