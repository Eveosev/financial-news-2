Japanese stocks fell for a second
day, led by  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., after the utility cast
doubt on a planned dividend and as carmakers declined on concern
parts supplies will be disrupted.  Tokyo Electric, which operates the nuclear plant damaged by
a March 11 earthquake and tsunami, tumbled 14 percent as it
suspended its decision to pay a second-half dividend. Nissan
Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest carmaker by sales, lost 4.6
percent after the company said about 40 component suppliers
remain in difficulty following the record quake.  “Stocks are falling in view of the impact of the blackouts
and damage by the earthquake and tsunami,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $17 billion in Tokyo as chief
strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. “Declining investor
sentiment is also dragging stocks down.”  The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average fell 0.2 percent to 9,435.01
at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo after rising as much as 0.6
percent. The broader Topix index lost 0.8 percent to 853.95,
with about five stocks declining for every three that advanced.  The Topix lost 4.2 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a gain of 3.2 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and a drop of 1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at 14.5 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the
 S&P 500  and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  Tepco Leads Declines  Tokyo Electric Power, which is  Asia ’s largest utility and
operates the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant that was damaged
by the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami, tumbled 14 percent
to 902 yen, the biggest drop in the Nikkei 225. The company,
which suspended its plan to pay a second-half dividend of 30
yen, was the most actively traded stock in Japan.  Other  utility companies  also declined. Tohoku Electric
Power Co., which provides electricity to disaster-stricken areas
including Fukushima, Iwate and Miyagi prefectures, sank 5
percent to 1,514 yen. Chubu Electric Power Co. slumped 1.7
percent to 1,976 yen after the company delayed the planned start
on construction of a new reactor for a year.  “People have yet to figure out how big the negative
effects of the disaster will be on the economy and corporate
earnings, so they aren’t in a position to actively buy stocks,”
said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $450 million in Tokyo
at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Nissan Drops  Carmakers were the heaviest drag on the Topix among the 33
industry groups in the index.  Nissan Motor  slumped 4.6 percent
to 671 yen, the lowest close since Sept. 10, after Chief
Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said electronic components,
plastics and rubber are in short supply and will affect Japanese
automakers and rivals outside the country.  Carmakers are jointly offering stricken component-makers
support via Japan’s automobile manufacturers association, he
said. Toyota Motor Corp., which is the world’s biggest automaker
and this week extended a shutdown of all car-assembly plants in
Japan, sank 2.7 percent to 3,215 yen. Honda Motor Co. fell 2.6
percent to 3,010 yen.  Japan’s government said yesterday it estimates the damage
from this month’s record earthquake and tsunami at as much as 25
trillion yen ($309 billion), almost four times the bill faced by
the U.S. from  Hurricane Katrina .  The destruction will push down the total value of gross
domestic product by as much as 2.75 trillion yen for the year
starting April 1, yesterday’s report showed. The figure, about
0.5 percent of the 530 trillion-yen economy, reflects a decline
in production from supply disruptions and damage to corporate
facilities, without taking into account the effects of possible
power outages.  Building Materials, Water  Construction-related stocks rose on the outlook for orders.
Taiheiyo Cement Corp., Japan’s biggest cement maker, jumped 5.2
percent to 161 yen, the highest close since August 2009.
Furukawa Co., a maker of rock drills, cranes and bulldozers,
leapt 7.5 percent to 86 yen, the biggest gain in the Nikkei 225.
Daito Trust Construction Co. increased 2.6 percent to 6,280 yen.  Makers of drinks and water-treatment equipment also
advanced after Tokyo officials warned of radiation risks in tap
water. Ito En Ltd. and Coca-Cola West Co. climbed more than 3.8
percent. Nihon Trim Co., a maker of water purifiers, soared by
the daily limit of 400 yen, or 21 percent, to 2,300 yen, the
most since its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in February
2003.  “There’s no doubt that demand for beverages will increase
for several months,” Toyota Asset Management’s Hamasaki said.
“People are buying stocks of companies whose revenue is
expected to increase.”  Inpex Corp.,  Japan ’s largest energy exploration company,
jumped 6 percent to 636,000 yen, and Japan Petroleum Exploration
Co., the second-biggest oil driller, climbed 1.8 percent to
4,035 yen.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 0.7 percent to $105.75 a
barrel in  New York  yesterday, the highest settlement since Sept.
26, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
