Charles Ble Goude, the leader of
 Ivory Coast ’s largest youth militia, called for a two-day rally
to show support for incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo ,
according to reports in local newspapers including le Nouveau
Courrier.  Ble Goude, who was appointed by Gbagbo as Youth Minister,
urged Ivorians to gather at the presidential palace in  Abidjan ,
the commercial capital, on March 26 and March 27, the newspaper
reported.  Nicknamed “the street general” for his ability to mobilize
unemployed youth, Ble Goude was placed on a United Nations
sanctions list in 2006 following a violent protest against the
peacekeeping mission in Ivory Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
