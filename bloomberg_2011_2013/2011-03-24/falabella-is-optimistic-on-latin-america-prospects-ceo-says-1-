SACI Falabella (FALAB) ,  Chile ’s largest
retailer by market value, is seeking growth opportunities in
Latin America where an economic recovery is boosting  consumer
confidence , Chief Executive Officer Juan Benavides said.  Falabella, which operates stores in Chile, Peru, Colombia
and Argentina, is considering entering a new market, Benavides
told reporters at a conference in Santiago.  “Our outlook is not just Chile, our outlook today is the
region,” he said at the conference. “We think there is a lot
of optimism in the region.”  Falabella shares have gained 9.1 percent in the 13 trading
days since reporting quarterly profit that exceeded analysts’
estimates. Chile’s Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said today
that he sees South America’s fifth-largest economy in a
“virtuous cycle of growth” as record job creation and growing
optimism drives spending and investment.  Chile and  Peru  will probably lead economic growth in the
region this year, Benavides said.  Falabella rose 0.2 percent to 4,800 pesos at 10:41 a.m. New
York time, after falling as much as 0.6 percent. Chile’s Ipsa
index climbed 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
