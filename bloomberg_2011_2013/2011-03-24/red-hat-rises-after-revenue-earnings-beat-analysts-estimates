Red Hat Inc. (RHT)  rose as much as 18
percent in New York trading, the biggest jump in almost two
years, after the largest seller of Linux software reported sales
and earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Revenue rose 25 percent to $244.8 million in the fiscal
fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 28, Red Hat said in a statement
yesterday. That compared with the $235.1 million average
projection of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Per-share
earnings, excluding certain items, were 26 cents, beating the
22-cent average estimate.  Customers are updating data centers to take advantage of
cloud computing, helping billings rise more than 30 percent.
That was the fastest rate in 12 quarters, Chief Financial
Officer Charlie Peters said in the statement. The company, based
in Raleigh,  North Carolina , may reach $1 billion in revenue for
the next fiscal year, the first open-source-focused company to
do so, Chief Executive Officer Jim Whitehurst said.  “People are renewing old infrastructure that they couldn’t
afford to replace before,” Whitehurst said yesterday in a
telephone interview. “You did have a bit of pent-up need.”  The company has done a better job selling more products to
existing customers and making inroads in industries that haven’t
been traditional strongholds for Linux, such as oil and gas and
retail, Whitehurst said. Red Hat also saw a big rebound in
demand, especially in  North America , as companies replaced aging
systems after several years of trying to make do.  Fiscal-Year Profit  Red Hat expects fiscal-year profit, excluding some costs,
of 94 cents to 96 cents, the company said. That compares with an
average analyst estimate of 93 cents. Sales will be $1.05
billion to $1.07 billion, and analysts had projected $1.03
billion.  For the fiscal first quarter, Red Hat expects profit of 21
cents to 22 cents on sales of $252 million to $255 million.  The stock rose $6.51 to $46.48 at 11:17 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier, the shares climbed as
high as $47.23. Red Hat had declined 12 percent this year before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
