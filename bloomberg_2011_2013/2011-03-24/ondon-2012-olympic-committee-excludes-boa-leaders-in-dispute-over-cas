The chairman and chief executive of
the British Olympic Association are to be excluded from board
meetings of the  London 2012 Olympics  organizing committee
because of a financial dispute between the bodies.  The committee, known as LOCOG, announced the action against
Lord Colin Moynihan and Andy Hunt in a statement. The BOA is
taking legal action against LOCOG in a wrangle over whether the
association’s share of profit from the Games should include the
cost of the Paralympics.  “Colin Moynihan and Andy Hunt remain directors of LOCOG,”
the organizers said. “The LOCOG board has decided to exclude
them from board meetings whilst they are individually and
actively involved in pursuing a dispute against LOCOG. Both have
been invited to send alternate representatives to board
meetings.”  The statement added that the BOA was “ably
represented” on the board by others including Princess Anne,
Craig Reedie, Philip Craven and Adam Pengilly, all of whom are
also on the BOA board.  The  International Olympic Committee  has ruled against the
BOA in the dispute, but the association has filed a case with
the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the top sports tribunal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
