Accenture Plc (ACN) , the world’s second-
largest technology-consulting company, rose the most in three
months in New York trading after its sales forecast for this
quarter exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Net revenue, or sales before reimbursements, will grow to a
range of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for the fiscal third
quarter ending in May, Dublin-based Accenture said yesterday.
Analysts predicted $6.08 billion, the average of 14 projections
compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue on that basis climbed 17 percent to $6.05 billion
last quarter, led by the consulting business. The division,
accounting for more than half of Accenture’s sales, is getting a
boost as businesses resume work on discretionary products and
information-technology expansion, said Joseph Vafi, an analyst
at Jefferies & Co. in  San Francisco .  “The numbers are pretty strong across the board,” said
Vafi, who rates the shares “buy” and doesn’t own them.
“Accenture’s so big, they’re really a macro-play on IT
demand.”  The company also increased forecasts for full-year net
revenue growth to a range of 11 percent to 14 percent, from 8
percent to 11 percent, and for earnings per share to $3.22 to
$3.30, from $3.08 to $3.16.  Fiscal second-quarter net income rose 26 percent to $503
million, or 75 cents a share, from $399.8 million, or 60 cents,
a year earlier. Analysts predicted 71 cents, the average of 15
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Consulting net revenue in the second quarter was $3.51
billion, an increase of 20 percent from a year earlier.  “We are gaining market share, which is extremely important
to us,” said Pierre Nanterme, Accenture’s chief executive
officer, in a conference call.  Accenture, which trails  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  in technology consulting, rose $2.33, or 4.5 percent, to
$54.29 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, the largest gain since Dec. 17. The shares have added
7.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
