Warren Buffett , chief executive
officer of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said European countries that
run budget deficits may cause a collapse in the area’s monetary
union, according to a CNBC interview.  “Enough of a strain could cause it to fall apart,”
Buffett said of the euro in a televised interview on the
business network. “They have to get their fiscal houses in
reasonable harmony.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
