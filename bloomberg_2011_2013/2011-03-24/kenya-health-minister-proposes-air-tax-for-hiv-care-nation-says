Kenya  Public Health Minister Beth
Mugo proposed a tax on air tickets to help the East African
nation acquire anti-retroviral drugs for as many as 700,000
HIV/AIDS patients, the  Daily Nation  said, citing Mugo.  Kenya failed to access money from The Global Fund to Fight
AIDS in its last two funding rounds and the country needs a
back-up plan in case foreign donors withdraw support for its
health programs, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
