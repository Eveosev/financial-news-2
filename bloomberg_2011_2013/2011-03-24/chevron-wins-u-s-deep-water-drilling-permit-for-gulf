Chevron Corp. (CVX)  won approval for the
first “completely new exploration” in the deep waters of the
Gulf of Mexico after  BP Plc (BP/) ’s oil spill last year, a regulator
said.  Chevron will drill in Keathley Canyon Block 736 in 6,750
feet (2,057 meters) of water, about 216 miles off the Louisiana
coast, the U.S.  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation
and Enforcement said today in a statement.  While Chevron is the fifth company permitted to resume work
in the area following the last year’s Deepwater Horizon rig
explosion, it’s the first to be allowed to tap a reservoir that
has never produced, according to the regulator.  Chevron rose 20 cents to $105.68 at 11:57 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 16 percent
this year before today.  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) ,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , ATP Oil & Gas Corp.
and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  have received U.S. permits to resume work
halted after BP’s April 20 spill.  Chevron, based in  San Ramon ,  California , will use equipment
from Marine Well Containment Co. in case of a well blowout, the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said.  Initial drilling on the well began a year ago, and was
suspended on June 9, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
