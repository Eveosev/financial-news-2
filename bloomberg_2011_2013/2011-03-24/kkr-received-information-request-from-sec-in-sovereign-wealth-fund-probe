KKR & Co., the private-equity firm
founded by Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, said it has
received a request from U.S. regulators for information about
the company’s dealings with sovereign wealth funds.  KKR received the Securities and Exchange Commission request
in January and is cooperating with the agency’s investigation,
the New York-based firm said in a March 7 regulatory filing. The
SEC sought information regarding “investors and clients that
are sovereign wealth funds and certain services provided by
KKR,” according to the filing.  The SEC launched a probe this year to determine whether
financial firms made improper payments to placement agents to
secure investments from sovereign wealth funds, investment pools
drawn from a country’s reserves, according to people with
knowledge of the probe. Companies including  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and
Citigroup have been contacted by regulators, said four people
who declined to be identified because the matter isn’t public.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s largest private-equity
firm, also received a request, another person said.  An agent working with a sovereign wealth fund may be
considered a government official, making interactions with that
person subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The
SEC is also looking into whether firms may have provided other
benefits, such as travel and entertainment, to government
officials to win or keep business, according to the people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
