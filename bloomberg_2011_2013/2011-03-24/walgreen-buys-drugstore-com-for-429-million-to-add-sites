Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore chain, agreed to buy  Drugstore.com Inc. (DSCM)  for about $429
million to add about 60,000 products available online.  Drugstore.com holders will receive $3.80 in cash for each
of their shares, in a transaction with an enterprise value of
$409 million, Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen said today in a
statement. That’s a 112 percent premium to Drugstore.com’s
closing share price of $1.79 yesterday.  Walgreen is making its largest acquisition in a year after
the April 2010 purchase of  Duane Reade  made it the biggest
drugstore chain in New York’s five boroughs. The Drugstore.com
deal will add websites including Beauty.com and SkinStore.com.  Walgreen fell 3 cents to $39.80 at 9:57 a.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading, giving it a market valuation
of about $36.7 billion. Drugstore.com, based in Bellevue,
 Washington , jumped to $3.79 in Nasdaq trading. The stock had
slumped 52 percent in the past year before today.  The buyers of 85 U.S. online retailers paid an average
premium of 21 percent over the past three years, compared with
the target’s average price of 20 trading days before the
announcement, according to Bloomberg data. On that basis,
Walgreen agreed to pay a premium of 103 percent.  Walgreen is offering about 0.90 times Drugstore.com’s
trailing annual revenue, according to Bloomberg data, similar to
the median of five comparable deals over the past three years.  The chain agreed this month to sell its pharmacy-benefit
management business for $525 million as it focuses on providing
health care related goods and services directly to customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
