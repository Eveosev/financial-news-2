The  International Monetary Fund  is
working on activating its  crisis lending pool , a move aimed at
showing it has enough liquidity to help bail out countries in
need and stabilize the global economy, two IMF officials said.  Countries that contribute to the pool, with new members
including China and  India , are seeking an agreement on how much
of the  credit line ’s $583 billion should be made available and
for how long, according to one official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity because the talks are not public.  The talks are taking place as  Europe ’s debt crisis deepens,
with the resignation of Portugal’s Prime Minister  Jose Socrates 
stoking concern the government is moving closer to seeking a
bailout. The activation of the so-called New Arrangement to
Borrow would leave the IMF, which has helped rescue countries
including Greece and Ukraine over the past two years, with ample
resources if more European countries need help.  IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn requested the
activation about two weeks ago, the officials said, when an
expansion of the pool was ratified, fulfilling an April 2009
pledge by Group of 20 countries to boost IMF resources.  The activation may take place as early as next week, one
official said. The aim is to have it running for the
institution’s spring meetings April 16-17, the other official
said.  IMF spokesman William Murray in an e-mail said the
activation “is just a natural consequence of ratification” of
the pool.  To contact the reporter on this story:
