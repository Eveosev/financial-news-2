U.S. nuclear-power output was
little changed as  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  boosted the FitzPatrick reactor
in New York and  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  slowed
Salem 2 in New Jersey, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased by 209 megawatts from
yesterday to 85,393 megawatts, or 84 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Seventeen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Entergy Corp. increased output its 852-megawatt FitzPatrick
reactor to full power from 55 percent of capacity yesterday. The
plant is located 6 miles (10 kilometers) northeast of Oswego.  Public Service reduced power from the 1,130-megawatt Salem
2 reactor to 75 percent of capacity from 90 percent yesterday.
The plant is about 18 miles south of Wilmington,  Delaware .  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
