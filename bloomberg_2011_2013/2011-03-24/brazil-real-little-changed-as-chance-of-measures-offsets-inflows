Brazil ’s real held near a two week
high on the strength of foreign currency inflows into Latin
America’s biggest economy.  The real rose 0.1 percent to 1.6594 per  U.S. dollar  at 5
p.m. New York time, from 1.6604 yesterday, and held near a level
reached on March 9.  Brazil received a net inflow of $11.7 billion from trade
and financial investments this month through March 18, compared
with $7.4 billion for all of February, according to the central
bank. Brazil is leaning toward raising taxes to reduce fixed-
income inflows and pressure on the currency to appreciate, a
government official briefed on the discussions, who asked not to
be identified because the talks aren’t public, said last week.  “The flows are still coming strong,” said  Pedro Tuesta , a
Washington-based economist at 4Cast Inc. Gains in the real are
being limited by expectations that officials will announce new
currency measures, he said.  The government tripled a tax on foreign investors’ fixed-
income purchases to 6 percent in October as part of the effort
to curb the currency’s advance.  “The government is monitoring the exchange market” and
“until this moment, there is no plan to announce measures,”
according to an e-mailed statement from the  Finance Ministry .  The central bank said it bought dollars in the  spot market 
today at 1.6580 reais each. Regular dollar purchases are part of
an effort by policy makers to stem gains in the currency, which
has strengthened 39 percent since the end of 2008, the most
among emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg over the
period.  The yield on the interest-rate futures contract due in
January fell 6 basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 12.21
percent. The yield on the contract due in January 2017 rose 9
basis points to 12.69 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
