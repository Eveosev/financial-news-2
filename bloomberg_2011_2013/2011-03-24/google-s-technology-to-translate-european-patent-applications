Google Inc. (GOOG)  translation software
will translate existing patents to and from Chinese and 31 other
languages, the company and the  European Patent Office  said.  Researchers will be able to check translations of millions
of patents granted in European countries,  China ,  Japan , Korea
and Russia “to demonstrate that their invention is new and has
not been already patented by somebody else,” Benoit Battistelli, the patent office’s president, told reporters.  Google will have access to existing translations held by
the European Patent Office, the company said in a statement, and
will provide its translation technology without charge on the
patent office’s website. Google’s program will translate patents
to and from Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Russian as well as the
28 languages recognized by the European Union, it said.  European companies can pay as much as 10,000 euros
($14,100) to translate a patent valid in only 13 European Union
countries, the European Commission has said. The EU, which lacks
a region-wide patent, moved closer to establishing a system
earlier this month.  Rainer Osterwalder, a spokesman for the patent office in
Munich, said the translation tool “does not replace a
translation where it is required by the law” and cannot be used
for applying for a European patent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
