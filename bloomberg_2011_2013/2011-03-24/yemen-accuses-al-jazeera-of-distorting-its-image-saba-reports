Yemen’s government condemned  Al
Jazeera  television for what it called an attempt to “mislead
the audience and deliberately distort Yemen’s image,” state-run
Saba news agency  reported today , citing a government official it
didn’t name.  The official said Yemen has the right to prosecute Al
Jazeera over “its hostile activities against Yemen and its
unity, security and stability,” according to the report.  Doha-based Al Jazeera said yesterday that Yemen’s
government had closed its office in the country amid protests by
people seeking the ouster of President Al Abdullah Saleh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
