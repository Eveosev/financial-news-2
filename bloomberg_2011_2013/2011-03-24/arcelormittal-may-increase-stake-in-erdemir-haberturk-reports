ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest
steelmaker, said it hasn’t announced any plan to increase its 25
percent holding in Eregli Demir & Celik Fabrikalari, or Erdemir,
after  Haberturk  newspaper said the company may raise its stake.  “We haven’t said we will increase our stake in Erdemir and
we do not comment on speculation,” Arne Langner, a spokesman
for ArcelorMittal, said today by telephone.  Haberturk later removed its article from its website.
Anatolian news agency earlier corrected its report that
ArcelorMittal may boost its stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
