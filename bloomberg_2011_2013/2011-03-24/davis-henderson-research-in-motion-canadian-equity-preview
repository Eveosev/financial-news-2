Canadian stocks rose, extending a
weekly gain, as fertilizer producers advanced and energy
companies rallied along with natural  gas prices .  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, increased 3.4 percent after
the U.S. Agriculture Department said exporters sold 1.25 million
metric tons of corn to unknown buyers. BlackBerry maker  Research
In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plunged 10 percent after forecasting a smaller
profit than most analysts had estimated.  Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s
largest natural gas producer, climbed 2.4 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 56.4 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 14,085.77 at 1:32 p.m. in Toronto. The index
has gained 2.1 percent this week.  “People are comfortable taking long positions again,”
said Stephen Gauthier, who helps oversee C$600 million ($611
million) as a money manager at Fin-XO Securities in  Montreal .
“Ten days ago, the situation in  Libya  seemed out of control and
the situation in  Japan  seemed out of control.”  The S&P/TSX had slipped 0.8 percent this month through
yesterday, reflecting the impact of the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami in Japan and the escalation of the Libyan civil war. The
equity benchmark hasn’t had a monthly decline since June.  Fertilizer producers rallied. Wheat may rise as dry weather
in the U.S. threatens crops, said  Mark Schultz , chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis .  Potash, Agrium  Potash Corp. increased 3.4 percent to C$56.36.  Agrium Inc. (AGU) ,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, gained 2.3 percent
to C$89.04.  S&P/TSX energy companies advanced for the first time in
four days as natural gas climbed on forecasts for unseasonably
cold weather in the eastern U.S.  Encana increased 2.4 percent to an eight-month intraday
high of C$34.23.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) , an oil and gas producer
with operations in  North America , the North Sea and  Indonesia ,
rose 2.8 percent to C$23.83.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , the country’s
largest pipeline company, climbed 1.9 percent to C$59.96.  RIM sank 10 percent in Toronto Stock Exchange trading to
C$56.19 after earlier today tumbling as much as 11 percent, the
most in nine months. The company forecast first-quarter earnings
of $1.47 a share to $1.55 a share, excluding certain items.
Analysts had estimated the company would earn $1.66 a share.  ‘Just a Taste’  “Time is not on RIM’s side,” Brian Modoff, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients. “We think this
quarter was just a taste of what lies in store for the
company.”  Precious-metals producers gained after European leaders cut
the startup capital for its emergency-aid fund, heightening
concerns about the continent’s ability to quell its debt crisis.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest gold producer,
advanced 1.1 percent to C$48.19.  OceanaGold Corp. (OGC) , which mines
in  New Zealand , surged 6.6 percent to C$2.75. Silver reseller
 Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  rose 0.9 percent to C$42.81.  Directory publisher  Yellow Media Inc. (YLO)  increased 4.7 percent
to C$5.54 after agreeing to sell a unit to Apax Partners for
C$745 million. The shares soared as much as 6.8 percent, the
most intraday in 13 months, earlier today.  Imax Corp. (IMAX) , the maker of giant-screen movie-projection
systems, climbed 6.4 percent to C$31.09 after Aravinda Galappatthige, an analyst at Canaccord Financial Inc., raised
his rating on the shares to “buy” from “hold.” Imax soared
12 percent to a 10-year high yesterday after announcing plans to
open 75 new theaters in  China .  To contact the reporter on this story;
