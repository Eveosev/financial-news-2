Viacom Inc. (VIA) , owner of  MTV Networks 
and  Paramount Pictures , sold $500 million of six-year senior
notes as relative yields on investment-grade bonds decline.  The 3.5 percent securities due in April 2017 yield 155
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds may be used for general
corporate purposes, including repaying debt, acquisitions and
share repurchases, the New York-based company said in a
regulatory filing today.  Viacom last month reported a decline in first-quarter
profit after a drop in home-entertainment sales lowered earnings
at its Paramount Pictures film unit. The media company last sold
debt in February, issuing $500 million of 4.5 percent 10-year
notes in conjunction with a tender offer for its outstanding
6.25 percent notes due in 2016.  “There’s a lot of debt at this company that was issued in
earlier years with higher coupons,” said Jake Newman, an
analyst at debt-research firm CreditSights Inc. in  New York .
“They may want to tender for more bonds.”  Viacom has $5.51 billion of bonds outstanding, with $193
million maturing this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to buy investment-grade
debt has declined 13 basis points to 153 basis points, or 1.53
percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries this
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The
measure tumbled to 148 basis points on Feb. 17, the lowest since
October 2007.  Today’s notes are rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
Bloomberg data show.  Standard & Poor’s  grades the company BBB+.
Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BNP Paribas managed
the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
