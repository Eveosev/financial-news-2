Japan ’s ethylene producers still
have 23 percent of their capacity shut following the country’s
March 11 earthquake and tsunami, Chemical Market Associates Inc.
said in a report today.  No ethylene capacity has been restarted since CMAI’s last
report on March 18, according to the Houston-based industry
consultant.  Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp. (4188) , Japan’s biggest
ethylene maker, will take at least two months to resume
operations at its Kashima plant because of damage to berths,
utility infrastructure and roads, the Tokyo-based company said
yesterday.  Ethylene, the most widely used petrochemical, is an
ingredient in plastics, detergents and de-icers. The two naphtha
crackers at the Kashima facility are responsible for almost 11
percent of Japan’s ethylene capacity and 2.4 percent of capacity
in northeast  Asia , CMAI said.  Other curtailments include 37 percent of Japan’s
polyethylene plastic capacity and 46 percent of its PVC plastic
capacity, CMAI said in today’s report, which was issued at its
conference in Houston. About 27 percent of propylene capacity
and 35 percent of polypropylene capacity remain shut, CMAI said.  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp., the refining unit of  JX
Holdings Inc. (5020) , started its Negishi refinery March 21. That
reduced the amount of shut benzene production capacity in Japan
to 25 percent and the amount of shut xylenes capacity to 22
percent, CMAI said.  About 19 percent of Japan’s chlorine capacity remains
closed, the consultant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
