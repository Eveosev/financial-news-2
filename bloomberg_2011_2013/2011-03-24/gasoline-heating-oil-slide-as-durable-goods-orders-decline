Gasoline rallied a fourth
consecutive day on speculation that planned and emergency
repairs at U.S. refineries will reduce inventories that are
already at an 11-week low.  Futures reversed an earlier loss as gasoline for prompt
delivery on the  Gulf Coast  traded at the smallest discount to
futures in a month amid rumors of a refinery outage, indicating
supplies may tighten. The Energy Department reported yesterday
that gasoline stockpiles fell 5.32 million barrels to 219.7
million last week, the fifth straight drop.  “There’s a cumulative inventory drawdown, a firming on the
Gulf Coast and rumors of Gulf Coast refinery problems,” said
 Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply at Truman
Arnold Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas .  Gasoline for April delivery rose 2.35 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $3.0448 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest level since March 4.  BP Plc is preparing to shut units at its 420,000-barrel-a-
day Whiting refinery in  Indiana  early in April for 60 days of
repairs, two people with knowledge of the plans said today.  The discount to futures for prompt delivery conventional
gasoline on the Gulf Coast narrowed 1.25 cents to 12.5 cents as
of 2:05 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the
narrowest gap since Feb. 22. Gulf Coast inventories were down a
sixth straight week to the lowest level since November 2009,
according to department data.  Prices earlier fluctuated, falling as low as $2.9909 as
orders for durable goods unexpectedly shrank in February.
Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years dropped
0.9 percent after a 3.6 percent gain the prior month, the
Commerce Department said today.  “The market, without signs the  U.S. economy  is still
improving, will meet greater resistance as it attempts to
rally,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Heating oil for April delivery added 0.7 cent to settle at
$3.062 a gallon.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.3
cent to $3.551 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
