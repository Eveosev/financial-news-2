M&C Saatchi Plc (SAA) , the U.K.
advertising agency formed by brothers Maurice and Charles
Saatchi in 1995, said full-year profit rose 25 percent on
increased sales.  Net income climbed to 7.76 million pounds ($12.6 million)
from 6.22 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based
company said today in a statement distributed by the Regulatory
News Service. Revenue rose 21.3 percent to 125.1 million pounds.  “M&C Saatchi made excellent progress in 2010, delivering
strong growth in revenues and profitability,” Chief Executive
Officer David Kershaw said in the statement. “That success
leaves us well placed to make further progress. While we remain
cautious about the macro environment, the board is confident
that we will continue to make progress in 2011.”  M&C Saatchi profits have been boosted as the U.K., its main
market, emerges from its worst recession since World War II. The
company’s revenue has grown in  Asia  and Australia and in January
it said it will promote Britain’s 2012 Olympic Games and the
U.K. royal wedding in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
