rose 13 kurus, or 4 percent, to 3.37 liras, the biggest gain in
two weeks. Austria’s Verbund AG will bid for some of the
company’s assets via its joint venture Enerjisa, Verbund Chief
Executive Wolfgang Anzengruber told journalists in Vienna today.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL TI), Turkey’s
biggest mobile phone company, advanced 20 kurus, or 2.1 percent,

company said in a filing with the exchange late yesterday. The
payout was more than expected, brokers including Oyak Securities
and HSBC Yatirim told investors in e-mailed reports today.  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, the carrier known as
Turkish Airlines, dropped 16 kurus, or 3.6 percent, to 4.35
liras, the biggest loss since March 1. Net income last year
almost halved to 286.4 million liras ($184 million), missing the
average estimate of 553.6 million liras in a Bloomberg survey of
24 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
