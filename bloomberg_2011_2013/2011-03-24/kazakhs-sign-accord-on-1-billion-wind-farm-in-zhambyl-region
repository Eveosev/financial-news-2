Central Asia Green Power may invest
about $1 billion to build two wind power plants in  Kazakhstan ’s
Zhambyl region, the local government said.  The company, which is owned by Relight and Kazakhstan’s
Visor Group, will build the plants with a combined capacity of
600 megawatts in two years, the northern Kazakh region’s
administration said on its  website , without giving a start date
for construction. Central Asia Green Power will invest borrowed
funds and its own money, it said.  The administration signed a deal today with the company and
state-owned grid operators Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating
Co. and TOO JES, according to the statement.  -- Editors: Torrey Clark, Rob Verdonck  To contact the reporter on this story:
