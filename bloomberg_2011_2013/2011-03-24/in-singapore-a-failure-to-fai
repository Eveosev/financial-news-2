Singapore, although far from Silicon Valley, has a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem, and I've been impressed by passion and talent of its entrepreneurs since my wife and I moved here a year ago. The government plays a big role in the city's ecosystem — administering grants and programs that provide financial support for startup companies. Innosight benefits directly from one of these programs. Our IDEAS Ventures fund is a joint arrangement with the National Research Foundation as part of the National Framework for Innovation and Enterprise.  Government support is beneficial, but venture capitalist investor  Mike Maples  recently made a point in  a conversation with TechCrunch  that crystallized a nagging concern that I've had about Singapore: it's too hard for companies to fail. One topic of Maple's discussion was whether it is too easy to start a company (a point  I riffed on  back in August). Maples' research shows that the number of breakthrough companies launched at any given time is relatively fixed. More people starting companies therefore could mean that great talent is locked up in flawed companies. I've certainly seen this play out in Singapore. Last summer, my colleague  Pete Bonee  and I met with a young Singaporean entrepreneur. Let's call him George. George was impressive — whip smart, good entrepreneurial instincts, and a presence beyond his years. He needed a few hundred thousand dollars to keep his business going. But it was pretty clear to us that his idea was in the wrong industry space. It is always possible that the iterations that characterize early-stage startups would have eventually led him to success, but we decided not to invest in his company. The rest of the local VC community had the same reaction. Recently, however, I learned that he scored a grant from the government to keep the business going for another 18 months.  While I'm happy that George can keep pursuing his dream, the amount of money he received isn't enough to lead the business to any kind of breakthrough. And think of the opportunity costs — emerging companies desperate for talent or ideas in the ether just waiting for George, or someone like him.  That led me to think of the parallels inside some of my corporate clients. Most corporate cultures fear failure so viscerally that they will lock up great talent in a fatally flawed project, investing resources well past the point where everyone can see that the plug should have been pulled. That (historically at least) would never happen in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, most entrepreneurs consider having worked at a failed company to be a badge of honor. My colleague  Richard Foster  is working on (among other things) a "handbook for creative destruction." Foster often reminds us that one key teaching of Austrian economist  Joseph Schumpeter  (who is credited with coining the term creative destruction) is that creation can require destruction. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture sometimes allows lightning fires to continue to burn in controlled areas. The destruction creates room for the next wave of forest growth. Failure is a necessary part of a flourishing innovative ecosystem. Not every idea is destined for greatness. A talented individual working on an idea with fatal flaws by definition isn't working on an idea with transformational potential. When great talent is stuck working on the wrong things, the ecosystem as a whole suffers. The failure of failure leads to stagnation.
