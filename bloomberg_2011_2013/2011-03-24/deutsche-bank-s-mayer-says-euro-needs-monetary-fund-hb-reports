Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Economist
 Thomas Mayer  said the euro area needs its own monetary fund to
provide a permanent basis for the currency union,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing an interview.  Mayer said the 17-member euro area had had only temporary
solutions to its problems so far and that an independent
institution was needed to oversee political decisions, send
warning signals, provide financial aid, and design adjustment
programs when needed, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
