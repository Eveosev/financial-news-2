Sugar output in Swaziland,  Africa ’s
third-biggest producer of the sweetener, may increase 12 percent
this year as more land is put under cultivation by small-scale
farmers, the country’s industry board said.  Output may climb to 651,000 metric tons from 582,000 tons
last year, and exceed the 605,000 tons produced in 2009,
Swaziland Sugar Association Chief Executive Officer Mike
Matsebula said in an interview today in Nairobi,  Kenya ’s
capital.  “It’s mainly because we produced less than projected last
year, so we’re starting from a lower base,” he said.
“Additionally, land is being brought under cultivation.”  The kingdom of  1.2 million  people, bordering South Africa,
consumes about 10 percent of the sugar it produces, and exports
about half of the rest to fellow  Southern Africa Customs Union 
members  South Africa , Botswana,  Lesotho , and Namibia. The
European Union, the U.S., and East Africa buy the balance.  About 11 percent of Swaziland’s foreign exchange earnings
are derived from its sugar industry, which employs as much as 18
percent of the country’s workforce, Matsebula said.  Swaziland’s 2010 sugar sales rose to 2.46 billion
emalangeni ($355.1 million), from 2.44 billion a year earlier,
the Swaziland Sugar Association said in an annual report on Jan.
4.  Swaziland is Africa’s biggest producer of the sweetener
after South Africa and Sudan, on a continent that supplies about
7 percent of world output,  Peter Baron , executive director of
the  International Sugar Organization , said in an interview in
Nairobi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
