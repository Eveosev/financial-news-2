Taiwan’s  Financial Supervisory
Commission  asked Ruen Chen Investment Holding Co. to provide
more documents for the second time in its application to buy
 American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s local life unit.  Ruen Chen has to submit proof of NT$30 billion ($1 billion)
cash or equivalent to show it has the financial means to run the
business for the next decade, the regulator said in a  statement 
on its website today. The Taiwanese company said it plans to
raise NT$10 billion this year, according to the statement.  AIG in January agreed to sell a 97.57 percent stake in Nan
Shan Life Insurance Co. to Ruen Chen for $2.16 billion. The deal
ends the search for a buyer that stalled when Taiwan’s Financial
Supervisory Commission on Aug. 31 rejected a $2.15 billion bid
by a group led by Primus Financial Holdings Ltd. and  China
Strategic Holdings Ltd. (235) , citing concerns over their financial
capability and long-term commitment.  The financial regulator said Ruen Chen’s debt-to-equity
ratio can’t exceed 48 percent once the deal is approved,
according to the statement.  Ruen Chen must also nominate a chairman candidate who has
professional knowledge of the insurance business, and put its
entire Nan Shan stake into a trust to ensure it is committed to
operating the insurer, the statement said. The buyer must
provide these information within a month to the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
