U.S. households across all income
levels suffered declines in wealth during the worst recession in
seven decades, and many families’ desire for a bigger buffer in
savings may slow the recovery, a Federal Reserve survey found.  Median wealth fell to $96,000 in 2009 from $125,000 in
2007, and 63 percent of families had a decline, the central bank
said today in its first report on a 2009 survey of 3,862
households that also participated in a similar 2007 survey. Most
families sought “greater desired precautionary savings” in
2009 than they had in 2007, the Fed said.  The report may help policy makers and the public better
understand how the downturn, which lasted from December 2007 to
June 2009, set back U.S. families’ finances and contribute to
research in years to come. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is
counting on higher asset prices to boost the economy as a result
of the central bank’s record monetary stimulus.  “The data show signs that families’ behavior may act in
some ways as a brake on reviving the economy in the short run,”
the Fed said in the report, written by five staff researchers.
In addition, “it appears that families may be relatively
reluctant to spend more when asset prices rise and may more
readily reduce spending when asset prices fall,” the paper
said.  The world’s largest economy shrank 4.1 percent from the
fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, the most
during any recession since the 1930s, according to the U.S.
Commerce Department.  ‘Nascent Recovery’  “Despite the signs of the nascent recovery, the economic
downturn was likely still very present for many families,” the
report said. The national  unemployment rate  averaged 9.6 percent
in 2010, and consumer borrowing didn’t start rising until
October 2010, according to Fed data.  The drop in wealth wasn’t uniform, as “many families saw
only small changes and a non-negligible group of families saw
substantial increases in their wealth,” the Fed said. The
median total debt of households increased to $75,600 in 2009
from $70,300 in 2007, while real median  household income  fell to
$49,800 from $50,100, the report said.  More wealthier Americans saw a decline in their net worth
than did people with less money. Of households above the 90th
percentile in wealth, 77 percent had a drop, compared with 49
percent of households below the 25th percentile, according to
the report.  Families seemed to be more cautious in 2009, with most
respondents saying they wanted to increase emergency savings,
according to the survey. In most cases, heads of households with
full-time jobs said they planned on working longer. At least 25
percent said they were postponing retirement by two years.  Separate Report  A separate report this month from the Employee Benefit
Research Institute said more than a quarter of U.S. workers said
they’re “not at all confident” about their ability to afford a
comfortable retirement, the highest percentage in two decades.  Even families seeing net-worth increases were still
“cautious,” the Fed said. “Compared with families with
relative losses, the families with relative gains appeared more
pessimistic and cautious before the crisis, and in the 2009
survey they remained cautious even though their wealth had
increased,” the paper said.  The central bank has conducted the survey every three years
in 1983. The Fed shortened the period to two years for the 2009
survey to determine how individual and family finances have
weathered the downturn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
