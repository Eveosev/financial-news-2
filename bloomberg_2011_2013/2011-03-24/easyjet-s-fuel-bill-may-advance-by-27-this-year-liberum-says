EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ’s fuel bill may
increase by 27 percent this year, with the Middle East crisis
likely to support prices at a 30-month high in the coming
months, according to Liberum Capital Ltd.  Fuel could cost  Europe ’s second-biggest low-cost carrier as
much as 934 million pounds ($1.51 billion) in the year to Sept.
30, said Peter Hyde, head of research at the London-based
investment bank. That’s up from 733 million pounds  last year .  Jet fuel in northwest Europe traded at $1,074 a metric ton
yesterday, 54 percent higher for the year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest since Sept. 25, 2008.  “In the short-term, a solution to the Middle East crisis
is looking increasingly unlikely,” Hyde said today in a
research report. Prices may remain at current levels “for at
least a few months.”  Luton, England-based EasyJet said in January it hedged 70
percent of its fuel needs for this year at $734 a ton. Hedging
allows airlines to agree on prices for future fuel needs and is
intended to help guard against cost fluctuations.  The company hedged 26 percent of its fuel for fiscal 2012,
it said in January. Its fuel bill could rise next year to 1.25
billion pounds, according to Liberum estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
