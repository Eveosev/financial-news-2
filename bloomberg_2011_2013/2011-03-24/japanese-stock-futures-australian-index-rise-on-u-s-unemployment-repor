Japanese stock futures and
Australian shares rose after a U.S. government report showed a
decline in unemployment claims, adding to evidence the labor
market in the world’s largest economy is recovering.  American depositary receipts of Sony Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest
exporter of consumer electronics, jumped 2.9 percent from the
closing share price in  Tokyo . Those of Advantest Corp., the
world’s largest maker of machines used to test memory chips,

gold producer, gained 1.8 percent today in Sydney after gold

percent in Wellington.  “The  U.S. economy  is steadily recovering,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, a market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.3
percent today. The index advanced 0.9 percent yesterday in  New
York  after corporate profits topped analysts’ estimates and
figures from the Labor Department showed jobless claims declined
by 5,000 to 382,000 in the week ended March 19, in line with the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Valuations, Earthquake  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 3.2 percent this year
through yesterday, while the  S&P 500  increased 4.1 percent and
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index was almost unchanged. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.4 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is
scheduled to announce the consumer-price index for February at
8:30 a.m. local time in Tokyo.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  has fallen 8 percent since March 11, the
biggest decline among indexes for the world’s largest equity
markets, after an earthquake and tsunami killed thousands of
people, razed homes and factories and crippled the Fukushima
nuclear-power station northeast of Tokyo.  “Unless there’s bad news related to nuclear issues, we can
expect stocks will be bought back,” Monex’s Kanayama said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
