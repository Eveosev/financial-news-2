U.K. stocks climbed for the sixth
time in seven days, with the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  posting
its biggest weekly gain since November, as consumer shares
rallied amid optimism the economic recovery is strengthening.  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) , the maker of Nurofen
painkillers, rose after BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
advised buying the shares. Reckitt, together with  SABMiller Plc (SAB) 
and Unilever Plc, led personal-goods companies higher.  African
Barrick Gold Ltd. (ABG) , the biggest London-listed producer of the
precious metal, rose 1.9 percent after saying drill results may
add “considerable value” to one of its projects.  The FTSE 100 advanced 19.89, or 0.3 percent, to 5,900.76 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, bringing this week’s increase to
3.2 percent, the largest weekly rally in more than four months.
The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  added 0.5 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 0.8 percent.  “The outlook for the U.K. consumer appears to be
improving,” said Gerard Lane, an equity strategist at Shore
Capital Stockbrokers Ltd. in Liverpool,  England . “We expect an
improvement in the level of employment, and wage growth to
contribute to strong growth in earnings.”  The FTSE 100 has clawed back 5.4 percent since this year’s
low on March 16. Concern that Arab revolts in the Middle East
and North Africa will disrupt oil supplies and the strongest
earthquake on record in  Japan  dragged stocks down 8.1 percent
from Feb. 8 through March 16. Still, the gauge has soared 68
percent, or 83 percent including reinvested dividends, since its
March 2009 low as the global economy recovered from recession
and corporate profits beat estimates.  Reckitt Benckiser Climbs  Reckitt Benckiser jumped 3.1 percent to 3,160 pence. BofA
Merrill Lynch raised its recommendation on the shares to “buy”
from “neutral.”  SABMiller rose 1.4 percent to 2,145.5 pence and Unilever
climbed 0.9 percent to 1,886 pence.  African Barrick Gold soared 1.9 percent to 539 pence as the
company said it has found further gold deposits at its Nyanzaga
project.  Separately, Citigroup Inc. upgraded the shares to “buy”
from “hold.”  Resolution Ltd. (RSL)  declined 2.6 percent to 281.8 pence, among
the worst performers on the FTSE 100. The stock had risen for
the previous four days.  Songbird Estates Plc (SBD)  climbed 2.1 percent to 144 pence as
the property company that controls the Canary Wharf estate in
east London said net income more than doubled to 277.8 million
pounds ($445.3 million) in 2010 from 131 million pounds in 2009
after selling a building to JPMorgan Chase & Co. previously
occupied by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Drax Group Plc (DRX) , owner of the U.K.’s largest power station,
climbed 4.2 percent to 387.4 pence, rebounding from four days of
losses. Britain’s new tax on carbon-dioxide may fail to reduce
power generation from coal, according to Evolution Securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
