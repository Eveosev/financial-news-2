South Korea , which is 99 percent
self-sufficient in rice, said it plans to release 150,000 metric
tons of the staple from state reserves to help ease a sharp gain
in local prices.  The government will initially sell 50,000 tons to the
domestic market on March 31 and the rest of the amount later,
depending on price trends, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
