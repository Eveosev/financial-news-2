Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  call volume
rose to its highest level since Nov. 30 before earnings today
after the close, with most of the trading concentrated in
contracts with a strike price 9.2 percent above today’s close.  Almost 130,000 calls to buy the BlackBerry maker changed
hands today, 3.3 times the four-week average and 1.3 times the
number of puts to sell. The most-active contracts were March $70
calls that expire tomorrow and accounted for one-tenth of all
call trades. RIM rose 3.2 percent to $64.09 and hasn’t closed
above $70 since May.  The Waterloo, Ontario-based company forecast first-quarter
revenue and profit that missed analysts’ estimates, as new
models like the Torch fail to stop a slide in market share. The
stock fell 10 percent to $57.44 in after-hours trading as of 5
p.m., after the earnings release. It has tumbled 14 percent in
the past year, compared with an 11 percent rise for information
technology companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
