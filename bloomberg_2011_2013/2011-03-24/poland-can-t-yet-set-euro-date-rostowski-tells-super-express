It’s “decidedly too early” for
Poland to set a specific date for adopting the euro, Finance
Minister Jacek Rostowski was quoted today as saying in an
interview in the tabloid newspaper Super Express.  Rostowski said he didn’t fear that proposed changes in the
euro area would create a “two-speed  Europe ” that would leave
countries outside the currency bloc behind, according to the
newspaper. “Over the last three years we’ve converged faster
with the European Union average than over the previous six,”
Super Express quoted Rostowski as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
