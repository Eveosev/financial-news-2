Nigeria awarded a $2 billion
contract to  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s Agip and  Oando Plc (OANDO)  to build a natural gas
processing facility at Obiafu in the southern Rivers state.  The plant will process wet gas from fields operated by
Chevron Corp. and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to supply petrochemical
and fertilizer plants to be built in the Delta and Lagos states,
Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said today in Abuja.  Africa’s most populous nation and top oil producer is “re-
positioning to be the regional hub for gas-based industries,”
Alison-Madueke said.  Nigeria plans to develop its gas reserves and build
pipelines to supply power plants and export. The West African
country selected 15 companies including Shell, Chevron and Oando
in 2009 to participate in its development plan. It is yet to
announce the final outcome.  The country plans to spend $30 billion building domestic
processing and transmission plants to send gas across the  Sahara
Desert  by pipeline to Europe, according to the state-owned oil
company. Nigeria’s gas reserves are estimated at 187 trillion
cubic feet, the world’s seventh largest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
