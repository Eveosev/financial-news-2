Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
may end the country’s emergency law, Bouthaina Shaaban, one of
his political advisers, said on state television today.  The country will prepare new laws for the media and
political parties, and seek to spur job growth, Shaaban said.
Reports of political protests have been exaggerated by some
media organizations and there are signs that they have been
funded by foreigners, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
