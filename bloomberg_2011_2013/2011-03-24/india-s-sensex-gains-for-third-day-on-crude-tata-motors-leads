Indian stocks climbed for a third
day as a decline in  oil prices  eased concerns of inflationary
pressures.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the nation’s biggest truckmaker and the
owner of Jaguar Land Rover, advanced for the fourth day, rising
1.5 percent. Oil dropped from the highest in more than two years
to $105.5 a barrel as a larger increase in U.S. crude
inventories than analysts predicted overshadowed threats to
supplies from the conflict in  Libya  and the Middle East.  Bharat
Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the top power-equipment maker, reached a
two-week high.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 146.45, or 0.8 percent, to 18,352.61, according to
preliminary closing prices as of 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The S&P
CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange rose 0.8 percent
to 5,524.35, while its March futures traded at 5,550.70. The BSE
200 Index rallied 1.9 percent to 2,265.49.  The Sensex has tumbled 11 percent this year, the world’s
worst-performance apart from Egypt and Tunisia, because of
concern rising  interest rates  will crimp economic growth. The
 Reserve Bank  of  India  raised borrowing costs for the eighth time
on March 17 and increased its end-March inflation forecast for a
second time in three months.  Overseas investors bought a net 3.13 billion rupees ($69.7
million) of Indian equities on March 22, paring their outflow
from stocks this year to 77.8 billion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
