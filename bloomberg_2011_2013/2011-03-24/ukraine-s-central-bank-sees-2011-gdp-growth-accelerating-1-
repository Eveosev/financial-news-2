Ukraine’s economic growth may
accelerate this year on higher exports as external conditions
improve, the central bank said.  Ukraine’s gross domestic product may rise as much as 5
percent in 2011, compared with 4.2 percent in 2010, the Kiev-
based  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  said today in a statement on its
website. The economy may grow between 4 percent and 5 percent in
2012, according to the statement.  The east European nation returned to growth last year after
contracting 14.8 percent in 2009 as the global financial crisis
eroded demand for Ukraine’s commodity exports and its currency
slumped. GDP grew 6.5 percent in the first two months of this
year, the central bank said yesterday.  Inflation this year should be in a range of 9 percent to 11
percent before slowing to 6 percent to 8 percent in 2012, the
bank said.  Ukraine’s current-account gap will probably widen to 3.6
percent of GDP this year, compared with 2.1 percent in 2010 and
2.5 percent estimated by the central bank for this year in
January. The shortfall will be boosted by increased imports of
Russian natural gas, domestic demand and equipment needed to
prepare for hosting the Euro 2012 soccer championship, according
to the statement.  The central bank sees Ukraine’s foreign direct investments
at $6.5 billion this year and $7.5 billion next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
