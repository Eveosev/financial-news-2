The euro advanced against the
dollar for the first time in three days as European Union
leaders began a two-day meeting on measures to contain the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The 17-nation currency gained against the yen as
speculation the  European Central Bank  is poised to raise
borrowing costs outweighed fiscal turmoil. The euro rose even as
Fitch Ratings cut  Portugal ’s credit rating after the nation’s
Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  resigned yesterday. Currencies with
above-average economic growth, such as New Zealand and  Canada ,
advanced as raw material prices and equities rallied.  “What we’re doing now is buying the rumor on an ECB rate
hike and then we’ll sell the fact when it materializes,” said
 Marc Chandler , global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. “The euro is still going
to make new highs.”  Chandler said the shared currency may reach $1.45 to $1.47
in a Bloomberg Television interview on “Surveillance Midday”
with  Tom Keene .  The euro appreciated 0.6 percent at $1.4177 at 5:09 p.m. in
New York, from $1.4088 yesterday. The euro touched $1.4249 on
March 22, matching the level on Nov. 5. The currency appreciated
0.7 percent to 114.79 yen, from 114 yen. The dollar was at 80.97
yen, compared with 80.92.  Futures Bets  Futures show traders added to bets on higher borrowing
costs in the region, with the implied yield on the three-month
Euribor contract expiring in September rising 0.1 percentage
point to 1.8 percent. That compares with a 17 percent chance the
 Federal Reserve  will raise U.S. interest rates from near zero in
September, according to CME Group Inc. exchange futures.  The euro extended its gains after breaking through the
technical level of $1.4150.  “There were stops at $1.4150 and $1.4170 that may have
pushed the euro higher,” said  John McCarthy , director of
 currency trading  at ING Groep NV in New York. “I’m always
surprised risk is as buoyant as it is and there is interest to
sell dollars today against everything but the yen.”  U.S. Treasuries  dropped pushing the yield on the 10-year
note to the highest in a week as investors sold the dollar to
seek higher yielding assets. The benchmark 10-year yield
increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point to 3.39
percent. The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Equity Index traded 0.9 percent higher,
its biggest gain in three days.  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against six
major trading partners, fell 0.2 percent to 75.671 as two
European officials said a bailout for Portugal may total as much
as 70 billion euros ($99 billion). The gauge is weighted 57.6
percent to movements in the euro.  Portugal hasn’t asked for a bailout and the figures are
preliminary, the officials said. The action would follow  Greece 
and Ireland’s request of aid from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund .  Greece accepted a $110 billion-euro aid package from the EU
and IMF in May 2010 and Ireland accepted an 85 billion-euro
bailout fund in November.  Portugal had its long-term foreign and local currency
issuer default ratings cut to ‘A-’ from ‘A+’ by  Fitch Ratings .
The ratings were placed on rating watch negative, citing
“increased risks to policy implementation and fiscal financing
in light of the Portuguese parliament’s failure to pass fiscal
consolidation measures and the resignation of the Prime Minister
on 23 March.”  Euro Shares  Portugal made up about 1.8 percent of the total 17-nation
euro-zone gross domestic product in the fourth quarter last
year, according to Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics
office, and Bloomberg data, while Ireland accounts for 1.8
percent and Greece makes up 2.3 percent.  “The euro is in a tug-of-war between relatively strong
economic data and the pretty strong belief that the ECB will
raise rates soon against the lingering unresolved sovereign debt
crisis,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at online
currency trader GFT Forex in  New York .  The Swiss franc weakened 0.1 percent to 90.90 centimes per
dollar, from 90.84 yesterday. The currency earlier gained as
much as 0.4 percent against the greenback amid speculation a
takeover of Alcon Inc. by Novartis AG may prompt sales of the
currency.  Pound Falls  The pound weakened 0.8 percent to $1.6102 after a report
showed U.K. retail sales dropped in February more than
economists forecast after a surge in the previous month, when
shoppers boosted spending to beat a tax increase.  Sales fell 0.8 percent last month after an increase of 1.5
percent in January, the  Office for National Statistics  said. The
median forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 0.6 percent drop.  New Zealand ’s dollar advanced against all of its major
counterparts after the government said the economy grew in the
fourth quarter, avoiding a recession. New Zealand’s currency
jumped 1.2 percent to 74.91 U.S. cents and rallied 1.3 percent
to 60.68 yen.  Canada’s dollar strengthened for the first day in three
days against the greenback as crude oil, the nation’s biggest
export, traded at almost the highest level in 29 months. The
currency gained 0.7 percent to 97.52 cents per  U.S. dollar .
Crude oil for May delivery advanced as much as 0.9 percent to
$106.69 per barrel in New York before trading at $105.  To contact the reporter on this story:
