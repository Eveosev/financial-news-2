Grain loaded for export from the
French port of Rouen dropped 4.5 percent in the week through
yesterday as shipments to North Africa slid on a decline in
cargoes for  Algeria , the largest buyer of French wheat.  Outgoing grain shipments were 214,351 metric tons between
March 10 and March 16, the Seine River port,  Europe ’s biggest
cereal-shipping hub, said in an e-mailed statement today.
Loadings fell from 224,442 tons a week earlier.  Shipments included 188,916 tons of wheat and 25,435 tons
of barley. Morocco was the biggest export destination with
117,300 tons of wheat and 19,600 tons of barley loaded, the
most grain shipped to the country since at least August.  Wheat shipped to Algeria amounted to 23,890 tons, less
than a quarter of the 104,096 tons loaded for the country the
previous week, port data showed.  France ’s other main grain ports are La Pallice in the Bay
of Biscay and Dunkirk on the North Sea coast.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
