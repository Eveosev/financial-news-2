South Africa ’s Crop Estimates
Committee cut its forecast for this season’s corn crop by 1.9
percent because of dry weather in the Free State and Mpumalanga
provinces.  Farmers may produce 10.83 million metric tons of corn this
season, Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said
by phone from  Pretoria  today. The committee’s last forecast was
for a crop of 11.04 million tons.  The white corn crop estimate was cut 1.6 percent to 6.26
million tons while the yellow corn forecast was reduced by 2.4
percent to 4.57 million tons, she said.  The median estimate of 11 grain traders surveyed by
Bloomberg this week was for a total corn harvest of 10.9 million
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
