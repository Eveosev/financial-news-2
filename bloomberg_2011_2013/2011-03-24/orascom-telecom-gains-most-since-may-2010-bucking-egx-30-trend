Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (OTLD) , the
biggest mobile-phone operator in North Africa, surged the most
since May after the shares traded at a discount to their global
depository receipts.  The shares rose 9.9 percent to 3.87 Egyptian pounds at the
1:30 p.m. close in Cairo. Orascom Telecom’s London-listed GDRs
have gained 20 percent this month to $3.68 as of 11:48 a.m. in
 London , leaving the Cairo-listed shares valued at a discount of
14 percent. Egypt’s EGX30 Index tumbled 3.7 percent.  Shareholders of  Russia ’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  approved issuing
shares for a merger with Wind Telecom SpA, which has a
controlling stake in Orascom Telecom, on March 17. That helped
create a “positive sentiment" for the shares, said Amr Elalfy,
a research director at CI Capital in Cairo.  The stock is responding to the ‘‘resilient ’’ performance
of the London-listed GDRs, Elalfy said. ‘‘It is also trading at
some discount compared to its peers.’’  Cairo-based Orascom Telecom was valued at 5.9 times
analysts’ estimates for 2011 earnings after yesterday’s close,
less than half the average of 12 times for global peers, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. The stock was trading 79 percent
below the average 12-month price estimate of four analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Shareholders of VimpelCom voted on March 17 to issue new
shares to complete a merger with Wind Telecom, a $6.5 billion
transaction that would create the world’s sixth-biggest mobile
network operator. The merger still faces opposition from
VimpelCom’s largest shareholder  Telenor ASA. (TEL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
