Turkey  aims to promote the domestic
supply of scrap metal in a bid to reduce the import bill and
narrow the current-account deficit, Sabah newspaper reported,
citing Industry Minister Zafer Caglayan.  Scrap imports accounted for 15 percent of the current
account deficit last year, Caglayan said, according to the
Istanbul-based newspaper. If Turkey can double the local supply
of scrap to 10 million tons, that could keep $2.5 billion
annually in the country, he said.  The government has sent orders to provincial governors
throughout the country instructing them on the importance of
ensuring local scrap supplies, Sabah said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
