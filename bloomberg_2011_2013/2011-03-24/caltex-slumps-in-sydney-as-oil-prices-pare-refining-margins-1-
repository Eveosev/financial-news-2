Caltex Australia Ltd. (CTX) , the
country’s largest oil refiner, dropped in Sydney trading after
saying higher crude prices have reduced margins.  Caltex fell 5.3 percent to A$15.31 at the 4:10 p.m. close
in Sydney, the most in two weeks, compared with an increase of 1
percent for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index. Caltex has climbed
6.5 percent this year, while the index has declined about 1
percent.  The refiner margin from turning crude into fuel declined 30
percent in February from a year earlier to $6.44 a barrel,
Caltex said. For January, it fell 28 percent to $8.86 a barrel.
Crude oil yesterday rose to $105.75 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest since Sept. 26, 2008.  “The sharply rising crude price during January and
February had a material negative effect” on the refiner margin,
Caltex, 50 percent-owned by  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , said in a statement
to the exchange today.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
