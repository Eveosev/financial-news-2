Russian steel prices may start to
decline following a drop in export markets, Deutsche Bank AG
said in a report.  Steel in  Russia  has stayed at about 28,000 rubles ($990.60)
a metric ton for five weeks in a row, Deutsche Bank analyst Olga Okuneva wrote in the report today. Export prices declined by
about $60, or 7 percent, to $730 a ton, according to the report.  “We estimate that Russian domestic prices are currently at
a peak and will start softening already in April following the
trends in the export markets,” Okuneva wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
