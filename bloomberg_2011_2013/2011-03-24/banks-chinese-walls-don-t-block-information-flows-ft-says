Big banks’ equity analysts have
access to inside information from corporate lending desks,
despite the existence of so-called “Chinese walls” that are
meant to stop price-sensitive information passing between
departments, the Financial Times reported, citing a study to be
published in the Journal of Accounting Research.  Ting Chen of the Zicklin School of Business and Xiumin
Martin of the Olin Business School examined bank loans and
analysts’ earnings-per-share estimates between 1994 and 2007 and
found that the accuracy of forecasts improved significantly if
banks’ commercial lending arms signed loan agreements, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
