AccessKenya (ACCESS)  Group Ltd., the
country’s only publicly traded Internet company, headed for the
lowest close on record on expectations costs will increase.  The stock fell 35 cents, or 4 percent, to 8.5 shillings as
of 11:04 a.m. in Nairobi.  “The expected rise in  interest rates  in 2011 is also
likely to have a negative impact on financing costs,” Nairobi-
based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd. said today in an e-mailed
note to clients.  AccessKenya yesterday fell to the lowest since at least
June 2007 after the company reported a loss of 7.95 million
shillings ($94,000) for the year through December compared with
a profit a year earlier. Financing costs, administrative
expenses and foreign exchange losses increased, it said.  AccessKenya has fallen 37 percent this year, making it the
worst performing stock on the East African nation’s bourse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
