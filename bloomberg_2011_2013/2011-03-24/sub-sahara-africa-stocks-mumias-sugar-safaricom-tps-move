record, losing 35 cents, or 4 percent, to 8.5 shillings. “The
expected rise in  interest rates  in 2011 is also likely to have a
negative impact on financing costs,” Nairobi-based Kestrel
Capital East Africa Ltd. said today in an e-mailed note to
clients.  Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG KN), Kenya’s biggest producer of the
sweetener, snapped five days of decreases, adding 5 cents, or
0.7 percent, to 7.45 shillings. The East African nation expects
sugar production to grow by 4 percent this year as new producers
of the sweetener start operations in the country’s west, said
Solomon Odera, chief executive officer of the Kenya Sugar Board.  Mumias has expressed interest in buying one of five state-
controlled mills, Kenya Sugar Board Chairman Saulo Wanambisi
Busolo said in Nairobi today, without providing further details.  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)  , Kenya’s biggest mobile-network
operator and largest company by market value, rallied for a
second day, adding 5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 4 shillings. The
business will be restructured to comprise three units, namely
financial services, consumer business and enterprise services,
Chief Executive Officer Bob Collymore said yesterday.  “Buying Safaricom now is an endorsement of the changes and
cost-cutting plan,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , a Nairobi-based
independent stock market analyst, said in a phone interview
today. Collymore in January said the company started cost-
cutting measures in September and plans to save as much as 1
billion shillings ($12 million).  TPS Eastern Africa Ltd. (TPSEA)   rose for the first time
in five days adding 50 cents, or 0.8 percent, to 67.5 shillings.
The Kenyan holding company for the Serena chain of hotels said
full-year profit jumped 40 percent to 531.1 million shillings as
revenue climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
