a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies fell 0.5 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories declined 8 billion cubic feet in the week ended
March 18 to 1.61 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for April delivery gained 2.8 cents, or 0.7
