Wheat declined for the third time
this week on speculation production will rise next year as
prices that gained 47 percent last year encourage farmers to
increase planting.  World wheat production will rise, led by a possible 33
percent jump in  Russia , on increased planting prompted by higher
prices and as yields improve, the  United Nation’s Food and
Agriculture Organization  said yesterday in its Crop Prospects
and Food Situation report. Global production will increase 3.4
percent to 676 million metric tons in 2011, according to the
report.  The FAO cites “higher yields per acre and acreage
expansion as its reasons,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said today in a report. “This
applies to Russia especially, where the wheat crop is set to
surge by 32.5 percent this year to 55 million tons, after the
drought-related slump last year.”  Wheat for May delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$7.1225 a bushel at 10:35 a.m.  London  time on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade. The price has declined 13 percent this month, partly
on speculation stockpiles will rise amid declining demand for
the grain.  Corn fluctuated as investors weighed increased demand for
ethanol made from the grain and expanded seeding in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter.  U.S. farmers will plant more corn and soybeans this year
amid rising prices, Farm Futures magazine said in a  statement 
yesterday, citing a survey of 1,400 growers. Corn sowing will
increase 3.6 percent to 91.4 million acres from a year earlier,
according to the magazine.  Biofuel Support  “As long as oil remains above $100 a barrel, corn prices
should be well-supported thanks to demand for biofuel,” said
Seo Jun Mo, a senior trader at KB Futures Co. in  Seoul . “This
looks more like a temporary correction.”  Corn for May delivery in Chicago fell 0.25 cent to $6.8075
a bushel in Chicago. Corn rallied 11 percent in the four days
before March 23 and soybeans gained 7.5 percent in the five
sessions through March 22 after crude oil gained to the highest
in more than two years, boosting the appeal of biofuel.  May-delivery soybeans gained 2.5 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$13.5375 a bushel. U.S. acreage will climb 1.4 percent to a
record 78.5 million, according to the magazine’s survey. The
December projection was 77.42 million acres.  Crude oil for May delivery gained as much as 94 cents to
$106.69 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , near the highest level for the most active
contract since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
