One of the Lake District homes of
the English romantic poet William Wordsworth was severely
damaged by fire in the early hours of yesterday morning, the
Guardian reported.  The blaze was probably caused by an electrical fault in the
roof space, the newspaper said.   The 18th-century house, Allan Bank, at Grasmere, Cumbria,
was occupied by Wordsworth from 1808 until 1813; it’s owned by
the National Trust conservation organization, though it’s not
open to the public, the Guardian said.  Dove Cottage and Rydal Mount, two other Wordsworth homes
that are close by, are open to the public and are among the Lake
District’s greatest attractions, the newspaper said.   Wordsworth (1770-1850) was Poet Laureate from 1843 until
his death; among his best known works are “The Prelude” and
“Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early
Childhood.”  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
