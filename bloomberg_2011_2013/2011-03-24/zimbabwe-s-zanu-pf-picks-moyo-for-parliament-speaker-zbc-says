The  Zimbabwe  African National
Union-Patriotic Front nominated Simon Khaya Moyo as its
candidate for Parliament Speaker, the  Zimbabwe Broadcasting
Corp.  reported, citing  Zanu-PF  spokesman Rugare Gumbo.  Moyo will stand against Lovemore Moyo from the  Movement for
Democratic Change , the Harare-based broadcaster said on its
website. Lovemore Moyo was Speaker in Zimbabwe’s parliament
until a court nullified his election in a March 10 ruling.  Both men are chairman of their respective parties, ZBC
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
