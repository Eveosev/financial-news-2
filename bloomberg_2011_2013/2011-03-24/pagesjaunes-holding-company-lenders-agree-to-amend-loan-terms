Mediannuaire Holding SA, which
holds a controlling stake in French directories publisher
 PagesJaunes Groupe (PAJ) , got approval from lenders to amend terms of
its loans, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Mediannuaire will extend 316 million euros ($448 million)
of term loan B by one year to September 2015 after 91.3 percent
of holders gave their consent, said the person, who didn’t want
to be identified because the terms are private.  Lenders will receive as much as 125 basis points in fees
for accepting the changes, the person said. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and KKR Capital
Markets coordinated the amendment, the person said.  Delphine Penalva, a press officer for PagesJaunes in Paris,
didn’t respond to an email or phone call outside of business
hours.  To contact the reporters on this story:
