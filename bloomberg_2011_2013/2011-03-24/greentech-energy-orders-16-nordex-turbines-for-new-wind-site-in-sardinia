Greentech Energy Systems (GES)  A/S, a
Danish wind-power project developer, signed an order for 16  wind
turbines  with  Nordex SE (NDX1)  for a site being built in Sardinia.  Nordex, based in Norderstedt, Germany, will start delivery
and installation of the turbines at the 24-megawatt Cagliari II
park in April, Herlev-based Greentech said today in a statement.  The project will be commissioned in August with revenue
generation starting in September, Greentech said in the
statement. The company agreed to bridge finance for the turbines
on market terms with a duration lasting six months after
completion or to next February, Greentech said.  This enables Greentech to negotiate and secure final
 project financing  on market terms, the company said in the
statement without disclosing further financial information.  Cagliari II will use the same grid connection as
Greentech’s neighboring Energia Verde project once Terna SpA,
 Italy ’s power network operator, finishes expanding a transformer
station there, according to the statement.  Greentech also said an earlier agreement with Nordex to
supply nine turbines for another project, known as Cagliari III,
was canceled. Prepayment on that contract was transferred to the
delivery order on Cagliari II, according to the statement.  This eliminated a potential contractual obligation of 14.8
million euros ($21 million), according to Greentech, which said
this was important “as there is material uncertainty regarding
the possibility to obtain all permits for the Cagliari III
project.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
