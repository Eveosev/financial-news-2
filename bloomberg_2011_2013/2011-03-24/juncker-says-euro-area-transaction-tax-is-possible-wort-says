Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said a financial-transaction tax just for the 17-
nation euro-area is possible depending on what products are
targeted by it,  Luxemburger Wort  said, citing an interview.  “I am aware of the risks for the financial sector if the
 euro zone  alone introduced a transaction tax,” Juncker told the
newspaper in the interview published today. “It depends what
products will be affected by it.”  Juncker said he “will stick to the principle of a
transaction tax even if some people in  Europe  and in Luxembourg
have a different view,” adding that “it will be some time
before there’s an agreement on a transaction tax,” according to
the newspaper.  “I will continue to push for stricter rules concerning
bank bonuses,” Juncker said in the interview. “After all, we
can’t just jump from the crisis to a normal daily schedule
without tackling the origins of the crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
