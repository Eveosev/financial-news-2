Poland’s public debt ratio is
“unlikely” to have exceeded a legal limit of 55 percent of
gross domestic product last year due to unreported imports that
may have reduced the country’s official GDP, Miroslaw Gronicki,
a central bank adviser, told the  newspaper  Rzeczpospolita.  Gronicki’s comments follow a note yesterday from Danske
Bank which said imports from  Germany  may be underestimated by as
much as 15 billion euros ($21 billion), based on the Narodowy
Bank Polski’s payments data and discrepancies between Polish and
German trade figures. Any underestimate would result in a
similar reduction of GDP and increase the debt ratio,
Rzeczpospolita said on its Rp.pl website.  The balance of “errors and omissions” in its 12-month
balance of payments data reached 14.3 billion euros in January,
or about 4 percent of GDP, the central bank said.  “The debt ratio would top 55 percent if imports accounted
for the entire difference of 4 percent of GDP, but that’s
unlikely,” Gronicki said, according to the newspaper.  The errors and omissions may apply to underestimations
Of Polish foreign investments or wages earned by Poles abroad,
Pawel Michalik, deputy director of the central bank’s
Statistical Department, was quoted by Rzeczpospolita as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
