U.S. stock futures trimmed gains
after orders for durable goods unexpectedly fell in February as
demand for capital goods and military aircraft declined.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
rose 0.5 percent to 1,298.9 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York  after
climbing more than 0.8 percent earlier. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures rose 62 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,083.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
dropped 0.9 percent after a 3.6 percent gain the prior month
that was higher than initially reported, the Commerce Department
said. Orders excluding transportation equipment fell for a
second month and demand for business equipment declined.  The  S&P 500  is poised this week to recover some of the
previous two weeks of declines after AT&T Inc. agreed to buy T-
Mobile USA Inc. for $39 billion. The S&P 500 has fallen after
Japan’s worst earthquake on record caused a nuclear power plant
to discharge radioactive vapor and  Libya ’s Muammar Qaddafi
attacked rebels seeking to end his 41 years as the country’s
ruler.  European Union leaders begin a two-day meeting in Brussels
today to seek a solution to the debt crisis that has forced
Greece and Ireland to seek financial aid. Portuguese President
Anibal Cavaco Silva said the government will retain its powers
until he accepts the resignation of Prime Minister  Jose
Socrates .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
