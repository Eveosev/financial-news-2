PG&E Corp. (PCG)  customers will have to
pay as much as $20 a month if they want to have the wireless
radio transmitters in their digital electricity meters turned
off.  PG&E, the owner of  California ’s largest utility, disclosed
the charge in a regulatory filing, saying it’s needed to cover
the cost of stopping the signals and reading the meters manually
as well as upgrading the utility’s wireless meter network to
compensate for lost signals.  The company, which was ordered March 10 to create a way for
customers to “opt-out” of its smart-meter program, estimated
about 145,800 customers may chose to have the meters disabled at
a potential cost of $84.4 million.  Customers wishing to terminate the meter’s transmission
abilities will pay a one-time fee ranging from $135 to $270, as
well as an ongoing monthly charge that will either be a flat
rate or based on energy use, the San Francisco-based company
said in the filing. The charges will be reduced for low-income
customers.  The opt-out directive from the  California Public Utilities
Commission  was designed to provide relief for customers
concerned about the potential health effects of the wireless
radio frequency emissions from the devices, which allow for
remote readings of electricity and gas use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
