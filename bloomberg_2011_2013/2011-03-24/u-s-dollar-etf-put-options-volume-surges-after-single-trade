Put volume for an exchange-traded
fund tracking the U.S. dollar against six other major currencies
surged to a record after a single trade with a strike price 3.4
percent below today’s close.  An investor bought 94,039 June $21 puts to sell the
 PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP)  for 16 cents each at
12:28 p.m. in  New York , according to a report by Trade Alert
LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market data and
analytics, and data compiled by Bloomberg.  More than 102,700 puts traded today, a record. The June $21
puts were the most traded and accounted for almost all put
trades. The ETF, which began trading in February 2007, declined
0.2 percent to $21.73. It has never closed below $21.65.  “The ETF is not far from record lows,” said Frederic Ruffy, a senior options strategist at WhatsTrading.com, a New
York-based provider of options-market analytics. “Basically,
what they’re saying is, ‘I’m going to buy these puts and look
for it to continue falling.’” The puts “are not very
expensive” because the fund “doesn’t make very big moves,” he
said.  The fund replicates a long position in the  U.S. dollar 
against the euro, yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish
krona and Swiss franc.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
