Japan ’s auto parts makers, faced
with continuing production interruptions after the March 11
earthquake, may relocate more factories to  China  as a result of
the disaster, according to a Chinese government official.  About 70 percent of car parts in China are supplied by
local component makers and foreign companies with plants in the
country, according to the nation’s Association of Automobile
Manufacturers. Yet some parts used for engines and electronic
components are mainly imported from Japan and other countries,
Cheng Xiaodong, an official with the National Development and
Reform Commission, said in a telephone interview today.  “Companies were not motivated to localize production of
key components in China and the quake may change that if they
face rising difficulties in the following months in supplying to
their China assemblers,” said Cheng, who is in charge of the
vehicle price monitoring arm of the state planning agency.
“China is the world’s biggest vehicle market and producer and
it makes sense for them to do so.”  Nissan Motor Co.’s Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn 
said yesterday about 40 component suppliers in Japan remain in
difficulty after the quake, complicating automakers’ efforts to
restart production. Denso Corp., Aisin Seiki Co., Hitachi Ltd.,
and others parts makers suspended most or some of their
production after the quake.  Japanese automakers accounted for 23 percent of car
deliveries in China last year, according to the auto association.  --Tian Ying. Editors:  Garry Smith ,  Ian Rowley .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
