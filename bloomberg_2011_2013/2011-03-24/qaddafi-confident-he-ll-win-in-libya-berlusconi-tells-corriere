Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  remains confident
he’ll retake full control of the country and called on him to
abide by a United Nation demand for a cease-fire,  Corriere della
Sera  reported, citing an interview.  “Qaddafi is still confident he can succeed because he has
full control of the capital,” the Milan-based newspaper cited
Berlusconi as saying. “An end to hostilities by the Colonel is
the pre-condition for any mediation, after which point diplomacy
can begin.”  Berlusconi said Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
agrees with him that the time for a diplomatic mediation hasn’t
come yet, Corriere reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
