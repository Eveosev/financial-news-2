JPMorgan Chase & Co., which accepts
physical gold as collateral for trading securities, has become a
custodian of Comex silver inventories, according to the owner of
the New York exchange.  JPMorgan became a depository on March 17, according to
Chris Grams, a spokesman for Comex owner CME Group Inc. The bank
had 30,844 ounces of silver eligible for delivery as of March
22, exchange data show. Total holdings in Comex-monitored
warehouses were 104.27 million ounces.  Silver prices have more than doubled in the past year and
gold reached a record today as investors bought precious metals
as a hedge against inflation and turmoil in financial markets.
New York-based JPMorgan said last month it expects to accept
additional precious metals and commodities as collateral later
this year.  “This is further indication that gold and silver are being
treated more like a currency,” said Matt Zeman, a market
strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago .  Silver futures for May delivery rose 17.7 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $37.375 an ounce at 1:51 p.m. on the
Comex, after touching a 31-year high of $38.18. The price
reached a record $50.35 in 1980.  JPMorgan has also been authorized to hold gold, platinum
and palladium for delivery against precious metals contracts
traded on the Comex and Nymex, according to Grams, the exchange
spokesman.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the inventories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
