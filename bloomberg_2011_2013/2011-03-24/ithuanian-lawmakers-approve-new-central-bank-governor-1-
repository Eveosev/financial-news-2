Lithuanian lawmakers approved
former Deputy Finance Minister Vitas Vasiliauskas as the next
central bank governor as the Baltic nation moves toward joining
the euro region.  Lawmakers voted 89-16, with 8 abstentions, to back
Vasiliauskas, according to a vote count on Parliament’s website.
The 37-year-old lawyer will replace Reinoldijus Sarkinas, whose
mandate expired on Feb. 15.  Vasiliauskas’s five-year term means he will oversee
monetary policy as Lithuania, which joined the pre-euro
 exchange-rate  mechanism in 2004, aims to make the currency
switch in 2014.  The country pegs the litas to euro in a currency-board
system where the central bank keeps foreign-currency reserves at
least at the level of all cash in circulation to maintain the
exchange rate. Lietuvos Bankas doesn’t use  interest rates  as a
policy tool.  President Dalia Grybauskaite nominated her former deputy,
who worked with her between 2001 and 2004 when she was the
country’s finance minister. Vasiliauskas was also the head of
Grybauskaite’s presidential election campaign in 2009.  Vasiliauskas, who received his doctoral law degree from
Vilnius University, teaches law and works for the legal firm
LAWIN since 2004. He also led  Lithuania ’s pre-accession tax
negotiations with the European Union.  Sarkinas, who led the central bank’s board since 1996, will
remain in his post until April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
