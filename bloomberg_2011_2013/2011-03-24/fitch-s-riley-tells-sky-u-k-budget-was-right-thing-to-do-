Fitch Ratings Ltd. Managing
Director of Sovereign Ratings  David Riley  told Sky News in an
interview the budget announced by the U.K. government yesterday
was “in the whole, the right thing to do.” The government’s
initiatives to set out a “credible, admittedly tough, fiscal
program has actually been very important in supporting the
U.K.’s Triple A status,” Riley said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
