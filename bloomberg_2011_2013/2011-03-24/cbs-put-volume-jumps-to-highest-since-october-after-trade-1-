CBS Corp. (CBS)  put volume surged to its
highest level since October after a single trade with a strike
price 4.3 percent below today’s close.  A block of 2,176 April $24 puts traded for 55 cents each at
9:43 a.m. in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Open
interest for the contract was 264 before today.  Almost 12,700 puts to sell the owner of the most-watched
U.S. television network traded today, 11.5 times the four-week
average. The April $24 puts were the most active and accounted
for almost nine-tenths of all put trades. New York-based CBS
gained 0.9 percent to $25.09.  The TV network owner rallied 76 percent in the past year,
beating the 19 percent advanced for companies dependent on
 consumer spending  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. It has
climbed 14 percent since CBS Corp. and Time Warner Inc.’s Warner
Bros. studio discontinued production of the “Two and a Half
Men” sitcom, citing the behavior and remarks of series star
 Charlie Sheen , on Feb. 24.  CBS’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to 36.79 from
34.47 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
