The U.K. Serious Fraud Office
manager heading the inquiry into the Tchenguiz brothers’ role in
the collapse of Kaupthing Bank hf has resigned, the Financial
Times reported, citing the SFO.  The departure of Mick Randall comes less than three weeks
after the agency arrested tycoons Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz
and raided their homes, the newspaper said, adding that the
brothers denied wrongdoing and were released without charge.  The SFO said Randall has planned to leave for “some
time,” the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
