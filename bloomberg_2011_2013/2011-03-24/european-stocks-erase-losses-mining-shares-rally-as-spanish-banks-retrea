European stocks erased losses as
mining companies rallied. Asian shares advanced and U.S. futures
fluctuated.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and Banco Santander SA
retreated 1.3 percent and 0.9 respectively, after Moodyâ€™s
Investor Services downgraded 30 Spanish banks, even though it
maintained its rating on the pair.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.1 percent to
273.34 at 8:19 a.m. in  London  after earlier falling as much as
0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
