Belarus’s dollar-denominated bonds
rebounded from yesterday’s plunge, which pushed yields to record
highs on  currency-devaluation  concern.  The country’s dollar bonds due in 2018 rose 1.2 percent to
88.825 cents on the dollar, the biggest jump since they were
sold in January, pushing the yield down 25 basis points to
11.978 percent as of 10:46 a.m. in London, according to prices
on Bloomberg. Belarus dollar bonds maturing in 2015 gained 0.9
percent, trimming the yield 25 basis points to 12.126 percent.
It was the first day of gains in the past three days.  Yields reached record highs yesterday on concern the
country may be forced to devalue and will struggle to pay debts
after foreign reserves decreased 33 percent to $2.9 billion in
December from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg-compiled
data. Belarus’s current-account deficit was equivalent to 15.6
percent of the economy in 2010. Belarus asked Russia and former
Soviet partners for loans of $3 billion, Russian Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin said March 15. The central bank eased
restrictions on banks’ foreign-currency dealings yesterday.  “We think that something must be in the pipeline in terms
of privatization,”  Dmitry Gourov , a Vienna-based UniCredit
analyst, wrote in a research report today. Belarus may have to
devalue its ruble by 20 percent “in the coming weeks,”
UniCredit said.  The Belarusian ruble weakened 0.2 percent to 3,031 per
dollar, bringing losses in the past two days to 0.4 percent, the
biggest back-to-back retreat since Jan. 11 in intraday trading.  New Rules  By comparison,  Greece ’s current-account deficit reached
15.3 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2008, and began 2010
at 12.2 percent before the country had to turn to the European
Union for a rescue loan.  The central bank of Belarus lifted its 30-day reserve
requirement for bank purchases of foreign currency to help
lenders cope with currency demand, according to a  statement  on
the regulator’s website yesterday.  The new rules, which will go into effect on April 1, will
allow banks to buy foreign currency one day after reserves in
Belorussian rubles are formed, the Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki
Belarus said in the capital Minsk.  The central bank devalued its currency by about a fifth
January 2009.  The Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus, the central bank,
said on March 15 that it has no plans for a “sharp” currency
devaluation. The Belarusian ruble will be allowed to fluctuate
within 8 percent of 1,057.04 rubles, the value of its target
basket at the start of the year, the bank said March 15. The
basket is divided equally into dollars, euros and Russian
rubles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
