Iraq will sign a $15 billion
contract for a housing project with Arab investors next month,
Saber al-Issawi, the governor of  Baghdad , said.  An investor from the  United Arab Emirates  and another group
of companies from the U.A.E. and Kuwait are the finalists in the
bidding process, he said in an interview today in Amman.  “We will either choose one of them, or split the project
between the two groups,” he said. He declined to identify the
companies.  The project, Madinat al-Mustaqbal, or City of the Future,
is for 35,000 to 40,000 apartments and related infrastructure in
al-Duhna, western Baghdad.  The Baghdad commission intends to sign contracts for more
than 20 projects this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
