Codelco, the world’s largest copper
producer, is optimistic about the metal’s price this year as
 Japan ’s earthquake reconstruction boosts demand prospects, El
Mercurio reported, citing Chairman Gerardo Jofre.  Codelco, which is owned by the Chilean state, will
contribute about $6 billion to government coffers from last
year’s earnings after prices surged, the Santiago-based
newspaper quoted Jofre as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
