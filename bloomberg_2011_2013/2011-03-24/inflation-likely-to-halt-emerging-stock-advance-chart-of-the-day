Emerging-market stocks are likely
to fall victim to accelerating inflation even after performing
better this month than shares traded in developed countries,
according to  Barclays Capital .  The CHART OF THE DAY displays an inflation indicator, the
Institute for Supply Management’s index of prices paid, in the
top panel. The gauge is based on monthly surveys of purchasing
managers at manufacturing companies.  Emerging markets tend to do relatively poorly when the ISM
index exceeds 75, according to a report today in which Barclays
Capital discussed the global outlook. This conclusion was based
on the ratio of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index, which the chart shows in the bottom panel.  “Greater risks remain for emerging markets from high and
rising inflation rates” as central banks respond by tightening
credit, strategists Edmund Shing and Barry Knapp wrote in the
report.  China , India, Indonesia and  South Korea  raised  interest
rates  since last month, and the Philippines joined them today.  The ISM gauge surpassed 75 in January and rose last month
to 82, the highest level since July 2008. Readings greater than
50 show prices are generally rising.  MSCI’S emerging-market index, composed of shares listed in
21 countries, climbed 1.4 percent this month through yesterday.
The gain contrasted with losses of 2.2 percent for the S&P 500
and 3 percent for the MSCI World Index, which tracks 24
developed markets.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
