Naftna Industrija Srbije AD,
 Serbia ’s largest oil company majority owned by OAO Gazprom Neft,
will triple production and nearly double sales by 2020 under a
proposed long-term plan.  The vertically integrated company active in Serbia, Bosnia-
Herzegovina and  Angola  is to increase production by 306 percent
to nearly 3.7 million tons of crude by the end of the decade and
plans to boost sales 91 percent to almost 5 million tons as its
two refineries are also expected to increase processing volume
by 75 percent, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Last year was a turnaround for the company and the
achieved results created a base for further development,” Vadim Yakovlev, deputy chairman of the management board, said in the
statement.  Nis lost its monopoly on oil imports to Serbia this year
while it remains the sole refiner in the Balkan country where it
also operates several  oil fields  and a retail network. Last
month, it reported 2010 net income before extraordinary items of
16.5 billion dinars ($219 million), compared with a loss of 37.7
billion dinars in 2009.  OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s state-controlled
gas producer, has approved the long-term plan, the company said
in the statement released a day after Russia’s Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  visited Serbia for talks with the government.  Gazprom Neft bought 51 percent of NIS for 400 million euros
($567 million) in early 2009 with a commitment to invest another
500 million euros. It recently raised the stake to 56.15
percent, paying 40.3 million euros to small shareholders for
5.15 percent of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
