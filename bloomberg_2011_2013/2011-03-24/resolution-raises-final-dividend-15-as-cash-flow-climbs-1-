Resolution Ltd. (RSL) , the insurance
buyout firm founded by  Clive Cowdery , raised its final dividend
15 percent after more than doubling the cash generated from the
acquisitions it made over the past two years.  Resolution raised the payout for the second half of 2010
to 12.57 pence a share and plans to pay 18.85 pence a share in
2011, the Guernsey, Channel Islands-based firm said today in a
statement.  “The board will continue to keep under review the
appropriateness of the company moving to a growing dividend,
from the rebased level, by the end of the U.K. life project,”
Resolution said in the statement.  Resolution has made three acquisitions since it was founded
by former insurance salesman Cowdery in 2008 and plans to sell
the combined units within the next three years. The firm is the
best-performing member of the  FTSE ASX Life Insurance (FALIFE)  Index over
the past six months, rising 24 percent, after saying it will
concentrate on merging its businesses rather than on future
purchases.  Shareholder cash increased to 1.07 billion pounds
($1.73 billion) at Dec. 31 from 510 million pounds a year
earlier, Resolution said.  Net income declined to 765 million pounds from 1.28 billion
pounds. That beat the 308 million-pound median estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The highest estimate was
536 million pounds, the lowest was 214 million pounds.  The 2010 profit figure includes four months of earnings
from Axa SA’s U.K. life business, which Resolution acquired last
year, and the company’s 2009 profit was “restated”
accordingly, the insurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
