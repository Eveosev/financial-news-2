Spot gasoline in  California 
strengthened as Exxon Mobil Corp.â€™s Torrance refinery in
California reported a leak and emissions.  The tubing leak has been stopped and there was no impact on
production, according to the filing with the California
Emergency Management Agency. Gasoline inventories on the West
Coast fell 1.1 million barrels to 31.1 million barrels last
week, the Energy Department reported yesterday.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or carbob, in
Los Angeles, increased 0.9 cent to 20 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 2:19 p.m.
local time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the
highest level since Feb. 18. Prompt delivery rose 2.54 cents to
$3.245 a gallon.  The same fuel in  San Francisco  gained 0.9 cent to 16.5
cents a gallon.  U.S. gasoline stocks are at their lowest level since
January, according to the government.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Portland rose 0.75 cent to 5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
