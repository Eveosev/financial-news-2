Colombia ’s peso bonds dropped,
pushing yields up the most in four months, on speculation the
central bank will raise  interest rates  at a faster pace after a
report showed the economy grew more than economists forecast.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 11 percent bonds
due July 2020 rose 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to
8.359 percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The
increase was the biggest since Nov. 11. The bond’s price
declined 1.078 centavo to 116.561 centavos per peso.  Colombia’s economy grew 4.6 percent in the last three
months of 2010 from a year earlier, the statistics agency said
today, beating the 4.1 percent median estimate of 27 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Gross domestic product grew 4.3 percent
in 2010 from a year earlier, the biggest gain since 2007, when
annual growth rose to a decade high of 6.9 percent.  “Because this was a very positive number, it may be
translated in interest-rate increases by the central bank so
prices are reflecting that,” said Omar Escorcia, a fixed-income
analyst at Asesores en Valores SA brokerage in Bogota.  Colombian policy makers increased the overnight lending
rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 percent on March 18 and
indicated that the current benchmark rate may serve to anchor
inflation within their 2011 and 2012 target. They are scheduled
to next announce any changes to the rate April 29.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 1,865.45 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:17 p.m. New York time, from 1,867.18 yesterday.  “Greater economic growth increases investors’ trust in the
country,” Escorcia said. “That, coupled with expectations we
will get investment-grade ratings from Fitch and Moody’s,
increases demand for the Colombian currency.”  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said he expects 2011
GDP growth of as much as 6 percent as spending to repair damages
from last year’s flooding and a rating upgrade by  Standard &
Poor’s  attracts added investment.  Colombia’s credit rating was raised to investment grade by
Standard & Poor’s on March 16, 11 years after it was cut to junk
in the midst of an insurgency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
