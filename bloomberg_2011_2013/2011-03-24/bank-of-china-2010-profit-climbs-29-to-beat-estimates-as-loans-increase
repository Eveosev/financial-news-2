(Corrects share price in second paragraph.)  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , the nation’s
third-largest lender by market value, rose the most in almost
five months in  Hong Kong  trading after reporting full-year
profit that beat analysts’ estimates on wider loan margins.  The stock advanced 2.6 percent to close at HK$4.27, after
 Bank of China  said yesterday that net income climbed 29 percent
to 104.4 billion yuan ($15.9 billion) in 2010. Earnings were
helped by increased loan profitability and lower credit
provisions.  Rivals including  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd.
also rose in Hong Kong today, as Bank of China’s report spurred
optimism that lenders will benefit from higher interest rates.
Chairman Xiao Gang, 52, said he plans to further boost loan
margins by cutting the cost of capital and raising lending rates.  “After a flat net interest margin for three quarters, its
net interest margin finally rebounded,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analysts Samuel Chen and Cindy Xu wrote in a note today. “We
expect a positive stock-price reaction on the results. Long term,
we see valuation as attractive.”  Bank of China trades at 1.77 times book value, below the
average of 2.17 times over the past four years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Beijing-based lender’s profit
beat the 99 billion yuan average of 19 estimates collected by
Bloomberg.  Wider Margins  China’s central bank has raised  interest rates  three times
since mid-October to contain inflation as the nation’s economy
grew to overtake  Japan ’s as the world’s second largest in 2010.
That’s helped push banks’ loan margins higher because their
funding costs haven’t risen at the same pace.  Bank of China’s net interest margin widened to 2.07 percent
last year from 2.04 percent in 2009. The gap expanded 10 basis
points in the fourth quarter from the previous three months to
2.14 percent, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Bank of China President Li Lihui said he expects further
interest rate increases and tighter liquidity this year, adding
that he’s “confident” the lender’s net interest margin will
improve. Loan profitability in the first two months of 2011 was
similar to that of the fourth quarter, he said.  “China’s banks should be thankful that the government put
on the brakes while the economy is still expanding and demand
for loans remains strong,” said Sophie Jiang, a Beijing-based
analyst at CCB International Securities Ltd.  Payout Ratio  ICBC, the world’s largest bank by market value, rose 1.9
percent in Hong Kong while  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  gained
2 percent. All Chinese lenders traded in the city advanced.  Bank of China extended 750 billion yuan of local and
foreign-currency denominated new loans last year, taking the
outstanding amount to 5.66 trillion yuan, an increase of 15.3
percent from the end of 2009. The company forecast loan growth
of at least 10 percent for 2011.  China’s Hong Kong-listed banks may increase net interest
margins by an average 17 basis points this year and another 15
basis points in 2012, compared with a 6 basis point increase
last year, according to Mike Werner, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co.  Bank of China cut its dividend payout ratio last year to 39
percent to preserve capital, compared with 44 percent in 2009
and 51 percent in 2008. The reduction came after the bank
regulator forced lenders to set aside more provisions against
loans and boosted minimum requirements for capital strength.  ‘Public Protest’  “We view this as a public protest to the regulator’s
tightening on banks’ capital adequacy and other requirements
such as provisioning,” BNP Paribas SA analysts Dorris Chen and
Ellie Li wrote in a note yesterday. The move “reduces the
attractiveness of  China  banks as a high-yield defensive play.”  Bank of China targets a payout ratio of 35 percent to 45
percent over the next three years and aims to maintain the level
at about 40 percent to support long-term growth, Li said.  The bank reported almost 13 billion yuan of impairment
losses on assets for 2010, including provisions for potential
non-performing loans and a reversal of earlier charges for
overseas mortgage investments, compared with 15 billion yuan a
year earlier. The balance of its non-performing loans dropped
for an eighth year to 62.47 billion yuan as of December,
accounting for 1.1 percent of total advances.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
