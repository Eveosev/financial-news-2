Following is the text of a  Federal
Reserve  statement today:  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will hold press briefings four times
per year to present the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s current
economic projections and to provide additional context for the
FOMC’s policy decisions.  In 2011, the Chairman’s press briefings will be held at 2:15
p.m. following FOMC decisions scheduled on April 27, June 22 and
November 2. The briefings will be broadcast live on the Federal
Reserve’s website. For these meetings, the FOMC statement is
expected to be released at around 12:30 p.m., one hour and
forty-five minutes earlier than for other FOMC meetings.  The introduction of regular press briefings is intended to
further enhance the clarity and timeliness of the Federal
Reserve’s monetary policy communication. The Federal Reserve
will continue to review its communications practices in the
interest of ensuring accountability and increasing public
understanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
