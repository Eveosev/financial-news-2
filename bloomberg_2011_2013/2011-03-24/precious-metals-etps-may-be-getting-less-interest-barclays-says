Precious metals investors are
turning to active strategies instead of exchange traded products
which were popular last year, a Barclays Capital survey showed.  “Last year’s most-favored investment route -- exchange-
traded products -- has fallen significantly from over a third of
votes to less than a fifth, most likely reflecting less
interest in physically backed precious metals,” Barclays said
in its annual survey of more than 100 investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
