The Republic of Congo plans to keep
exports of its Djeno and N’Kossa crude unchanged in May,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The May program comprises six 920,000-barrel shipments of
Djeno and two 950,000-barrel cargoes of N’Kossa, unchanged from
April, the plan shows.  Total SA (FP) ,  France ’s largest oil producer, operates the two
fields in Congo. The crudes are sweet, or have low sulfur
content. N’Kossa is a lighter grade than Djeno and yields more
lucrative fuels such as gasoline and diesel when processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
