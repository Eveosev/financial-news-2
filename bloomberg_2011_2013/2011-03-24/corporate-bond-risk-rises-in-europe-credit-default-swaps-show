The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 7 basis
points to 393, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7:30 a.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals deteriorating
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1.75 basis points to 106.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers climbed 5.5 basis points to 154 basis
points and the subordinated index was up 7 at 272.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
