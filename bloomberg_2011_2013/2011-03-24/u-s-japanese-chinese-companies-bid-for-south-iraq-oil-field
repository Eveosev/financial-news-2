U.S., Japanese and Chinese
companies submitted bids to develop the al-Qatiaa oil field west
of the southern Iraqi city of Nassiriya, according to a
municipal official.  The Oil Ministry is studying the offers from the three
companies, Hussein Aziz, head of the municipality of al-Shatra
in Nassiriya province, told reporters. He declined to identify
the companies.  The oil field will produce about 300,000 barrels a day, he
said. The contract also involves the establishment of a refinery
and the drilling of 10 wells, he said.  Iraq  is struggling to draw foreign investment and expertise
to help it increase energy exports and rebuild an economy
shattered by wars and sanctions. The country has signed 15 gas
and oil licenses since the U.S.-led invasion overthrew former
President  Saddam Hussein  in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
