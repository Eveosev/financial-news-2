U.S. manufacturing remains strong,
economist Ian Shepherdson said after the government reported an
unexpected decline in factory orders for durable goods.  “I’m reluctant to call this any type of turn,” said
Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics of
Valhalla,  New York . “I don’t think there’s much wrong with the
manufacturing sector.”  Shepherdson cited gains in the Institute for Supply
Management’s national factory index for his optimism in a radio
interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene.  He was less optimistic about the labor market. “I’m very
skeptical of what’s reported has actually happened,”
Shepherdson said.  The Commerce Department reported today that durable goods
orders dropped 0.9 percent last month. Economists had
anticipated an increase. The Labor Department, meantime,
reported initial jobless claims fell last week.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
