The tuberculosis reporting rate in
the U.S. dropped to a record low last year, while falling short
of the goal to eradicate the bacterial infection.  About 3.6  tuberculosis  cases were reported for every
100,000 Americans, a decline of 3.9 percent from the prior year
and the lowest since national reporting began in 1953, according
to a  study  released today by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. Minorities and people born in other
countries accounted for most of the 11,181 U.S. cases.  The CDC and its scientific advisers said in 1989 that
tuberculosis should be eliminated from the U.S. by 2010. The
increase in cases tied to HIV in the 1990s and difficulty in
lowering the rate of infection among foreign-born residents has
prevented this target from being reached, the agency said.  “Continued progress in meeting the goal of TB elimination
will hinge on improving TB control and prevention activities
among disproportionately affected populations, including
foreign-born persons, blacks, and Hispanics,” according to the
study in today’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.  The data were released to coincide with  World TB Day , which
commemorates the discovery in 1884 of the germ that causes
tuberculosis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
