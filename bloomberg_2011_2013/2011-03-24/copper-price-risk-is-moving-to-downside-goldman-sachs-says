Copper price risk is moving to the
“downside” on turbulence in the Middle East and North Africa
and this month’s earthquake in  Japan , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said.  “The anticipatory pricing that pushed copper prices beyond
$10,000 a metric ton earlier in the quarter is now encountering
new headwinds,” analysts including Joshua Crumb in London said
in a report dated today.  Still, the metal is likely to remain above $9,000 a ton for
now, the bank said, citing a probable return of Chinese buying
and a “tightening impact” from Japan. That will create
“demand-pull” support for copper prices, it said.  Copper for three-month delivery traded at $9,743 a ton at
4:06 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange. Prices reached $10,190
on Feb. 15. Imports of refined copper into  China , the world’s
biggest consumer, dropped to a two-year low in February, customs
figures showed on March 21.  Goldman Sachs said it still expects supply shortfalls in
the “medium term” that will push inventories toward
“critically low” levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
