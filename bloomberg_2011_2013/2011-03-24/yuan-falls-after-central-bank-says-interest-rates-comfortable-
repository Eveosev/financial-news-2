China ’s yuan fell for a second day
after a central banker said interest rates are at a
“comfortable level” and predicted inflation will cool.  Yi Gang, a deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China,
said yesterday that he is “not too worried” as price pressures
will slow in the second half of the year. The monetary authority
set the reference rate 0.04 percent weaker at 6.5625 per dollar,
after fixing it at the strongest level since July 2005 on March
22.  “From what Yi said, the stance that the currency will
appreciate to tackle inflation is somewhat ruled out,” said
 Patrick Bennett , a Hong Kong-based strategist at Standard Bank
Group Ltd. “The major tools on inflation are the reserve-
requirement ratio and  interest rates .”  The yuan slipped 0.04 percent to end at 6.5618 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency touched 6.5552 on March 22, the strongest
level since the country unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.11 percent to
6.449 per dollar as of 4:45 p.m. in  Hong Kong , reflecting bets
the yuan will strengthen 1.7 percent in a year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency may strengthen to 6.15 per dollar by the end
of 2011 and to 5.75 per dollar by the end of next year,
according to International Strategy & Investment Group. China’s
economy may grow 9.1 percent this year,  Donald Straszheim , head
of China research at ISI, said in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
