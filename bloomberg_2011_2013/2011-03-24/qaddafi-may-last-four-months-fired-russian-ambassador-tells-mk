Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  may
withstand military attacks by the U.S. and its allies for as
long as four months, Russia’s former ambassador to the country
said in an  interview  published today in Moskovsky Komsomolets.  Qaddafi will last “as long as he has food supplies,” said
Vladimir Chamov, who was fired by Medvedev last week without
making the reason public, according to MK.  Chamov said he sent a telegram to Medvedev calling Russia’s
decision not to block United Nations Security Council approval
for the military campaign a “betrayal of Russia’s interests,”
according to the interview.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s condemnation of the air and
missile strikes on Libyan targets as a “medieval call to a
crusade” was exactly right, Chamov said. Medvedev defended
Russia’s decision to abstain from the UN vote and chided Putin,
saying on March 21 that comparing the events in  Libya  to the
crusades was “unacceptable.”  Natalya Timakova, a spokeswoman for Medvedev couldn’t be
reached immediately today for comment on Chamov’s interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
