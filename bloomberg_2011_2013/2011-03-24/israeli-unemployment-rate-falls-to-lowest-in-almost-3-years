Israel ’s unemployment rate in
January declined to its lowest level in almost three years as an
expanding economy led to the creation of new jobs.  The rate fell to 6.1 percent from 6.3 percent in December,
the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics said today on
its website.  “We are seeing very positive growth figures and this
trickles down to the job market”  Rafael Gozlan , chief economist
at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by telephone
before the report.  Israel bounced back from the global recession faster than
many developed economies, with growth accelerating to 7.7
percent in the last quarter of 2010, the fastest pace in four
years. The economy may expand 4.3 percent this year, Harel
Insurance Investments and Financial Services Ltd. said March 2.  Israel’s index of leading economic indicators rose a
preliminary 0.4 percent in February, led by exports of goods and
services and manufacturing, the  Bank of Israel  reported on March
17. Israel’s trade deficit narrowed in February as industrial
exports increased, the bureau said on March 10.  The economic recovery has pushed the benchmark TA-25 stock
index up about 6 percent in the past 6 months, led by Avner Oil
Exploration LP, a partner in gas fields off the country’s coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
