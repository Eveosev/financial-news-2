Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  assembled a record
number of vehicles at its factory in  Slovakia  last year to meet
rising demand for sport-utility vehicles.  The South Korean carmaker’s Slovak unit produced 229,505
vehicles in 2010 in Zilina, Slovakia, compared with a target of
228,000 cars and 150,000 vehicles shipped in 2009, said Dusan Dvorak, a spokesman for the unit. Engine production at the
factory rose 32 percent to 320,900 units, he said.  Kia and its affiliate Hyundai Motors Co. plan to tap rising
demand for small SUVs to gain market share in  Europe  as the
economy struggles to recover from the worst economic crisis
since World War II. SUVs represented 58 percent of Kia’s Slovak
output last year, up from about 20 percent in 2009.  “Last year was good for us,” Dvorak told journalists
today. “Growth was achieved thanks to the new models.”  The carmaker last year began to produce a new generation of
its Sportage SUVs and to assemble Hyundai-brand ix35 cars at
Zilina.  The 1.1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) plant, which
started to produce in 2006, also makes cee’d compact cars.  The unit is sticking to its plan to increase output to
about 240,000 vehicles this year, Dvorak said. The Zilina
factory will in the second half of this year take over
production of Kia Venga cars from Hyundai’s plant in the  Czech
Republic , which will in turn begin assembling Hyundai ix35
model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
