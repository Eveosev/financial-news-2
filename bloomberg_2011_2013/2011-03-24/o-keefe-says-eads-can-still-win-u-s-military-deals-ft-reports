European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. North America Chief Executive Officer  Sean O’Keefe 
said the company can still win some contracts for specialized
aircraft for the U.S. military despite  Boeing Co. (BA)  being awarded
the main tanker contract last month, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview.  EADS has got “commercial aircraft that can fit those kind
of requirements,” O’Keefe said, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
