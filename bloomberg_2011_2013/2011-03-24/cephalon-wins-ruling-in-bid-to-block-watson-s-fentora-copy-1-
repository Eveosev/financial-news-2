Cephalon Inc. (CEPH)  won a U.S. court
ruling that may keep Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. from selling
generic versions of the painkiller Fentora until a patent
expires in 2019.  U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
today said Watson’s copy would infringe a Cephalon patent on the
drug and rejected efforts by Watson to invalidate it. The judge
also denied Watson’s request to vacate a previously entered
order that prevents Watson from marketing its product, Cephalon
said in a statement.  Fentora, a fast-acting tablet that dissolves in the mouth,
is approved to relieve sudden episodes of cancer pain in adults
already taking other opioids, or morphine-like drugs. The
medicine generated $160 million in U.S. sales last year for
Cephalon, the company reported Feb. 10.  The patent that was upheld is for a process of making the
drug so it dissolves. It expires in 2019, said Natalie de Vane,
a spokeswoman for Frazer, Pennsylvania-based Cephalon.  The judge had earlier ruled that Corona, California-based
Watson wouldn’t infringe two other patents on the medicine.
Officials with Watson didn’t immediately return messages seeking
comment.  The case is Cephalon Inc. v.  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) ,
09cv724, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
