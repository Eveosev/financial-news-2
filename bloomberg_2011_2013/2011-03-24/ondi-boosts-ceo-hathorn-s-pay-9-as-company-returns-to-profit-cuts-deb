Mondi Plc. (MNP) ,  Europe ’s largest maker
of office paper, boosted the pay of Chief Executive Officer
David Hathorn by 9 percent last year as the company swung to
profit and slashed debt.  Hathorn, 48, earned 2.16 million euros ($3.05 million) in
2010, which includes base pay of 903,629 euros, a bonus of
602,812 euros and deferred stock that matched his bonus,
according to Johannesburg-based Mondi’s  annual report . That
compares with a total package of 1.99 million euros in 2009,
which included a base of 867,115 euros and a bonus and deferred
shares each worth 538,799 euros.  Mondi, which posted a 224 million euro profit last year
from a 2009 loss of 33 million euros, completed its largest
capital project with the 545 million euro modernization of its
Syktyvkar mill in  Russia . The mill added 50,000 metric tons of
office paper and another 60,000 tons of containerboard capacity,
Hathorn said in the annual report.  “With the completion of the major European projects in
2010 we should see increased cash flow generation,” Joint
Chairmen Cyril Ramaphosa and  David Williams  said in the report.
Mondi will use the extra cash to boost shareholder returns,
invest in existing assets and ensure debt levels are maintained
within “investment grade credit metrics,” they said.  Mondi’s net debt fell by 153 million euros last year to
1.36 billion euro, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
