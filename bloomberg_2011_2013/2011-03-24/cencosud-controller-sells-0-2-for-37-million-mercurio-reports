Cencosud SA’s controlling
shareholder Horst Paulmann sold a 0.2 percent stake in  Chile ’s
biggest retailer by sales for $37 million, El Mercurio reported.  Paulmann sold 5.3 million shares after regulators reduced
the limit that pension funds can hold in companies in which the
controller owns more than 65 percent, the Santiago-based
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  An officer at Cencosud’s communications department wasn’t
available for comment, an assistant said by phone, and didn’t
respond to an e-mailed message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
