turned into a destination for fans of chef Henry Harris’s French
country cooking. The wine list is another draw. Information:

 river race  that originated in 1829.  The two crews board their boats Saturday afternoon from
Putney Embankment, after a gold sovereign is tossed to determine
which side they row on. They fight to the Mortlake finish past
scores of cheering gawkers, as tens of thousands watch live on
BBC1, BBC World, BBC America and Eurosport.  Cambridge, last year’s winner, has chalked up the most wins
since 1829 -- 80 against Oxford’s 75.  Information:  http://www.theboatrace.org .  The Brown Dog is a friendly pub in Barnes -- near the
race’s finish -- with a fine British seasonal menu. It’s a few
blocks from the river, and children and dogs are welcome, so
it’s a good place to escape the crowds. Book ahead if you want
to eat. There’s no TV, so if you try too many of the real ales,
you could miss the 5 p.m. race.  Information:  http://www.thebrowndog.co.uk/  or

recreated on the London stage.  “Million Dollar Quartet,” a Broadway show, has the King
teaming up with  Johnny Cash , Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins in
 Memphis ,  Tennessee . They race through tracks including “Hound
Dog” and “Great Balls of Fire.”  The live singing is solid, particularly in the final
medley. It’s the linking narration that could use some work.  “Million Dollar Quartet” is at the Noel Coward Theatre.

artist Jan Gossaert produced plenty of naughty nudes.  A roomful of his erotica including his famous part-
uncovered Venus is in the  National Gallery .  Gossaert’s portraits give his sitters framed, architectural
backdrops, creating a 3-D effect -- without the silly glasses.  “Jan Gossaert’s Renaissance” is at the National Gallery
through May 30. Information:  http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk
