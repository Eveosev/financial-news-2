Premiums are likely to rise for
industrial companies after this month’s earthquake and tsunami
in  Japan ,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing an
interview with Axel Theis, head of  Allianz SE (ALV) ’s industrial unit.  The insurer has received “numerous” client inquiries
about the extent of coverage, but “so far few concrete loss
reports,” the newspaper quoted Theis as saying in a preview of
an article to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
