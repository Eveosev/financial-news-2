Singapore ’s gasoil stockpiles fell
the most in more than three months as suppliers made up lost
shipments from Japan as refineries shut after an earthquake,
data from a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of middle distillates, including gasoil
and kerosene, fell 11.7 percent to 12.67 million barrels in the
seven days to March 23,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the largest decline since
the week of Dec. 8  Stockpiles of residues, including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen, fell 0.04 percent to 18.45
million barrels. Light distillates such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline declined 4.2 percent to 11.8 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
