U.S. Gulf crude premiums over
benchmark West Texas Intermediate weakened as traders balanced
books on the final day of trading for April delivery.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 55 cents to
$11.75 a barrel at 3:52 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet sank 80 cents to
$12 over the benchmark.  Among  Gulf Coast  sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
narrowed 25 cents to $8.75 a barrel over WTI, while Poseidon’s
premium narrowed $1.40 to $8.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium strengthened 15 cents to
$8.75. Thunder Horse increased $1.35 to $12 a barrel over WTI.  Crude supplies near a record-high at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
gives U.S. refiners an advantage over their European
counterparts, Vienna-based researcher JBC Energy GmbH said.  “Refining economics in the Atlantic Basin are severely
skewed in favor of U.S. refiners,” as the oversupply at Cushing,
the delivery point for benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate oil,
depresses crude prices in the Midwest and Gulf Coast, JBC
analysts led by  David Wech  said today in a note.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 20 cents to $3.60 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing.  Syncrude’s premium shrank 75 cents to $9.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 50 cents to
$16.90 a barrel. The spread has narrowed $4.10 over the past
nine days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
