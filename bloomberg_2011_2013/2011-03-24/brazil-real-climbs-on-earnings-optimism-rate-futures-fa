Brazil’s real strengthened as
speculation earnings growth will counter the effects of Japan’s
biggest earthquake increased demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency gained 0.2 percent to 1.6565 per dollar at
8:50 a.m. in New York, from 1.6604 yesterday.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s biggest automaker, reached
the highest level in more than two months on the prospect that
first-quarter earnings will beat forecasts. Taiwan’s  Inotera
Memories Inc. (3474)  jumped 6.8 percent after Micron Technology Inc.,
the largest U.S. maker of computer-memory chips, posted better-
than-expected profit. Commodities including sugar, cotton,
aluminum and live cattle rose.  “There’s a favorable environment for the real’s
appreciation, with less risk aversion,” said Luciano Rostagno,
chief-strategist at CM Capital Markets in Sao Paulo. “A great
part of Brazilian exports come from commodities.”  Yields on interest-rate futures contracts due in January
2013 fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.76
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
