Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman  John Kerry  will hold hearings “in the near future” on
the military intervention in  Libya  by the U.S. and allies, a
committee aide said.  Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, “has been been traveling
in the region” during this week’s congressional recess “to get
information firsthand from our allies,” spokesman Frederick Jones said in a statement.  “Senator Kerry understands the importance and complexity
of our role in protecting the people of Libya and the committee
will hold public hearings in the near future,” Jones said.  Senator Richard Lugar of  Indiana , the top Republican on the
foreign relations panel, yesterday sent a letter to Kerry
requesting hearings on Libya as U.S. and allied warplanes
continued to strike Muammar Qaddafi’s ground forces there.  “The administration has not adequately defined the U.S.
strategic interest in Libya or adequately articulated how the
conflict ends,” Lugar said in the letter.  Jones said the Libyan situation “was explored in depth”
during a March 17 committee hearing when Under Secretary of
State  William Burns  testified about citizen uprisings in the
Middle East and North Africa.  The coalition’s mission began March 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
