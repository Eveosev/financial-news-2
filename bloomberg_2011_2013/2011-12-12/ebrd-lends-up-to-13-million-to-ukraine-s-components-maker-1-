The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development agreed to lend as much as $13 million to ZAT
Lugcentrokuz, a Ukrainian private producer of key components for
rail freight wagons and locomotives.  The loan will help Ukraine improve freight transportation
services and replace aging wagons, the London-based bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. Lugcentrokuz will be able to
improve its product range and sales in Ukraine, the post-Soviet
Commonwealth of Independent States and other markets such as
 Europe ,  North America  and  India .  The company will save around 4,000 mega-watt-hours a year
and also reduce natural-gas consumption, the EBRD said. This
will allow annual greenhouse emissions to be reduced by the
equivalent of around 7,000 tons of CO2, the statement said.  Lugcentrokuz makes shock absorbers, axles, wheel sets and
springs for railway cars. The company will also spend the loan
to improve its water supply and use leading to higher
environment standards, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
