The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose for a third day, according to money-
market indicators.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was 123 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:50 a.m. in London,
from 122 basis points on Dec. 9.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 80 basis
points under Euribor, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  rose. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was at 97 basis
points from 96 basis points Dec. 9.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank, parking 335 billion euros ($446 billion) at the
Frankfurt-based ECB on Dec. 9, from 310 billion euros the
previous day. That’s the most since June 2010 and compares with
a year-to-date weekly average of 88 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
