Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-
largest U.S. lender by assets, said D. Paul Jones will step down
after three years on the firm’s board of directors.  Jones, 69, won’t stand for re-election at the May 9 annual
meeting, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said today in
a regulatory filing.  The former chairman and chief executive officer of
Birmingham, Alabama-based Compass Bancshares Inc. was among four
new directors appointed at Bank of America in June 2009 as then-
CEO  Kenneth D. Lewis  revamped the firm’s board amid pressure
from regulators. Jones, a lawyer, began his career at a
Birmingham law firm more than 40 years ago.  “Mr. Jones has brought industry expertise and seasoned
judgment to his service for Bank of America shareholders during
a challenging period of transformation for the company,” said
 Larry DiRita , a spokesman for the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
