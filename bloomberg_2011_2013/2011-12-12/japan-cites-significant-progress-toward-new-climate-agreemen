Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said he welcomes broader participation in efforts to limit
greenhouse-gas emissions following commitments from China and
India at the climate summit in Durban,  South Africa .  “This meeting has brought the significant outcome, in line
with Japan’s stance, such as clarifying the pathway to the
establishment of a new legal framework in which all economies
participate,” Noda said yesterday in a  statement .  China and India committed at the United Nations  climate
conference  in Durban to work toward an agreement to limit their
fossil fuel emissions for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
