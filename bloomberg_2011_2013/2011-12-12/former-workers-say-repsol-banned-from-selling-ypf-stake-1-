Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s biggest oil
company, wasn’t permitted to sell a stake in its Argentine unit
 YPF SA (YPFD)  without the approval of former workers, according to a
recent appeals court ruling in the South America nation.  Repsol sold an 11.5 percent stake in YPF to U.S. funds for
$1.7 billion in March when it was banned from doing so, the
Federation of Former YPF Workers said in an e-mailed statement
today, citing the appeals court ruling from earlier this month.
The group plans to file a complaint to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission in the next few days, according to the
statement.  A court in the Argentine province of Cordoba ruled on Dec.
5 that Repsol can’t sell a 10 percent stake in YPF without the
approval of almost 25,000 former workers and shareholders,
according to today’s statement. An Argentine judge in February
ordered Madrid-based Repsol to halt plans to sell a 15 percent
stake in YPF amid a dispute with former employees, who are
seeking to recover their ownership rights in YPF shares.  Repsol Spokesman Kristian Rix declined to comment in an e-
mail today. A YPF official wasn’t immediately available for
comment.  Repsol fell 3.2 percent to close at 22.39 euros in Madrid.
YPF’s  American depositary receipts (YPF)  fell less than 1 percent to
$34.44 at 1:41 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
