Estonia  won’t join other European
Union nations in helping channel 200 billion euros ($265
billion) to the  International Monetary Fund , the Finance
Ministry said.  “Estonia didn’t participate in the IMF capital boost in
2009 following the financial crisis and  Europe  is currently not
counting on Estonia’s contribution,” the ministry said today in
a written response to e-mailed questions from Bloomberg.  EU member states last week agreed to consider and confirm
within 10 days contributing funds to the IMF in the form of
bilateral loans to ensure the Washington-based fund has adequate
resources to deal with the sovereign debt crisis.  “Estonia first needs to resolve matters pertaining to IMF
quota reforms of 2008 and 2010, including increased
downpayments, which in themselves will significantly increase
Estonia’s contribution to the IMF,” the  Finance Ministry  said.
“The contribution total cited in the conclusions of the summit
was reached by doubling the bilateral loans extended by Europe
to the IMF in 2009.”  Estonia’s central bank plans to comment on the issue
tomorrow, spokesman Viljar Raask said in a phone interview.  The Baltic nation plans to boost its contribution to the
IMF to 243.6 million SDRs, or 277 million euros, from 65.2
million SDRs, or 74.1 million euros, under quota reforms of 2008
and 2010, the Finance Ministry said, adding that Parliament is
due to approve the first part of the two-phase increase on Dec.
15, with the second phase due by next summer.  SDRs are currency units developed by the IMF based on a
basket of major currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
