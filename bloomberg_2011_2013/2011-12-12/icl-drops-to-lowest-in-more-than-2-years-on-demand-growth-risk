Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , which
extracts minerals from the Dead Sea to make fertilizer and
potash, declined to the lowest in more than two years amid
speculation slowing global growth will drive food prices lower.  The shares declined 1.8 percent to 35.44 shekels at 11:43
a.m. in Tel Aviv, the lowest intraday level since July 2009.  “There is a worry that a worsening macro economy on a
global basis will bring down demand for grain and food,” said
Gilad Alper, an analyst at Excellence Nessuah Investment House
Ltd. in  Ramat Gan .  World food prices tracked by the United Nations retreated
for a fifth consecutive month in November, the longest decline
in more than two years. The U.S. government said Dec. 9 that
combined global inventories of corn, soybeans and wheat will be
3.2 percent larger than anticipated a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
