Iran ’s Abadan refinery will raise
its daily output of high-octane gasoline by almost 2 million
liters (12,600 barrels) before Jan. 20, the oil ministry website
 Shana  reported, citing Abdolreza Mehraban, managing director of
Abadan Oil Refining Co.  The Persian Gulf state is working on building a new
refinery complex in Abadan, which upon completion would increase
daily production of 94-octane gasoline to 6 million liters,
according to the report. The first phase of the expansion plan
came on stream in June with a production capacity of 4.2 million
liters, Shana said.  Iran is the second-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi Arabia . The Abadan
refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of about 360,000
barrels a day, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
