State Street Corp.’s money-
management unit named Michael Ho chief investment officer for
actively managed emerging-markets equities, a new position.  Ho, 44, joined  State Street Global Advisors  from Mellon
Capital Management, a unit of Bank of New York Mellon Corp.,
where he was CIO, the Boston-based firm said today in a
statement. He will be based in Boston and report to Alistair
Lowe, global chief investment officer for active equities.  SSgA, known primarily for its passive, or index-based,
funds and institutional strategies, has worked to expand
actively managed capabilities under Chief Executive Officer
Scott Powers. The firm increased active assets by about 36
percent in January when it acquired the investment-management
unit of Bank of Ireland, the company said at the time.  The appointment “underscores our commitment to having the
highest quality investment talent at SSgA,” Lowe said in the
statement.  Ho, who holds a doctorate degree in management science and
engineering from  Stanford University  in  Palo Alto ,  California ,
will also oversee SSgA’s so-called global macro investing
strategies.  SSgA managed $1.9 trillion as of Sept. 30. Clients have
$8.98 billion in SSgA’s active emerging-markets equities
strategies and funds, spokeswoman Arlene Roberts said in an e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
