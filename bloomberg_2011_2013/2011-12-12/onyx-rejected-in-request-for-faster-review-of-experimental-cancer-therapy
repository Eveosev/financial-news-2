Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s (ONXX) 
experimental cancer drug carfilzomib will get a standard review
from U.S. regulators, instead of an accelerated process sought
by the company.  The  Food and Drug Administration  said the South San
Francisco, California-based company hadn’t conducted the
clinical trials necessary for the quicker review of carfilzomib,
Onyx said today in a statement.  The FDA scheduled a target date of July 27, four months
later than under an accelerated approval, to decide whether to
approve carfilzomib for patents with multiple myeloma, a cancer
of plasma cells, Onyx said in its statement. The company, which
developed Nexavar for kidney cancer, submitted its application
in September.  “Our goal remains to make this promising new therapy
available to patients with relapsed and refractory multiple
myeloma as quickly as possible,” Ted Love, Onyx’s executive
vice president of research and development, said in the
statement.  Carfilzomib may generate $227.6 million in sales by the end
of 2014, according to the average estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
