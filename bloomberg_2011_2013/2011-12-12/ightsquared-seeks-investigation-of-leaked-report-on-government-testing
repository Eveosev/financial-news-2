LightSquared Inc.  is calling for a
government investigation into a leak of test results that
indicated its planned wireless service caused interference with
global-positioning system receivers.  Testing conducted Oct. 31 to Nov. 4 indicated that
LightSquared’s service caused interference with 75 percent of
GPS receivers, Bloomberg News reported Dec. 9, citing a draft
summary of the results.  “The information leaked on Friday, December 9, 2011 was
preliminary, incomplete and did not represent the full findings
from the test results,” LightSquared Chief Executive Officer
Sanjiv Ahuja said in a letter to officials at the U.S.
Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation.  He asked the departments to “refer this matter for an
immediate investigation to determine the circumstances of this
leak.”  LightSquared, backed by $3 billion from Philip Falcone’s
Harbinger Capital Partners hedge fund, has proposed offering
high-speed mobile  Internet service  to as many as 260 million
people using 40,000 base stations. The service would operate on
airwaves formerly reserved mainly for satellites, and near those
used by GPS devices.  The Reston, Virginia-based company said the results
wrongfully assume that LightSquared’s wireless network will
operate at a power level 32 times greater than the one at which
it will actually operate, according to the letter.  Planes, Tractors, Automobiles  LightSquared is facing challenges from GPS companies that
say the service will disrupt navigation by cars, boats, tractors
and planes. U.S. regulators have been withholding approval as
they check the claims of interference.  “It is the latest in a series selective leaks aimed at
undermining LightSquared’s efforts to find a solution to the GPS
interference problem and serve the narrow business interests of
a few GPS companies,” LightSquared said.  The testing was requested by the  National
Telecommunications and Information Administration , a part of the
Commerce Department.  “Our analysis is still under way and we are examining the
full range of scenarios,” said Moira Vahey, a spokeswoman for
the NTIA. “The conclusions to be drawn from the test data will
vary depending on factors such as LightSquared’s power levels
and other technical variables.”  Official results of the testing won’t be released for
“several more weeks,” Anthony Russo, director of the  National
Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and
Timing , said in an e-mailed statement. The NTIA asked that the
tests be conducted under the auspices of Russo’s office.  Bloomberg stands by its reporting, said  Ty Trippet , a
spokesman for New York-based Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg
News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
