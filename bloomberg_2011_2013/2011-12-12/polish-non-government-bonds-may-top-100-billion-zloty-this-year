The value of the market for Polish
corporate, bank and municipal bonds may rise by as much as 49
percent this year as companies, driven by the  energy industry ,
seek financing for investments, according to  Fitch Ratings .  The market for non-government bonds may reach 100 billion
zloty ($29.3 billion) at the end of this year, compared with
67.3 billion zloty in 2010, Miroslaw Dudzinski, a director of
Fitch’s Polish unit said in an interview on Dec. 9. The value of
bond issuances may reach about 50 billion zloty in 2012.  “I expect the corporate  bond market  to expand in Poland”
as the European debt crisis may force banks to limit lending and
as bonds become more interesting for investors, Dudzinski said.
For “smaller companies” bonds may be the only source of
financing next year, he added.  Polish companies that plan to sell bonds include Polskie
Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA, the country’s biggest gas
company, which plans to sell up to 7 billion zloty of bonds.
Tauron Polska Energia SA in October increased its domestic bond
sale plan to 4.3 billion zloty from 1.3 billion zloty.  PKO Bank Polski SA,  Poland ’s biggest bank, sold 700 million
zloty of bonds on Dec. 9 as part of its 5-billion zloty program.
Getin Noble Bank SA, controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki,
plans to sell as much as 500 million zloty of bonds by the end
of next year, according to a regulatory filing on Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
