Kuwait  aims to boost output capacity
by about a third to 4 million barrels a day by 2020 and maintain
that level for about a decade by expanding its heavy crude
deposits in northern fields, Kuwait Oil Co. Chairman Sami al- Rushaid said.  “To achieve the 4-million-barrels-a-day target, we need to
develop our ‘very large’ heavy oil reserves,” he said today at
a heavy oil conference in  Kuwait City .  Kuwait  currently has a 3
million barrels a day capacity.  Kuwait, holder of about 8 percent of the world’s crude
reserves, aims to start producing 60,000 barrels a day of heavy
oil in 2016 by injecting steam into the deposits to heat the
thick grade and make it flow to the wells, he said. The emirate
plans to raise the output to 270,000 barrels a day by 2030, al-
Rushaid said. The new blend will have an API from 11 to 18
degrees, he said.  KOC, as the company is known, is seeking the assistance of
international  oil companies  to develop the heavy deposits, and
it is still holding talks with them, he said.  KOC had talks with  Total SA (FP)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  about
developing the heavy-crude deposits from fields in the north
using advanced technology. Al-Rushaid said that his company
hadn’t reached a final agreement with any company until now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
