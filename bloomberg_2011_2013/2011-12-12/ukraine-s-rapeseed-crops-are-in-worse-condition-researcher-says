Ukraine’s rapeseed conditions have
deteriorated from a year earlier after dry weather in autumn,
according to UkrAgroConsult, a researcher.  The amount of rapeseed areas in “good” condition declined
to 32.9 percent as of Dec. 8 from 53.5 percent a year
earlier, the Kiev-based researcher said by e-mail today.
Rapeseed in “weak” condition accounted for 33.2 percent of the
crop, compared with 10.6 percent a year earlier, it said.  Rapeseed sprouted on 746,300 hectares (1.84 million acres)
and 183,500 hectares of the plant failed to emerge, according to
the  Agriculture Ministry ’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
