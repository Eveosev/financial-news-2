Ariana Resources Plc (AAU) , developer of a
$26 million gold mine in western  Turkey , expects as much as $10
million in annual profit from 2013, Managing Director Kerim
Sener said.  The company, which is developing the open-pit mine in a
venture with Turkish builder Proccea Construction Co., aims to
begin output by the end of next year, Sener said today in an
interview in London. Ariana is in talks with three Turkish banks
to borrow $20 million to fund construction, he said. The
remaining will be funded by Proccea, he said.  Ariana, which owns gold projects in northeast Turkey with
European Goldfields Ltd., wants to acquire mining licenses in
the largest gold-producing country in  Europe , Sener said. Turkey
is likely to produce 25 metric tons of gold this year compared
with 17 tons last year, he said.  The company aims to produce 14,400 ounces of gold at an
operating cost of $500 to $600 an ounce at its mine in the Red
Rabbit area of western Turkey in 2013, the first year of
production, Sener said. The mine would be profitable at gold
prices above $1,058, he said. Production is estimated to rise to
21,400 ounces in 2015 before beginning to decline until the end
of the mineâ€™s life in eight years.  Ariana will seek to pay back the debt it takes on to
develop the mine and may then consider offering a dividend, he
said. European Goldfields owns an 11 percent stake in Ariana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
