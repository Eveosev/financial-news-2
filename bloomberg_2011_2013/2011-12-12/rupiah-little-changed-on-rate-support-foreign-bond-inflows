Indonesia ’s rupiah gained on
optimism overseas investors will boost purchases of the nation’s
bonds after the central bank kept  interest rates  on hold.  Bank Indonesia  kept its  reference rate  at 6 percent on Dec.
8 after cutting it in October and November.  Foreign holdings  of
rupiah debt climbed 4.1 percent this month through Dec. 8,
reversing a decline in November, after the central bank reduced
debt supply and pledged to prevent its currency from becoming
“too weak” amid concern the European debt crisis is worsening.
Three-year  government bonds  rose.  “The BI decision and bond purchases are supporting the
rupiah,” said Mika Martumpal, a senior market analyst at PT
Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “The currency should continue to
trade in a range against the dollar with a tendency to
strengthen going into year-end.”  The rupiah rose 0.3 percent to 9,055 per dollar as of 3:51
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. It may trade between 8,800 and 9,200 through year-
end, Martumpal said.  The central bank expects the currency to trade between
8,900 and 9,000 in 2012, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono told
reporters in Jakarta today. The monetary authority plans to
boost “intervention” to support the rupiah, Governor Darmin
Nasution said on Nov. 30, after it reached a 17-month low of
9,240 the previous day. The rupiah has appreciated 0.9 percent
this month.  Bond Auction Canceled  Overseas investors owned 223.61 trillion rupiah ($24.7
billion) of  government securities , according to the latest data
published by the debt management office. They cut holdings by
2.3 percent to 214.79 trillion rupiah in November.  The finance ministry canceled an auction of 10- and 20-year
bonds on Dec. 6 because the government has sufficient cash
reserves,  Rahmat Waluyanto , director general at the debt
management office, said in Jakarta on Dec. 1. The sales were the
last scheduled for 2011, according to its auction calendar.  The yield on the 11 percent note due October 2014 dropped
four basis points or 0.04 percentage point to 5.38 percent,
according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
