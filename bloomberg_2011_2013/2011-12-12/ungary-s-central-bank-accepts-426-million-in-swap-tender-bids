Hungary ’s central bank accepted 320
million euros ($425 million) in foreign-currency swap bids from
local lenders in November to ease pressure on the forint arising
from a mortgage-repayment plan.  The  Magyar Nemzeti Bank  paid out 291 million euros to
credit institutions, the central bank said in a summary of last
month’s transactions that were posted on its  website  today.  The government is forcing commercial banks to swallow
exchange-rate losses on foreign currency denominated mortgages
by giving the option for borrowers to repay their loans in a
lump sum at below-market rates. Two-thirds of housing loans are
denominated in foreign currencies, mostly in Swiss francs.  The central bank is allowing domestic lenders to tap its
foreign currency reserves to cope with an expected increase in
demand for Swiss francs and euro. The offer is aimed at easing
depreciation pressures on the forint, which fell to a record-low
against the euro last month and is the worst-performing currency
in the world in the second half of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
