Rebels in  Germany ’s co-ruling Free
Democratic Party who oppose the setting up of a permanent
European rescue fund -- called the European Stability Mechanism
-- will fail, the Handelsblatt reports.  Rebels led by lawmaker  Frank Schaeffler  need the support of
a third of the party’s membership or 21,500 backers to force the
FDP to adopt a resolution rejecting the ESM, said the newspaper.  The deadline for garnering that support is Dec. 13 and
Schaeffler has only 16,800 votes, it said. The FDP leadership
expects the move to fail, Handelsblatt said, citing its Chairman
Philipp Roesler.  To contact the reporter on this story:
