FuelCell Energy Inc., (FCEL)  a U.S. maker
of fuel-cell power plants, jumped the most in three months on an
agreement to supply equipment to Spain’s Abengoa SA for biogas
projects.  FuelCell climbed 15 percent to $1.09 at the close in New
York, the most since Sept. 7. The Danbury, Connecticut-based
company, which initially sold shares in June 1992 at $9 each,
had declined 53 percent this year.  Abengoa plans to use FuelCell’s products at projects it
will develop in Europe and  Latin America  that will convert
biogas into electricity, the companies said today in a
statement. The Spanish company will initially install a 300-
kilowatt fuel-cell plant at its headquarters in Seville.  FuelCell’s systems run on natural gas or biogas, methane
produced through wastewater treatment,  food processing  and other
renewable sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
