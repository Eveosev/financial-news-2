What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as rising global production
reduces demand for U.S. supplies, Chad Henderson, a market
analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
Wisconsin, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on speculation that  Europe â€™s debt crisis will
expand as rising world supplies slow demand for U.S. grain,
Henderson said.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cent to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT on speculation that a stronger dollar and falling
prices for crude oil and global equities will reduce consumer
and speculative demand for agricultural commodities, Henderson
said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.5 cent to 0.6
cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open steady to
50 cents lower per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
