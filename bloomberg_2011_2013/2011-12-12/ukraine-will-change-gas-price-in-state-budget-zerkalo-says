Ukraine ’s Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  instructed the cabinet on Dec. 7 to prepare another
version of the state budget for next year with a natural gas
price of $400 per 1,000 cubic meters,  Zerkalo Nedeli  reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  The draft of a new gas supply and transit agreement between
Ukraine and Russia stipulates that Ukraine’s state-run NAK
Naftogaz Ukrainy and Russia’s OAO Gazprom create two equally
owned joint-venture companies, one for transit, the other for
domestic distribution in Ukraine, the weekly newspaper reported,
citing the draft, which it obtained and which is subject to
change.  Ukraine’s underground gas storage is also to be in joint
ownership, according to Zerkalo.  Ukraine seeks to revise the terms of a 10-year gas supply
contract signed with  Russia  in 2009, with a lower price for the
gas it imports. Ukraine pays for Russian gas using a formula
that takes account of world oil and gasoil prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
