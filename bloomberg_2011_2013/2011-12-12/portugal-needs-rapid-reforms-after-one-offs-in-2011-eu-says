Portugal  reached its  budget-deficit 
targets this year though one-off measures and needs to enact
proposed austerity policies against powerful opposition to
ensure lasting debt reduction, the European Commission said.  “Perseverance and resolve of the government will be
required to overcome strong vested interests that stand in the
way of reforms,” the Commission said in a report dated Dec. 2
following the second review of Portugal’s bailout program
obtained by Bloomberg News. The country has to “rapidly” adopt
reforms to reduce labor costs and increase flexibility.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($104
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund .  Portugal will meet its budget-deficit limit for this year
after taking over banks’ pension funds to the state, Finance
Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Dec. 5. Passos Coelho said the
same day that the transfer “will allow our deficit to be
substantially below 5.9 percent” of gross domestic product.  The  Portuguese government  said on Dec. 2 that the value of
the planned transfer of banks’ pension funds may reach 6 billion
euros. The government has also announced a Christmas income-tax
surcharge to help cover the shortfall this year.  The government aims to trim the budget deficit from 9.8
percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 percent in 2011, 4.5 percent in
2012, and to the EU ceiling of 3 percent in 2013. Debt will
reach 100.8 percent of GDP this year and peak at 106.8 percent
in 2013 before declining, the government forecast on Aug. 31.
Debt was 93.3 percent of GDP in 2010.  ‘Good Start’  Finance MinisterGaspar said on Nov. 16 said the second
quarterly review of the country’s financial-aid program was
“successful,” allowing it to receive another rescue payment
tranche of 8 billion euros. The so-called troika of the
Commission,  European Central Bank  and IMF said on that day that
Portugal’s plan is “off to a good start,” adding that the 2012
budget includes “bold and welcome measures.”  The 2012 budget includes a plan to eliminate the summer and
Christmas salary payments for state workers earning more than
1,100 euros a month.  Tax deductions  will be reduced and the
government plans to increase the value-added  tax rate  on some
goods. Spending cuts in 2012 represent 4.4 percent of GDP,
including reductions on health-care spending, while revenue
increases represent 1.7 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
