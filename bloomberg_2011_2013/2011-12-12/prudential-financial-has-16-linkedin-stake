     Dec. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Prudential Financial Inc., the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, reported a stake in LinkedIn
Corp., the largest professional-networking website.  “Shares were acquired in the ordinary course of business,
and not with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing
control” of LinkedIn, according to a regulatory filing today.
The document shows Prudential has 3.09 million shares. That is
7.8 percent of the 39.7 million Class A shares outstanding,
according to LinkedIn.  The shares are held for clients, rather than in the  Newark ,
New Jersey-based firm’s account backing insurance policies, said
 Bob DeFillippo , a spokesman for the company. Prudential had
about $871 billion of assets under management as of Sept. 30. T.
Rowe Price Group Inc. has more than 5 million shares of  Mountain
View , California-based LinkedIn, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  LinkedIn sold shares to the public in May at $45 each and
held an additional  offering  last month when investors paid $71
each. The stock slipped 60 cents today to $71.29 at 4:15 p.m. in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
