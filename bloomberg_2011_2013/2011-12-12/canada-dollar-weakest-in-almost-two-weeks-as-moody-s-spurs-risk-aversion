Canada ’s dollar dropped as Moody’s
Investors Service said it will review the credit ratings of
European Union nations after last week’s summit, damping
appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The loonie, as the currency is known, fell to the lowest
level against its U.S. counterpart this month as crude oil
decreased as much as 2.3 percent and  government bonds  rose. The
Canadian currency rose against the majority of its most-traded
counterparts and the U.S. dollar was the best performer as
investors sought the safety of North American debt.  “Canada should test C$1.05 on the topside in the next two
weeks, which will be a good level to buy,” said  Dean Popplewell , head analyst in Toronto at the online-currency
trading firm Oanda Corp. “We’re talking about Canada being the
best of the bad lot and  Europe  is really in the crosshairs
now.”  The loonie slid 1 percent to C$1.0271 per  U.S. dollar  at 5
p.m. Toronto time, after touching C$1.0286, the weakest since
Nov. 30. One Canadian dollar buys 97.36 U.S. cents. The currency
rose 0.5 percent to C$1.3545 against the euro.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, fell 1.9
percent to $97.83 a barrel in New York. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index fell 1.5 percent, and the  S&P/TSX  Index, Canada’s
equity benchmark, dropped 1.1 percent.  International Debt  The advance in Canadian  government bonds  pushed the yield
on the two-year security down three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.88 percent. The 1 percent securities
maturing in February 2014 rose 5 cents to C$100.26. The yield on
the U.S. two-year note was little changed at 0.22 percent.  Canada’s net international debt fell for the first time in
10 quarters during the July-September period as a decline in the
loonie boosted the value of assets held abroad,  Statistics
Canada  said today. The book value of the country’s shortfall
fell by C$31.8 billion ($30.9 billion) to C$189.5 billion.  The failure of Canada’s dollar to rise above C$1.0113 has
kept the weakening trend in tact versus the U.S. currency,
according to Royal Bank of Canada.  The currency will have to see a daily close weaker than
C$1.0271 to move to C$1.0364 and C$1.0486 and neutralize the
risks of strengthening,  George Davis , chief technical analyst
for fixed-income and currency strategy in Toronto at RBC, wrote
to clients today. A daily close of the greenback below C$1.0120
would be bullish for the Canadian dollar, according to the note.  European leaders announced a blueprint after meetings on
Dec. 8 and 9 for a closer fiscal accord to save the euro, adding
200 billion euros ($265 billion) to their bailout fund and
tightening rules to curb future debts.  The agreement offered few new measures and doesn’t
diminish the risk of credit-ranking revisions, Moody’s said in
its Weekly Credit Outlook. “Our intention as announced in
November is to revisit the level and dispersion of ratings
during the first quarter of 2012,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
