Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  aims
to invest $7 billion to increase capacity next year and will
raise 2012 oil output 17 percent to benefit from high oil
prices, President  Steve Laut  said.  The company plans to drill two wells in the North Sea and a
third off Ivory Coast in 2012, he said today in an interview in
Kuwait City. The explorer will boost production of heavy crude
to 480,000 barrels a day from 110,000 barrels a day, adding
40,000 to 60,000 barrels a day every two to three years until it
reaches the target, he said.  The company wonâ€™t raise natural gas production next year as
prices in  North America  remain low, he said. Laut said in
November he expects natural gas prices to stay low for five to
10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
