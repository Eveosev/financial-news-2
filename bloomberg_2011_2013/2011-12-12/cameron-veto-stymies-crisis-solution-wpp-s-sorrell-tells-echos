U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s
refusal to sign a European Union fiscal accord is a political
maneuver that will make it harder to resolve the region’s debt
crisis,  Martin Sorrell , chief executive of advertising group  WPP
Plc (WPP) , told  Les Echos  in an interview.  Sorrell added that it would be better for the U.K. to
participate in decisions, the newspaper reported.  Cameron’s action resembles company management infighting
and amounts to a political struggle for power and control,
Sorrell also told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
