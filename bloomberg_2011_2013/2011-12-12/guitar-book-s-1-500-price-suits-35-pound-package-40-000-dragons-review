She’s a beauty, with an hourglass
figure and just a few years over 300.  The honey-hued guitar, which Antonio Stradivari made in
1700 on a break from violins, is the first of 150 exceptional
strummables featured in “ The Guitar Collection ,” an unusual
piece of work itself.  It’s 23” wide by 11.25” tall and weighs 21 pounds. As a
guitar-loving colleague noted while gawking, this is a coffee-
table book big enough to be one.  The 512 pages bear more than 670 images, and the multiple
photographs for each guitar include the kind of close-up look
you’d never get for many of these rare specimens without
steaming up a vitrine.  Add a heavy black leather hard case in which yet another,
normal-size book is secreted in a panel of the plush lining,
plus a print signed by one of the three photographers -- one
print for each of the three limited editions of 1,500. Finger-
picking good doesn’t cover it, but $1,500 will.  A group of experts chose the 150 instruments based on
historical, aesthetic and celebrity value. Then a lot of
negotiating followed to get access from private owners and
collections, according to Jenifer Gonzalez, marketing specialist
at the book’s publisher,  Epic Ink  of Bellevue,  Washington .  Breakthrough and beauty don’t always coexist. I’d vote
“Yes” on the National resonator, with its 1928 metal oddity. I
can manage a “Maybe” for the 1937 Rickenbacker featuring the
“Doc Kauffman-designed motorized vibrola tailpiece, which used
an electric motor, flywheel and solenoid assembly” to create
“Hawaiian-style vibrato effects.”  Pink Paisley  As for the pink paisley Telecaster that Fender made for
James Burton in 1969, he put it best himself: “Oh, my God, no.
This is not me.”  Walter Carter, a guitar historian and sales manager with
 Gruhn Guitars  of Nashville, wrote the main text for the big
book, putting flesh on some of the famous names.  For a circa 1834 Martin, Carter notes that Christian
Frederick Martin left  Germany  “to get away from a dispute
between the guild of violin makers and the guitar makers, who
belonged to the guild of cabinetmakers” and arrived in
 Manhattan  in 1833. Orville Gibson, he writes, worked as a shoe-
store clerk in Kalamazoo,  Michigan , in the 1890s before he
started making guitars.  The number of “played by” guitars will impress a range of
fans: Tampa Red, Jimmie Rodgers, Gene Autry,  Elvis Presley , Lead
Belly, Charlie Christian and many more. Here’s the 1928 Gibson
L-5 Maybelle Carter played for 50 years, and the 1939 Martin
000-42 Eric Clapton handled for the historic “ MTV Unplugged ”
in January 1992.  Beck’s Fender Esquire  The battered 1954 Fender Esquire with which  Jeff Beck 
played on Yardbirds hits “I’m a Man,” “Shapes of Things” and
“Heart Full of Soul” gets its due: “For the first time in pop
music, the guitar leads were just as important as the lead vocal
-- more important, many would argue,” writes Alan di Perna, one
of three writers for the smaller book’s excellent back stories.  Eye candy abounds. A gorgeous inlaid rose by Danny
Ferrington graces the 1955 Gibson J-200 played by Emmylou Harris. “Over the top” might describe the Paul Reed Smith
double-neck on which two dragons in inlaid mother-of-pearl,
abalone, fossilized mammoth ivory and various woods face each
other while their tails ascend the necks of the guitar. When it
was made as a limited edition item in 2005, it cost $40,000.  The book that gathers all these beauties costs a good deal
less, yet bears its own uniqueness, in terms of size and visual
access to such rarities, along with a hefty history of the
instrument. That’s a treat for any player who sighs at his
homely old six-string.  Take heart, though: Nothing in this lovely tome can match
the buzz of pulling out old homely after a hard day’s work and
hitting the matchless chord that opens “A Hard Day’s Night.”  “The Guitar Collection: An Elite Gathering of 150
Exceptional Guitars” is published by Epic Ink Books (512 pages,
$1,500; the first 10 numbered copies for each edition cost
$3,000 and number 11 to 100 cost $2,000). The book can be
ordered at  Amazon.com ,  John Varvatos  stores and
