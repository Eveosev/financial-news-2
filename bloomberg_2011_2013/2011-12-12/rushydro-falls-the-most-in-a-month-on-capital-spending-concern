OAO RusHydro (HYDRS) ,  Russia ’s largest
renewable energy producer, fell to a record low amid concern the
company’s capital spending plan is too ambitious given
government restrictions on electricity prices.  The company’s American depositary receipts sank 7.1 percent
to settle $3.16 in New York, the biggest drop since Nov. 1 and
the lowest closing price since the shares began trading in
September 2010. The stock is down 47 percent this year.  Investors expected the company would cut its 350 billion-
ruble ($11.1 billion) capital spending program for 2011 through
2013 in early December after the government pledged to keep
electricity prices in check next year, said Irina Filatova, an
analyst at Broker Credit Securities in Moscow.  “Investors are concerned that the company won’t do
anything to actually cut the planned investments, while the
government has pledged to keep electricity tariffs for
households unchanged through July 1, 2012, and restrict increase
in electricity prices on the country’s wholesale market,”
Filatova said.  Elena Vishnyakova, head of the press office at RusHydro’s
Moscow offices, said via telephone that no board meetings have
been scheduled at which capital spending plans may be modified.
The company is aware of investors’ calls to cut outlays, she
said.  The Russian government  owns  a 58 percent stake in RusHydro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
