Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , which is
41 percent owned by the British taxpayer, is issuing new bonds
with a face value of $3.2 billion as part of an exchange of
subordinated debt that will help it boost capital.  The lender is buying back $4.1 billion of so-called Tier 2
bonds in euros, pounds and U.S. and Canadian dollars callable in
2011 and 2012 at a discount of as much as 30 percent of face
value, London-based Lloyds said in a statement today. The new
Tier 2 notes will have optional redemption dates in 2016.  Regulators are pushing banks to increase their capital, or
ability to absorb losses, before taxpayers have to step in.
Lenders in the European Union must raise 114.7 billion euros in
fresh capital as part of measures to respond to the sovereign-
debt turmoil that is roiling euro region nations, the European
Banking Authority in  London  said on Dec. 9.  By exchanging Tier 2 notes, banks are disposing of bonds
that will begin to lose their value as capital notes from 2013
under new rules. Lloyds joins European lenders including BNP
Paribas SA and Banco Santander SA in exchanging capital
securities for new debt.  Banks divide  debt capital  into tiers, depending on the
ability of the bonds to absorb losses. The most junior is Tier
1, which includes equity and retained earnings, while Tier 2
includes more senior securities that are used if an institution
becomes insolvent.  Lloyds plans to make an announcement about Australian
dollar-denominated notes tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
