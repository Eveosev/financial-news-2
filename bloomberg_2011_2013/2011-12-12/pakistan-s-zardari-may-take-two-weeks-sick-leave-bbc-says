Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari may need another two weeks of rest in Dubai before he
returns home after receiving treatment for a heart condition,
 BBC Television  reported, citing an  interview  with Prime Minister
 Yousuf Raza Gilani .  Gilani also said the government may continue to block NATO
war supplies to land-locked Afghanistan as the U.S. and Pakistan
negotiate new terms of engagement after an airstrike last month
killed 24 of Pakistani troops along the border with Afghanistan,
the BBC said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
