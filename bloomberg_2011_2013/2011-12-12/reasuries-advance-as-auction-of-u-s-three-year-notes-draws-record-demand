Treasuries  rose as concern that
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is far from a resolution pushed
demand to a record high at an auction of $32 billion of U.S.
three-year notes.  Longer-term  U.S. debt  gained earlier following two weeks of
declines as investors sought refuge after Moody’s Investors
Service said it will review ratings for all European Union
countries because a summit last week failed to produce
“decisive” measures to end the two-year-old crisis. Stocks
dropped after a two-week rally.  “They have no place else to invest their money, with the
uncertainty of the stock market and with what’s going on in
Europe,” said  Michael Franzese , managing director and head of
Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  New York .  Yields on U.S. 30-year bonds slid six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.05 percent at 5:09 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
securities due in November 2041 rose 1 3/32, or $10.94 per
$1,000 face amount, to 101 14/32. The yields climbed eight basis
points last week and 11 basis points the week before that.  The yield on the current  three-year note  slipped two basis
points to 0.34 percent.  Ten-year note  yields declined five basis
points to 2.01 percent, compared with the record low of 1.67
percent reached Sept. 23.  Debt Auctions  The Treasury is selling $78 billion in notes, bonds and
inflation-indexed debt this week, and will announce on Dec. 15
how much it will auction next week in three note offerings. It’s
due to auction $21 billion of 10-year securities tomorrow, $13
billion in 30-year bonds on Dec. 14 and $12 billion of five-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on Dec. 15.  At today’s auction, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of notes offered,
was 3.62, the highest since at least 1993, when the government
began releasing the data. It compared with an average of 3.24
for the past 10 sales.  The three-year securities drew a  yield  of 0.352 percent,
versus a forecast of 0.359 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers, which are
obliged to bid at U.S. debt sales. The record low at an auction
of the maturities was 0.334 percent, reached in September.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 39.1 percent of the notes, compared with
an average of 35.9 percent for the past 10 sales. Direct
bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, purchased 7 percent, versus an
average of 12.2 percent at the past 10 auctions.  ‘Great Start’  “It’s an excellent and great start to the auctions for
this week and next,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New
York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., a primary dealer.
“Money seems to be flowing from Europe, out of equities and
into Treasuries.”  The Fed purchased $1.38 billion today in TIPS maturing from
January 2019 to February 2041 as part of its $400 billion
‘Operation Twist’ program to replace shorter maturities with
longer-term debt. The plan, announced in September, is an effort
to cap borrowing costs. The  Federal Open Market Committee  holds
its December policy meeting tomorrow.  Volatility in the Treasury market has increased this month.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which measures price
swings in Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter options
maturing in two to 30 years, rose on Dec. 9 to 100 basis points,
the highest level since Dec. 1. The average for 2011 is 94 basis
points. The gauge reached a high of 117.8 basis points Aug. 8,
three days after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating.  Italian, Spanish Bonds  Treasuries gained earlier as Italian and Spanish sovereign
bonds led declines among higher-yielding European sovereign
government debt.  The EU summit on the region’s debt crisis last week offered
few new measures and doesn’t diminish the risk of credit-ranking
revisions, Moody’s said.  “In the absence of any decisive policy initiatives that
stabilize credit market conditions effectively, our intention a
announced in November is to revisit the level and dispersion of
ratings during the first quarter of 2012,” Moody’s said in its
Weekly Credit Outlook.  Fitch Ratings  said today, without taking any action, that
the summit did little to ease pressure on Europe’s sovereign
bond ratings.  ‘No Real Decisiveness’  “There’s concern that there was no real decisiveness about
Europe over the weekend,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based
brokerage for institutional investors. “That’s caused selling
in peripheral debt, and it’s leading to buying in Treasuries.”  Italian 10-year note  yields climbed as much as 43 basis
points today to 6.79 percent, the highest level since Dec. 1,
before paring losses to 6.56 percent, up 20 basis points, as the
ECB was said to buy the nation’s securities. Spanish 10-year
yields rose as much as 32 basis points to 6.07 percent, also the
highest level since Dec. 1, before slipping to 5.79 percent.  The S&P 500 Index of stocks dropped 1.5 percent.  Today’s Treasury auction raised $3.2 billion in fresh cash,
as more than $28.8 billion of maturing three-year securities are
held by the public and the Fed, including $24.4 billion by the
public and $4.4 billion by the central bank, according to
Treasury data.  Three-year notes have returned 3.4 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 8.9 percent for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
