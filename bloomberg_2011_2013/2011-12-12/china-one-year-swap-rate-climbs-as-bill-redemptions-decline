China ’s interest-rate swap rate
climbed on speculation declining bill redemptions will curb
 money supply  this week.  China will maintain a “prudent” monetary policy and a
“proactive” fiscal policy next year, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported on Dec. 9, citing a meeting of the Communist
Party’s Politburo chaired by President Hu Jintao. A total of 13
billion yuan ($2 billion) of central bank bills and repurchase
contracts will mature this week, down from 35 billion yuan last
week, according to China Merchants Bank Co.  “Given such a small amount of redemptions, it is possible
the central bank may conduct the second week of net liquidity
withdrawals,” said Pin Ru Tan, a strategist at HSBC Holdings
Plc in  Hong Kong .  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose five basis
points to 2.81 percent as of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumer prices  climbed 4.2 percent in November, the least
in 14 months, the statistics bureau said on Dec. 9. Inflation
was at 5.5 percent in October.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained one basis point to 3.54 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The yield on the 2.77 percent government bond due May 2012
was unchanged at 2.59 percent, according to quotes provided by
the Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
