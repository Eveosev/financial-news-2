Ethanol futures slipped for a second
day in  Chicago  amid uncertainty regarding  Europe ’s credit rating
and as corn dipped.  Futures declined after Moody’s Investors Service said it
will review the credit ratings of all European Union countries
and as corn slid for a second day. The grain is used to make the
fuel in the U.S.  “Ethanol prices took a cue from its feedstock and ended
the day nearly unchanged also on thinner than usual volume,”
SCB & Associates LLC wrote in a report to clients today.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 0.1 cent to
$2.114 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price
since Dec. 10, 2010. Futures have fallen 11 percent this year,
heading for the first yearly decline since 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  plunged 13
cents, or 5.1 percent, to $2.42 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive dropped 10 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $2.45,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slid 7.5 cents, or 3 percent, to
$2.45 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel decreased 2.5 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.30.  Corn for March delivery slumped 0.25 cent to $5.94 a bushel
in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
