Lithuanian Transport Minister
Eligijus Masiulis, the head of the ruling coalition’s junior
partner, said the government should test its mandate in the
parliament in a confidence vote.  The government should ask for a confidence vote after
parliament decided to look for alternatives to the government’s
proposed 2012 budget plan that was approved unanimously by the
Cabinet, Masiulis, who leads the Lithuanian Liberal Movement,
said at a news conference in Vilnius today.  The Baltic nation’s government submitted a revised 2012
budget plan with additional cuts to parliament last week after
the  Finance Ministry  revised down its economic growth forecast
to 2.5 percent from 4.7 percent next year. Members of parliament
of the ruling coalition are initiating alternative proposals
such as taxes on luxury assets to the government’s plan to slow
pension increases.  The parliament must agree to a budget plan with a deficit
of 3 percent of  gross domestic product  next year, Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius said in a press conference today. Kubilius’s
Cabinet will make “its conclusions” if parliament fails to
approve a deficit within the government’s target, signaling he
may consider resigning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
