     Dec. 12 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  advancing for the first time in three
trading sessions, after European leaders expanded a bailout fund
and tightened anti-deficit rules, boosting investor confidence
the region will escape a deeper crisis.  Sony Corp. , which depends on  Europe  for 21 percent of its
sales, rose 1.3 percent.  Olympus Corp.  gained 7.8 percent after
saying it won’t miss a deadline for reporting earnings that
would have forced the scandal-hit company to be delisted.  Mitsui
O.S.K. Lines Ltd.  led gains among shipping lines after cargo
rates for large vessels rose to a high for the year.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.4 percent to 8,653.82 as of the 3 p.m.
trading close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained 1.2
percent to 746.69, with all but one of the 33 industry groups on
the gauge advancing.  Stocks (TPX)  also rose on speculation  China  will
ease monetary policy to boost economic growth.  “Investors were pessimistic before the European summit but
it looks like policy makers have made progress toward averting a
crisis,” said Tamiji Shinada, executive director of investment
and research and investor services department at Nomura
Securities Co. “Still, it wasn’t enough to put people’s fears
to rest.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.2 percent
today. The index rose 1.7 percent in  New York  on Dec. 9 after
European leaders in Brussels tightened anti-deficit rules and
agreed to boost their rescue fund by as much as 200 billion
euros ($267 billion) by funneling money to the  International
Monetary Fund .  U.S. Confidence  Stocks also gained as confidence improved among consumers
in the U.S., the world’s biggest economy. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment rose to a six-month high of 67.7 in December from 64.1
in November, beating estimates.  Japan ’s exporters advanced, with makers of electronics
contributing the most to the Topix’s advance. Sony rose 1.3
percent to 1,423 yen. Gamemaker Nintendo Co. climbed 1.9 percent
to 11,070 yen.  Olympus rose 7.8 percent to 1,300 yen after the company
said today it plans to release its second-quarter earnings by
Dec. 14. Tokyo Stock Exchange rules require the company to be
delisted if it misses the deadline.  The volume of shares traded on the Nikkei 225 was 17
percent below the 10-day average before a policy announcement by
the U.S. Federal Reserve on Dec. 13.  Shippers Gain  Shipping lines advanced the most among the 33 Topix
industry groups after cargo rates for the largest ships that
haul dry-bulk raw materials rose to $32,617 a day, this year’s
high, according to the  Baltic Exchange .  Mitsui O.S.K., Japan’s second-biggest shipping line by
sales, gained 6.4 percent to 299 yen after Credit Suisse AG kept
its “overweight” rating on Japan’s shippers, citing China’s
demand for ore.  Nippon Yusen K.K. , ranked No. 1, added 4.3
percent to 195 yen.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. , No. 3, advanced
3.6 percent to 144 yen.  The Topix index dropped about 17 percent this year amid
concern Europe’s debt crisis will drag the region and the global
economy into recession. The price of shares on the index is
valued at 0.9 times book value, near the lowest since March 2009.  In China, customs data released Dec. 10 showed the weakest
export growth since 2009. Overseas shipments rose 13.8 percent
last month from a year earlier, while the excess of exports over
imports fell by 35 percent.  ‘Clearing The Way’  A smaller  trade surplus  and signs that capital has started
to flow out of the country may encourage the ruling Communist
Party to add to a Nov. 30 cut in bank reserve requirements,
first such move since 2008, according to Shen Jianguang, a Hong
Kong-based economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  “If the data is slowing down, that’s what’s required in
China and clears the way for further policy easing in months
ahead,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “I think it’s positive, but there’s
always uncertainty in the short-term.”  Komatsu Ltd. , a maker of construction machinery that counts
China as its biggest market, added 0.9 percent to 1,999 yen.
 Hitachi Construction Machinery Co , which gets more than a
quarter of its sales in China, gained 2.4 percent 1,407 yen.  Among companies that fell,  Toyota Motor Corp.  dropped 0.7
percent to 2,617 yen. Toyota last week forecast profit will fall
56 percent in the year through March after Japan’s record
earthquake and  Thailand ’s floods hurt production. Nomura
Holdings Inc. boosted its investment rating on Toyota to “buy”
from “neutral,” saying the company is more likely to see a V-
shaped recovery in earnings in the year starting April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
