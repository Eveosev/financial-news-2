U.S. stocks fell, after a two-week
rally, as Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings said last
week’s summit did little to ease pressure on Europe’s struggling
governments and  Intel Corp. (INTC)  cut its revenue forecast.  Financial shares had the biggest decline among 10 groups
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as Morgan Stanley and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  sank more than 5.3 percent. Intel dropped 4
percent as the world’s largest chipmaker said a shortage of
hard-disk drives was causing computer makers to reduce orders of
other parts. Alpha Natural Resources Inc. tumbled 8.8 percent,
while  Halliburton Co. (HAL) ,  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) 
decreased more than 2.4 percent as commodities slumped.  The  S&P 500  declined 1.5 percent to 1,236.47 at 4 p.m. New
York time, after rising 8.3 percent over the previous two weeks.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 162.87 points, or 1.3
percent, to 12,021.39. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, or 19 percent below the three-month average.  “This is not heaven,” Stanley Nabi, New York-based vice
chairman of Silvercrest Asset Management Group, which oversees
$10.5 billion, said in a telephone interview. “The European
stopgap may not be successfully implemented. In order for this
program to be successful, there’s going to have to be a lot of
belt tightening. That means that the European economy is not
going to do well at all. That would have negative impact on
other countries around the globe.”  Stocks rose last week as European leaders agreed to boost a
rescue fund and reports spurred optimism about the  U.S. economy .
Today, equities joined a  global slump  as Moody’s said that last
week’s EU summit failed to produce “decisive policy measures.”
Fitch said a comprehensive solution has not yet been offered and
predicted a “significant economic downturn” in the region.  ‘Easily Justifiable’  “Did the European summit do enough to stave off these
downgrades or not?” Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at
Fort Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati, which
oversees more than $39 billion, said in a telephone interview.
“Most people come to the conclusion that downgrades on the
region’s sovereigns are easily justifiable. If the rest of the
world is slowing down, we too would feel some of that impact.”  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 today fell as financial,
commodity, industrial and technology gauges slid at least 1.5
percent. The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index slumped 1.9 percent
amid concern about a global economic slowdown.  The KBW Bank Index declined 2.5 percent as 23 of its 24
stocks fell. A gauge of European lenders in the benchmark  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index  declined 3.9 percent. Morgan Stanley slid 6.1
percent to $15.38. Citigroup decreased 5.4 percent to $27.22.
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  lost 4.7 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$5.45.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  erased 3.4 percent to $32.04.  Intel Tumbles  Intel tumbled 4 percent, the biggest decline since Aug. 18,
to $24. While PC sales will rise in the fourth quarter from the
previous three months, customers are cutting back on their
stockpiles of parts because they expect hard-disk shortages to
reduce output, Intel said. Those shortages, resulting from the
worst flooding in Thailand in 70 years, will continue into the
first quarter, it said.  Energy and raw material shares slumped as commodities
retreated amid concern about slower global demand and as the
U.S. dollar rose. The  Market Vectors-Coal ETF (KOL) , an exchange-
traded fund, tumbled 4.2 percent.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , a coal producer, sank 8.8
percent to $21.39. Halliburton, an oilfield services provider,
fell 4.5 percent to $32.56. Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, sank 3 percent to $9.35. Newmont Mining, the largest
U.S. gold producer, slid 2.5 percent to $65.27.  Salesforce, Pfizer, Boeing  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  tumbled 6.3 percent to $116.07. The
largest maker of online customer-management software was cut to
“underperform” from “neutral” at Cowen and Company LLC.  Two of the world’s biggest companies fell even after
boosting their dividends.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the largest drugmaker,
authorized a new share buyback program for as much as $10
billion and said the quarterly dividend was increased to 22
cents a share from 20 cents.  Boeing Co. (BA)  raised its quarterly
dividend 4.8 percent to 44 cents a share, the first increase
since 2008 at the world’s largest aerospace company. A Bloomberg
projection called for a new total of 45 cents.  Pfizer dropped 0.8 percent to $20.39. Boeing retreated 1.4
percent to $70.90.  Thomas Lee , chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan,
estimated the  S&P 500 (SPX)  will rally to 1,430 next year and
recommended financial stocks. Lee’s forecast is 14 percent
higher than the last closing level on Dec. 9. He estimated
combined profit by companies in the benchmark equity gauge will
be $105 a share in 2012 and $110 in 2013.  ‘Murky’  “The consensus view is that visibility remains murky and
with significant tail risks” such as Europe’s debt crisis and
fiscal tightening in  China , Lee said. “2012 may look a bit like
2009,” he wrote. “Emergence from a financial crisis and the
potential for acceleration of the business cycle driven by
Europe exiting a recession and China easing” may boost cyclical
stocks. Financials, which may be helped by Republican gains in
the U.S. election, are his “top pick,” he said.  Financials have plunged 21 percent in 2011, the most of the
 10 groups in the S&P 500 (SPXL1) , as investors fled banks and insurers
on concern Europe’s debt crisis will spread. Raw-material and
industrial shares had the next biggest declines, falling 13
percent and 5 percent, respectively.  From the S&P 500’s bear-market bottom on March 9, 2009,
through the end of that year, financials surged 131 percent,
while consumer discretionary, industrial and raw-material
companies jumped at least 83 percent.  Federal Reserve   Unemployment at the lowest level in more than two years and
manufacturing running at the  fastest pace  in five months may
dissuade Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and fellow
central bankers from pursuing a third-round of large scale asset
purchases. The  Federal Open Market Committee  will issue a
statement after its meeting tomorrow with any updated outlook.  Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC)  surged 15 percent, the biggest gain in
the S&P 500, to $38.70. Martin Marietta Materials Inc. is
seeking a hostile takeover of Vulcan in an all-stock transaction
valued at $4.7 billion that would create the world’s largest
aggregates supplier.  Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW)  added 1 percent to $8.05. The
company, which has been the subject of at least 20 takeover
rumors in the past five years, may finally be cheap enough to
lure a private equity buyer, according to a Bloomberg News
report.  The world’s largest online-recruiting company has plunged
66 percent this year, the most in the S&P 500, as American
businesses remained reluctant to hire. New York-based Monster is
now trading at a 7 percent discount to sales, cheaper than 90
percent of U.S. Internet software and services companies,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s also generating
twice as much cash relative to its share price as the industry
median, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
