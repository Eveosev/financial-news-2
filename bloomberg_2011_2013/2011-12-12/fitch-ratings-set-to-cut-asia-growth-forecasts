Fitch Ratings  is poised to cut
growth estimates for Asian nations as Europe’s debt crisis
weighs on the outlook for the world economy.  Quarterly predictions due to be released by the company
“shortly” will see growth downgraded for Asian countries,
 Andrew Colquhoun , the company’s Hong Kong-based head of 
Asia-Pacific Sovereigns, said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television today.  China’s economy, the biggest in Asia, is cooling as demand
for exports weakens and the government prolongs a crackdown on
property speculation. Growth in overseas shipments in November
was the weakest since 2009, excluding seasonal distortions, and
the trade surplus shrank from a year earlier, customs data
showed on Dec. 10.  Colquhoun didn’t give any specific estimates for growth.  Asian stocks advanced today, snapping a two-day losing
streak on the region’s benchmark index, after U.S. consumer
confidence topped estimates and European leaders agreed tighter
budget rules and to add 200 billion euros ($267 billion) to the
euro crisis war chest.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 1 percent as of 10:03
a.m. in Tokyo. The gauge dropped 2.2 percent last week after
 Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut credit ratings for Germany,
France and 13 other euro-area countries amid a deepening debt
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
