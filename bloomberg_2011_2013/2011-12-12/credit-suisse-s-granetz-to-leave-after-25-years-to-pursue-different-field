Marc Granetz, chairman of  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s  investment-banking  department, is leaving
after 25 years to try a role in a different field.  Granetz, 55, “has informed me of his decision to leave the
bank to pursue an opportunity outside investment banking,” Eric Varvel, who runs Credit Suisse’s investment bank, said in a memo
distributed to employees today and obtained by Bloomberg News.
“He will leave a lasting impression on our investment banking
business globally, in particular our M&A franchise.”  Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank by assets,
named Granetz chairman at the end of 2009 after he served five
years as co-head of the investment-banking department, which
handles merger advice and securities underwriting. His latest
job at the Zurich-based company was to develop relationships
with clients, advising them on complex takeovers and helping
with the firm’s strategy.  Earlier in his career, Granetz’s roles included overseeing
global mergers and acquisitions, running media and
telecommunications banking and managing the team that advised
oil and gas companies.  Granetz didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail
messages seeking comment. Jack Grone, a spokesman for the firm
in  New York , confirmed the memo’s contents and declined further
comment.  The New York Times reported Granetz’s departure on its
website earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
