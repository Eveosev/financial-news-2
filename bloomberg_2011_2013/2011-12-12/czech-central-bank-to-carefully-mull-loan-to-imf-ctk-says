The Czech central bank will
“carefully consider” whether to provide part of its foreign
exchange reserves for a mechanism planned to tackle the euro
area’s crisis, CTK newswire reported, citing the bank’s Governor
Miroslav Singer.  Deciding on whether to provide about 3.5 billion euros
($4.64 billion) in a loan to the International Monetary Fund as
part of a deal agreed by European leaders last week won’t be
easy, CTK quoted Singer as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
