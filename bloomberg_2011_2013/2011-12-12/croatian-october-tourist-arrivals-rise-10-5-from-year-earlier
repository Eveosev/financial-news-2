Croatian tourist arrivals rose 10.5
percent in October from a year ago, the Zagreb-based  statistics
office  said today on its website.  A total of 501,834 visitors arrived in the period as fair
weather extended the tourist season, the office said.  Tourism accounts for about 20 percent of gross domestic
product in the Adriatic Sea nation and brings in revenue that is
vital for the government as it tries to narrow the budget gap,
forecast at 6.2 percent of gross domestic product, this year.  “Mild October weather has boosted tourist arrivals,”
Zdeslav Santic, the chief analyst at  Societe Generale - Splitska
Banka d.d. , said by phone before the data release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
