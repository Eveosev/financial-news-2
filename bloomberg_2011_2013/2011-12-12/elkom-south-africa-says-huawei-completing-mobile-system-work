Telkom South Africa Ltd. (TKG)  said Huawei
Technologies Co. is completing work for its mobile-phone unit,
denying a  Business Day  report that  Africa ’s largest provider of
fixed-line services wants to replace the supplier.  Huawei Technologies has built 1,560 base stations to date
for Telkom’s new 8ta mobile division and is busy setting up
others according to the original agreement, Pynee Chetty, a
spokesman at Pretoria-based Telkom, said in an e-mailed response
to questions.  Business Day reported today, citing an unidentified person
in the industry, that Telkom is planning to issue a new tender
to build a network for 8ta after Shenzhen, China-based Huawei
Technologies failed to meet deadlines.  “This is certainly not the case,” as Telkom had been
planning to seek a second equipment vendor to expand the network
only after seeing how demand develops and analyzing how the
technologies can be integrated, Chetty said.  “The formal sourcing process has been started, with the
generation of requisite documentation and specifications having
been completed” for the additional supplier, Chetty said.  Telkom is withholding 800 million rand ($97 million) in
payments due to Huawei Technologies, Johannesburg-based Business
Day reported. Telkom pays its contractors only after assets have
been handed over, Chetty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
