MarkWest Energy Partners LP (MWE)  agreed
to buy the 49 percent of MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources
LLC that it doesn’t own from The Energy & Minerals Group for
approximately $1.8 billion in cash and units.  The price includes $1 billion in cash, according to a
statement today. The 19.95 million new Class B units MarkWest
will issue to Energy & Minerals are worth $750 million to $850
million, MarkWest Chief Executive Officer Frank Semple said on a
conference call. They will be convertible into common units
starting in July 2013.  The Liberty joint venture “has made significant capital
investments” in infrastructure for petroleum liquids in the
Marcellus shale formation, Semple said in the statement.  MarkWest and Energy & Minerals, a private-equity group
based in Houston, plan to create a Utica Shale joint venture to
develop natural-gas processing, transportation and marketing
infrastructure in eastern Ohio beginning next year, with Energy
& Minerals funding most of the initial expenditures, according
to the statement.  MarkWest, based in Denver, increased its 2012 distributable
 cash flow  forecast to a range of $480 million to $540 million
today, after saying in November the number would be $380 million
to $440 million. The partnership expects  capital spending  next
year to be in a range of $900 million to $1.3 billion.  MarkWest said it expects the transaction to boost its fee-
based net operating margin by as much as 6 percent a year.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  is the financial adviser to MarkWest on the
planned transaction. Citigroup Inc. provided financial advice to
Energy & Minerals.  MarkWest units fell 3.4 percent to $54.20 after the close
of trading in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
