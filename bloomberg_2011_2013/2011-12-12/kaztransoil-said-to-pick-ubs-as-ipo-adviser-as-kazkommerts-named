Kazkommerts Securities, a unit of
Kazkommertsbank,  Kazakhstan ’s largest lender by assets, was
picked to advise JSC KazTransOil on its planned share sale next
year, the state-owned pipeline operator said.  KazTransOil is also selecting a foreign consultant for the
initial public offering after choosing Kazkommerts Securities,
Asem Nusupova, KazTransOil’s managing director for economics and
finance, said in a phone interview today. She declined to name
the foreign firm considered for an advisory role.  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, may be hired as an
adviser, a person familiar with the matter said, declining to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  Kazakhstan plans a divestment program, offering shares in
assets owned by the National Wellbeing Fund  Samruk-Kazyna  to
citizens through so-called people’s IPOs. Kaztransoil and
Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Co. are the “closest to
being ready” for sale, Economic Development and Trade Minister
 Kairat Kelimbetov  said in August, adding that the government
will offer holdings of 5 percent to 15 percent of shares in
companies.  Kaztransoil, which operates about 5,495 kilometers (3,415
miles) of oil pipelines, increased crude shipments to 49.3
million metric tons in the first 11 months of the year, a 3
percent rise from a year earlier, according to the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
