Yandex NV , operator of  Russia ’s most
popular Internet search engine, fell to a two-month low in U.S.
trading after the company’s market share declined.  Yandex dropped 5.6 percent to close at $18.83 in  New York ,
the lowest closing price since Oct. 4.  Liveintenet.ru , an Internet-service provider and
researcher, reported today that Yandex’s share of the Russian
search market declined to 60.7 percent in the week through Dec.
11, from 60.9 percent the previous week, Zoltan Palfi, a London-
based analyst at Credit Suisse, said by e-mail.  “We remain skeptical that Yandex’s market share will turn
around,” Palfi, who rates the stock “underperform,” said via
e-mail. “The bulk of the growth in search queries will come
from mobile devices -- smart phones and tablets -- where Google
is the dominant search provider with over a 60 percent market
share.”  David Ferguson and Anastasia Demidova, Moscow-based
analysts for  Renaissance Capital , reiterated their “sell”
recommendation on the stock today after Liveinternet.ru released
the data. Ferguson and Demidova said in an e-mailed report that
they prefer  Mail.ru (MAIL)  stock over Yandex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
