Coffee shipments from  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of the robusta variety, may climb to
about 2.5 million bags, or 150,000 metric tons, this month, Sao
Paulo-based Archer Consulting said yesterday in an e-mailed
report.  The Southeast Asian nation exported 70,745 tons last month,
according to a report today on website of the country’s General
Customs office. Robusta beans, used in instant coffee and
espresso, are harvested mainly in  Asia  and parts of Africa.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
