The ruble dropped for an eighth day,
the longest losing streak January 2009, after protests across
Russia against Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s government and a
warning from Moody’s Investors Service that it will review
European countries’ credit ratings.  The Russian currency lost 0.4 percent to 31.5841 per dollar
at the close in Moscow. The ruble was 0.5 percent stronger at
41.7904 per euro, leaving it little changed at 36.1769 against
the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  As many as 25,000 people gathered in central Moscow Dec.
10, police said, to protest the alleged electorial fraud in the
parliamentary elections of Dec. 4. Last week’s European Union
summit offered few new measures and doesn’t diminish the risk of
credit-ranking revisions, Moody’s said today. The EU is Russia’s
largest trading partner.  The protests “are compounding concerns over weaker oil and
slower global growth,” Johannesburg, South Africa-based
Tradition Analytics wrote in an e-mail. “They will result in
increased political uncertainty being priced into the ruble.”  Russia ’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020 fell for the first
day in four, pushing the yield up eight basis points to 4.622
percent. The yield on ruble debt due 2021 was one basis point
higher at 8.56 percent, while the country’s ruble Eurobond due
in 2018 yielded 21 basis points more at 7.435 percent, the
biggest jump since Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
