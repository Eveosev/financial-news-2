Russian political risk sparked by
ballot-rigging allegations in parliamentary elections may remain
“repellent” for stocks for months to come, even after
nationwide protests ended peacefully,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said.  “Large-scale political protests have taken their toll on
the market, with Russia massively underperforming global
emerging market peers in the past week,” said Alex Kantarovich,
a strategist at JPMorgan in Moscow, in an e-mailed note today.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  said yesterday he ordered an
investigation into allegations of electoral fraud in the Dec. 4
elections to parliament, which was won by the dominant United
Russia party that he and Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  promoted.
About 25,000 people gathered in near-freezing weather in central
Moscow the day before to protest the results of elections, with
tens of thousands more doing the same in  St. Petersburg  and
other major cities, according to police.  The  Micex Index  rallied today, rising 1.5 percent, the most
this month, to 1,416.49 at 12:49 p.m., after nationwide protests
Dec. 10 concluded peacefully. That measure tumbled 7.3 percent
last week, the most in almost three months, as earlier protests
led to the detention of hundreds of activists.  The protests will probably continue sporadically into the 
first quarter of 2012, yet fail to broaden, JPMorgan said.  The most likely scenario is that Putin’s plan to return to
the Kremlin in the March vote for president will go according to
plan and stocks will “experience a drag until then,”
Kantarovich said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
