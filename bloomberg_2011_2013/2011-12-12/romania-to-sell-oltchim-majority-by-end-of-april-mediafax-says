Romania plans to sell a majority
stake in  Oltchim SA (OLT) , a chemical company, by the end of April
2012 as pledged to the International Monetary Fund,  Mediafax 
reported, citing a government document that isn’t yet public.  The government needs to select an investment bank to manage
the sale by mid-February, according to Mediafax.  The IMF blocked Oltchim’s planned acquisition of the
Arpechim refinery from  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  before the privatization,
the Bucharest-based news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
