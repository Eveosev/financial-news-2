Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest
maker of wireless equipment, said it will name a new chief
technology officer early next year to replace Haakan Eriksson,
who is moving to run Australian and New Zealand operations.  “The process is ongoing and we expect it to be closed
before Feb. 1,” when Eriksson takes his new post, Ola Rembe, a
spokesman at the Stockholm-based manufacturer, said in an
interview. He declined to comment further on the announcement.  Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg aims to get more
revenue from the company’s 27,000 patents built up during
Eriksson’s period as technology chief. Eriksson became CTO in
2003 and added the job of president of Ericsson Silicon Valley
in 2009 to succeed Bert Nordberg, who became CEO of the
company’s  Sony Ericsson  joint venture.  “I have had a desire to move into a more commercial role
and for personal reasons to come closer to  Australia ,”
Eriksson, whose wife is from that country, said in today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
