Slough, the town near  London ’s
Heathrow Airport that was the setting for the original version
of “The Office” TV program, is looking for a company to help
pay for a 1 billion-pound ($1.6 billion) regeneration plan.  Slough Borough Council  will provide a joint-venture partner
with land and other assets amounting to 50 percent of the
project’s costs, according to  documents  posted on the
government’s procurement website. The local government wants the
partner to use the land to build houses, offices, shops, leisure
facilities, hotels, a school, libraries and parks over 15 years.  “Other approaches to financing and sharing returns from
the developments and services” will be discussed with bidders,
the council said in the documents.  Some refurbishment of existing buildings may also be
carried out by the joint venture, which may be extended by an
additional 10 years. Slough is about 8 miles (13 kilometers)
west of Heathrow.  “The Office,” a British comedy with Ricky Gervais in the
lead role, was remade for U.S. audiences with  Steve Carell  as
the main character. That version was set in Scranton,
 Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporters on this story:
