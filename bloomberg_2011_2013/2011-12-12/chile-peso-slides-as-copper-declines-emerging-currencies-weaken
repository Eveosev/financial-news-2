Chile ’s peso weakened the most in
two weeks amid a sell-off in emerging-market currencies as
disappointment spread following last week’s European Union
summit and the price of copper fell.  The peso declined 0.9 percent to 514.54 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close of trading in Santiago, from 509.95 on Dec. 9. The
Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index  slid  1.4
percent.  Copper, which makes up more than half of Chile’s exports,
declined as much as 3.4 percent to $3.435 per pound on
speculation demand from  China  may weaken. All but three of 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg declined today
and stocks sank after Moody’s Investors Service said it will
review the ratings of all EU countries in the first three months
of next year.  “The market has realized that nothing really happened, and
the disappointing summit prompted Moody’s to say that the
measures don’t lessen the risk of downgrades,” said Katia Diaz,
an economist at 4Cast Inc. in  New York . “Copper’s down on
speculation of lower demand from China, so that’s adding to
weakening pressure on the peso. We expect the focus to remain on
 Europe .”  The peso may weaken as far as 520 per dollar after passing
the 515 per dollar level, Diaz said.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased their bets against the currency to $5 billion on Dec.
7 from $4.6 billion on Dec. 6, according to central bank data
published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
