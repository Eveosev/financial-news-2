Italian police today discovered
bullets in letters sent to Justice Minister Paola Severino and
 Rome ’s Mayor Gianni Alemanno.  “The letters sent to me and Severino were signed by
different organizations, which makes me think that they are
unrelated,” Alemanno said in comments broadcast on Sky TG24
television.  A tax-collection official in Rome was wounded by a letter
bomb on Dec. 9. The day before, an Italian anarchist group said
it had targeted  Deutsche Bank AG  Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  with a similar device.  Police investigating the letters found today are not
looking into links with last week’s attacks,  Corriere della Sera 
reported on its website, citing law-enforcement sources.  The government led by Prime Minister  Mario Monti  earlier
this month approved 30 billion euros ($40 billion) in emergency
measures aimed at reducing the country’s debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
