Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, told regulators that 413 employees may be dismissed
in  New York City  as the firm starts 4,500 job cuts announced
last week.  Most of more than 270 reductions may be within the Global
Markets division at 388 Greenwich St., according to a filing by
the New York-based lender  with  the state’s Department of Labor.
About 29 people may be affected at 111 Wall St., the filing
shows.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-biggest Swiss bank,
also announced additional New York job cuts today.  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  who
announced the cuts during a Dec. 6 presentation, aims to trim
costs amid slumping revenue and what he called “unprecedented”
market conditions. The lender will take a pretax charge of about
$400 million this quarter tied to the reductions. The New York
cuts are part of the planned 4,500, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.  More than 100 reductions may come at Citibank N.A., the
unit that accepts deposits, according to the filing. The company
also will dismiss more than 30 employees of Citigroup Technology
Inc., which handles the firm’s technology infrastructure.  Pandit, 54, may pare about 900 jobs from the securities and
banking division, which includes trading and investment banking,
a person familiar with the matter said last month. The firm is
cutting about 95 jobs in its markets business in  London , two
other people with knowledge of the plan said last week.  Financial firms globally have announced more than 200,000
job cuts this year, up from about 58,000 last year and 174,000
in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ZeroHedge.com
reported the Citigroup filing earlier today.  Credit Suisse said it may cut 49 additional jobs at offices
on Madison Avenue by March 2012, according to a filing today by
the Zurich-based bank. The firm also submitted documents Nov. 15
disclosing its plan to eliminate 268 jobs at that site. The bank
announced 2,000 staff reductions in July and 1,500 in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
