Haitong Securities Co. (600837)  will try to
set a price today for a $1.7 billion share sale in  Hong Kong 
after failing to complete the offering last week, said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Haitong Securities,  China ’s third-biggest brokerage by
market value, delayed price-setting negotiations on Dec. 9 after
the Shanghai-listed company resisted selling stock at the low
end of a marketed range, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the process is private. Haitong Securities
may raise $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion through the offering.  The company’s struggles to woo investors reflect stock
market volatility that forced  Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. 
and New China Life Insurance Co. to sell a combined $3.3 billion
of first-time shares in Hong Kong at or near the low end of
price ranges last week. The city’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 2.7
percent on Dec. 9, the biggest drop in a month.  Haitong Securities, based in Shanghai, has until Dec. 13 to
set a price or the share sale  “will lapse,”  according to the
offering prospectus. The company is offering 1.23 billion shares
at HK$9.38 ($1.21) to HK$10.58 each and plans to start trading
in Hong Kong on Dec. 15, the document shows.  Shares in Haitong Securities fell 1.6 percent to 8.18 yuan
($1.29) at 10:08 a.m. in Shanghai today, giving the brokerage a
market value of 67.3 billion yuan.  Haitong Securities’s Hong Kong investment banking unit,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG
and Citigroup Inc. are managing the offering. Officials at the
company’s  Shanghai  headquarters weren’t immediately available to
comment on the share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
