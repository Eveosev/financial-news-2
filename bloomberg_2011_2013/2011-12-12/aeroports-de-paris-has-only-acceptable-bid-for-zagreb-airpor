Aeroports de Paris submitted the
only acceptable final offer to build a new terminal at  Croatia ’s
main international  airport in Zagreb  and lease the facilities
for 30 years.  A second bid by Strabag AG and Flughafen Zurich AG was
“put aside” by the  Transportation Ministry  because it was
incomplete, said ministry official Krunoslav Sams today in
Zagreb. The winner will have the right to operate the existing
terminal while a new facility is being built within a three-year
deadline. The government will make a final decision on the
project winner in 100 days.  The new airport construction is aimed at boosting tourism,
which accounts for about 20 percent of gross domestic product in
the Adriatic Sea nation. It may also provide a chance for
Croatia to become a regional hub in the western Balkans, said
Zdeslav Santic, the chief analyst at  Soc-Gen Splitska Banka d.d.   The first phase, during which a new terminal and runways
will be built, is estimated to cost 190 million euros ($252
million). After traffic through the airport exceeds 5 million
travelers, compared with 2.1 million in 2010, another 29 million
euros will be invested, according to ministry officials.  The Paris-led group, called Zagreb Airport International
Co., offered to pay 87 million euros in concession fees over 30
years.  The target figure of 5 million travelers could be changed,
the ministry’s state secretary, Tomislav Mihotic, said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
