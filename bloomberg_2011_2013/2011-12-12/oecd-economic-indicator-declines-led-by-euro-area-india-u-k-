The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development’s leading indicator fell in October
as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighed on growth across the region.  The  measure  dropped 0.3 points from September to 100.1, the
Paris-based group said today in an e-mailed statement. The
indicator shed 1.1 points in Germany, 0.7 point in France and
0.6 point in the U.K. The measure for India fell 0.9 point,
while  China ’s was unchanged.  In the “U.K. and the euro area as a whole, the indicators
continue pointing strongly to economic activity falling below
long-term trend,” the organization said.  European leaders agreed last week to add to the region’s
rescue fund and tighten fiscal rules to resolve the debt
turmoil. The  European Central Bank  cut its 2012 growth forecast
for the 17 countries sharing the euro to 0.3 percent, from 1.3
percent in September.  The OECD’s leading economic indicator aims to signal when
the direction of the economy is changing, with any level below
100 signifying a contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
