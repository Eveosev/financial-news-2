British investors are choosing other
destinations over  Hungary  because of the government’s rhetoric
against foreign owners, news website  hvg.hu  reported, citing the
U.K.’s outgoing ambassador to Budapest.  Hungary’s image among investors has become similar to 2006,
when media reports portrayed anti-government protests as if the
capital was in flames, hvg.hu said, citing an interview with
Greg Dorey, who has spent eight years in Hungary.  The country has lost its status as the region’s top
investment destination, with complaints focusing on the lack of
transparency in public procurement tenders, Dorey told the
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
