The Czech government will postpone
its decision on the future development of the  energy industry  by
at least one year,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Industry
and Trade Minister Martin Kuba.  An energy strategy relying heavily on the construction of
nuclear reactors was due for approval next year. The document,
drafted under Kubaâ€™s predecessor Martin Kocourek, lacked
detailed economic analysis and will need to be reworked, the
newspaper reported, citing the minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
