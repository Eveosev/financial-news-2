India ’s 10-year bond yields were
near a two-month low on speculation slowing economic growth will
prompt the central bank to halt interest- rate  increases.  Factory  output  decreased 0.7 percent in October from a year
earlier after rising 1.9 percent in September, according to the
median forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg survey before
data due today. It would be the first contraction since June
2009. The central bank has boosted its  repurchase rate  by 3.75
percentage points to 8.50 percent since the start of 2010, the
most among  Asia ’s 10 biggest economies. The  Reserve Bank  of
India is scheduled to review its policy rate on Dec. 16.  “There is little chance of further rate increases,” said
Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at Development Credit
Bank in Mumbai. “That expectation is keeping yields lower.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.54 percent as of
9:50 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate dropped to 8.52 percent on Dec. 8, the lowest
level for a benchmark 10-year note since Oct. 3, according to
Bloomberg data.  Gross domestic  product  rose 6.9 percent in the three months
through September, the least in two years, official data show.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose six basis points to 7.82 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
