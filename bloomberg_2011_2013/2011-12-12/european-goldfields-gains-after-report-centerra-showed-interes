European Goldfields Ltd. (EGU) , a metals
explorer and mine developer with projects in Greece, Romania and
Turkey, reached the highest price in five months after  Centerra
Gold Inc. (CG)  reportedly expressed interest in the company.  European Goldfields rose 4.4 percent to C$13.43 at the
close in Toronto, the highest price since July 8, after the
London-based Sunday Times reported yesterday that Centerra made
an approach to the company. Centerra’s interest came after
Vancouver-based  Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD)  made a preliminary approach,
the newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources.  European Goldfields said in a Dec. 6 statement that it
received “preliminary and indicative approaches from third
parties” regarding potential deals. No formal offers had been
received, the Whitehorse, Yukon-based company said, without
identifying the third parties.  Gold miners including the biggest producer, Barrick Gold
Corp., and fellow Canadian Iamgold Corp. are seeking
acquisitions to increase production amid record prices for the
precious metal. Gold rose to a record of $1,923.70 an ounce in
 New York  on Sept. 6.  Centerra, which has gold operations in Kyrgyzstan and
Mongolia, said in June 2010 it may spend as much as C$3 billion
($2.92 billion) buying assets to boost production. John Pearson,
a spokesman for Toronto-based Centerra, said yesterday the
company doesn’t comment on market speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
