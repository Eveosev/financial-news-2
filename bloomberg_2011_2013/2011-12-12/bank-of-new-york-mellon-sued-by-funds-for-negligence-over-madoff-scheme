Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. was
sued on behalf of three funds for negligence in connection with
the  Ponzi scheme  run by convicted fraudster Bernard L. Madoff.  Bank of New York Mellon and its BNY Alternative Investment
Services unit, which served as administrator, sub-administrator
and custodian of the Rye funds, acted with “gross negligence”
and helped funnel billions of dollars into Madoff’s scheme,
according to the complaint, which was filed in New York State
Supreme Court on Dec. 9.  Bank of New York Mellon and BNY “turned a blind eye to
Madoff’s scam and reaped tens of millions of dollars in fees
from the Rye funds, whose assets were entrusted to the BNY
defendants and ultimately plundered by Madoff,” according to
the complaint, which seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages. Tremont Partners Inc. served as the general partner and
investment manager for the funds.  Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon in New
York, declined to immediately comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Plaintiffs’ State and Securities Law Settlement
Class Counsel on Behalf of the State Law Subclass and the
Securities Subclass in “In re: Tremont Securities Law, State
Law and Insurance Litigation” v.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) ,
653415/2011, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
