(Corrects spelling of Pima County in second paragraph.)  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  bought two solar
plants in Arizona from developer Recurrent Energy Inc., a unit
of  Sharp Corp .  The 5-megawatt Ajo project in Pima County has 21,000
photovoltaic panels and began producing power in September,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke said today in a  statement 
that didn’t give a price. The 15-megawatt Bagdad project, in
Yavapai County, is expected to go into operation by the end of
the year and will use 72,000 panels.  Both projects have 25-year power-purchase agreements with
utility Arizona Public Service Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
