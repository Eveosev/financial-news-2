South Korea’s won closed little
changed, erasing an earlier gain on speculation importers bought
dollars to settle bills.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency rose as much as 0.7 percent today after
European leaders agreed on new fiscal measures to contain the
region’s debt crisis, supporting demand for riskier assets. The
 Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares advanced 1.3 percent after last week’s
European summit resulted in an accord that tightens budget rules
and provides an extra 200 billion euros ($267 billion) of
financial aid for euro-zone nations. U.K. Prime Minister  David
Cameron  refused to back the effort.  “The positive sentiment about  Europe  wasn’t so strong
among investors,” said Yu Won Jun, a Seoul-based currency
trader at Korea Exchange Bank. “The won reversed movements as
importers bought dollars.”  The won closed at 1,146.95 per dollar in Seoul, little
changed from 1,146.82 on Dec. 9, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  South Korea’s economic expansion will slow to 3.7 percent
in 2012 from 3.8 percent this year and 6.2 percent in 2010, the
 finance ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said today that growth may
miss the government’s forecast next year if Europe’s debt
problems deteriorate. Moody’s Investors Service said today that
the European Union summit last week didn’t lower the risk of
credit-ranking revisions.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.5 percent bonds due September
2016 was unchanged at 3.52 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
