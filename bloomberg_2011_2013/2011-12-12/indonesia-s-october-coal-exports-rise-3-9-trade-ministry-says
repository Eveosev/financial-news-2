Indonesia , the world’s biggest
exporter of thermal coal, increased shipments 3.9 percent in
October from the previous month, according to data released by
the Ministry of Trade.  Indonesia supplied 27.9 million tons from 26.8 million the
month before, the data showed. The country shipped 22.9 million
in October 2010.  Indonesia’s overseas shipments of the fuel in January to
October rose 11.5 percent to 254.2 million tons from 228 million
tons in the same period a year earlier, the trade ministry
reported.  The department didn’t provide an explanation for the rise
in exports or details of buyers. The figures, which come from
surveyors’ reports before shipment, are subject to change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
