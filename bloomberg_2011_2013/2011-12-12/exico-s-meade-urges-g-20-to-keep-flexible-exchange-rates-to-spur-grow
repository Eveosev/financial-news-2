Policy makers should remove trade
barriers and adopt flexible exchange rates to spur stronger
global economic growth,  Mexico ’s Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said after meeting officials from the Group of 20 nations.  Mexico  is hosting a meeting of G-20 deputy finance
ministers this week for the first time since it took over the
presidency of the group from  France  this month.  Meade, in an e-mailed statement, outlined Mexico’s goals as
head of the G-20 over the next year. These include working on
economic and structural reforms to boost growth and employment,
strengthening financial systems and improving the global
financial architecture, according to the statement.  The G-20 should also secure access to food for the poor and
encourage sustainable development that seeks to mitigate the
impact of energy and infrastructure development on the
environment, the  finance ministry  said.  “Our goal is to put the issues on the table, analyze them
and conclude them during the period,” Meade told deputy
ministers from the group meeting in Mexico City.  Today’s meeting was called to set the agenda ahead of next
year’s meeting in Mexico of G-20 finance ministers and a heads
of state summit to take place in June in  Baja California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
