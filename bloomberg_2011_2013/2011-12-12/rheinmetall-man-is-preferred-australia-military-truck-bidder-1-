Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  and  MAN SE (MAN)  were named
joint preferred bidders in a tender to supply Australia with as
many as 2,700 military vehicles.  The German companies’ Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles
GmbH joint venture will enter detailed negotiations with the
Canberra-based government to sell medium-size and heavy vehicles
as part of an A$7.5 billion ($7.6 billion) fleet overhaul, the
Defense Ministry said in a statement.  The proposal “offered the best value for money and met
defense requirements for capability and cost,” the ministry
said today in a  statement .  Rheinmetall, a partner in Germany’s Puma battle tank, and
MAN, the Munich-based truckmaker controlled by  Volkswagen AG ,
set up a partnership in January 2010 to build wheeled military
vehicles. Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on
the value of any order or on a time frame for talks.  Rheinmetall  rose  as much as 3.3 percent to 35.39 euros and
was up 0.5 percent as of 11:30 a.m. in  Frankfurt . MAN declined
as as much as 1.8 percent to 61.73 euros and was down 1.3
percent.  The A$7.5 billion ($7.6 billion) Overlander project will
provide Australia’s armed forces with about 7,500 new vehicles
over the next decade, replacing the current fleet of Land
Rovers, Unimog, Mack and S-Liner trucks in service since the
early 1980s, the ministry said.  Besides the 2,700 armored and unprotected vehicles that
Rheinmetall MAN would supply, Australia is also seeking options
for about 1,000 more unprotected trucks for training purposes,
the ministry said. The order will include medium and heavy
recovery vehicles and tractors, heavy integrated load-handling
trucks and medium-weight crane carriers and  dump trucks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
