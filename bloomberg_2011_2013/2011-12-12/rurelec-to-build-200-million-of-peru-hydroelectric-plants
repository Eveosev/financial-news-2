Rurelec Plc (RUR) , a U.K. energy developer
that lost its stake in a power company that was nationalized in
Bolivia, is planning $200 million of hydroelectric plants in
Peru.  The company agreed to buy with other investors a 50 percent
stake in the Peruvian developer Cascade Hydro Ltd. and the
option to acquire power plants with capacity of 32 megawatts
that it may build with Cascade, London-based Rurelec said today
in a statement that didn’t give a price.  Rurelec expects to have a total of 100 megawatts of
hydroelectric plants in operation by 2016 on Peru’s Pachacayo
river, Chief Executive Officer Peter Earl said today in a
telephone interview.  The Bolivian government expropriated in May 2010 Rurelec’s
controlling stake of  Santa Cruz , Bolivia-based Empresa Electrica
Guaracachi SA, prompting the company to look at other Latin
American markets, Earl said. Rurelec also operates a
thermoelectric plant in  Argentina .  Peru’s steep mountains make it one of the few places on
Earth suitable for run-of-river hydroelectric plants, Earl said.
Other locations include Bolivia and Nepal.  “Peru has the perfect topography for this kind of
project,” Earl said. “You can capture the same water through a
series of hydro plants without building a high-head dam,” which
causes more environmental damage.  Two rainy seasons a year and melting glaciers mean the
Pachacayo river “never runs dry” and the plants can operate
year round, he said.  Rurelec was unchanged at 7.38 pence at the close in  London .
Its shares have dropped 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
