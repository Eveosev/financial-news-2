(Corrects reason for board vacancy in fourth paragraph.)  Benoit Coeure, candidate for the
European Central Bank’s Executive Board, said the institution is
independent and should not take instructions from governments.  “Governments have undertaken to respect this principle and
not to seek to influence them,” Coeure said, according to
written answers for a European Parliament hearing on his
candidacy.  Couere said he sees no reason to change the ECB’s “clear
mandate” to maintain  price stability , which is the best
contribution a central bank can make to safeguard economic
growth. Coeure, a French treasury official, is appearing at a
hearing of the 27-nation Parliament’s economic and monetary
affairs committee this evening in Strasbourg, France.  The vacancy on the ECB’s 6-man executive board arises due
to the resignation of Italy’s Lorenzo Bini Smaghi. That adds to
the personnel revamp on the panel after  Juergen Stark , the
Frankfurt-based central bank’s chief economist, quit following
tensions over the purchase of  government bonds  aimed at stemming
 Europe ’s debt crisis. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has
called on the ECB to increase its crisis-fighting role, a move
opposed by the ECB itself and the German government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
