South Korea ’s economy will grow at
the slowest pace in three years in 2012 as the European debt
crisis and global economic weakness cripple exports.  Gross domestic product growth will slow to 3.7 percent next
year from 3.8 percent this year and 6.2 percent last year, the
nation’s finance ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.
The Bank of Korea projected the same growth rate for 2012 on Dec.
9, cutting its July forecast of 4.6 percent.  The central bank refrained from raising  interest rates  last
week for a sixth straight month as deepening European debt woes
prompted monetary easing in countries from  Australia  to  China .  “Our policy priority for next year is to stimulate the
economy and improve the living quality of the people,” the
statement said. “We will also focus on preempting potential
difficulties from global uncertainties and increasing
volatilities as the European financial crisis spreads.”  Exports, equivalent to half of the economy, will increase
7.4 percent next year, down from a 19.2 percent jump this year,
trimming the current-account surplus to $16 billion from $25
billion, the ministry said. Inflation may run at 3.2 percent in
2012 after a 4 percent rate this year, the ministry also said.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
last month cut its 2012 growth forecast for its 34 member
countries to 1.6 percent from 2.8 percent predicted in May. The
Paris-based organization projected South  Korea ’s expansion at
3.8 percent in 2012, compared with 2 percent growth for  Japan 
and an 8.5 percent gain for China.  South Korea will create more 280,000 jobs next year after
an addition of 400,000 jobs this year, the ministry said today.
The government will spend about 60 percent of its 2012 budget in
the first half to spur domestic demand, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
