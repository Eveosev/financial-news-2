Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s largest maker of luxury cars, says it’s in talks with
 General Motors Co.  about cooperating on fuel-cell technology.  “We are exploring various topics related to future
technologies such as fuel cells,”  Mathias Schmidt , a spokesman
for the Munich-based carmaker, said today by phone. He declined
to comment on the timing of an agreement.  Fuel cells generate electricity in the chemical reaction
that combines hydrogen and oxygen to create water. BMW has
largely ignored the technology in the past, focusing research on
burning liquid hydrogen in a combustion engine.  Daimler AG , the
world’s third-biggest luxury-vehicle manufacturer, plans to
introduce a fuel-cell-powered version of the Mercedes-Benz B-
Class compact by 2014.  The talks between BMW and Detroit-based GM were reported
Dec. 10 by  Germany ’s  WirtschaftsWoche  magazine, which said the
carmakers are close to signing a deal as early as January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
