Optima Group d.o.o. , owned by
Russia’s OAO   Zarubezhneft , may purchase petrol stations in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia that are being sold by  OMV AG (OMV) 
as the  oil company  seeks to expand operations in the Balkans.  “We are very interested and we are closely monitoring
developments even though it’s too early to say that this will
definitely happen,” Radomir Vidakovic, head for marketing and
advertising at Optima in Banja Luka said in a phone interview
today. “We are looking to expand operations as we have surplus
capacity at our refineries.”  The Bosnian company owns refineries in Modrica and Bosanski
Brod as well as 88 petrol stations through its unit Petrol a.d.
in the Balkan nation, according to the company’s website.  OMV, led by Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss, said on
Dec. 6 that it plans to sell its subsidiaries in  Croatia  and
Bosnia as the Vienna-based oil company seeks to dispose of less
profitable assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
