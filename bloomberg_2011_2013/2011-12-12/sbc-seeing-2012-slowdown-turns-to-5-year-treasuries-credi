HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  plans to boost its
holdings of five-year Treasuries as it seeks to buy safer assets
in 2012 amid forecasts for a “sharp and protracted” slowdown
in the new year.  Europe ’s biggest bank by market value will also bolster its
holdings of high-yield credit and switch out of developed-market
equities and commodities such as oil and industrial metals, the
London-based bank’s asset-allocation unit said in a research
note today.  “We are bracing for economic hardship in 2012,” Fredrik Nerbrand, London-based global head of asset allocation, wrote in
the note. “Our leading indicators have been in deep contracting
territory since early this year, and we see few signs of
improvement. Against this backdrop, we are rebalancing our
strategic portfolio in favor of lower risk.”  Yields on five-year Treasuries fell four basis points to
0.86 percent at 3:37 p.m. London time.  The notes now make up 10 percent of the bank’s three-year
view  asset allocation  while investment in U.S. 10-year debt will
be cut to 10 percent, according to the bank.  Investment in high-yield credit will be increased to 22.5
percent of the bank’s portfolio, while gold will account for 15
percent, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
