French pork prices are moving closer
to the cost of production after increases in recent weeks,
 France ’s national hog-breeders federation said.  Producer prices have risen at a time of year typically
“not very favorable” for pork, the Federation Nationale
Porcine said in an e-mailed statement today. Prices have been
insufficient to cover costs since feed expenses started rising
in the summer of 2010, the group said.  Prices for live pigs rose 1.5 percent on Dec. 8 to 1.367
euros ($1.81) a kilogram at the  Marche du Porc Breton  in Plerin
in western France, up from 1.347 euros on Dec. 5 and compared
with 1.112 euros at the same time a year ago. Paris-traded
milling-wheat futures have risen 33 percent since the start of
June 2010.  “The economy remains precarious for the producers whose
treasuries have been depleted by successive crises,” the FNP
said. “That’s why the producers will be vigilant in coming
weeks about the evolution of the pork prices and the attitude of
industry operators.”  Breeders can ill afford a return to “inescapable
situations” in which retail promotions of pork resemble “a
liquidation” unrelated to production costs, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
