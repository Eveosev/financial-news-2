JAT Tehnika, Serbia’s state-owned
aircraft maintenance company, will start servicing Airbus’ 320
series, in addition to  Boeing Co. (BA)  and ATR planes,  Beta   news
agency  reported, citing the country’s infrastructure minister.  The Belgrade-based company, which the state failed to sell
in 2008, will use a 5 million-euro ($6.65 million) government-
backed loan to expand facilities and start offering spot repairs
by mid-2012 and systemic maintenance of Boeing jets later next
year, the report quoted Milutin Mrkonjic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
