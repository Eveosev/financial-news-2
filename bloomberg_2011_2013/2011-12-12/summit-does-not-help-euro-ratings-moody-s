A European Union summit on the
region’s debt crisis last week offered few new measures and
doesn’t diminish the risk of credit-ranking revisions, Moody’s
Investors Service said.  “In the absence of any decisive policy initiatives that
stabilise credit market conditions effectively, our intention as
announced in November is to revisit the level and dispersion of
ratings during the first quarter of 2012,” Moody’s said in its
Weekly Credit Outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
