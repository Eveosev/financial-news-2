Gulf Coast gasoline rose after BP
Plc adjusted equipment associated with an ultracracker in Texas
City, Texas, and  Petroleo Brasileiro SAâ€™s (PBR)  Pasadena refinery shut
a coker following a fire.  BP lowered system pressure on the gasoline-making unit to
make changes Dec. 10, according to a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. The coker fire broke out
the same day at the Pasadena plant near Houston and was
extinguished, the company said in a statement.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  narrowed 0.58 cent to 7.05 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:10 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
2.68 cents to $2.4931 a gallon.  The discount versus heating oil futures for ultra-low-
sulfur diesel at the same hub narrowed 2.55 cents to 4.7 cents a
gallon.  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  flared sulfur dioxide from the Big
Spring Refinery in Texas after a valve failed, according to a
Dec. 11 filing to state regulators.  The emissions began at 2:30 a.m. local time and ended by 9
a.m., and the unit was stabilized, the state filing showed.  The Big Spring refinery can process 70,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  California-blend gasoline in  San Francisco  weakened 0.75
cent to a premium of 0.25 cent a gallon versus futures.  The premium for the fuel in  Los Angeles  slipped 0.75 cent
to 5.75 cents. It strengthened Dec. 9 as Kinder Morgan started
scheduling for the third cycle on the West pipeline, which
carries refined products from  Southern California  into  Arizona .  To contact the reporter on this story:
