Hungary may be targeting an
 International Monetary Fund -led safety net of as much as 15
billion euros ($20 billion), Citigroup Inc. said, citing unnamed
government officials.  The Cabinet, which will start negotiations this week with
the IMF and the European Union, may aim for a backstop of
between 10 billion euros and 15 billion euros, Citigroup’s  David Lubin  and Eszter Gargyan said in a report published on Dec. 9
after meeting officials in Budapest.  Hungary last month lost its investment-grade  credit rating 
at Moody’s Investors Service after seeking a backstop. Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  reversed his policy of shunning
international aid after the forint fell to its weakest against
the euro and the government struggled to raise planned amounts
at debt auctions.  “Since the Prime Minister has already spent some of his
political capital in embracing the idea of an IMF agreement, it
seems that the sensible option now is quickly to gain the
benefits that such a deal would bring,” Citigroup said. “2012
seems to provide a decent window in which to shore up  Hungary ’s
economic credibility.”  Hungary’s ability to sell a planned 4 billion euros in
foreign-currency denominated debt next year is “heavily
dependent” on the government obtaining an IMF-led aid package,
Lubin and Gargyan wrote. An agreement may create a “virtuous
circle” for Hungarian financing, they said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
