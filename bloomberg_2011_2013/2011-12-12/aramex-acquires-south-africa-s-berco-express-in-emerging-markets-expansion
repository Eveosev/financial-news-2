Aramex PJSC (ARMX) , the Middle East’s
largest courier company, said it acquired Berco Express (Pty)
Ltd. of  South Africa , marking its biggest purchase to date and
entry into Africa’s largest economy.  Berco Express operates 15 branches in South Africa and
employs more than 700 people, Aramex said in an e-mailed
statement today. No price was disclosed for the transaction.  “It’s our largest deal so far,” said Aramex Chief
Executive Officer Fadi Ghandour in a phone interview.  Aramex has been expanding into Africa from its hub in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to take advantage of opportunities
for growth in underserved markets and fill a gap untapped by
multinational firms.  The company operates in markets including  Kenya , Uganda,
Tanzania and Juba in Southern Sudan and plans to use Berco to
expand across Southern Africa and invest in new offices and
warehouses, Aramex said.  The Berco deal follows the formation of a joint venture
company with SinoAir in China and the acquisition of OneWorld
Courier and In-Time Couriers in Kenya this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
