The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped seven basis points to 193.5
basis points as of 8:05 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The gauge is set for its biggest
daily loss since Dec. 2, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid six basis points to
183 basis points as of 11:04 a.m. in Sydney,  Australia  & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The index is headed for
its largest decline since Dec. 5, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index decreased one basis point to
183 as of 9:06 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
