French farmers are expected to
increase soft-wheat planting by 1.6 percent, estimates
published by national crops office FranceAgriMer show.  The area growing all soft-wheat varieties for harvesting
next year will climb to 5.07 million hectares (12.5 million
acres) from 4.99 million hectares harvested this year, the
Montreuil-sous-Bois-based office said in an online  report .  The outlook compares with a forecast by the  Agriculture
Ministry  for planting of winter soft wheat to climb to 5.06
million hectares. Overwintering varieties typically account for
more than 99 percent of soft-wheat production in  France , the
European Unionâ€™s largest grower and exporter.  Durum-wheat planting, both winter and spring varieties,
will climb 2.8 percent to 429,050 hectares, according to
FranceAgriMer. Winter barley is expected to cover 1.07 million
hectares, up 0.9 percent, the crop office report shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
