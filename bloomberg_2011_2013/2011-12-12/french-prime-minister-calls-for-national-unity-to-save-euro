French Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  called for “national unity” to fend off attacks against
the euro currency and for politicians to back the Dec. 9
agreement between European Union leaders.  “We must today show national unity in the face of markets,
attacks against the euro zone and in the face of all dangers
threatening us,” Fillon said in a speech in Saint-Dizier in
eastern France. A copy of the speech was sent by e-mail by his
press office.  The prime minister was speaking after the Socialist Party’s
candidate for next year’s presidential elections,  Francois Hollande ,  said today  he would revise the Dec. 9 accord if
elected in May and add a measure to ensure the  European Central
Bank ’s role in defending the euro. Hollande is the frontrunner
according to all opinion polls published in the past three
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
