Nigerian banks headed to the biggest
gain in almost six weeks on bets selling was overdone, Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co. said.  The  Bloomberg Banking Index (NGSEB10) , which tracks the performance
of 10 most capitalized banks, added 0.8 percent, the biggest
rise since Oct. 27, to 252.93 as of 1.33 p.m. in Lagos.  Fidelity Bank Plc (FIDELITY)  led the gainers, rising 4.9 percent, the
largest increase since Aug. 15, to 1.28 naira.  Stanbic IBTC Bank
Plc (IBTCCB) , a unit of  Standard Bank Group Ltd. , spiked 4 percent, the
maximum jump since Nov. 30, to 6.55 naira, while  Access Bank
Plc (ACCESS) , which acquired  Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) , one of the eight
lenders bailed out by the central bank two years ago, climbed 2
percent to 4.4 naira.  The low prices of Nigerian banks are “attracting both
local and foreign investors,” David Adonri, chief executive
officer of Lagos-based Lambeth Trust, said by phone today.
Nigerian banks are trading at 0.8 times their price-to-book
value, down from 1.2 in 2009 and 1.3 in 2010, according to
Bloomberg data.  A debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 threatened the Nigerian
banking system, forcing the central bank to fire eight chief
executives of the country’s 24 lenders and set up the Asset
Management Corp. of  Nigeria , or Amcon, to buy bad debts to
stabilize the industry. Amcon has acquired 3.14 trillion naira
worth of debts, chief executive officer Mustafa Chike-Obi said
Nov. 28.  The banking index has lost 37 percent this year compared
with a 21 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-
Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
