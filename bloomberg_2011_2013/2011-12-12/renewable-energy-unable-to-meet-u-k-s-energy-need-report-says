Renewable energy  can’t meet the
U.K.’s energy needs and government policies to promote it will
lead to higher costs for consumers, said a report by the Adam
Smith Institute and Scientific Alliance.  Renewable energy is too unreliable ever to replace gas,
coal and nuclear generation, said the report published on the
Adam Smith Institute website today. The decommissioning of coal-
fired and nuclear power stations over the coming decade is a
threat to  energy security , said the report.  Wind energy would never be economically viable and wind
turbines were doing little to reduce carbon emissions and fossil
fuel consumption, said the report.  The Scottish government has a target to meet all of the
country’s energy needs from renewable sources by 2020, compared
with 15 percent for the U.K.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
