White sugar’s  premium  over raw
sweetener may fall as much as 35 percent in the first quarter on
increased exports from the European Union,  India , and
Thailand, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  White, or refined, sugar on NYSE Liffe in London was
trading $93 a metric ton above the price of the raw variety on
ICE Futures U.S. in New York at 3:08 p.m. London time. The price
difference, known as the white premium, may fall to $60 a ton,
said  Naim Beydoun , a broker at the Rolle, Switzerland-based
company.  “It would be difficult not to turn bearish ahead of
additional exports from the EU, India and Thailand,” he said in
an e-mail today.  India may export 2 million to 2.5 million tons of the
sweetener in the 2011-12 season, and Thailand may ship 650,000
tons in the first quarter, he said. The EU may ship the maximum
allowed by the  World Trade Organization , he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
