Wah Nam International Holdings Ltd. (159) ,
a Hong Kong-traded limousine provider and copper producer,
offered about A$196 million ($199 million) to buy the remaining
shares of Brockman Resources Ltd. it doesn’t own.  Wah Nam, Brockman’s largest  shareholder (BRM)  with a 55.3 percent
stake, plans to pay A$1.50 in cash and 18 Wah Nam shares,
valuing the deal at A$3.03 for each Brockman share, the
companies said today in a joint statement. The offer is 34
percent more than Brockman’s A$2.26 closing price on Dec. 9.  The offer by Wah Nam follows its A$497 million acquisition
of Nedlands, Australia-based Brockman’s shares in May. Buying
Brockman gives Wah Nam full control of the Marillana iron ore
project in the Pilbara region of  Western Australia .  “Consolidation should improve funding options to develop
Brockman’s Marillana iron ore project,” Brockman said. The
“offer provides immediate value certainty via the A$1.50 cash
component as well as exposure to the potential upside of the
Marillana iron ore project via the 18 Wah Nam shares scrip
component.”  Brockman’s independent directors unanimously recommended
the Wah Nam offer in the absence of a superior proposal, the
company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
