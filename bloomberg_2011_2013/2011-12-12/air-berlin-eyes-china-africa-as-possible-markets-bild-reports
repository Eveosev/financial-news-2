Air Berlin Plc  is considering China
and  Africa  as possible markets,  Bild Zeitung  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Hartmut Mehdorn.  The German carrier doesn’t plan job cut though it doesn’t
rule out redundancies depending on how severe an impact the
European debt crisis will have on the economy, the newspaper
cited Mehdorn as saying in an interview published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
