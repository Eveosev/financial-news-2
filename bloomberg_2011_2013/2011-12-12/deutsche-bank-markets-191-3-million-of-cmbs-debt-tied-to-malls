Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  is marketing $191.3
million of bonds tied to a commercial property loan, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The debt is backed by mortgages on malls in Gainesville,
 Florida , and Omaha,  Nebraska , Bloomberg data show. The
securities, of which $114.6 million are expected to be rated AAA
by Moody’s Investors Service, mature in about one year.  Wall Street banks arranged about $28 billion in bonds
backed by commercial mortgages this year, compared with $11.5
billion in 2010, Bloomberg data show. Issuance peaked at $232
billion in 2007.  The extra yield investors demand to own top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries has risen to
259 basis points from this year’s low of 178 basis points on
April 26, according to a Barclays Capital index. The spread has
narrowed from 323 on Oct. 4, the widest since February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
