Stocks, the euro and commodities
tumbled as Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings said last
week’s summit did little to ease pressure on  Europe ’s struggling
governments.  Intel (INTC)  Corp. led a retreat in technology companies
after cutting its fourth-quarter revenue forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.5 percent to
1,236.47 at 4 p.m. in New York and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
tumbled 1.9 percent. The euro weakened 1.5 percent to $1.3187,
approaching its 2011 low. The 10-year  Italian bond  yield
increased 20 basis points after earlier surging as much as 43
points. The cost of insuring against default on European
government debt approached a record. Zinc and cotton lost at
least 3.4 percent and natural gas slid to a 27-month low.  The EU summit offered few new measures and doesn’t diminish
the risk of credit downgrades on European nations, Moody’s said
today. Equities and the euro extended losses as Fitch said a
comprehensive solution has not yet been offered and predicted a
“significant economic downturn” in the region. The onus
remains on governments rather than the  European Central Bank  to
solve the crisis, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann told
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.  “The big issue is: Did the European summit do enough to
stave off these downgrades or not?”Nick Sargen, chief
investment officer at Fort Washington Investment Advisors in
Cincinnati, which oversees more than $39 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “Most people come to the conclusion that
downgrades on the region’s sovereigns are easily justifiable. If
the rest of the world is slowing down, we too would feel some of
that impact.”  Retreat Following Rally  The S&P 500 retreated after climbing for two straight
weeks, its first back-to-back weekly advance since October.
Technology, energy and financial shares were the biggest drags
on the index among 10 groups today.  The  S&P 500  has struggled to stay above its 2010 closing
level of 1,257.64 since topping it during the last week of
October after slumping below it for almost three months. The
index has shown a year-to-date gain during 18 sessions since
Oct. 27, only to later turn lower for 2011. It is currently down
about 1.7 percent for the year, led by a 21 percent slide in
financial shares.  Intel sank 4 percent, the most since August, as the world’s
largest maker of semiconductors cut its forecast for fourth-
quarter revenue, saying supply shortages for hard drives are
prompting computer makers to cut orders for other components.
The shortages, stemming from the worst flooding in Thailand in
70 years, will continue into the first quarter, Intel said.  Banks Retreat  Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. tumbled at least 3.4 percent to lead a retreat in 23 of 24
stocks in the  KBW Bank Index (BKX) , which lost 2.5 percent.  JPMorgan’s chief U.S. equity strategist,  Thomas Lee ,
forecast the S&P 500 will climb to 1,430 by the end of next
year, a 14 percent rally from last week’s close, and named
financial stocks as the firm’s “top pick” for 2012. Lee listed
eight reasons for the advance, including an easing of Europe’s
debt crisis by the second half of the year, further recovery in
the U.S. housing market, the American election cycle and a
“selective easing” of monetary policy in  China .  Barton Biggs , the hedge fund manager who increased bets on
U.S. equities before the S&P 500 rallied this month, said he’s
still bullish.  ‘Best Houses’  “I’m biased toward the long side,” he said during an
interview on Bloomberg Television “In the Loop” with Betty Liu
today. “U.S. big-capitalization, U.S. stocks and Asian stocks
are the best houses in a fairly tough, bad neighborhood.” Biggs
said equities may surge or drop 20 percent because of concern
about budget negotiations and Europe.  The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell five basis
points to 3.06 percent, with 10-year yields slipping four basis
points to 2.02 percent.  The S&P GSCI Index of commodities slumped 1.3 percent, as
19 of 24 commodities retreated. Silver for March delivery
dropped 3.9 percent to $31.002 an ounce. Copper declined 2.6
percent and oil lost 1.7 percent to $97.77 a barrel in  New York .
Natural gas fell to the lowest in more than two years, losing
1.9 percent to $3.254 per million British thermal units, on
forecasts for warmer weather and stockpiles near record highs.  Almost 16 shares fell for every one that advanced in the
 Stoxx 600 , extending last week’s 0.1 percent drop. HSBC Holdings
Plc slipped 3.2 percent and Banco Santander SA lost 4.2 percent
to pace a drop among 49 of 50 banks in the index.
Commerzbank AG, Germany’s second-largest bank, tumbled 7.8
percent on concern it will need state aid. After European
markets closed, Germany’s  Finance Ministry  denied a Reuters
report that it’s in talks to offer state assistance to
Commerzabank, saying that communication between the government
and the bank doesn’t go beyond “exchange of information.”  European Bonds  The two-year Italian note yield decreased 11 basis points
to 5.85 percent after surging as much as 53 points earlier. The
government sold 365-day bills at an average yield of 5.952
percent, compared with 6.087 percent at the previous auction.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year French
bonds instead of benchmark German bunds climbed 14 basis points
to 126 basis points.  France  sold 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion)
13-week bills at an average yield of 0.222 percent. France also
sold 1 billion euros of 308-day bills and 1.5 billion euros of
182-day bills.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed for a fifth day, jumping
18.5 basis points to 382, the highest since closing at its all-
time high of 386.5 on Nov. 25.  Dollar, Euro  The dollar appreciated against all 16 major peers monitored
by Bloomberg, strengthening 0.3 percent versus the yen and 0.6
percent against the pound. The euro weakened against eight of 16
major peers, while strengthening at least 0.7 percent versus the
Swedish krona, South African rand and Brazilian real.  Foreign-exchange strategists are reducing forecasts for the
euro at the fastest pace this year as ECB President  Mario
Draghi ’s interest-rate cuts remove one of the currency’s pillars
of support. Since Nov. 3, when Draghi began to undo the rate
increases implemented earlier this year by his predecessor,
 Jean-Claude Trichet , analysts have cut end-of-2012 estimates for
the euro to $1.32 from $1.40, based on the median of 40
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey as of last week.  The shared currency has weakened versus every major peer
except the Swiss franc since then, after gaining against 12 of
the 16 this year prior to that.  ‘No Panacea’  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc Chief European Economist  Jacques
Cailloux  said the agreements reached at the EU summit last week
are unlikely to inspire the ECB to engage in large-scale bond
purchases to support struggling nations.  “Perhaps more importantly, we reiterate our view that even
if the ECB was to intervene more aggressively, this would be no
panacea,” he said.  The ECB settled settled 635 million euros ($841 million) of
bond purchases last week, down from 3.7 billion euros the
previous week.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  slipped 1.1 percent,
erasing earlier gains of as much as 0.9 percent.  India ’s Sensex
Index fell 2.1 percent after industrial production fell for the
first time since June 2009. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 1
percent after data showed overseas shipments rose by the least
in two years. Benchmark gauges in  Brazil , Argentina, Turkey and
 Russia  lost more than 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
