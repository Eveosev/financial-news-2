Sidney Crosby  of the  Pittsburgh
Penguins  will be out indefinitely after a return of concussion-
like symptoms.  Crosby, who has played in eight of Pittsburgh’s 30 games
while recovering from a concussion sustained last season, said
there was no timetable for his return, according to the National
Hockey League team’s  website . He has two goals and 10 assists
this year.  Crosby, the team’s captain and leading scorer last season,
said he still isn’t feeling completely recovered after colliding
with teammate Chris Kunitz on Dec. 5 in a game against  Boston .
While he passed a test after the game, Crosby and the team won’t
rush his return.  “I’m not happy about watching, but I have to make sure
with these sort of things that I’m careful and making sure I’m
100 percent before coming back,” Crosby said.  The 24-year-old center said he decided to go through the
testing after practice the following day when his symptoms
persisted.  “With a little bit of exertion, I just didn’t feel
right,” he said. “After talking with everyone I figured it was
better to be cautious and not take any chances. That’s where I’m
at right now.”  The recovery period is likely to be quicker than his
previous absence, Crosby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
