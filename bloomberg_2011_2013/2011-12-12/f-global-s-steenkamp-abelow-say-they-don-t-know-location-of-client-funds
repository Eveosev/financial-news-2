Henri Steenkamp, chief financial
officer of MF Global Holdings Ltd., said he doesn’t know the
location of $1.2 billion in missing client funds and didn’t have
direct involvement with accounts and fund transfers at the
failed brokerage.  “I do not know why these funds cannot be accounted for,
but based on the fact that no shortfalls had been reported to me
previously, it appears that any irregularities were likely
caused by events that occurred shortly before the bankruptcy
filing,” Steenkamp said in testimony prepared for a Senate
Agriculture Committee hearing tomorrow. Steenkamp said he
learned of the shortfall on Oct. 30, the day before the firm
filed for  bankruptcy protection .  Bradley Abelow, president and chief operating officer at MF
Global, also said he doesn’t know the location of the missing
funds. “I am deeply troubled by the fact that customer funds
are missing, and I can assure you that I share your interest,
and the public’s interest, in finding out exactly what
happened,” Abelow said in testimony prepared for the same
hearing.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Securities
and Exchange Commission and U.S. Justice Department are
investigating the missing funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
