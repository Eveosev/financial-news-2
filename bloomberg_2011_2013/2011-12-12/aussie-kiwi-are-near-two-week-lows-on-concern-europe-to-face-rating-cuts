The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars pared gains against their U.S. counterpart amid concern
European leaders won’t agree how to solve the region’s debt
crisis.  Global stocks erased gains after  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
told German coalition lawmakers that the 500 billion euro ($654
billion) cap on  Europe ’s planned permanent bailout fund will
stay in place, two officials with knowledge of the discussion
said. The South Pacific currencies gained earlier amid optimism
about the U.S. economic recovery as retail sales rose.  “We just need the situation in Europe to stabilize,” said
 Adam Carr , a senior economist in Sydney at ICAP Australia Ltd.,
a unit of the world’s biggest interdealer broker. “The  U.S.
economy  is much better than people were predicting only a couple
of months ago.”  New Zealand’s currency was little changed at 76.32 U.S.
cents at 12:10 p.m. New York time. It earlier rose as much as
0.6 percent to 76.75. It fetched 59.42 yen from 59.45.  The Australian dollar traded 0.1 percent stronger $1.0084,
down from as strong as $1.0163. The Aussie was 0.1 percent
higher at 78.52 yen.  The MSCI World  Index (MXWO)  fell 0.1 percent after gaining as much
as 0.8 percent.  Australia’s government bonds advanced, with the  yield  on
the 10-year note falling 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 3.80 percent. It reached 3.78 earlier, the lowest
since at least September 1992 when Bloomberg began compiling
data.  A National Australia Bank Ltd. survey today showed that
Australian business confidence was unchanged in November. The
confidence index was 2 last month, the same as in October,
according to the poll of about 550 companies conducted Nov.
