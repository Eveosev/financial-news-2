Asian  stocks (MXAP)  pared gains as Italy
and France prepared to sell debt and Moody’s Investors Service
reiterated it plans to review the credit ratings of European
nations even after an agreement to tighten fiscal controls in
the region and boost a bailout fund.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.1 percent, reversing an advance
of as much as 1.8 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the Hong Kong-
based clothier that counts  Europe  as its biggest market, slipped
1.7 percent, reversing an advance of as much as 2.2 percent.
 James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , the building materials suppliers
that counts the U.S. as its biggest market, gained 2.2 percent.  “The European situation will continue to bother us into
next year as policy initiatives seem insufficient,” said Mark Matthews, Singapore-based head of research for Asia at Bank
Julius Baer & Co., which has about $180 billion globally. “U.S.
economic data is improving quite nicely and that’s one of the
few bright spots in the world.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent to 115.66 as
of 7:28 p.m. in  Tokyo , paring a gain of as much as 1.4 percent.
About two shares rose for each that fell in the measure. The
gauge dropped 2.2 percent last week after Standard & Poor’s said
it may cut credit ratings for Germany, France and 13 other euro-
area countries amid a deepening debt crisis.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  increased 1.4 percent led
by Olympus Corp., the endoscope maker at the center of an
accounting scandal. The company’s shares jumped 7.8 percent
after saying it will meet a Dec. 14 deadline to submit its
accounts to avoid delisting.  South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 1.3 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 index added 1.2 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite
Index declined 1 percent.  ‘Very Cautious’  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 1 percent
today. The index rose 1.7 percent in  New York  on Dec. 9 after
European leaders in Brussels tightened anti-deficit rules and
agreed to boost their rescue fund by as much as 200 billion
euros ($267 billion) by funneling money to the  International
Monetary Fund .  Europe’s leaders outlined a “fiscal compact” to prevent
future debt run-ups and accelerated the start of a planned 500
billion-euro rescue fund.  “Of course people are getting relief from the Europe
talks, but people probably don’t think they still have any long-
term solution,” said  Alex Wong , an asset-management director at
Ample Capital Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “People are very cautious.”  Esprit fell 1.7 percent to HK$10.58 in Hong Kong, after
gaining as much as 2.2 percent.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , a
retailer and port operator that gets more than half of revenue
from Europe, dropped 0.5 percent to HK$65.70, erasing an earlier
advance of up to 2 percent.  U.S. Confidence  Shares of exporters gained as confidence improved among
consumers in the U.S., the world’s biggest economy. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment rose to a six-month high of 67.7 in December from 64.1
in November, beating estimates.  James Hardie advanced 2.2 percent to A$6.89 in Sydney.
Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, rose 1.6 percent
to 3,500 yen in Tokyo.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest exporter of
consumer electronics, added 1.3 percent to 1,423 yen.  Samsung Electronics climbed 2.9 percent to 1.084 million
won in Seoul. The company said yesterday its mobile-phone
handset sales this year reached a record of 300 million units.
Technology companies had the biggest advance among the 10
industries on the MSCI gauge.  Biggest Advance  Olympus Corp. (7733) , the scandal-hit maker of cameras and
endoscopes, jumped 7.8 percent to 1,300 yen in Tokyo, the most
in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The company said it plans to
release earnings by the Dec. 14 deadline, allowing it to avoid
automatic delisting.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 16 percent this year
through last week, compared with a 0.2 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 13 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.7 times for the S&P 500
and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
