Peruvian bond yields rose the most
in three weeks and the sol weakened after President Ollanta Humala reshuffled his cabinet.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 climbed five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 5.73 percent at 9:22 a.m. Lima time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The security’s price
fell 0.35 centimo to 114.19 centimos per sol. The sol weakened
0.2 percent to 2.70 per  U.S. dollar , from 2.76950 on Dec. 9,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Humala swore in 10 new ministers led by a former army
officer as he seeks to take a firmer stance on protests that
halted the nation’s biggest investment project. European stocks
and U.S. equity futures fell and the euro weakened as Moody’s
Investors Service said it will review ratings for countries in
the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
