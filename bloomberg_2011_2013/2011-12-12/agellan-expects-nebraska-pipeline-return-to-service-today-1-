Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) 
expects to return a products pipeline to service in Nebraska
late today.  Repairs to the pipeline that spilled an estimated 6,000
barrels of refined oil products have been completed, Bruce Heine, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. Two separate
lines carrying diesel and gasoline were shut Dec. 10 after they
were struck by a bulldozer, he said.  The refined products have been contained, Heine said.
Federal and state regulators are at the spill site 65 miles (105
kilometers) south of Omaha.  The pipeline system starts in  Kansas City , Kansas, and runs
north, said Heine, who declined to comment on the current
operating rates of those lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
