Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  will continue
the production of its Rafale fighter jets and maintain its
industrial “skills,” French Prime Minister  Francois Fillon 
said today in a speech.  “The extraordinary capacities of the Rafale have been
demonstrated in the war in Libya,” Fillon said in a speech on
the air base of Saint-Dizier in eastern France. ”France will in
no circumstances renounce” the engineering and industrial
competences developed by Dassault, he said, according to a copy
of the speech e-mailed by his office.  He added that France is still seeking to sell the jets to
 India , the United Arab Emirates and Brazil.  Fillon’s comments follow Defense Minister Gerard Longuet’s
remarks in Le Monde daily on Dec. 7 when he said that unless the
jet finds a buyer abroad, the government will quit funding its
production, effectively killing the program.  Over the last decade, Dassault has consistently lost out in
competitions in countries including Singapore,  South Korea ,
Morocco, and last week, Switzerland. Although it has been
producing a plane a month for the French military, without
export orders to help pay the cost of production, its funding
burden falls entirely on France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
