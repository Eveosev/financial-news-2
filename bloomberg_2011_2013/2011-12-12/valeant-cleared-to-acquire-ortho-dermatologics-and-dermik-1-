Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX)  won U.S. antitrust approval to acquire
 Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Ortho Dermatologics’ U.S. assets and
Sanofi’s Dermik unit, the Federal Trade Commission said.  As a condition of approval, Mississauga, Ontario-based
Valeant must sell manufacturing and marketing rights to two
drugs for acne and pre-cancerous lesions to a unit of
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based  Mylan Inc. , the FTC said today in
a statement. Valeant also must sell marketing rights for a
wrinkle treatment to closely held Spear Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
according to the statement.  Without the divestments, Valeant’s purchase of Dermik and
Ortho Dermatologics would reduce competition in skin-care
markets, leading to higher prices, the FTC said. Valeant agreed
in July to buy  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based J&J’s unit for
$345 million, gaining the prescription medicines Retin-A Micro
and Renova for acne and Ertaczo for fungal infections. The unit
had $150 million in 2010 sales, Valeant said.  Earlier that month, Valeant said it would buy Paris-based
 Sanofi (SAN) ’s unit for $425 million, bringing in the acne treatment
Benzaclin, wrinkle therapy Sculptra and Carac for skin growths.  Laurie Little, a Valeant spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to a telephone message seeking comment on the FTC’s
announcement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
