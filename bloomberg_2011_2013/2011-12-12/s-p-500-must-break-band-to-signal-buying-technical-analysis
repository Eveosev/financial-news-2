The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  is
getting confined in a narrowing band between its 200-day moving
average and a line of successive lows, and the best buying
opportunity will arise only when it breaks out of that ceiling,
according to Auerbach Grayson & Co.  The so-called coil pattern, formed by lower highs and
higher lows, reflects investor indecision, and the  S&P 500 
remains vulnerable to volatility as long as it stays within that
range,  Richard Ross , a technical analyst at the New York-based
brokerage, said.  Investors should “trade in the direction of the
breakout,” buying stocks if the S&P 500 closes above 1,263, the
200-day moving average, or selling the index if it closes below
about 1,175, which is on a trend line connecting the low on Nov.
29 with that of Oct. 4.  “The market is at a deadlock,” Ross said in a telephone
interview today. “The coil is more indecisive. It speaks to
that battle between the bulls and the bears. When you finally
get a breakout from that coil, you win in a dramatic fashion and
you really want to trade in that direction.”  The benchmark U.S. equity measure lost 0.9 percent this
year through Dec. 9 and rebounded 14 percent from the Oct. 3
low. The S&P 500 hit its 200-day moving average three times this
month during intraday trading, failing to close above it.  Volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, also known as  VIX (VIX) , closed at 26.38
last week, 28 percent above its historical average of 20.56
since January 1990, Bloomberg data show.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security
or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
