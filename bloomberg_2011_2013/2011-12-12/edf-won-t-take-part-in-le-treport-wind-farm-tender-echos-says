Electricite de France SA won’t bid
to build an offshore wind farm at Le Treport in northern France,
 Les Echos  reported, citing David Corchia, chief executive
officer of EDF Energies Nouvelles.  The tender is one of five, worth a total 10 billion euros,
by the French government, according to the daily newspaper.  “We’ve taken this decision in order to concentrate on the
four other zones,” Les Echos cited Corchia as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
