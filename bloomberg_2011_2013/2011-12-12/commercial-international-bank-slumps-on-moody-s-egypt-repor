Commercial International Bank (COMI) , the
biggest publicly traded lender in  Egypt , fell after Moody’s
Investor Service said the country’s banks are increasingly
vulnerable to sovereign credit risk because of their high
exposure to government debt.  The shares of Commercial International Bank declined the
most since Nov. 22, falling 4.4 percent to 21.37 Egyptian
pounds, valuing the bank at 12.7 billion pounds ($2.1 billion).  Egypt’s political and financial instability is a “credit
negative,” Moody’s said in an e-mailed statement today. The
country’s new Cabinet is failing to address popular demands for
transition to civilian rule from military rule, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
