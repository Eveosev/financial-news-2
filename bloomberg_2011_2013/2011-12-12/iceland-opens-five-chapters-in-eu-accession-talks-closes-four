Iceland opened five more chapters in
its accession talks to join the European Union and provisionally
closed four of them.  The Atlantic island nation opened chapters on company law,
enterprise and industrial policy, trans-European networks,
judiciary and fundamental rights and financial and budgetary
provisions, and provisionally closed all but the last one, the
EU said today.  The EU noted “the high level of Iceland’s state of
preparedness and its fulfillment of obligations regarding” the
four chapters that were closed today, according to an e-mailed
statement. Of a total of 35 negotiating chapters for EU
accession, Iceland has now opened 11 and completed negotiations
in eight of them, the EU said.  European Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said he hopes
to open the remaining chapters next year. The primary challenges
facing the talks will be in matters relating to agriculture,
environment and fisheries, according to Fule.  Iceland started EU entry talks in July 2010, with no
deadline set for membership. It will probably vote on accession
in early 2013, Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson has said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
