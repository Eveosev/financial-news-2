Hoang Thach Lan, head of the
brokerage unit at Ho Chi Minh City-based MHB Securities Co., the
equity investment arm of Mekong Housing Bank, comments on the
local stock market.  The benchmark  VN Index  on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock
Exchange dropped for a fifth day, losing 0.7 percent to 374.52.  On the stock market:  “The stock market will extend losses and may go below 300
by the Lunar New Year holiday in late January.” That would be
the lowest since April 2009, according to Bloomberg data.  “Investors are quite negative about corporate earnings
this year and in doubt about the possibility of economic
improvement next year. About 80 percent of stocks on the Ho Chi
Minh exchange have seen their trading volumes plunge to a few
thousand shares a day.  ‘‘However, both stocks and properties will rebound if the
government makes any moves to support the markets, since there
are many investors who still have money but just don’t know
where and when to invest.’’  On securities companies:  ‘‘Declines in the stock market have meant almost all
securities companies face financial difficulties. More than 50
percent of securities firms will have losses this year.  ‘‘There are about 50 to 60 securities companies seeking to
sell stakes to overseas investors for strategic partnerships, so
you will see more and more mergers and acquisitions next year.’’  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
