Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Cosan SA
Industria & Comercio (CSAN3) ’s Raizen joint venture cut its investment
plan for the next five years by 20 percent, Valor Economico
reported, citing Pedro Mizutani, executive vice president of the
unit’s milling business.  Raizen expects to crush 80 million tons of sugar-cane by
2015, down from a prior estimate of 100 million tons, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said.  The venture, which can process 64.5 million tons of cane,
plans to add 7 million tons of capacity through expansions in
existing plants and the remainder through a combination of
acquisitions and new plants, Mizutani told Valor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
