Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  and
Australian stocks fell after ratings companies said last week’s
European summit did little to resolve the debt crisis, damping
investor demand for riskier assets.  American depositary receipts of  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. , Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, fell 3.1
percent from the closing price in Tokyo. Those of  Advantest
Corp. , a maker of memory-chip testers, slid 2.2 percent after
 Intel Corp . cut its sales forecast.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , an
Australian mining company, lost 1.9 percent after oil and
commodity prices fell.  Futures (TPX)  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 8,545 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,620 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,530 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200  Index (CRY)  dropped
0.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index declined 0.4
percent in Wellington.  “Nothing new came of last week’s European summit,” said
Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “If EU nations get downgraded, funding costs in
the region will definitely rise.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent
today. The index slid 1.5 percent in New York yesterday after
Moody’s Investors Service said last week’s European summit
didn’t produce “decisive” measures to end the crisis.  Fitch
Ratings , which predicted a “significant economic downturn” in
the region, said the summit did little to ease pressure on
Europe’s sovereign bond ratings.  Intel Cuts Forecast  Asian manufacturers of semiconductors and chipmaking-
equipment may decline today after Intel, the world’s largest
chipmaker, cut its sales forecast. The Santa-Clara, California-
based company said flooding in Thailand had caused a shortage of
hard-disk drives that is forcing computer makers to cut orders
for other parts.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 16 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 1.7 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 14 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.5 times for the S&P 500
and 10.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for January delivery fell $1.64 to $97.77 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Nov. 25. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
 Index  of raw materials fell 1.2 percent for a fourth day
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
