Egypt ’s pound weakened to a seven-
year lows after Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri said the
country’s economic situation is worse than expected.  The pound dropped 0.1 percent to 6.0203 against the dollar
at 12:21 p.m. in Cairo, after touching 6.0249, the lowest since
January 2005. The currency has declined 3.6 percent this year
after a popular uprising toppled President  Hosni Mubarak .
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements, was unchanged at 7.0600, a
15 percent premium to the spot rate.  Egypt may resort to borrowing abroad while austerity
measures may be needed to reign in the  budget deficit  and
counter the deterioration of the economy, Ganzouri said at a
news conference in Cairo yesterday. The government is targeting
a deficit of 8.6 percent of gross domestic product. Moody’s
Investors Services said Oct. 27 the gap may widen to more than
10 percent of GDP.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bond due April
2020 declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
7.04 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
climbed to a record 7.09 percent on Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
