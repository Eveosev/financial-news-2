Mozambique ’s central bank reduced
its benchmark  interest rate  by one percentage point to help
boost economic growth in the southern African country as
inflation slows.  The standing lending facility rate was reduced to 15
percent, the Maputo-based Bank of Mozambique said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The rate was last cut by half a percentage
point on Aug. 11. The bank kept its interest rate on the
standing deposit facility unchanged at 5 percent.  Inflation in Maputo, which is tracked by the central bank,
eased to 7.7 percent in November from 8.3 percent a month
earlier, the statistics office said Dec. 6. Mozambique’s metical
has gained 22 percent against the dollar this year, the second-
best performing currency of more than 170 tracked by Bloomberg.  The bank also said it will increase  money supply  in the
economy to as much as 35.79 billion meticais ($1.21 billion) by
the end of December. That’s an increase from the 34 billion
meticais limit for November. The central bank also reduced the
required deposit holding for banks by a quarter of a percentage
point to 8.5 percent.  The central bank plans to “cautiously” ease monetary
policy, the government said in a letter posted on the
International Monetary Fund’s website on Dec. 9. The economy
will probably expand about 8 percent a year in the “medium
term,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
