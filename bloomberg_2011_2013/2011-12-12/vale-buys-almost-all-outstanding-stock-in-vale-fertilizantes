Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s second-biggest
mining company by market value, paid 2.08 billion reais ($1.1
billion) to boost its stake in fertilizer producer  Vale
Fertilizantes SA (FFTL4)  amid strong growth in agriculture.  Vale now holds 99.99 percent of the total common shares of
the company through a subsidiary, the company said yesterday in
a statement.  Vale plans to dedicate almost 10 percent of its $21.4
billion investments for next year to the fertilizers business as
it seeks to meet rising demand for crop nutrients in Brazil, the
world’s biggest grower of sugar cane, coffee and oranges.  “It’s a sector that has a strong capacity for growth,
agriculture is robust in a moment of uncertainty,” Rogerio Freitas, who manages about $50 million at Teorica Investimentos,
said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro yesterday.  Agriculture output grew 6.9 percent in the third quarter
from a year ago, the fastest growing industry in  Brazil  and more
than triple the 2.1 percent expansion of the overall economy.
The fertilizers unit accounted for $1.04 billion, or about 6.2
percent, of Vale’s operating revenue during the third quarter,
the company said Oct. 26.  Vale announced June 22 its proposal to buy all the
outstanding shares of its fertilizers unit for 25 reais each,
canceling a previous plan for an initial public offering of the
unit. The company bought assets worth about $5.8 billion for its
fertilizer unit last year.  Vale produced 166,000 metric tons of potash and 1.93
million tons of phosphate rock last year. The company targets
output of 650,000 tons of potash and 8 million metric tons of
phosphate rock next year, according to a Nov. 28 statement.  Vale fell 1.5 percent to 38.55 reais in Sao Paulo trading
yesterday, extending a 21 percent decline this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
