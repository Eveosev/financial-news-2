Swedish industrial unions and
employers agreed on a wage deal to avert a potential labor
strike after a deadline expired last month.  Five unions representing 500,000 industrial workers agreed
to a 3 percent wage increase over the next 14 months, the
Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers, Unionen, IF Metall,
GS and Livsmedelsarbetarefoerbundet said today in separate
statements. The deal, which translates into a 2.6 percent annual
pay increase, takes effect from Feb. 1.  Unions and employers’ organizations representing almost 3
million, or about two-thirds, of Swedish workers are or will
negotiate pay deals by the end of next year with most current
agreements expiring in March and April. Deals agreed on by
industrial workers traditionally guide those in other areas.  Swedish salaries will grow an average 3.3 percent a year
between 2012 and 2014, the  central bank predicted on Oct. 27  as
it kept its  benchmark lending rate  at 2 percent and forecast
inflation will average 1.9 percent next year.  New wage deals are expected to be “compatible” with the
bank’s 2 percent inflation target, it said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
