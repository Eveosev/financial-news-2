Boeing Co. (BA)  supplier  Spirit
AeroSystems Holdings Inc. (SPR)  will move production of a wing
component on the 787 Dreamliner to  Malaysia  from Tulsa,
Oklahoma, as the company works to meet demand for parts.  The shift involves what is called the fixed leading edge
composite wing component, Spirit said today in a statement. The
Wichita, Kansas-based company said its Malaysia operation has
worked with composite materials such as those used on the 787.  Boeing’s 787 is the first airliner with a fuselage built
chiefly from plastic composites. The Dreamliner’s first delivery
was delayed more than three years as Boeing struggled with new
materials and a manufacturing process for the twin-engine jet
that included increased reliance on suppliers.  Spirit is facing “unprecedented demand,” according to the
statement, as Chicago-based Boeing boosts output of all models
by about 60 percent through 2014. Spirit builds aluminum hulls
for the 737 that are sent by rail for final assembly at the
planemaker’s commercial hub in  Seattle .  Oklahoma employees working on the Dreamliner wing part will
be moved to other airplane programs, Spirit said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
