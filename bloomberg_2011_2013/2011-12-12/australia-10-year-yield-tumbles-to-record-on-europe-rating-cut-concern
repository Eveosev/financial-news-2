Australian government bonds
advanced, pushing the 10-year note yield to a record low, amid
concern European governments face credit-rating cuts following
last weekâ€™s summit on the debt crisis.  The yield on 10-year Australian notes tumbled nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.79 percent. The three-
year yield fell 7 basis points to 3.05 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
