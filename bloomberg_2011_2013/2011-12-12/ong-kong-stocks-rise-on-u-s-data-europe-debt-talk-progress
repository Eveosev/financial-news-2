Hong Kong   stocks (HSI)  fell as Italy and
France prepared to sell debt and Moody’s Investors Service
reiterated plans to review the credit ratings of European
nations, overshadowing a debt accord reached last week.  Prada SpA , a Milan-based luxury-goods maker that gets more
than 40 percent of its sales in  Europe , sank 5.4 percent in Hong
Kong. Country Garden Holdings Co., a Guangdong-based real estate
developer, retreated 1.1 percent after a report that new home
sales in Shanghai fell. Haitong Securities Co.,  China ’s No. 3
brokerage by market value, canceled plans for an initial public
offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.1 percent to 18,575.66 at the
close, after rising as much as 1.8 percent. The volume of stocks
traded was 41 percent lower than the average over the past 10
sessions, according to Bloomberg data. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong slid
0.1 percent to 10,059.35.  “People are very cautious and trading is very light so you
can’t be too excited,” said  Alex Wong , an asset-management
director at Ample Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. “In this thin
market, people are not willing to do anything.”  The Hang Seng Index last week slid 2.4 percent amid concern
growth is slowing in countries including China, Australia and
Japan, and after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut credit
ratings on Germany, France and 13 other members of the euro.
Shares on the index traded at 10.1 times forecast earnings at
the last close, compared with 12.7 times for the S&P 500 Index.  Prada Drops  Prada sank 5.4 percent to HK$33.90.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a
clothier that gets most of its revenue from Europe, retreated
1.7 percent to HK$10.58 after rising as much as 2.2 percent.
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., a ports and telecom operator that makes
53 percent of its sales in Europe, lost 0.5 percent to HK$65.70  Hong Kong stocks slipped in late trading as the Euro Stoxx
50 Index, a benchmark for the euro region, declined before Italy
and France sell a combined 13.5 billion euros ($18 billion) of
short-term debt today. A European Union summit on the region’s
debt crisis last week offered few new measures and doesn’t
diminish the risk of credit-ranking revisions, Moody’s said.  Property Stocks Decline  A measure of property and construction companies was the
 biggest drag (HSCI)  on the Hang Seng Composite Index among its 11
industry groups. Country Garden declined 1.1 percent to HK$2.84.
China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., a state developer, fell
0.9 percent to HK$13.62.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , which
earns all of its revenue on the mainland, slid 0.5 percent to
HK$6.50.  Property consulting company Shanghai Uwin Real Estate
Information Services said Shanghai’s new home sales slumped 56
percent in the first 11 days of December from a year earlier.  Renhe Commercial Holdings Co. (1387) , a Chinese developer of
underground shopping centers, sank 8.5 percent to 86 Hong Kong
cents, extending its 9.6 percent decline on Dec. 9 after UBS AG
cut its rating on the stock to “sell” from “buy,” citing
overdue receivables.  Haitong Halts IPO  Haitong Securities Co. (665) , China’s third-biggest brokerage by
market value, canceled plans for a $1.7 billion initial public
offering in Hong Kong with shares to begin trading on Dec. 15,
said three people with knowledge of the matter. Its shares fell
0.6 percent in Shanghai. Volatile markets curbed demand for the
Shanghai-based company’s stock, said one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the process is private.  The  HSI Volatility Index  has risen 78 percent this year
through Dec. 9. It sank 7.1 percent to 29.97 today, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 8.6 percent in the benchmark
over the next 30 days. Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.3
percent to 18,490.  Among stocks that gained were exporters to the U.S. Yue
Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., which supplies Nike Inc. shoes to
the U.S., rose 2.4 percent to HK$23.45.  Techtronic Industries
Co. (669) , a maker of power tools that gets more than 70 percent of
its revenue from  North America , gained 2.2 percent to HK$7.43.  U.S. Confidence Rises  Hong Kong stocks rose in early trading after consumer
confidence rose in the U.S., the world’s biggest economy. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment rose to a six-month high of 67.7 in December
from 64.1 in November, beating estimates.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.5 percent
today. The gauge rose 1.7 percent in  New York  on Dec. 9 after
European leaders in Brussels tightened anti-deficit rules and
agreed to boost their rescue fund by as much as 200 billion
euros ($267 billion) by funneling money to the  International
Monetary Fund .  The leaders also outlined a “fiscal compact” to prevent
future debt run-ups and accelerated the start of a planned 500
billion-euro rescue fund.  “The European situation will continue to bother us into
next year as policy initiatives seem insufficient,” said Mark
Matthews, Singapore-based head of research for  Asia  at Bank
Julius Baer & Co., which has about $180 billion globally. “U.S.
economic data is improving quite nicely and that’s one of the
few bright spots in the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
