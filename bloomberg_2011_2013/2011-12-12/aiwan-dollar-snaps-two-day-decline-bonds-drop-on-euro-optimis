Taiwan ’s dollar snapped a two-day
drop after European leaders took steps to contain their debt
crisis, easing concern global growth will slow and bolstering
demand for emerging-market assets. Bonds fell.  Taiwan’s benchmark stock index rose 0.8 percent after euro-
area leaders outlined a “fiscal compact” to prevent future
debt run-ups and accelerated the start of a planned 500 billion
euro ($666 billion) bailout fund. The island’s exports increased
by the least in more than two years in November as shipments to
 Europe  slumped and faltering growth in  China  and the U.S. curbed
demand.  “The market is digesting what happened in Europe,” said
Raymond Yeung, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “Developments over the next few days
will still be highly vulnerable to external events. The
deteriorating trade outlook points to a softening” of the
island’s currency, he said.  The Taiwan dollar closed at NT$30.230 against its U.S.
counterpart in Taipei, compared with NT$30.239 on Dec. 9,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency declined 0.3 percent
last week.  Overseas shipments climbed 1.3 percent from a year earlier,
compared with an 11.7 percent pace in October, the Ministry of
Finance said on Dec. 8. That was less than the median 8.6
percent estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Government bonds  fell. The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds
due September 2021 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 1.265 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
