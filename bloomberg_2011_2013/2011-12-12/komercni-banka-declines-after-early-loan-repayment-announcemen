Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  fell on concern
that early repayment of a loan provided by Societe Generale SA,
its majority owner, will cut the Czech lender’s capital buffers.  The stock dropped 2.4 percent to 3,144 koruna by its 4:24
p.m. close in Prague, adding to a 1.8 percent retreat last week.
Komercni was the third-worst performer today in the country’s  PX (PX) 
equity index, which retreated 1.5 percent.  The board of directors approved early repayment of a 10-
year loan of 6 billion koruna ($314 million) obtained in 2006,
Prague-based Komercni Banka said in a statement on Dec. 9 after
the stock market closed. The capital adequacy ratio was 16
percent in September 2011, of which the loan’s contribution was
1.7 percent, the Czech lender said.  “The market may perceive any news about declining capital
as negative,” analysts led by Milan Vanicek at J&T Banka AS in
 Prague  wrote in an e-mail to clients today. “We consider the
news neutral because the management announced it may repay the
loan during a conference call after third-quarter earnings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
