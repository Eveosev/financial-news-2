China Three Gorges Corp. , operator
of the nation’s biggest dam, agreed to pay HK$2.1 billion ($269
million) for a 29.1 percent stake in renewable energy producer
 China Power New Energy Development Co. (735)   China  Power New Energy will issue 3.2 billion new shares at
HK$0.65 each to China Three Gorges, the Hong Kong-listed company
said in a statement to the city’s stock exchange today. China
Power New Energy said it will use the proceeds to fund power
generation projects.  China is pushing its companies to increase power generation
from alternative sources including wind and hydro as it seeks to
cut reliance on coal and oil to reduce pollution. China Three
Gorges, which operates the world’s largest hydro power dam, will
become the biggest shareholder in China Power New Energy.  The purchase will create “opportunities for the company’s
further expansion through leveraging the hydro power
capabilities and expertise” of China Three Gorges, China Power
New Energy said in the statement.  China Power New Energy gained 15 percent to 38  Hong Kong 
cents at 2:32 p.m. in in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang Seng
Index (HSI)  advanced 0.9 percent.  The sale will leave state-owned China Power Investment
Corp. as China Power New Energy’s second-biggest holder with a
25.6 percent stake. China National Offshore Oil Corp., the
nation’s largest offshore oil producer, will have 8.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
