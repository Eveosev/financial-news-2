French photographer Francois-Marie
Banier and his companion were arrested at their Paris home to
face questioning about gifts from  L’Oreal SA (OR)  heiress Liliane Bettencourt, Le Point said.  The pair will be questioned by an investigating judge in
Bordeaux, the magazine reported, without saying where it got the
information. An investigation is under way in the city over
allegations that people close to Bettencourt took advantage of
her weakened mental state for financial gain, the magazine said.  A legal battle between Banier and Bettencourt’s daughter
ended last year when they reached an agreement in which Banier
gave up his rights to 700 million euros ($926 million) in life-
insurance policies on the heiress, while retaining real estate,
artworks and cash gifts exceeding 300 million euros, the
magazine said.  Banier’s lawyer didn’t immediately return calls by
Bloomberg News for comment on the Le Point report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
