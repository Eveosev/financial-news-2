Mike Bibby said he’ll play any role
necessary after signing with the  New York Knicks , the sixth team
of his 14-year National Basketball Association career.  Bibby, a point guard, joined the Knicks as a free agent
yesterday after  Chauncey Billups  was waived to clear salary cap
space for center Tyson Chandler.  Bibby and Chandler joined their new teammates at practice
yesterday after meeting in last season’s NBA Finals, Bibby with
the Miami Heat and Chandler with the Dallas Mavericks.  “I’m going to go out and do whatever it takes to help the
team win,” Bibby said on the  Knicks’ website . “If that means
standing on the sideline cheering, that’s what I have to do. I’m
here to win and play the role they want me to play.”  Bibby, who signed a one-year contract at the veteran’s
minimum of $1.4 million, won’t replace Toney Douglas as the
Knicks’ starting point guard, the New York Post reported. The
Knicks needed another guard after waiving Billups and sending
Andy Rautins to the Mavericks to acquire Chandler.  Bibby, 33, has averaged 15.2 points and 5.7 assists during
his career. He played with three teams last season, including 22
regular-season games in Miami, where he averaged 7.3 points and
2.5 assists. In the Heat’s loss to  Dallas  in the NBA Finals, he
averaged 3.8 points and one assist in five games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
