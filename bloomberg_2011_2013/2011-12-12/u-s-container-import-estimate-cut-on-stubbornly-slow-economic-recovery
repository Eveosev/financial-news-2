The U.S. will import 2.8 percent
more containerized goods next year, down from a previous
forecast of 4.7 percent, The Journal of Commerce/PIERS said,
blaming a “stubbornly slow” economic recovery.  The projected growth for next year would still be higher
than this year’s estimated 2.2 percent gain, and a three-year
contraction that ended with a 15 percent slump in 2009,
according to data from  Newark , New Jersey-based PIERS, a unit of
UBM Global. Imports will reach 17.4 million twenty-foot-
equivalent units next year, compared with 16.9 million in 2011.  “We still have an uncomfortably high  unemployment  rate,
and sales of homes are still not as strong as we want them to
be,” said Mario O. Moreno, an economist with The Journal of
Commerce-UBM Global Trade based in Newark,  New Jersey . “Those
things affect imports because most of the items we import are
 consumer goods .”  The  U.S. economy , the world’s largest, will expand 1.8
percent next year, compared with 1.5 percent in 2011, the
Washington-based International Monetary Fund estimates. That
compares with projected global growth of 4 percent. Unemployment
is running at 8.6 percent, almost twice the 4.4 percent rate in
mid-2007, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show.  Container Ships  The global fleet of container ships expanded 17 percent to
a near-record 4,774 vessels in the past four years, data from
IHS Fairplay show. The cost for taking a 40-foot container to
the U.S. West Coast from  Shanghai  tumbled 28 percent $1,419 this
year, according to data from London-based Clarkson Plc, the
world’s biggest shipbroker. About $700 of that is a fuel
surcharge, according to Copenhagen-based A.P. Moeller-Maersk AS.  Containerized imports from  Asia  to the U.S. West Coast will
advance 2.7 percent next year, compared with an earlier estimate
of 5.9 percent, The Journal of Commerce/PIERS predicts. That’s
the world’s largest inter-regional trade lane for shipping
manufactured goods such as furniture, televisions and car parts,
according to Clarkson.  The London shipbroker cut its estimate for this year’s
growth in trade on the Asia-to-U.S. route to 1.5 percent from
6.1 percent in November. The global trade prediction was cut to
8.3 percent from 9 percent.  World trade in goods and services will expand 5.8 percent
next year, compared with 7.5 percent this year and 12.8 percent
in 2010, the Washington-based IMF estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
