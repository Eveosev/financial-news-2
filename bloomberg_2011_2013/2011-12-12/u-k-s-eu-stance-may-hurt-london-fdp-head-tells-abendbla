The U.K.’s opposition to an
amendment of European Union rules aimed at helping the euro may
backfire as it is in  London ’s interest to operate in a stable
global financial system,  Hamburger Abendblatt  reported, citing
an interview with the General Secretary of  Germany ’s Free
Democrats Christian Lindner.  Lindner said bringing stability to the global financial
system is “vital” to London’s interest as a financial capital,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
