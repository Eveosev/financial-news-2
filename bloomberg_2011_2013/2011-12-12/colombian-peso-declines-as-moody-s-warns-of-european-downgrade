Colombia ’s peso declined after
Moody’s Investors Service said it will review the ratings of
European Union nations, cutting into appetite for higher-
yielding emerging-market assets.  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 1,932.35 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:34 a.m. Bogota time, from 1,925.50 on Dec. 9. The currency has
slipped 1.1 percent in the past month.  Moody’s said today that it will review the ratings of all
EU countries in the first quarter because last week’s regional
summit failed to produce “decisive policy measures” to end the
debt crisis. At the summit, euro-zone leaders agreed to a fiscal
accord to create more oversight of budget policies and create
automatic penalties for countries violating deficit rules.  “ Europe  is again the common denominator that’s driving
declines in stocks and currencies” including the Colombian
peso, said Patricia Gonzalez, an analyst at Banco de Bogota SA,
the nation’s second-biggest bank.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.57 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.062
centavo to 119.227 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
