Overseas  investors  sold a net  2.92
billion rupees  ($55.9 million) of Indian stocks on Dec. 9,
increasing their withdrawals from the equities this year to 8.61
billion rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 17.7 billion rupees of shares and sold
20.6 billion rupees, the Securities and Exchange Board of  India 
said  today . They bought a net 22 billion rupees of bonds, taking
total flows into debt this year to 313.2 billion rupees.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has dropped 23 percent this
year, the worst performer in  Asia , on concern a slowdown in the
U.S. and  Europe ’s debt crisis may erode company profits already
threatened by the most aggressive interest-rate increases among
major Asian economies.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market, Asia’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds  have placed 4.462 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.1 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
