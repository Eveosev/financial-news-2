U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums
weakened after Petroleo Brasileiro SA shut a coker at its
Pasadena refinery in Texas Dec. 10.  Ciro Ribeiro, a Houston-based spokesman for the refinery,
said he would have an update later today and didn’t say if the
plant was at reduced rates when asked in an e-mail. Yesterday he
said no other units were affected.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium narrowed 10 cents to $11.80
a barrel at 2:34 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI was unchanged
at $11.45 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI decreased 75 cents to $8.75.
The premium for Mars Blend narrowed 5 cents to $7.05 a barrel.
 Poseidon  gained 25 cents to $6.45 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium increased 10 cents to $6 a
barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount was unchanged at 80 cents.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  widened 60 cents a
barrel to $15.35.  Syncrude ’s premium added 20 cents to $2.50 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
