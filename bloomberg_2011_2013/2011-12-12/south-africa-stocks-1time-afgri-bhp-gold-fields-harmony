The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
declined for a third day, falling 362.86, or 1.1 percent, to
32,270.06 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The index gained
less than 0.1 percent last week.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the mining company that makes
up more than 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , dropped for
a fifth day, losing 2 percent to 303.10 rand. Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of Commodities retreated as Moody’s Investors Service

declined for a fourth day, sliding 1.7 percent to 244.73 rand.  Central Rand Gold Ltd. (CRD)  , a gold miner, gained the
most in almost three months, adding 80 percent to 9 cents.  South
Africa ’s Department of Mineral Resources agreed to set aside a
decision canceling its mining right, the company said in a
regulatory filing.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , the country’s second-biggest
producer, slipped for a third day, falling 3 percent to 130.24

dimming the appeal of the metal as an alternative investment.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. (HAR)  , the third-biggest
gold miner, retreated 2.5 percent to 106.74 rand.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the second-biggest
producer of the metal, declined for the first time in four days,

mine inspections, J.P. Morgan Cazenove said.  Pioneer Foods Ltd. (PFG)  , a food producer, fell for the
first time in eight days, slipping 2.9 percent to 57.75 rand.
Rival Unilever NV plans to invest 500 million euros ($663
million) in its South African plants over the next five years to
better compete against Pioneer Foods and Tiger Brands Ltd. in

chief supply chain officer, said in an interview on Dec. 9.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the maker of Grolsch and Peroni
