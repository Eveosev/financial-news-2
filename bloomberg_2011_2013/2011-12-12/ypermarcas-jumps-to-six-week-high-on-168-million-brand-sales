Hypermarcas SA , the maker of more
than 180 consumer products, rose to a six-week high after it
agreed to sell some brands to Bunge Ltd. and Quimica Amparo
Ltda. for as much as 305 million reais ($168 million).  Shares gained 1.7 percent to 8.95 reais at 11:40 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo  after earlier jumping as much as 3.4 percent to 9.10
reais, the highest since Oct. 31. The benchmark Bovespa index
slid 0.8 percent.  “We view this sale of non-core assets as a positive step
that will foster operational improvements in the core divisions,
on which management will now be able to concentrate its
attention and resources,” Banco Itau BBA analysts Juliana Rozenbaum and Francine Martins wrote in a note to clients today.  Hypermarcas agreed to sell the Salsaretti, Puropure and
Etti food brands to Bunge for 180 million reais, according to a
statement the Sao Paulo-based company sent to  Brazil ’s
securities regulator.  In a separate statement, Hypermarcas said it sold its
Perfex, Cross Hatch and the Assolan cleaning brands to Quimica
Amparo for as much as 125 million reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
