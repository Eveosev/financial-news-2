India ’s rupee tumbled to a record
low after industrial production declined for the first time in
more than two years.  The currency fell 1.5 percent, the most in three weeks, as
the  Central Statistical Office  said  factory output  shrank 5.1
percent in October from a year earlier, compared with the median
estimate for a 0.7 percent contraction in a Bloomberg News
survey. That was the first drop in output since June 2009. The
 Reserve Bank of India  sold dollars today to curb the rupee’s
slide, according to IndusInd Bank Ltd.  “The bearish sentiment is very strong and there is nothing
going for the rupee,” said J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based
executive vice president at IndusInd. “The RBI has been
intervening intermittently today at various levels.”  The rupee declined to 52.8350 per dollar in Mumbai, from
52.0425 on Dec. 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
fell to an unprecedented low of 52.84 earlier, breaching the
previous record of 52.73 on Nov. 22. The currency may fall to 54
if the euro, currently trading at $1.3255, declines to $1.30,
Harding predicts.  The  Reserve Bank  “does not comment on day-to-day market
movements,” Mumbai-based spokeswoman Alpana Killawala said. The
central bank sold $943 million of foreign currency in October,
compared with $845 million in the previous month, according to a
monthly bulletin released on its website today.  The rupee has lost 15.4 percent this year, the worst
performance among Asian currencies.  ’Risk Aversion’  The rupee also fell as investors sought the dollar’s
relative safety on concern European leaders will struggle to
contain their region’s debt crisis. The Dollar Index, which
tracks the U.S. currency’s performance against six major trading
partners, rose 0.7 percent.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares fell the most in
 Asia  today as exchange data showed foreign investors cut
 holdings  of local shares by $148 million this year through Dec.
9, after adding $29 billion in 2010.  “The recent  risk aversion  in global financial markets has
exposed the vulnerability of India’s macro conditions,” Morgan
Stanley’s Hong Kong-based economist  Chetan Ahya , wrote in a
report published today. “Both trade and capital flows will
likely maintain their downward pressure on the currency.”  Morgan Stanley estimates the Indian currency will fall to
54.80 by the second quarter of 2012.  Three-month offshore rupee forwards traded at 53.75 to the
dollar, compared with 53.25 on Dec. 9. Forwards are agreements
to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
