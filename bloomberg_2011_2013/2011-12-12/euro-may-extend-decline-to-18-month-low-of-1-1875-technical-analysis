The euro is poised to fall to an 18-
month low of $1.1875 after failing to follow through a rally late
last week, Societe Generale SA said, citing trading patterns.  After the “bounce” on Dec. 9 proved short-lived, the 17-
nation currency is now heading down toward so-called support at
its Oct. 4 low of $1.3145, technical analysts Hugues Naka and
Fabien Manac’h wrote today in a note to clients. If the currency
drops below that level, the next target would be $1.2860, close
to the weakest this year, they said.  “The likely break below $1.3145 should open the door to an
extension of the medium-term downtrend” toward the June 2010
low of $1.1875, the Paris-based analysts wrote.  The euro weakened 1 percent to $1.3248 at 2:21 p.m. London
time, after rising 0.3 percent on Dec. 9. The currency has
fallen 7.7 percent in the past six months.  Support refers to an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency and its related
instruments. The stronger the support, the more selling is
needed for a drop below that level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
