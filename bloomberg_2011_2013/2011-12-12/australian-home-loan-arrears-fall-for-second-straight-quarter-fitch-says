Australian home loan delinquencies
fell for a second quarter as a strong jobs market boosted
households’ ability to repay mortgages,  Fitch Ratings  said.  The number of homeowners behind on mortgage payments by
more than 30 days dropped by 17 basis points to 1.52 percent in
the third quarter, according to the London-based ratings firm’s
Australian residential mortgage performance index.  “The  unemployment rate  was 5.3 percent as at November
2011, the economy is strong and the recent rate cuts passed on
to borrowers will likely offset some of the increased Christmas
and holiday season pressure anticipated,” Courtney Miller, an
analyst at Fitch, wrote in the statement. “Softening  house
prices  could impact future 90-plus days delinquencies.”  The number of “low-doc” loans more than 30 days late
declined to 6.4 percent in the third quarter from 6.6 percent in
the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
