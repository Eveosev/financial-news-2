Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
biggest state-owned exporter, will supply full contracted crude
volumes to Asian buyers in January, according to four regional
refiners who received notification from the producer.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will provide 100
percent of supplies sold under long-term contracts for a 26th
month, according to the refiners in  South Korea ,  Japan  and
 China , who declined to be identified because of confidentiality
agreements with the Dhahran-based seller. Aramco officials in
Tokyo and Beijing were not available for comment when contacted
by phone and e-mail today.  Crude shipments from  Saudi Arabia  to the Asia-Pacific
region were 4.26 million barrels a day in 2010, or about 64
percent of total exports, according to OPEC’s annual statistical
bulletin. The country raised crude output to more than 10
million barrels a day last month in response to customer demand,
Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi said Dec. 6.  While Saudi Aramco has the option to reduce monthly sales
volumes to term buyers, the largest Mideast producer has not
done so for more than two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
