Palm oil  dropped to the lowest level
in more than a week on concern rising soybean stockpiles will
boost global vegetable oil supplies and as exports from
 Malaysia , the second-biggest producer, fell.  The February-delivery contract declined as much as 1.2
percent to 3,046 ringgit ($966) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest level since Dec. 2, and traded
at 3,051 ringgit at 11:58 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures gained
0.7 percent last week.  Global soybean  reserves  will be 1.5 percent bigger than
last month’s estimate and U.S. stockpiles will rise 15 percent
to a five-year high, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on
Dec. 9. The forecast for U.S. exports was cut to 1.3 billion
bushels from 1.325 billion in November. That compares with 1.501
billion bushels in the previous year.  “Palm oil is reacting as a spill-over effect to the lower
close in  Chicago  after the USDA reported higher soybean
stockpiles,” Ryan Long, vice president of futures and options
at OSK Holdings Bhd., said by phone from Kuala Lumpur.  Soybeans fell on Dec. 9 by as much as 2.9 percent to
$11.0025 a bushel, the lowest price for the most-active contract
since Oct. 8, 2010. The January-delivery contract gained as much
as 0.7 percent to $11.15 on the Chicago Board of Trade today.  Palm oil exports from Malaysia declined 5.1 percent to
443,699 tons during the first 10 days of December from the same
period a month earlier, according to surveyor Intertek.  Palm oil for delivery in May retreated as much as 1.6
percent to 7,842 yuan ($1,233) per ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange . Soybean oil for September delivery declined as much as
1.2 percent to 8,726 yuan per ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
