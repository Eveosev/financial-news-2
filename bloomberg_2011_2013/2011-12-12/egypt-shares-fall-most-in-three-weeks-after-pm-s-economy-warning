Egyptian shares declined the most in
almost three weeks after Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri said
austerity measures may be required to counter a deterioration of
the economy.  Orascom Construction Industries , the country’s largest
publicly traded builder, fell for a sixth day.  Commercial
International Bank  SAE, the biggest publicly traded lender,
declined the most since Nov. 22. The benchmark EGX 30 Index lost
2.1 percent, the biggest drop since Nov. 22, to 3,882.17 at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  El-Ganzouri’s government inherited an economy that grew at
the slowest pace in at least a decade after turmoil that
accompanied  Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster in February stifled tourism
and deterred foreign investment. The prime minister’s remarks
outweighed an announcement from Orascom it won a $100 million
share in a contract and a statement by  Six of October
Development & Investment Co. (OCDI)  it sold all units available in the
Westown Residences project in two days.  “The political and economic situation overshadows any
positive company news,” said Mohamed Radwan, head of
international sales at Pharos Holding for Financial Investment
in Cairo. “In general, the mood is bearish.”  The pound dropped 0.1 percent to 6.0231 against the dollar
at 4:15 p.m. in Cairo. The currency has declined 3.6 percent
this year after a popular uprising toppled Mubarak. The
country’s international reserves tumbled 44 percent in the first
11 months, according to central bank data.  Orascom Construction  lost 0.8 percent to 207.51 pounds.
Commercial International Bank plunged 4.4 percent to 21.37
pounds. Six of October tumbled 3.8 percent to 10.16 pounds, the
lowest level since February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
