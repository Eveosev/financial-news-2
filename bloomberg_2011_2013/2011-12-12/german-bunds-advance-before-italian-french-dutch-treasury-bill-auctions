Italian and Spanish bonds led
declines in  Europe ’s higher-yielding sovereign debt after
Moody’s Investors Service said measures agreed at last week’s
leaders’ summit don’t go far enough to stem the crisis.  German and Dutch  two-year yields  fell to euro-era records
as investors sought safer assets after Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said the onus is on governments rather than the
European Central Bank to resolve the crisis. Italy’s two-year
 notes  erased losses as the ECB was said to buy the nation’s
securities and borrowing costs declined at a sale of one-year
bills. Treasuries advanced and the euro weakened.  “Italian and Spanish bonds are falling because of the
bigger euro-region picture,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior
fixed-income strategist at UniCredit Global Research in Milan.
“The summit didn’t do enough to turn around market expectations
about the  European Central Bank  taking a bigger role to solve
the crisis. The Italian auction results were fairly good.”  Italian 10-year yields climbed 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 6.54 percent at 4:20 p.m. London time. The
4.75 percent bond due in September 2021 fell 1.170, or 11.70
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,321) face amount to 87.935. Two-year
note yields dropped two basis points to 5.93 percent, after
gaining as much as 53 basis points.  Spanish 10-year  rates  rose four basis points to 5.78
percent, after earlier climbing above 6 percent for the first
time since Dec. 1.  Risk of Revisions  European leaders unveiled a blueprint after meetings on
Dec. 8 and 9 for a closer fiscal accord to save the euro, adding
200 billion euros to their bailout fund and tightening rules to
curb future debts. They also agreed to start a 500 billion-euro
rescue fund next year.  The agreement offered few new measures and doesn’t diminish
the risk of credit-ranking revisions, Moody’s said in its Weekly
Credit Outlook. “In the absence of any decisive policy
initiatives that stabilize credit-market conditions effectively,
our intention as announced in November is to revisit the level
and dispersion of ratings during the first quarter of 2012,”
the company said.  Ten-year German yields fell 11 basis points to 2.04
percent. The  two-year rate  dropped six basis points to 0.265
percent, after declining to a record 0.25 percent. Dutch  two-
year yields  reached a euro-era low 0.356 percent.  ‘Too Many Issues’  “There’s an element of flight to quality in the market,”
said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at Monument
Securities Ltd. in London. “The analysis of the euro-region
summit is that it simply isn’t enough and there are far too many
issues to be clarified, so bunds are well bid.”  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index  dropped 1.7 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  fell 1.7 percent. The euro declined
as much as 1.3 percent to a two-month low of $1.3209. The 10-
year Treasury yield slid five basis points to 2.01 percent.  German bunds gained for the fourth time in five days as
Weidmann damped speculation the ECB will extend its role to help
end the debt crisis. While the agreement on Dec. 9 to limit
budget deficits represents “progress,” governments rather than
the ECB should resolve the crisis with financial backing, he
told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.  Italian Auction  Italian notes reversed losses as people with knowledge of
the transactions said the ECB bought the securities along with
Irish debt. The people declined to be identified because the
trades are confidential. A spokeswoman for the ECB in  Frankfurt 
declined to comment.  Yields on Ireland’s 5 percent bond due in October 2020
climbed 10 basis points to 8.82 percent.  The ECB said it settled 635 million euros of bond purchases
in the week through Dec. 9, down from 3.7 billion euros the
previous week. The central bank will take seven-day term
deposits tomorrow to absorb the 207.5 billion euros of liquidity
created since its bond program started on May 10 last year to
ensure the purchases don’t fuel inflation.  Italy sold 7 billion euros of 12-month Treasury bills at an
average yield of 5.952 percent, compared with 6.087 percent at
the previous auction of the securities on Nov. 10. Demand from
investors declined to 1.92 times the amount on offer from 1.99.  The Netherlands sold 1.12 billion euros of bills due March
2012 at a yield of minus 0.007 percent, the Dutch State Treasury
Agency said.  France, Austria  French 10-year bonds stayed lower as the nation sold 4
billion euros of 13-week bills at an average yield of 0.222
percent. The nation also auctioned 308-day bills and 182-day
bills. Ten-year  yields  climbed two basis points to 3.29 percent.  Greece  is scheduled to sell 1.25 billion euros of six-month
bills tomorrow, and  Spain  plans to offer 12- and 18-month debt.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold French and
Austrian 10-year bonds instead of  Germany ’s widened on concern
 Standard & Poor’s  will cut the two nations’ top credit ratings.  S&P said Dec. 5 that 15 euro nations face having their
rankings lowered as “continuing disagreements” among policy
makers on how to tackle the debt crisis risks damaging their
financial stability.  The  spread  between French and German 10-year yields widened
13 basis points to 125 basis points. The  gap  between similar-
maturity Austrian securities and German bunds expanded five
basis points to 112 basis points.  German bonds have returned 7.6 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Italian debt lost 7 percent
and French securities gained 3.3 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
