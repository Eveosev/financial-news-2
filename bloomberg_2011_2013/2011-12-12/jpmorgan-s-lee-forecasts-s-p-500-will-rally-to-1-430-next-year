Thomas Lee , chief U.S. equity
strategist at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , estimated the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index will rally to 1,430 next year and recommended
financial stocks.  Lee’s forecast is 14 percent higher than the closing level
on Dec. 9 of 1,255.19. He estimated  combined profit by companies (SPX) 
in the benchmark equity gauge will be $105 a share in 2012 and
$110 in 2013. Based on his projection for earnings in 2013, the
 S&P 500  will trade at a price-earnings multiple of 13 times,
according to a note dated Dec. 9.  “The consensus view is that visibility remains murky and
with significant tail risks” such as Europe’s debt crisis and
fiscal tightening in  China , Lee said. “2012 may look a bit like
2009,” he wrote. “Emergence from a financial crisis and the
potential for acceleration of the business cycle driven by
Europe exiting a recession and China easing” may boost cyclical
stocks. Financials, which may be helped by Republican gains in
the U.S. election, are his “top pick,” he said.  Financials have plunged 21 percent in 2011, the most of the
 10 groups in the S&P 500 (SPXL1) , as investors fled banks and insurers
on concern Europe’s debt crisis will spread. Material and
industrial shares had the next biggest declines, falling 13
percent and 5 percent, respectively. In 2009, from the S&P 500’s
bottom on March 9, 2009, through the end of the year, financials
surged 131 percent, while consumer discretionary, industrials
and materials jumped at least 83 percent.  Lee’s S&P 500 estimate is the second-highest of 11
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg, who on average forecast the
measure will climb to 1,350 next year.  The S&P 500 fell 1.5 percent to 1,236.47 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The measure has lost 1.7 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
