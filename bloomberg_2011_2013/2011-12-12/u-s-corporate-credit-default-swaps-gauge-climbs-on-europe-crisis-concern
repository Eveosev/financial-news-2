A benchmark gauge of U.S. credit
risk rose as Moody’s Investors Service said it will review the
ratings of European Union nations after last week’s summit
failed to produce decisive steps to end the debt crisis.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
added 3.7 basis points to a mid-price of 125.6 basis points as
of 5:18 p.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd.  The measure increased as European leaders’ fifth agreement
in 19 months aimed at fixing the region’s sovereign crisis is
failing to ease stress in debt markets, with 10-year Italian
government bond yields climbing above 6.5 percent after falling
on Dec. 9. Moody’s said there was the chance of “more severe
scenarios,” including “multiple defaults” and “exits from
the euro area.”  The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, has climbed from 119.6 on
Dec. 7 on investor concern that  Europe ’s fiscal crisis may
spread, infecting bank balance sheets worldwide. The gauge had
previously dropped from 146 on Nov. 25.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
