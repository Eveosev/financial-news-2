Mexico ’s peso dropped the most in
three weeks after a report showed industrial production rose
less than forecast and Moody’s Investors Service said it will
review the ratings of all European Union countries.  The peso declined 1.9 percent to 13.8342 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:54 a.m. in Mexico City, from 13.5744 on Dec. 9. The currency
fell 2.1 percent on Nov. 21. Earlier today it tumbled as much as
2.3 percent to 13.8832, the weakest since Nov. 29. Local markets
are closed for a national holiday today.  Disappointment spread after last week’s summit on the
European debt crisis offered few new measures, with all except
three of the top 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg declining today. Mexico’s factory output rose 3.3
percent in October from a year earlier, the national statistics
agency said today, trailing the 3.9 percent median estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “It’s the global combined with the lack of liquidity
because the Mexican market is off,”  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin
America currency strategist at Scotia Capital Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Toronto.  The weaker-than-forecast industrial production data in
Mexico may also have fueled the peso’s decline, according to
Suarez.  “That should have an impact,” he said. “The numbers had
been quite good and this one actually disappointed.”  Europe Debt Summit  European leaders unveiled a blueprint after meetings on
Dec. 8 and 9 for a closer fiscal accord, adding 200 billion
euros ($264 billion) to their bailout fund and tightening rules
to curb future debts. They also said they would start a 500-
billion-euro rescue fund next year.  The agreement offered few additional measures and doesn’t
diminish the risk of credit-ranking revisions, Moody’s said in
its Weekly Credit Outlook. “Our intention as announced in
November is to revisit the level and dispersion of ratings
during the first quarter of 2012,” the company said.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.61 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of the
security fell 0.24 centavo to 129.52 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
