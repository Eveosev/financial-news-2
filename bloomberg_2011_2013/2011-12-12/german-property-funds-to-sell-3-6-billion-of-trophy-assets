DJE Kapital AG  said its investment
unit closed a property fund with assets of 225 million euros
($291 million) because of “difficult” market conditions.  The DJE Real Estate fund was closed yesterday after a large
number of investors withdrew their money, DJE Investment SA said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Germany ’s 85 billion-euro real-estate mutual fund industry
may be facing the biggest crisis in its 50-year history. A dozen
of the 44 funds, which own 28 percent of the industry’s assets,
are liquidating or have suspended redemptions, according to
Frankfurt-based  BVI Bundesverband Investment & Asset Management .  DJE Kapital is based in Pullach, a town near Munich,
according to its website. DJE Investment’s headquarters are in
Luxembourg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
