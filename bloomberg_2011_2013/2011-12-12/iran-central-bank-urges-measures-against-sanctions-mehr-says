Iran  needs to come up with solutions
to face western countries’ punitive measures that target its
central bank,  Mehr  reported, citing Mahmoud Bahmani, the bank’s
governor.  The country needs to be managed as if it was under siege
for two years and needed to survive, Bahmani said yesterday,
according to a report published by the state-run  news agency . He
didn’t elaborate on what the counter measures may be.  Bahmani said the central bank had worked toward decreasing
foreign currency prices. It was challenged after the Nov. 29 mob
attack on the U.K embassy in Tehran, which affected foreign
currency prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
