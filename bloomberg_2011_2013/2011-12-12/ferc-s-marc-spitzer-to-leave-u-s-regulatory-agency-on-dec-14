U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission member Marc Spitzer will leave the agency Dec. 14, he
said in a statement.  “I am grateful for the dedication and hard work of the
employees of this agency to ensure a reliable supply of energy
to the people of our nation at just and reasonable rates,” he
said.  Spitzer, 54, a former chairman of the Arizona Corporation
Commission, was appointed to the U.S. agency by President  George W. Bush  in 2006. His five-year term expired on June 30.  Spitzer’s departure leaves the commission with four
commissioners. The agency on Nov. 30 held a conference to
consider the effects of pending Environmental Protection Agency
rules on the U.S. power-grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
