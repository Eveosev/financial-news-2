The  New York Giants  rallied for a
37-34 win over the  Dallas Cowboys  to end a four-game losing
streak and tie for the division lead.  Brandon Jacobs had a one-yard touchdown run with 46 seconds
left at Cowboys Stadium as the Giants (7-6) avoided their
longest losing skid since 2004 while staying in the hunt for a
National Football League playoff berth. The Giants blocked a 47-
yard field goal attempt with one second left to pull out the win
in a game that featured eight lead changes.   A loss would have dropped the Giants two games behind the
Cowboys in the NFC East and also two games back in the race for
an NFC wild card spot. The rivals are now tied atop the division
with three games left, including a Jan. 1 matchup in East
Rutherford,  New Jersey , to end the regular season.  The  New York Jets  beat Kansas City 37-10 earlier today and
improved their chances of making the NFL playoffs as Cincinnati,
Tennessee and Oakland all lost. Mark Sanchez threw two touchdown
passes and ran for a pair of scores as the Jets (8-5) pushed
their winning streak to three games  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
