The winter wheat in Ukraine that’s
emerged was 22 percent smaller than a year earlier by Dec. 8
after the driest autumn in at least 50 years, UkrAgroConsult, a
research company, said.  Winter wheat sprouted on 5.14 million hectares (12.7
million acres), down from 6.63 million hectares a year earlier,
UkrAgroConsult said in e-mailed statement today.  Winter wheat in “good” condition amounted to 1.41 million
hectares, down from 3.66 million hectares a year earlier, the
company said. The amount of “weak” wheat covered 1.71 million
hectares, up from 483,100 hectares a year earlier, the
researcher said.  Winter grains sprouted on about 77 percent of planted areas
as of Dec. 8 compared with 71 percent a week earlier after some
rains helped wheat and barley to emerge in some regions, the
researcher said. Crops on 1.3 million hectares probably won’t
emerge, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
