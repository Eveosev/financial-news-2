Hungary’s government plans budget
savings of 120 billion forints ($516 million) in response to
slowing economic growth, less than the 200 billion forint
announced today, news website  hvg.hu  reported, citing an
unidentified person in the ruling party.  The Cabinet is struggling to provide the required savings
because it is late in the year to rework the 2012 budget draft,
hvg.hu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
