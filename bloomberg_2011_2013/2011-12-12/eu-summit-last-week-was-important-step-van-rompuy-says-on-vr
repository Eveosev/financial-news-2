The European Union summit last week
in Brussels marked an “important step” in fighting the
sovereign-debt crisis, EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  said on
Belgian radio.  “We again took an important step toward greater stability
of the euro zone,”  Van Rompuy  said today in an interview with
 VRT-Radio 1 . “The biggest and most important measure that we
can take to stimulate growth is to get back to financial
stability in the euro zone.”  European leaders at an all-night summit Dec. 8-9 agreed to
a “fiscal compact” and more disciplined economic policy to
prevent future debt crises.  “Without budget derailments, without the sleeping pill
that the euro became during the last 10 years,” the debt crisis
could have been avoided, Van Rompuy said. “Without that, we
wouldn’t have a crisis in the euro zone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
