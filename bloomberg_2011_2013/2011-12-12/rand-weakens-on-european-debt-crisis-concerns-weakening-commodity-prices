The rand weakened against the dollar
after concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will persist curbed
demand for commodities and riskier emerging-market assets.  South Africa’s currency depreciated as much as 2 percent
and traded 1.7 percent weaker at 8.2355 per dollar as of 4:12
p.m. in Johannesburg, extending last week’s 0.7 percent retreat.
It fell 0.6 percent against the euro to 10.9067.  The accord European Union leaders agreed to last week at a
summit in Brussels provides tighter budget deficit rules and an
additional 200 billion euros ($267 billion) in bilateral loans
to the  International Monetary Fund  to assist the euro area
bailout. The summit offered few new measures and doesn’t
diminish the risk of credit-ranking revisions, Moody’s Investors
Service said in its Weekly Credit Outlook today.  “We are yet to see a tangible recovery in global risk
appetite, and the recent EU summit on the debt crisis did not
offer any cause for relief,”  Benoit Anne , the London-based head
of emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA, and
colleagues said in an e-mail. “It is way too early to turn
bullish on global  emerging markets , especially in the high-beta
EM currency space.”  Copper declined on speculation that a slowdown in  China ’s
industrial output will increase stockpiles in the biggest
consumer and concern that Europe’s debt crisis will persist even
after leaders agreed to a fiscal accord.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 2.5
percent to $7,617.25 a metric ton, adding to last week’s 1
percent decline.  Commodities make up 50 percent to 60 percent of South
Africa’s total exports, according to Rand Merchant Bank.  South Africa ’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 retreated for a
sixth day, driving the yield up 7.2 basis points, or 0.072
percentage point, to 6.855 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
