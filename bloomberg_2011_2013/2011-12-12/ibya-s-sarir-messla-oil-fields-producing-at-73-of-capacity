Libya’s Sarir and Messla fields in
the east of the country are producing at 73 percent of capacity,
according to state-run National Oil Corp.  Sarir’s output is 160,000 barrels a day, compared with a
maximum of 220,000 barrels, and Messla is pumping 75,000 barrels
of its 100,000-barrel limit, the Tripoli-based company, known as
NOC, said on its website. The two fields are owned and operated
by state-owned Arabian Gulf Oil Co, which is based in Benghazi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
