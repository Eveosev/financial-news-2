Moody’s Investors Service said that
resilient growth and further fiscal tightening are credit
positive for  Bulgaria .  “Despite a large slippage in the 2009 budget position
during the global and domestic recession, the Bulgarian
government has since reverted to a tight fiscal policy stance,
implying a measurable improvement in creditworthiness that in
July 2011 led to the only sovereign rating upgrade in the
European Union since the global crisis began in 2007,” analysts
Kristin Lindow and Renzo Merino wrote in Moody’s Weekly Credit
Outlook today.  “Continued positive growth, as well as fiscal
consolidation measures, will help Bulgaria remain one of the
very few low debt countries in  Europe ,” the analysts said.  Moody’s in July raised Bugaria’s rating to Baa2, the
second-lowest investment grade.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
