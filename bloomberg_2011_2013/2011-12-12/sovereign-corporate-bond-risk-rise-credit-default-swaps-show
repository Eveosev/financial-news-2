The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments jumped 13 basis points to 376.5 at 9 a.m. in London,
approaching the record 385 set Nov. 25. An increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 20.5 basis
points to 770.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings climbed six basis points to 179.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 11 basis points to 307 and
the subordinated index rose 17.5 to 547.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
