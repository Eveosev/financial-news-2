Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Asiaâ€™s
largest international carrier, will install new coach seats in
long-haul planes and add Internet connectivity as it contends
with rising competition from Chinese and regional airlines.  The new economy-class seats, which will be introduced in
March, will feature a cradle mechanism for reclining and outlets
that will let passengers watch contents from Apple Inc. iPhones
and iPads on the inflight entertainment system, according to an
e-mailed statement today. The Wi-Fi will be available for all 
passengers, Chief Executive Officer John Slosar told reporters.  Cathay also in March plans to add premium-economy cabins,
fitted with 26 to 34 seats, as Singapore Airlines Ltd. and China
Southern Airlines Co. seek to lure passengers with Airbus SAS
A380s. The carrier has already begun rolling out a new business-
class seat to retain lucrative business travelers.  Premium Economy will initially be featured on flights to
Sydney, Toronto,  Vancouver  and New York, followed by London,  Los
Angeles ,  San Francisco , continental Europe and other long-haul
routes, according to the statement. The product will be fitted
in 87 planes by the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
