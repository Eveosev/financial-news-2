U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  and the Canadian
government reached a settlement to end a court dispute over the
company’s 2007 takeover of steelmaker Stelco Inc., Industry
Minister Christian Paradis said.  U.S. Steel agreed to maintain operations in  Canada  until
2015 and make C$50 million ($48.7 million) in additional capital
investments beyond the C$200 million it originally promised,
Paradis said today in the country’s parliament.  “U.S. Steel has given significant new and enhanced
undertakings under the Investment Canada Act,” Paradis said in
a  statement . “I have requested that the Attorney General of
Canada discontinue the Government’s court action.”  Canada took Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel to court in 2009
under the country’s foreign-takeover laws after it said the
company hadn’t complied with pledges it made on spending,
output, and research and development following the Stelco deal.
Last month, Canada’s  Supreme Court  rejected U.S. Steel’s
constitutional challenge of those laws.  U.S. Steel, the largest U.S. steelmaker by volume, will
continue to operate at the Lake Erie and Hamilton plants in
Ontario until 2015, according to the statement. It will also
contribute C$3 million toward community and education programs
in Hamilton and Nanticoke.  “We are pleased to have resolved amicably this unfortunate
dispute with the government,” U.S. Steel said in an e-mailed
statement. “The resolution reflects our ongoing and long term
interest in doing business in Canada.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
