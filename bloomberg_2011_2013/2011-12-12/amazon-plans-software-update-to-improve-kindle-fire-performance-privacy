Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the largest
Internet retailer, said it will release a software update for
the Kindle Fire tablet to improve performance, make touch
navigation easier and let users choose what items are displayed.  The update will be available in less than two weeks,
Seattle-based Amazon said in an e-mailed statement.  Users have complained on Amazon’s website that the screen
is difficult to navigate, scrolling is “jittery,” and there is
no way to lock the device to keep others from using it. Amazon
unveiled the Kindle Fire, which has a 7-inch display and sells
for less than half the price of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s least-expensive
iPad, on Sept. 28 in a bid to erode Apple’s dominance.  “As with all of our products, we continue to make them
better for customers with regular software updates,” Kinley
Pearsall, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said in the statement.  While some Kindle Fire users have cited problems, 2,326
customers on Amazon’s  website  have given the tablet the highest
product rating of five stars -- a larger number of buyers than
all those who have given it one, two or three stars combined.
The device has an average rating of four stars.  Amazon fell 1.8 percent to $189.52 at the close in  New
York . The shares have gained 5.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
