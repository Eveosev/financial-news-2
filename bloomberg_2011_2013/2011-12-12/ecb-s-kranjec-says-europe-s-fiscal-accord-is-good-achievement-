European Central Bank  governing
council member Marko Kranjec said the fiscal accord reached by
European leaders last week is a “good achievement.”  “We couldn’t have expected more since radical changes were
achieved in terms of harmonizing public finances,” Kranjec,
also a governor of  Slovenia ’s central bank, said in an interview
with public broadcaster TV Slovenija tonight.  “I am not surprised that ratings services aren’t happy
with the deal, but I wouldn’t give them such importance. Ratings
services are using their assumptions, which in some cases are
very prudent,” Kranjec said. “Markets will realize that this
deal in Brussels will importantly contribute to the
stabilization and will stop the crisis in the euro region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
