Toyota Tsusho Corp. , the trading
company of  Asia ’s largest automaker, will help accelerate
production of rare-earth metals for Canadian mining company
 Matamec Explorations Inc. (MAT)  and buy all the output from its Kipawa
mine.  A memorandum of understanding between the two companies
offers Toyota Tsusho a supply of metals needed for its hybrid
and electric vehicles, Montreal-based Matamec said in a
statement yesterday.  The agreement calls for the two companies to form a joint
venture under which Toyota Tsusho, based in Aichi,  Japan , would
pay $17.5 million for 49 percent of the venture. Toyota Tsusho
will buy all of the mine’s output, Andre Gauthier, Matamec’s
chief executive officer, said by telephone yesterday.  This is the second time this month an Asian company has
sought a rare earths development agreement. On Dec. 4, Korea
Resources Corp. led a group of Korean companies in an agreement
with Luxembourg-based Frontier Rare Earths to develop its South
African mine.  Matamec explores for rare earths, base metals and precious
metals. It rose 12 percent to 32 Canadian cents at the close in
Toronto, the biggest gain in more than two months. Matamec has
fallen 49 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
