Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. The most influential U.S. policy statement on  climate change  didn't come last week during the UN climate negotiations in Durban. It wasn't even in December 1997, when Vice President  Al Gore  signed the  Kyoto Protocol  to limit heat-trapping gas emissions, which the White House never submitted for ratification. It happened several months before that, when U.S. Senators Robert Byrd (D-WV) and Chuck Hagel (R-NE) led a 95-0  vote  against any climate agreement that would "result in serious harm to the economy" and not include commitments from developing nations. Bloomberg News' team in Durban saw this weekend's agreement in the historical context of the "Byrd-Hagel Resolution," and concluded on Sunday, "The U.S., long accused of blocking progress in international climate talks, is  winning  a two-decade old debate about how to curtail global warming."  China 's and  India 's first-ever pledges to work toward binding emissions reductions is major step toward answering the 1997 Senate resolution.
