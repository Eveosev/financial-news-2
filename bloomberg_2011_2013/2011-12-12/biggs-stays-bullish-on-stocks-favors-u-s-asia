Barton Biggs , the hedge fund manager
who increased bets on U.S. equities before the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rallied this month, said he’s still bullish.  “I’m biased toward the long side,” he said during an
interview on Bloomberg Television “In the Loop” with Betty Liu
today. “U.S. big-capitalization, U.S. stocks and Asian stocks
are the best houses in a fairly tough, bad neighborhood.” Biggs
said equities may surge or drop 20 percent because of concern
about budget negotiations and  Europe .  The founder of Traxis Partners LP said on Dec. 2 that while
he doesn’t want to be fully invested in equities, “it’s hard to
get really bearish.” The  S&P 500  rose 0.9 percent since then
through Dec. 9.  His optimism on stocks has fluctuated along with the
market. He reduced the net-long position, a gauge of bullish
versus bearish investments, in the Traxis Global Equity Macro
Fund to about 40 percent at the end of September before
increasing it to 65 percent on Oct. 17 and 80 percent on Oct.
31, according to interviews Biggs conducted with Bloomberg News.
On Nov. 21, he said he cut the figure to less than 40 percent
and might go even lower. On Dec. 2, he said he’d raised the
level to about 60 percent.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  dropped five straight months through September
before surging 11 percent in October and dropping 0.5 percent in
November. The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities fell 1.5 percent
to 1,236.47 at 4 p.m. New York time today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
