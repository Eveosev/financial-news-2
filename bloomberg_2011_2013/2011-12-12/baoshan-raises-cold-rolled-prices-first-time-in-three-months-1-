Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , China’s
biggest publicly traded steelmaker, increased cold-rolled coil
prices for the first time in three months because of higher
costs.  January-delivery prices of the product used in automobiles
were raised by 100 yuan ($16) a metric ton, Shanghai-based
Baoshan said in a  statement  on its trade website today, without
giving details. That’s the first increase since October,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company kept
January prices of hot-rolled coil unchanged.  Iron ore prices  rebounded in November from an almost two-
year low as mills replenished stockpiles. China, the world’s
second-largest economy, grew at the slowest pace since 2009 in
the third quarter on weaker exports and monetary tightening,
cutting demand for steel used in houses, cars and machinery.  “There’re no clear signs of demand recovery from end
users,” said Hu Yanping, a Beijing-based analyst with
researcher Custeel.com. “Baoshan raised the prices slightly to
pass on some costs as it still has some expensive stockpiles.”  Ore with 62 percent content at  China ’s Tianjin port closed
up 0.1 percent to $139.5 a ton on Dec. 9, according to the Steel
Index. Prices have climbed 19 percent from $116.9 reached Oct.
28, the lowest level this year.  Chinese prices  of cold-rolled coil dropped 0.1 percent to
5,258 yuan a ton today, the lowest level since Aug. 3, 2010,
according to researcher Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  Baoshan raised cold-rolled product prices by 50 yuan a ton
for October delivery, according to a statement on Sept. 13.
Prices were unchanged for November and lowered by 300 yuan a ton
in December.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
