Boeing Co. (BA)  raised its quarterly
dividend 4.8 percent to 44 cents a share, the first increase
since 2008 at the world’s largest aerospace company.  The dividend will be payable on March 2 to shareholders of
record as of Feb. 10, Boeing said today in a statement. The
previous amount was 42 cents a share. A Bloomberg projection
called for a new total of 45 cents.  Boeing’s last increase was announced Dec. 15, 2008, when
the Chicago-based planemaker raised the amount to 42 cents from
40 cents, payable in March 2009. Boeing had struggled since then
with delays in its 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 jumbo jet, which
entered commercial service this year.  Today’s move came after Morgan Stanley boosted its rating
on Boeing to “overweight” from “equal weight.” Boeing fell
1.4 percent to $70.90 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  as broad U.S.
indexes slumped. The shares have gained 8.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
