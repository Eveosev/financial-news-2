The  Los Angeles Lakers  traded
forward  Lamar Odom  and a second-round draft pick to the Dallas
Mavericks for a first-round selection in 2012, a move that was
questioned by Lakers All-Star  Kobe Bryant .  Odom has averaged 14.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and four
assists over 12 National Basketball Association seasons. He had
spent the past seven seasons with the Lakers.  “I don’t like it,” Bryant told reporters yesterday.
“I’ve known Lamar for a long time, and for the team he’s meant
a lot in terms of his versatility, his personality. He’s a big
presence for us in the locker room, just from a team chemistry
standpoint. He’s great at bringing guys together.”  Odom, 32, last year won the NBA’s sixth man award as the
league’s top reserve and starred in a reality television show
with his wife, Khloe Kardashian.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
