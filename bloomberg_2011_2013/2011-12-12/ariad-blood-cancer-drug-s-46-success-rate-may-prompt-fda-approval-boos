Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARIA) ’s
experimental drug ponatinib spurred a positive response in 47
percent of chronic myeloid leukemia patients, a pivotal study
the company said may help the medicine gain approval as a new
therapy for people without treatment options.  The patients in the trial, the second of three usually
required for U.S. regulatory approval, had an untreatable
mutated version of the disease, or had failed to respond to
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s Sprycel, also known as dasatinib, or
Novartis AG ‘s Tasigna, also known as nilotinib, according to
the study released yesterday at the American Society of
Hematology meeting in  San Diego .  “This is a very hard disease to treat as patients become
resistant to earlier lines of therapy,” Harvey Berger,
chairman, president and chief executive officer of Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Ariad, said in an interview. “Even in these
very advanced patients, we’re seeing what most physicians would
say is a very important and clinically beneficial response.”  The trial included 449 patients, some of whom have a
mutation called T315I, for which no drugs are currently
approved. About 65 percent of the patients with the mutation had
a major cytogenetic response to ponatinib, the goal for the
study, meaning the drug had reduced their disease.  Ariad fell 2.8 percent to $11.31 at the close of trading in
 New York . The shares have more than doubled this year.  Approval Submission  Ariad will submit the drug for regulatory approval in
mid-2012 based on the results, Berger said. The company may seek
a partner to help develop the treatment by selling some of its
international rights, though he said Ariad isn’t for sale.  In November, Ariad declined 8 percent, the most in a month,
after reporting that 17 percent of patients in its ponatinib
trial had serious side effects. Berger said the side effects
were typical for patients with  chronic myeloid leukemia , a slow
and progression disease in which the bone marrow makes too many
white blood cells.  The cancer usually occurs during or after middle age and
will be  diagnosed  in about 5,150 people in the U.S. this year,
killing 230, according to the  National Cancer Institute .  About 6 percent of patients in the trial developed
pancreatitis, although none dropped out because of it, the study
said. Four patients died, “possibly or probably” related to
ponatinib, according to investigators. The patients, all with
advanced stages of the disease, died from pneumonia, fungal
pneumonia, gastric hemorrhage and cardiac arrest.  The deaths “were likely linked to the advanced nature of
their disease, including the myelosuppressive effects of
ponatinib on already badly damaged bone marrows,” said Frank Haluska, Ariad’s chief medical officer, in a company statement.  “In all of the drugs to treat chronic myeloid leukemia,
you see side effects,” Berger said. “What’s important is the
drug is very well tolerated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
