Exports of North Sea  Troll  crude for
January will increase to 18 cargoes, five more than this month,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Shipments of Troll will total 10.8 million barrels, or
348,387 barrels a day, the highest in at least three years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg since 2008. This
compares with 243,548 barrels a day this month.  Statfjord  exports will be six 855,000 barrel-cargoes, one
less than December, while  Aasgard  shipments will be eight
cargoes totaling 6.84 million barrels, compared with 6.985
million barrels for this month, separate plans showed.  Exports of  Grane  blend will be unchanged at seven cargoes,
and  Flotta  loadings will drop to one 650,000 barrel-cargo,
compared with two 600,000 barrel-shipments for this month,
according to the programs.  Troll and Grane cargoes are for 600,000 barrels each, while
the size of Statfjord and Aasgard shipments is 855,000 barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
