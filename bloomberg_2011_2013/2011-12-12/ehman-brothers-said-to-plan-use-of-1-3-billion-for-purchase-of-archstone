Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , which
has court approval for a $65 billion liquidation plan, will ask
a judge to let it use $1.3 billion of estate money to increase
its stake in Archstone, its biggest real estate asset, according
to a person familiar with the planned bid.  Equity Residential (EQR) , founded by Sam Zell, said on Dec. 2
that it had offered Bank of America Corp. and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  
$1.33 billion for 26.5 percent of Archstone, or about half of 
their stake.   Lehman Brothers, which currently owns 47 percent of 
Archstone and has an option to inform the banks this week that 
it will match the Zell company’s offer, will tell the judge the 
investment is needed to protect the estate’s interest in the 
company, said the person, who declined to be named because the 
discussions are private.  Lehman Brothers filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history in 2008. The cash bid was reported earlier by the Wall
Street Journal.  The case is In re Lehman  Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
