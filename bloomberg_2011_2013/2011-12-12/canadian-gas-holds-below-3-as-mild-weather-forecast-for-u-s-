Canadian natural gas fell amid
forecasts of mild weather in the U.S. Midwest, the biggest
consuming region for Canada’s gas output.  Alberta  gas dropped 0.6 percent after AccuWeather Inc.
predicted warmer-than-normal weather. Temperatures in  Chicago 
will peak at 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 Celsius) on Dec. 14, 15
degrees higher than normal, according to the  State College ,
Pennsylvania-based forecaster.  “It’s all about the weather and there really is none,”
said Carl Neill, a consultant with Risk Management Inc. in
Atlanta. “We came into the season with record storage and have
only used 21 billion cubic feet of it so far.”  Alberta gas for January delivery fell 1.75 cents to
C$2.9425 a gigajoule ($2.72 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:20 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users
in  Canada  and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta
system.  Gas for January delivery tumbled 6.3 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to settle at $3.254 per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
tumbled 19.7 cents, or 5.7 percent, to $3.2374 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  West Prices Gain  Gas for prompt delivery at points in the U.S. Northwest
rose amid forecasts of colder weather in the region. The low in
Portland,  Oregon , may reach 24 degrees Fahrenheit overnight, 11
below normal, AccuWeather said.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 4.71 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $3.3832,
according to ICE. At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was up 7.03 cents, or 2 percent, to
$3.5367 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.1 billion cubic
feet, 214 million above its target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.71 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.11 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 334 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2.32 billion cubic feet today, about 87 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.9
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
