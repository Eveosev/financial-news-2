Barclays Plc (BARC)  hired three commodities
directors from JPMorgan Chase & Co. last month and an oil trader
from Citadel LLC.  Crude oil trader Thomas Wiktorowski-Schweitz joined from
Citadel and is based in London, the bank said in an e-mailed
response to questions today. Rebecca Lee joined as director in
commodities sales in New York, Phil Hardwick is London-based
director in energy sales, and Thomas Horn was hired as director
in commodity-linked finance in Hong Kong. They all worked at
JPMorgan.  Barclays said in May it was looking to make “selective”
hires in commodities after shrinking trading staff last year and
reining in value-at-risk, an estimate of potential trading
losses. Barclays tied with New York-based JPMorgan as the
leading provider of over-the-counter derivatives to companies
hedging energy and ranked second in hedging metals, a survey
from Greenwich Associates showed in May.  Revenue from raw materials at the 10 biggest investment
banks fell 20 percent in the first half, according to analytics
company Coalition. JPMorgan generated the most revenue from
commodities in the first six months this year, followed by
Goldman Sachs Inc. and Morgan Stanley, it said. JPMorgan plans
to get out of the business of owning and trading physical
commodities, it said in July.  The U.S. Federal Reserve is examining legal and regulatory
exemptions that allow banks to participate in the commodities
markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
