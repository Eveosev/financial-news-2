Ultra-low-sulfur diesel gained after
a government report that distillate supplies declined the most
in three months last week and as crude futures advanced.  Futures rose as the Energy Information Administration
reported that  distillate  stocks fell 1.68 million barrels, the
most since June 28, to 129.2 million. West Texas Intermediate
crude rose as much as 1.9 percent after TransCanada Corp. said
it expects to commission the southern leg of its Keystone
pipeline expansion from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to the Texas Gulf
Coast by the end of October.  “The decline in distillate inventories was the most
supportive aspect of the report,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “With the
Keystone news, the bulls saw their opportunity and they’re
taking it.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery rose 3.26
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.9879 a gallon at 1:05 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 2.8 percent
above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 36 cents to $21.72
a barrel while the  premium  over Brent increased 27 to $16.45.  Gasoline lagged behind the gains in diesel and crude.
Inventories of the motor fuel rose 3.5 million barrels to 219.7
million in the week ended Sept. 27. Analysts in a Bloomberg
survey estimated a 700,000-barrel decline.  East Coast  Supplies in PADD 1, which includes  New York  Harbor, the
delivery point for the Nymex contract, increased 1.56 million
barrels to 56 million.  PADD 1 imports  climbed 13 percent to
510,000.  Gasoline for November delivery rose 0.88 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.6194 a gallon. Trading volume was 16 percent
below the 100-day average.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed $1.33 to $6.28 a barrel. The fuel’s
 premium  over Brent fell 71 cents to $1, the lowest level since
Nov. 15.  Refinery utilization fell 1.3 percentage points to 89
percent, the lowest level since June 7.  “The crack spreads are telling the refiners to stop making
so much gasoline,” Evans said. “The market is waving its hands
in the air here to tell us the gasoline market is
oversupplied.”  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.8 cent to $3.385 a
gallon, the lowest level since Jan. 28 and 39.5 cents below a
year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
