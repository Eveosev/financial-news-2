Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  offered to buy
competitor  GSW Immobilien AG (GIB)  less than a week after its
investors approved a plan to issue shares to finance the all-stock acquisition, which would create the second-largest owner
of German homes.  Deutsche Wohnen offered 2.55 of its shares for each GSW
share, according to a statement today, confirming a plan
announced on Aug. 20. The bid values GSW’s equity at about 1.7
billion euros ($2.3 billion), based on Deutsche Wohnen’s 
closing share price yesterday.  The combined company would own about 150,000 apartments
valued at 8.5 billion euros, Deutsche Wohnen said in August.
Both companies are based in Berlin, where price and rent
increases have outpaced the rest of the country.  GSW shareholders must decide whether to accept the offer by
Oct. 30, according to today’s statement. Deutsche Wohnen needs
acceptances from investors owning at least 75 percent of GSW
shares to proceed with the deal.  At a Sept. 30 meeting in  Frankfurt , 99.5 percent of the
Deutsche Wohnen investors present voted in favor of issuing
shares to be offered in exchange for GSW stock, the company said
in a statement the same day.  Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE (ANN)  is  Germany ’s biggest
residential landlord by number of homes, with 180,000
apartments.  “A combination of GSW and Deutsche Wohnen could make sense
from an operational and industry point of view,” GSW said on
Aug. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
