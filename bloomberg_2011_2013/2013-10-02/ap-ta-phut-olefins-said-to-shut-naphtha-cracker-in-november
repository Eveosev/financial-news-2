Map Ta Phut Olefins Co., a joint
venture between  Siam Cement Pcl (SCC)  and Dow Chemical Co., will shut
a naphtha cracker from the middle of November for planned
maintenance, according to two people with knowledge of the plan.  The company will halt the plant, which has the capacity to
make 800,000 metric tons a year of ethylene, for about 40 days,
the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not
authorized to speak to the media.  A company official at Siam Cement’s public relations
department in Bangkok was not able to confirm the plan when
contacted by phone and e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
