It was a chance encounter on a beach in Ibiza, Spain, in the summer of 2012 that would lead to Cameron and  Tyler Winklevoss  becoming two of the biggest investors in Bitcoin.  While looking for lounge chairs on the celebrity-studded island, the Winklevoss twins ran into David Azar, a private investor from New York who recognized them and offered them his seat, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its November issue.  More from the November issue of  Bloomberg Markets : Azar started talking about Bitcoin, the digital currency that has gained prominence this year for its wild price swings and for piquing the interest of regulators from New York to Germany.  “He asked us if we’d given much thought to virtual currency, and, at the time, we really hadn’t,” says  Cameron Winklevoss , who along with his brother in 2004 sued Facebook Inc. founder  Mark Zuckerberg , claiming he stole their idea for the social-networking site.  “I got really fascinated by the implications for the financial world,” Cameron says.  Within weeks of their Ibiza sojourn, the brothers -- flush with cash from the $65 million they won after settling the Facebook case in 2008 -- started buying Bitcoins.  They aren’t the only ones to catch the Bitcoin bug. In the past six months, at least half a dozen venture capital firms that made fortunes from early contrarian bets on tech companies such as Twitter Inc., Tumblr Inc., Skype Inc. and Spotify Ltd. have put their money on Bitcoin.  A Joke  After dismissing Bitcoin as a joke for years, many Silicon Valley investors now see digital currencies as the next revolution to hit the Web after social media.  In May, Founders Fund, set up by PayPal Inc. founders including  Peter Thiel , led a $2 million investment in Atlanta-based  BitPay Inc. , which allows merchants to accept Bitcoin payments and is processing transactions totaling about $7 million a month.  Bitcoin Fever: How It All Began Also in May, after two years of wait and see, New York-based Union Square Ventures, an early investor in Twitter, put $2.5 million in  Coinbase.  Coinbase was processing $20 million worth of Bitcoins a month as of September, up from $1 million in February.  Related: Then Google Ventures jumped into digital currency with undisclosed investments in OpenCoin Inc., which started Ripple, a payment system using Bitcoin and other currencies.  Like the Bitcoin investors who came after them, the Winklevii, as they are known, started small. They invested $1 million in BitInstant, a New York-based Bitcoin payment processor in which Azar was investing.  Payment System  Rowers who competed in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, the brothers say they began snapping up Bitcoins when the price was in the low single digits. It was a wise investment; one Bitcoin was worth $140.45 as of Oct 1.  The Winklevosses, 32, say they own about 1 percent of the $1.6 billion worth of  Bitcoins in circulation,  making their holdings worth about $16 million. They say they see Bitcoin as a way around a sclerotic global payment system that is Balkanized into rival currencies and competing financial institutions.  “We feel that digital currency, and Bitcoin for now, is a huge place for innovation,” Cameron says.  Bitcoin originated at the height of the financial crisis in November 2008, when a programmer or group of programmers known only as “Satoshi Nakamoto” released an academic paper outlining the design for a new peer-to-peer electronic cash system that removes the need to deal with third parties such as banks.  Encrypted Coins  A few months later, in a  blog post , Nakamoto described the idea for issuing encrypted digital coins that were not tied to any central bank.  Users store Bitcoins in digital wallets, with transactions recorded on the  Blockchain , a public ledger that can be accessed via the Internet. The system Nakamoto designed caps the number of Bitcoins at 21 million.  The open-source Bitcoin protocol has been tested by some of the world’s top computer security experts, who have tried to hack it and failed.  While anyone can see transactions made from a Bitcoin address -- a string of about 34 numbers and letters -- the owner remains hidden. The same goes for Nakamoto, whose identity remains a mystery.  No central authority issues Bitcoins, which is part of their appeal to libertarians, who form a significant cohort of the virtual currency’s supporters.  Nakamoto argued that attempts to create digital money beginning in the 1990s failed because, even though these currencies were not issued by a government authority, they were centrally controlled by a company.  Money Laundering  One such attempt was E-Gold Ltd., a digital currency based on the precious metal. In 2007, the U.S. Justice Department indicted E-Gold. The following year, the company’s founder, Douglas Jackson, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to engage in money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.  Skeptics say Bitcoin could fail, too. Some compare its appeal to the mania for Dutch tulip bulbs in the 1600s, when speculators drove up prices only to see the market collapse as investors rushed to sell. Others have branded Bitcoin fool’s gold, saying a digital code can’t be valued as a traditional commodity can.  “Bitcoin will be the Esperanto of the monetary world,” says  James Angel , a finance professor at Georgetown University in Washington. “Most people will see it as a fad like hula hoops, and they’ll look back on it a decade from now and say, ‘That was a clever idea. I even bought a cup of coffee with it once.’”  Cyber Cred  Fad or not, Bitcoins are being adopted by a few merchants striving for cyber cred. You can use your Bitcoins to buy beer at Pembury Tavern in East London, cocktails at EVR bar in New York and dessert at Cups and Cakes Bakery in San Francisco.  Bitcoin exchanges and payment processors akin to PayPal have mushroomed, luring users to trust often-unregulated third parties to hold and handle their digital currency.  Regulators are cracking down on this Bitcoin free-for-all.  On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Ross Ulbricht, aka “Dread Pirate Roberts,” the alleged founder of Silk Road, a Web site that the FBI says was a platform for illegal drug sales.  Silk Road generated about $1.2 billion of sales using Bitcoins and $80 million in commissions, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in Manhattan Federal Court yesterday.  Ulbricht was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering. The FBI seized 26,000 Bitcoins worth about $3.6 million.  Mt. Gox  Earlier this year, in March, the U.S.  Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  issued guidelines requiring Bitcoin exchanges and processors operating in the U.S. to register with FinCEN as money services businesses. The regulations -- a costly headache for Bitcoin startups -- require companies to follow the same “know-your-customer” rules that banks do and report suspicious transactions.  In May and June, the Department of Homeland Security seized $5 million from two U.S. accounts connected to one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, for failing to register as a money-transmitting business. In June, Mt. Gox registered with FinCEN. In keeping with anti-money-laundering rules, it is now requiring users to verify their identities when they deposit or withdraw cash.  In August, the regulatory onslaught intensified.  Benjamin Lawsky , the superintendent of New York’s Department of Financial Services, jumped in with subpoenas to 22 digital-currency companies and investors, requesting information on their Bitcoin operations as part of a fact-finding mission. The DFS is considering issuing new guidelines specific to virtual currencies.  Regulation Hurts  “If virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country’s national security but also the very existence of the virtual-currency industry as a legitimate business enterprise,” Lawsky said in a statement in August.  On Tuesday, Lawsky said in an interview on Bloomberg TV that his goal is to make sure Bitcoin companies follow know-your-customer rules, not to “squelch out” Bitcoin. If regulation hurts the digital-currency industry dominated by anonymous transactions, he said, “So be it.”  In Germany, Bitcoin won a victory of sorts. Germany’s Finance Ministry said in August that Bitcoin would be recognized as “private money” and would be subject to sales and capital gains taxes.  Frank Schaeffler , a member of the German parliament’s finance committee, lauded Bitcoins as a first step toward the late Austrian economist  Friedrich Hayek ’s vision of a world with denationalized, competing private currencies.  ‘Growing Pains’  In the U.S., the regulatory chill has caused Bitcoin businesses to go into hibernation. In July,  BitInstant  said in a statement that it was suspending operations to sort out “growing pains” before relaunching -- casting a doubt on the Winklevosses’ investment.  “The BitInstant team is working hard to get its site up and running, and we hope that happens soon,” the brothers said in an e-mail on Sept. 19.  Tradehill Inc., a San Francisco-based Bitcoin exchange, announced in late August that it was temporarily suspending trading because of regulatory issues.  It had registered as a money transmitter earlier in the month with FinCEN. However, its bank, the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union, said in a statement that it could no longer serve some Bitcoin customers until there is greater regulatory clarity.  Many Geeks  “For Bitcoin to succeed, the banks need to be on board,” says Shakil Khan, head of special projects at music-streaming service Spotify, an early investor in BitPay and backer of  CoinDesk , a Bitcoin news site. “Living in hope that the regulatory challenges will disappear is not a strategy.”  The libertarian wing of the Bitcoin movement -- many of them geeks in T-shirts who wouldn’t look out of place at an Occupy protest -- say the U.S. government is bent on destroying Bitcoin.  “I recommend setting up in the least tyrannical jurisdiction, so stay the hell away from the U.S.,” Erik Voorhees, founder of Panama-based Coinapult, which helps customers transmit Bitcoins via e-mail and mobile phones, said in July at a digital-currency conference in London’s Canary Wharf.  The currency has fluctuated this year, turning some young entrepreneurs into Bitcoin millionaires, such as 25-year-old Coinbase co-founder  Fred Ehrsam , a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader.  Political Uncertainty  After trading as low as $17 in January, the price of a Bitcoin surged to a high of $240 in April, spurred by the banking crisis in Cyprus. Bitcoin was behaving like gold, a store of value that tends to rise at times of economic or political uncertainty.  Bitcoin believers say the currency is more than just an antidote to financial turmoil. In his office in Manhattan’s Flatiron District, Union Square Ventures co-founder  Fred Wilson  compares Bitcoin with the creation of the protocols behind e-mail and the World Wide Web.  “It’s a scheme for computers to talk to each other that people can build on top of,” says Wilson, 52, whose firm was one of the first to invest in social media site Tumblr and social-gaming company Zynga Inc.  Bitcoin has many investors excited because they say it could challenge dominant players such as Visa Inc. and Western Union Co as a means of international money transfer.  ‘Mainstream Investor’  With no need for a third-party intermediary, users can send Bitcoins to one another for free. PayPal, by contrast, charges sellers 2.9 percent per transaction and more for international sales.  Working from Flatiron offices featuring sleek gray sofas and exposed industrial pipes, the Winklevoss twins say they want to offer pension funds and retail investors a way to gain exposure to the digital currency without actually buying Bitcoins.  “The driving force is bringing Bitcoin to the mainstream investor,” Cameron says.  In July, the brothers filed a 95-page application with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an entity called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund that would track the performance of the digital currency.  Cameron says he and Tyler spent months on the  filing  with a team of lawyers at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, which helped draft the paperwork for the first ETF 20 years ago.  ‘A Riot’  The Bitcoin ETF idea is so far-fetched that SEC approval, if it ever comes, could take years, says  Reggie Browne , head of ETF trading at Cantor Fitzgerald LP.  “I think it’s a riot,” he says, laughing.  The Winklevosses have competition in the race to snag mainstream Bitcoin investors.  Barry Silbert , the 37-year-old founder of New York-based SecondMarket Inc., which became the biggest private market for trading shares in Facebook before it went public, is raising capital for a private Bitcoin Investment Trust aimed at institutional and accredited investors, not retail clients.  SecondMarket invested $2 million in the fund, which launched in September. Silbert says the only way for Bitcoin to become a global currency is for trading volumes and overall market value to increase beyond $1.6 billion.  Silbert began buying the virtual currency as a personal investment in early 2012, when the price was about $5 to $10. Then in the spring of 2012, he started the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund with his own money and began investing in startups, including Tradehill, the exchange that suspended operations at the end of August.  Facebook Effect  He says he’s invested more than $1 million so far in 10 companies -- and used Bitcoins to finance many of the companies he’s backed. Bitcoin could go viral, Silbert says.  “I’m not going to suggest it will replace the U.S. dollar,” he says. “But can it have as transformative an effect on the world as Facebook? Yes.”  Bitcoin’s future is largely in the hands of regulators.  By forcing companies that handle digital currencies to act by the same rules that banks do, regulatory authorities could draw Bitcoin into the mainstream like any number of innovations that are now embraced by the marketplace.  Or they could break it, marginalizing it as a threat to financial integrity and spelling the end of what many hoped would be a digital-currency revolution.  Get your free issue of Bloomberg Markets!
