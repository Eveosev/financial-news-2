David Einhorn , president of hedge-fund firm Greenlight Capital Inc., said it’s unimaginable for
the U.S. to miss a deadline to raise its debt limit and default.  “Frankly not working this out so the government shuts down
is bad enough,” he said in an interview today with Stephanie
Ruhle and  Erik Schatzker  on Bloomberg Television’s “Market
Makers.” “It doesn’t seem that they tried to sit down to talk
through their differences. It’s a real shame. I think it is
embarrassing to all of them.”  The U.S. government started a partial shutdown yesterday
and must raise the debt limit this month to ensure that it has
enough money to pay all its bills. President  Barack Obama 
summoned the top four leaders of Congress to the White House
today for the first high-level talks on reopening the U.S.
government and raising the debt ceiling, according to a White
House official.  Obama will continue to insist on a short-term spending bill
and debt-limit increase without policy conditions, said the
official, who requested anonymity because the information isn’t
public.  Einhorn’s New York-based firm manages $9.7 billion in
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
