Germany’s benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  will
climb to a record 9,000 by the end of the year as the euro-region economy returns to growth and investors brush off reduced
U.S. stimulus, according to Allianz Global Investors Gmbh.  The gauge of German equities has rallied 14 percent in
2013, closing at 8,689.14 yesterday. It gained 6.1 percent in
September as the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly refrained from
paring its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases. Most
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  said the Fed will wait
until December to take a first step to reduce the pace of
stimulus, according to a poll taken after the central bank’s
last decision on Sept. 18.  “Our most confident position is in European equities,”
Ingo Mainert, who helps manage 28 billion euros ($38 billion) as
chief investment officer balanced  Europe , at Allianz Global
Investors, said in an interview in Frankfurt last month.
“Tapering of up to $15 billion is more or less priced into the
market. If it is higher, which means the Fed is a little bit
more aggressive, we could see a negative reaction.”  Gross domestic product  in the 17-nation euro region grew
0.3 percent in the three months through June, snapping six
quarters of contraction. The  European Central Bank  forecasts the
area’s economy will shrink 0.4 percent in 2013 and grow 1
percent next year. Germany will expand 0.3 percent this year and
1.5 percent in 2014, the Bundesbank predicts.  Mainert said that Allianz Global Investors became more
positive on European equities after the second-quarter euro-area
GDP figures and purchasing managers indexes showed economic
improvement.  European Confidence  “We are positive for Europe as we are for  Germany ,”
Mainert said. “If you look to the actual valuation numbers,
price-earnings ratios for example, the Euro Stoxx 50 and the DAX
numbers are quite equal.”  The DAX trades at 13.10 times estimated earnings, compared
with 13.12 for the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The gauge is trading near a record of 8,694.18 reached on
Sept. 19. Shares fell 0.8 percent on Sept. 30 as the U.S.
government shut down for the first time in 17 years after
Congress failed to agree on a budget and Italian Prime Minister
Enrico Letta struggled to save his administration.  The Fed will probably begin tapering its monthly bond
buying toward the end of this year, possibly in December, before
cutting to “more or less zero” over nine months, Mainert said.
Allianz Global Investors currently favors co-called cyclical
companies, which are more reliant on economic growth to drive
earnings, he said.  “We are positive for industrials and consumer-discretionary stocks,” said Mainert, who declined to mention
specific companies. “I would say that we are constructive for
Germany. To say euphoric is too much, but we are constructive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
