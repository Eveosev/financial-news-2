Republican and Democratic leaders
left a White House meeting tonight giving no indication they had
bridged any of the differences at the center of a fiscal
stalemate that’s led to a partial government shutdown.  House Speaker John Boehner accused President  Barack Obama 
and congressional Democrats of refusing to negotiate an end to
the impasse.  “They will not negotiate,” the Ohio Republican said.  He was followed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who said their party has
been willing to convene a conference to work out differences.  “What the speaker has to accept is yes for  an answer,”
Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
