EBX Group Co., the holding company of
former Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , is moving out of its
Rio de Janeiro headquarters into smaller offices in the city,
said two people with knowledge of the move.  EBX and its units are vacating the Serrador building in
downtown Rio, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the decision hasn’t been made public.  The relocation is taking place as  OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA (OGXP3) , the centerpiece of Batista’s commodities
group, yesterday missed a $45 million interest payment on its
8.375 percent notes due in 2022, prompting  Standard & Poor’s  to
assign a default rating to the company and the bonds. The
tycoon, who lost his billionaire status in July and is now worth
$73.7 million, is selling assets, firing staff and ceding
control of some of his commodities and logistics ventures.  The EBX companies are relocating to two buildings in the
Flamengo neighborhood of Rio’s southern zone, where there were
based before moving to Serrador in 2011, one of the people said,
adding that the move is expected to be done by the end of the
year. EBX declined to comment in an e-mailed statement.  EBX is four months in arrears on the rent it pays for
Serrador, Veja columnist Lauro Jardim  wrote  in his blog earlier
today, without saying how he got the information. The holding
company started vacating the building yesterday, he wrote.  The oil producer was set to run out of money by early
September based on its burn rate through the end of the second
quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
