El Salvador will solicit bids for 40
megawatts of wind farms and 60 megawatts of solar parks in
November as the Central American nation seeks to diversify its
 energy supply  from fossil fuels.  Developers will compete for contracts to sell electricity
for 20 years to local distributors and winners will be announced
as soon as May 20, according to the country’s National Energy
Council, a government agency that helps guide  energy policy .  El Salvador is seeking to cut its dependence on oil and
diesel, which were used to run about 47 percent of its grid’s
generation capacity in 2011, Yayoi Sekine, a Sao Paulo-based
analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said today in an e-mail.  The solar projects will have to start producing power by
Oct. 1, 2015, and the wind projects by Oct. 1, 2016, the
National Energy Agency said on its  website  Sept. 30. The wind
farms must have capacities between 5 megawatts and 40 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
