Thailand ’s baht fell by the most in
five weeks as the central bank prepared to cut its 2013 economic
growth forecast. Government bonds advanced.  The Bank of Thailand plans to reduce its estimate on Oct.
25, Senior Director Mathee Supapongse said this week. The
monetary authority trimmed the projection in July to 4.2 percent
from 5.1 percent, and the Finance Ministry said last week it
expects the economy to expand 3.7 percent instead of 4.5 percent
this year. Global funds pulled a net $65 million from equities
in the first two days of this week, exchange data show.  The baht lost 0.6 percent, the most since Aug. 27, to 31.33
per dollar as of 4:38 p.m. in Bangkok after strengthening 0.6
percent in the first two days of this week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected swings in the exchange rate used to price options,
fell 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 7.41 percent.  “The Thai economy still doesn’t look good and the central
bank will lower the forecast again,” said Pareena Phuangsiri, a
Bangkok-based analyst at Kasikornbank Pcl. “The baht can
probably gain only to a certain level until we see signs of an
economic pickup. So, we see a reversal from the recent
appreciation.”  Nomura Holdings Inc. lowered its growth forecast for
Thailand’s economy this year to 3.5 percent from 3.9 percent
while ING Groep NV cut its estimate to 3.2 percent from 4
percent, according to research notes released this week.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 fell
eight basis points to 3.86 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
