Canadian  stocks  fell, after rising
the most in almost two weeks yesterday, as wireless carriers and
oil producers retreated while investors watched for progress in
efforts to end a U.S. budget impasse.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. lost 1.7 percent as U.S.
crude production rose. BCE Inc.,  Rogers Communications  Inc. and
Telus Corp. dropped more than 0.8 percent to pace declines among
phone stocks. Semafo Inc. jumped 6.7 percent as gold rebounded.
Paladin Energy Ltd. added 6.4 percent after reporting cost-cutting plans. Air Canada gained 4 percent after winning a pair
of slots for flights to a  Tokyo  airport. BlackBerry Ltd.
reversed losses after a report that the company has drawn the
interest of Cerberus Capital Management LP.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 8.44 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,839 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The index has
gained 3.3 percent this year for the third-worst performance
among developed markets, ahead of only  Hong Kong  and  Singapore .
Trading volume was in line with the 30-day average today.  “There was a lot of buying yesterday that was jumping the
gun,”  Bob Decker , a  fund manager  with Aurion Capital
Management, said in a phone interview from Toronto. His firm
manages about C$6 billion ($5.81 billion). “The obvious linkage
is what’s happening in  Washington  isn’t friendly to the economic
outlook.”  U.S. President  Barack Obama  summoned the top four leaders
of Congress to the White House today for talks on re-opening the
government and raising the debt ceiling.  The U.S. government began shuttering some operations
yesterday because of a budget stalemate. Congress now faces a
dispute over raising the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling this month.
The Treasury has said measures to avoid exceeding the borrowing
limit will be exhausted on Oct. 17.  Economic Growth  A partial shutdown lasting one week would probably shave
0.1 percentage point from economic growth, according to the
median estimate of economists, with the costs accelerating if
the closing persists.  A private U.S. payrolls report said employment rose a less-than-forecast 166,000 in September, following a revised 159,000
gain in August that was also smaller than estimated, ADP
Research Institute said.  BlackBerry rose 1 percent to C$8.27 after an earlier loss
of as much as 5.4 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported that
the company has drawn the interest of Cerberus, a private-equity
firm that specializes in distressed assets. Fairfax Financial
Holdings Ltd., the largest shareholder of  BlackBerry, (BB)  announced
Sept. 23 it was leading a group of investors planning a buyout
of the money-losing smartphone maker.  Restructuring Costs  BlackBerry tumbled earlier today after saying it will
record costs of about $400 million, four times the amount it
originally projected, as it reduces staff by 40 percent and
sells off equipment and real estate.  Barrick Gold Corp. climbed 2.3 percent to C$19.02 and
Semafo increased 6.7 percent to C$2.40 as gold rebounded from an
eight-week low. Gold futures for December delivery rose 2.7
percent to $1,320.70 an ounce in  New York , the most in almost
two weeks.  Canadian Natural Resources declined 1.7 percent to C$32.25
and Cenovus Energy Inc. slipped 1.6 percent to C$30.31 as  energy
stocks  dropped 0.5 percent as a group.  U.S. crude production climbed last week, the Energy
Information Administration said. Output rose to 7.8 million
barrels a day in the week ended Sept. 13, the highest level
since May 1989.  Wireless Shares  BCE lost 0.8 percent to C$43.92, Rogers Communications fell
1 percent to C$43.91 and Telus retreated 0.9 percent to C$33.90
as telephone stocks dropped the most in the S&P/TSX.  Paladin Energy jumped 6.4 percent to 50 Canadian cents. The
company said yesterday it will cut cash costs for 2014 by $23
million, including a 10 percent reduction in board and
management base salaries. The company is also pursuing joint
venture partners for its undeveloped assets.  Air  Canada  soared 4 percent to C$3.90, the highest close
since November 2008. The company, Canada’s largest airline, will
get one slot pair for flights to and from Tokyo’s Haneda
airport,  Japan ’s transport ministry said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
