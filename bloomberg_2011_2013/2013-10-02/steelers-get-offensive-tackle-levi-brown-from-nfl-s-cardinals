The Pittsburgh Steelers acquired left
tackle Levi Brown from the Arizona Cardinals, seeking to bolster
an offensive line that’s allowed 15 quarterback sacks, the
second-most in the National Football League.  The 6-foot-6, 324-pound Brown was the fifth pick in the
2007 draft and has started 79 of 81 career games. The Steelers
sent a conditional draft pick to the Cardinals for Brown, the
team said in a statement.  Pittsburgh’s offensive line has struggled to protect
quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger , with left tackle  Mike Adams 
allowing three sacks in the 34-27 loss last weekend to the
Minnesota Vikings in London. Pittsburgh ranks 29th of 32 NFL
teams in rushing yardage in its 0-4 start.  To contact the reporter on this story:
