Sugar futures rose to a six-month
high on signs of lower production in  Brazil , the world’s biggest
producer. Cotton and coffee gained, while cocoa and orange juice
fell.  Output of sugar in Brazil’s Center South will be 34.2
million metric tons in the 12 months that started April 1, down
3.7 percent from an estimate six months ago amid adverse
weather, Unica, an industry group, said yesterday. Production
may drop more should rainy weather persist, the Sao Paulo-based
association said.  “These bullish numbers, together with an improved
technical picture, are propelling the futures market,” Nick Penney, a senior trader at Sucden Financial Ltd. in London, said
in a report.  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 1 percent to settle at
18.51 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached 18.56 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since March 18.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
86.87 cents a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery advanced 0.3
percent to $1.1445 a pound.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$2,632 a ton.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery dropped 0.4
percent to $1.2745 a pound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
