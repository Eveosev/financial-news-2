Hochtief AG (HOT) , Germany’s largest
construction company, dropped 7.9 percent in  Frankfurt  trading
after the Sydney Morning Herald reported allegations of
corruption at its Australian unit Leighton Holdings.  The newspaper said hundreds of confidential company
documents it obtained in an investigation revealed corruption
and kickback payments to clients. Essen-based Hochtief, which is
controlled by Spain’s  Actividades de Construccion & Servicios
SA , owns 56 percent of Leighton, according to Bloomberg data.  Hochtief spokesman Christian Gerhardus declined to comment
on the report. A Leighton Holdings spokesman couldn’t be reached
for comment outside normal business hours. According to the
Sydney Morning Herald, Leighton said in a statement that it was
cooperating with police, had strong anti-corruption policies and
that its directors executed their duties with care and
diligence.  Hochtief dropped 5.15 euros to 60.20 euros in Frankfurt
today, the biggest drop in almost two years, valuing the company
at 4.6 billion euros ($6.3 billion). The stock has gained 37
percent this year, while Germany’s DAX index rose 13 percent.  Hochtief in August posted a 30 percent decline in second-quarter new orders as investment in natural resources projects
in Asia slowed. New orders at Hochtief’s Asia-Pacific division
fell 48 percent while business increased in  North America  and
 Europe .  Hochtief Chief Executive Officer Marcelino Fernandez Verdes
is focusing Hochtief on its main building business, reversing a
decade-long strategy of expanding into services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
