Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish power plant
developer, said it obtained $300 million for a solar thermal
project from  Liberty Interactive Corp. (LINTA) , a U.S. video and
internet company.  The funds will go for the $2 billion Solana project that
Abengoa is developing in Gila Bend, Arizona. The project is a
280 megawatt facility that works with parabolic trough
technology.  It will be the largest project using that technology and
the biggest in the U.S. with the capacity to store energy for
use at night. The U.S. Department of Energy already has extended
a $1.45 billion loan guarantee for the project, which now is in
its final testing phase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
