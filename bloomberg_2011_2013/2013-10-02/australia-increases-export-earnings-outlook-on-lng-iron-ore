Australia , the largest  iron ore 
shipper, raised its forecast for earnings from the export of
minerals and energy resources after volumes increased.  The value of exports may total A$203.76 billion ($191.3
billion) in the year started July 1, the  Bureau  of Resources and
Energy Economics said in a report today. That compares with
A$197 billion forecast in June and A$177.4 billion a year
earlier, it said.  “Growth in export revenue will be driven by two main
factors,” Bruce Wilson, the bureau’s executive director, said
in a foreword to the report. “Substantial growth in bulk
commodity export volumes, particularly for LNG and iron ore, and
a lower Australian dollar exchange rate.”  Iron ore entered a  bull market  in July as users in  China 
replenished stockpiles and data suggested growth in the world’s
biggest buyer may be picking after slowing for two quarters.
Morgan Stanley said in September that prices will be supported
through the first half of 2014 as a global surplus only emerges
later in the year.  Export earnings from mineral commodities may peak in the
year beginning July 1, 2014, with energy commodity exports
driving growth, the bureau said in its report. Earnings are
forecast to grow as volumes rise substantially even as commodity
prices decline, the bureau said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
