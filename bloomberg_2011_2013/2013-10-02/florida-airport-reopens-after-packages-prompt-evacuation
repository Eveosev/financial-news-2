Jacksonville International Airport in
 Florida  has reopened after it was evacuated for several hours
late yesterday because of two suspicious packages that were
investigated by local law enforcement authorities.  The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office bomb squad conducted a
search of the facility yesterday and located a device that was
“removed from the area and rendered safe,” according to a
statement posted on its Facebook page. The airport is now open,
the Jacksonville Aviation Authority said on its website.  The Sheriff’s Office didn’t provide a further description
of the device and didn’t say whether anyone was being held in
connection with the incident. The office said it’s working with
the airport authority and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation 
“to determine the nature of the activity at the airport.”  The airport was evacuated shortly before 6 p.m. EDT
yesterday, forcing flight cancellations and disrupting travel
for hundreds of passengers, the Florida Times Union reported on
its website. It reopened about five hours later, the newspaper
reported.  Two men were taken into custody at the airport, one inside
the facility and one near a parking garage, the Times Union
reported, citing witnesses. The newspaper said that one
suspicious package was found inside the terminal and another
inside a garage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
