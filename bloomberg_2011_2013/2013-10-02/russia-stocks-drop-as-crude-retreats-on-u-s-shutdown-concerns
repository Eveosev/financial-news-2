Russian stocks fell the most in five
weeks on speculation OAO Gazprom, the nation’s biggest company,
will delay a plan to pay dividends based on international
reporting standards, curbing the size of the payout.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  decreased 1.2 percent, the largest retreat
since Aug. 15, to 1,454.29 at the close in Moscow. Gazprom lost
1.6 percent to 143.35 rubles, the lowest since Sept. 13, on
volume 1.1 times the three-month daily average. The stock was
the biggest decliner by index points on the Micex. Polymetal
International Plc slid 2.7 percent OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  sank 1.9 percent.  Gazprom rallied 32 percent last quarter amid speculation
the company would start paying at least 25 percent of profit as
dividends under international accounting methods starting from
2014. Some state companies won’t have to make the switch from
Russian standards until 2016, Svetlana Nikitina, a Finance
Ministry spokeswoman, said today, without naming the companies.  “One of the big hopes for Gazprom had been that it would
pay high dividends,”  Bruce Bower , a partner at Verno Capital in
Moscow, which manages about $200 million in assets, said by
phone. “So when investors get disappointed like this, this
causes the stock to go down.”  The ministry is calling on state-run companies to increase
payouts to at least 35 percent of profit as it seeks to boost
government revenue. Its earnings from Gazprom and VTB Group
dividends will almost double in 2016 from 2015, according to the
draft budget on the parliament’s website.  Alrosa Sale  Four stocks fell on the Micex for every one that rose
today. OAO Alrosa soared 7 percent to 38.790 rubles after the
world’s largest diamond miner said the Russian government and
the Republic of Yakutia, in the country’s far east, would sell a
combined 14 percent stake. Alrosa will also sell about 2 percent
of treasury stock, with proceeds used to reduce debt, it said.  Russian equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21
emerging economies monitored by Bloomberg. Shares on the Micex
trade at 4.3 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with a
multiple of 10.5 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. The
dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  fell 1.1 percent to 1,421.94.  To contact the reporters on this story:
