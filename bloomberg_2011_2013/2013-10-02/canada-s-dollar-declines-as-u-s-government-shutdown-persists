Canada ’s dollar fell against the
majority of its 16 most-traded counterparts as the U.S.
government shutdown persisted, imperiling economic growth in the
nation’s biggest trading partner.  The currency reached the weakest level in more than two
weeks against its U.S. peer as the first shutdown since 1996
entered its second day amid speculation the standoff would merge
with the fight over raising the U.S. debt ceiling later this
month. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the U.S. has begun
using the last measures available to avoid breaching the limit.  There’s “a little bit of weakness in the Canadian
dollar,” Blake Jespersen, managing director of foreign exchange
at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto. “There’s a
little bit of movement now, but still confined to very narrow
ranges. But much of that is related to the U.S. government
shutdown.”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.2 percent to
C$1.0337 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0356, the weakest level since Sept. 16. One Canadian dollar
buys 96.74 U.S. cents.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government  bond  rose, pushing
the yield down two basis points to 2.54 percent. The price of
the 1.5 percent security due in June 2023 rose 13 cents to
C$91.13.  Bond Auction  The Bank of Canada auctioned C$2.8 billion ($2.7 billion)
of 2.5 percent bonds maturing in June 2024 at an average yield
of 2.64 percent. It attracted C$6.8 billion in bids. The
offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount offered, was 2.43.  Options data touched the most bearish level on the Canadian
dollar versus its U.S. peer in three weeks. The three-month 25
delta risk-reversal rate, which measures the premium charged for
the right to buy the U.S. dollar against its Canadian peer
versus contracts to sell, touched 1.4025 percent, the highest
intraday level since Sept. 6.  The Canadian dollar lost 1.1 percent in the past month
against nine developed-market peers tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index. The U.S. dollar dropped 3.3 percent,
while the Australian currency gained 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
