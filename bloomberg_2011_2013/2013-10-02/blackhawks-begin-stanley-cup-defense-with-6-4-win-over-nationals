(Corrects reference to third period in third paragraph.)  The  Chicago Blackhawks  began defense
of their National Hockey League title with a 6-4 home win over
the  Washington Capitals .  Also last night in the first games of the regular season,
the  Toronto Maple Leafs  beat the Montreal Canadiens 4-3 and the
Winnipeg Jets defeated the Edmonton Oilers 5-4.  Mikhail Grabovski scored two goals on power plays in the
third period at United Center to give Washington a 4-3 lead
before goals by Brandon Saad,Johnny Oduya and Marian Hossa
secured the victory for Chicago.  The Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup for a second time in
four seasons in June when they scored twice in the final 76
seconds of Game Six to beat the Boston Bruins 3-2.  The 2012 regular season was shortened to 48 games per team
by a labor dispute between players and owners that yielded a 10-year collective bargaining agreement after a 117-day lockout.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
