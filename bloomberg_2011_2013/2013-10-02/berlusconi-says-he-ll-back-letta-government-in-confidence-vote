Former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  reversed course and said he will support current
premier Enrico Letta in a confidence vote today as a political
crisis that has gripped the nation for five days abates.  Berlusconi, who announced his decision on the floor of the
Senate, had previously vowed to oppose Letta and topple his
five-month-old government.  “Italy needs a government that may produce those
structural and institutional reforms the country needs in order
to modernize itself,” Berlusconi, 77, said. “We have decided,
not without inner turmoil, to express a vote of confidence for
the government.”  Stocks and bonds rose as the political turmoil threatening
the euro region’s third-largest economy abated. The benchmark
FTSE MIB index rose 1.4 percent, while the yield on the Italian
10-year bond fell 4 basis points to 4.38 percent.  Berlusconi’s U-turn came as members of his own party defied
him and pledged allegiance to Letta.  “I’m asking Parliament for courage and confidence,” the
47-year-old Letta said earlier today in a speech to the Senate.
New elections would make Italy ungovernable and probably
reproduce a stalemate, he said.  The turning point in the political battle came late
yesterday when deputy Prime Minister  Angelino Alfano , who quit
the Cabinet on Sept. 28 at Berlusconi’s request only to have his
resignation rescinded by Letta, said he would back the
government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
