Air Canada (AC/B)  surged to the highest
level in almost five years in anticipation of strong September
travel data, taking its gains for the year to 123 percent and
making it the best performing stock in the country.  Air Canada (AC/A)   rose  4.3 percent to C$3.90 at the close in
Toronto today, the highest since Nov. 7, 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Montreal-based carrier’s rally since August has pushed
it to the  top  of the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index,
ahead of second place Valeant Pharmaceuticals International
Inc., which has gained 91 percent this year.  “August numbers were very, very strong and there’s an
expectation that September will also be strong,”  Cameron Doerksen , an analyst with National Bank Financial, said today in
an interview. The airline usually reports traffic data in the
first week of the month.  Recent financings by Air Canada have lowered interest
expenses and strong second-quarter financial results may be
repeated in the third quarter, Doerksen said.  Air Canada shares have also gained since being added to the
benchmark index on Sept. 20. A message left with  Peter Fitzpatrick , spokesman for the airline, wasn’t immediately
returned.  “Air Canada has had a great move,” Chris Damas, an
analyst at BCMI Research in Barrie, Ontario, said in a note.
“However, I’d be selling into the strength today because we
haven’t seen the September traffic numbers.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
