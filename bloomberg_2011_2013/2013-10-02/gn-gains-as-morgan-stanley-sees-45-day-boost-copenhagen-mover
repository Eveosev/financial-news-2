GN Store Nord A/S (GN) , Denmark’s second-largest hearing aid maker, rose the most among Copenhagen’s
benchmark shares after Morgan Stanley said the stock will recoup
losses over the next 45 days.  GN rose as much as 2.6 percent, making it today’s  biggest
winner  in the Nasdaq  OMX Copenhagen 20 Index. (KFX)  The stock rose 2.5
percent to 120.20 kroner at 12:46 p.m. in Copenhagen, with
trading volume at 74 percent of the three-month daily average.  Before today, GN shares had declined 4.8 percent from an
Aug. 23 peak, compared with a 0.3 percent gain in the C20 index
in the same period. Morgan Stanley repeated an overweight
recommendation, saying the recent stock decline makes the
“short-term valuation much more compelling,” in a note to
clients today.  “We believe the share price will rise in absolute terms
over the next 45 days,” Michael Jungling, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley, said in the note.  GN will benefit as it may introduce a planned hearing aid
made for Apple Inc.’s iPhone at this month’s International
Congress of Hearing Aid Acousticians, the bank said.  Citigroup Inc. last month started coverage of GN’s shares
with a buy recommendation, saying the iPhone device will help
the Ballerup, Denmark-based company outperform its competitors
over the next 12 months.  Morgan Stanley has a 12-month price estimate of 130 kroner
on GN shares, according to the note. That compares with an
average target of 127 kroner among 17 analysts tracking the
stock, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
