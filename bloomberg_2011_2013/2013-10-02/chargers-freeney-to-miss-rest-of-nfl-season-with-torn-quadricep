Dwight Freeney’s first season with
the San Diego Chargers is over after four games, with the seven-time Pro Bowl pass rusher placed on injured-reserve with a torn
quadriceps muscle.  Freeney, 33, was injured during the second quarter of
Sunday’s 30-21 win over the Dallas Cowboys.  Freeney, who spent his first 11 seasons with the
Indianapolis Colts, is fifth among active National Football
League players with 108 quarterback sacks. He signed with San
Diego as a free agent in May, a month after the Chargers lost
defensive end Melvin Ingram, their 2012 first-round draft pick,
to a torn knee ligament.  The Chargers (2-2) also said they placed wide receiver
Malcolm Floyd on season-ending injured reserve with a sprained
neck. He hadn’t played since being injured in a collision during
the Chargers’ Week 2 win in Philadelphia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
