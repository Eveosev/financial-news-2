Pearson Plc (PSON) , part-owner of Penguin
Random House, declined the most in more than a month after the
death of novelist Tom Clancy, one of the publishing house’s
best-selling authors.  The stock fell 2 percent to 1,225 pence in London trading
today, the biggest one-day drop since Aug. 29, following news of
the author’s death at the age of 66. The shares have climbed 3.1
percent this year.  Pearson is losing an author that produced a string of
novels ranked No. 1 on the  New York  Times best-seller list,
including “The Hunt for Red October” (1984), “Patriot Games”
(1987), “Clear and Present Danger” (1989), “The Sum of All
Fears” (1991) and “The Bear and the Dragon” (2000). His 17th
novel, “Command Authority,” is due out in December.  Pearson co-owns the publishing house with Bertelsmann
following a merger of Penguin and  Random House  in July.
Bertelsmann has a 53 percent stake in the joint venture, while
Pearson owns 47 percent. Combined, Penguin Random House had
revenue last year of 2.6 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) and
operating profit of 346 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
