The U.S. needs to raise its debt
limit and failing to do so would be “totally absurd,”
according to former European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet.  “What would be totally absurd would be that the ceiling
could not be augmented in two weeks’ time,” Trichet told CNBC
in an interview today. Raising the limit “is absolutely
essential, not only for the U.S., but for the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
