Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  India ’s  Oil
& Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  expanded oil production at a project off
 Brazil  after blocking a Chinese bid for a stake in the venture.  The partners, together with Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro
SA, started output at the Argonauta O-North field, The Hague-based Shell said today in a statement. It expects peak
production of as much as 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.  Shell and ONGC are expanding off Brazil after last month
pre-empting a $1.54 billion bid by  Sinochem Group  for a stake
held by Petrobras in their Parque das Conchas venture, which
includes Argonauta. The Latin American country has attracted
investment to its oil industry since Petrobras discovered the
Tupi field in 2007, the Americas’ biggest find in 30 years.  The Parque das Conchas, in the Campos Basin, is a phased
project where production from the Abalone, Ostra and Argonauta
B-West deposits began in 2009. Extraction from those fields
peaked at 90,000 barrels a day in 2010 before falling to 35,000
barrels a day, Shell said.  The first-phase output “declined naturally as expected,”
Julia Dudley, a London-based Shell spokeswoman, said by phone.
Output from the second and third phases -- the latter still
under construction -- will boost production, she said.  Shell,  Europe ’s largest oil producer, holds 50 percent of
Parque das Conchas, also known as BC-10. ONGC has 15 percent and
Petrobras 35 percent. Shell operates the heavy-oil block, about
110 kilometers (70 miles) off southeast Brazil. The  third phase 
will add volumes from the Massa and Argonauta O-South
reservoirs, which will pump as much as 28,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
