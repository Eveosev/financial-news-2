Australian Open organizers lifted
prize money at the season-opening tennis Grand Slam tournament
to A$33 million ($31 million).  The 10 percent increase follows a A$4 million rise in prize
money at the 2013 edition, where Novak Djokovic and  Victoria Azarenka  each picked up A$2.43 million for winning the men’s and
women’s singles championships at Melbourne Park.  “We said it last year and we still believe it -- these
incredible athletes deserve every cent and we will continue to
do everything in our power to make the life of an international
professional tennis player more worthwhile,” Tennis Australia
Chief Executive Officer Craig Tiley said in a statement.  Organizers will decide on the 2014 winners’ checks and
breakdown of the prize fund closer to the Jan. 13-26 tournament
after consulting the men’s and women’s tours, Tennis Australia
spokeswoman Prue Ryan said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
