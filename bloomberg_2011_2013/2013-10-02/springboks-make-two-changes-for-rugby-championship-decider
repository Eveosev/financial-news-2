South Africa  coach Heyneke Meyer made
two changes to the starting line-up for the Rugby Championship
decider against New Zealand on Oct. 5.  Juandre Kruger replaces the suspended lock Flip van der
Merwe, while Bismarck du Plessis comes in for Adriaan Strauss at
hooker. JJ Engelbrecht is in doubt with a muscle injury and may
be replaced by Jan Serfontein at outside center.  Prop Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira will play in his 50th Test
for the Springboks in the game at Ellis Park, Johannesburg.  South Africa beat Australia 28-8 in Cape Town on Sept. 28
to set up the title decider between the top two nations in the
International Rugby Board rankings. No. 1  New Zealand  takes a
five-point lead into the competition’s final round after scoring
four tries in a 33-15 win against Argentina.  To win the championship, the Springboks must score at least
four tries, win by eight or more points and limit New Zealand to
fewer than four tries. The last time the All Blacks allowed four
tries was Oct. 30, 2010, against Australia in Hong Kong.  South Africa team: Zane Kirchner, Willie le Roux, JJ
Engelbrecht/Jan Serfontein, Jean de Villiers (capt.),  Bryan
Habana , Morne Steyn, Fourie du Preez, Duane Vermeulen, Willem
Alberts, Francois Louw, Juandre Kruger, Eben Etzebeth, Jannie du
Plessis, Bismarck du Plessis, Tendai Mtawarira. Replacements:
Adriaan Strauss,  Gurthro Steenkamp , Coenie Oostuizen, Franco van
der Merwe, Siya Kolisi,  Ruan Pienaar , Pat Lambie, Jan
Serfontein/Juan de Jongh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
