Gold is expected to decline into 2014
as investors shift into other asset classes amid speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will slow stimulus, according to
the Australian government forecaster.  Prices may average $1,275 an ounce next year from $1,439 in
2013, the Canberra-based Bureau of Resources and Energy
Economics said in a report today. That compares with the
bureau’s estimates in June of $1,340 for 2014 and $1,444 for
this year. Spot bullion has averaged about $1,457 in 2013.  Gold tumbled 23 percent this year on expectations that the
U.S. central bank will taper asset purchases, dimming bullion’s
allure as shares rallied. Twenty-four of 41 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg in September said that the Fed will start to pare
stimulus in December. The  Federal Open Market Committee 
unexpectedly left the program unchanged last month.  Australia  is
the world’s largest bullion producer after  China .  “Prices are expected to rebound in the near term in
response to the FOMC announcement,” the bureau said.
“Speculation on the tapering is likely again in 2014,
particularly if more positive U.S. economic data is reported.
This market speculation, as well as investor preferences
shifting to other asset classes as  interest rates  recover to
normal levels, are expected to result in lower gold prices.”  Gold for immediate delivery dropped as much as 0.8 percent
to $1,277.15 an ounce, the lowest level since Aug. 7, and traded
at $1,291.67 at 4:20 p.m. in Singapore. Bullion fell 3.1 percent
yesterday on bets that the U.S. government’s first partial
shutdown in 17 years will be short-lived.  Australian output may drop to 242 tons in the year started
July 1 from an earlier estimate of 263 tons and 254 tons the
prior year, on production cuts and mine closures, the bureau
said. Exports may total 282 tons in 2013-2014, down the June
estimate of 304 tons, and compared to 280 tons the prior year,
it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
