The improving U.S. housing market may
help small and medium-sized businesses obtain more loans, as
those enterprises often use housing as collateral, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  The IMF had previously  said  that U.S. small and medium
enterprises, also known as SMEs, didn’t benefit as much as large
corporations from relaxed financial conditions and expanding
corporate markets, because their options are usually limited to
bank loans with real-estate collateral.  “The improving housing market may improve access to
finance for SMEs given that they often use housing as
collateral,” the IMF said in a chapter of the Global Financial
Stability Report released today.  The Washington-based IMF also praised the  Federal Reserve ’s
purchases of mortgage-backed securities as contributing to
improving liquidity in the mortgage market.  “The constraints that the U.S. corporate loan market
witnessed in the early stages of the crisis appear to have
dissipated,” the IMF said. “Both supply and demand factors
have improved since then, and total credit growth to non-financial corporations has turned positive.”  Weak growth in  credit  is considered one of the main factors
in the slow economic recovery. While many countries are boosting
credit creation by very accommodative monetary policies, some
require additional actions to increase loan volumes, the IMF
said.  Japan  should increase the availability of risk capital for
startups through asset-based lending, according to the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
