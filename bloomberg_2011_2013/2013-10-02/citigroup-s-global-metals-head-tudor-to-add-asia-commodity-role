Jason Tudor,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s global
head of metals and commodity investor products in London, will
move to Singapore next year to take on the additional role of
running the Asia-Pacific commodities team, said the bank.  Tudor will replace Robert Bayley, who returns to London as
head of global commodities corporate structuring at about the
end of March, spokesman Simon Boughey said in an e-mail
yesterday. Both Tudor and Bayley confirmed the moves.  Tudor spent more than 20 years in commodities and worked at
banks including Barclays Plc, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and
Nomura Holdings Inc. Bayley has been in his present position
since the end of 2010 after joining from Barclays in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
