The California Institute of Technology is the world’s top-ranked university for the third consecutive year in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, as U.S. schools hold seven of the first 10 spots.  The University of Oxford and  Harvard University  tied for second while  Stanford University  and the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  rounded out the top five in the 2013-2014 rankings  announced  today by Times Higher Education, a London-based magazine.  A total of 620 institutions were ranked on 13 criteria that measure teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. The top 200 is dominated by universities from the U.S., with 77 entrants, and the U.K., with 31. The Netherlands has 12 schools on the list while Germany has 10. From Asia, there are five Japanese universities, four from South Korea, three from Hong Kong and two each from China and Singapore. No universities from India, Russia or Brazil appear in the top 200.  U.S. universities benefit from significant public and private investment, with 2.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product spent on higher education compared with 1.4 percent in the U.K., said Phil Baty, editor of the rankings.  “U.S. institutions reward academic staff for productivity, and have the infrastructure in place to support and nurture academic research, teaching and knowledge transfer - all things which play well across Times Higher Education’s core indicators,” Baty said in an e-mail.  Rounding out the top 10 are  Princeton University , ranked sixth; the University of Cambridge, seventh;  University of California , Berkeley, eighth;  University of Chicago , ninth; and  Imperial College London , 10th. The top university outside the U.S. and U.K. is ETH Zurich, in Switzerland, at 14th, while the University of Tokyo, at 23rd, is the highest-ranked Asian university.
