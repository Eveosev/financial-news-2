East African Breweries Ltd., the
region’s biggest beermaker, rose to the highest level in almost
two months as buyers bet the company’s earnings will beat  Diageo
Plc (DGE) ’s unit in  Nigeria .  The stock of EABL, which is also part of the London-based
brewer, climbed 4 percent to 339 shillings, the biggest jump on
a closing basis since June 28 and the highest since Aug. 7.
Investors traded about 970,000 shares, equivalent to 3.1 times
the three-month daily average.  EABL trades at 27.4 times estimated earnings, compared with
27.2 times for Guinness Nigeria Plc, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. In August, EABL said full-year profit fell 38
percent because of higher financing charges.  The brewer took a loan of 19.5 billion shillings ($224.9
million) in November 2011 to buy a 20 percent stake in  Kenya 
Breweries Ltd. from London-based  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  and sold a
similar shareholding it held in Tanzania Breweries Ltd. to
SABMiller. Interest payments on the loan were made through the
full year, rather than seven months recorded in the prior fiscal
period.  “Post restructuring, EABL is better positioned and the
long-term story is compelling,” Timothy Wambu, head of research
at Nairobi-based NIC Securities Ltd., said by phone. “It
deserves a higher price-to-earnings multiple to Guinness
Nigeria.”  Shares in EABL, Kenya’s second-biggest company by market
value, climbed 28 percent this year following a 54 percent
advance in 2012. Guinness Nigeria is down 3 percent after
increasing 10 percent last year. On Sept. 16, Guinness Nigeria
said full-year net income fell to 11.8 billion naira ($72.8
million) from 14.3 billion naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
