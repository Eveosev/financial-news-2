South African bonds fell for a second
day, driving yields to two-week highs, on speculation slowing
growth is limiting the  Reserve Bank ’s room to combat rising
prices. The rand gained against the dollar.  South Africa’s manufacturing gauge fell below the level
that signifies expansion for the first time in six months, while
vehicle sales contracted a second month, reports showed
yesterday. The central bank left its benchmark repurchase rate
at 5 percent since a surprise 50 basis-point cut in July 2012
even as inflation breached its target for a second month in
August.  “Yesterday’s local data was disappointing and supports our
view that the Reserve Bank will keep rates on hold as long as
possible, despite the less favorable inflation backdrop,”
Carmen Nel, a Cape Town-based fixed-income analyst at Rand
Merchant Bank, said in an e-mail. Higher inflation erodes real
returns on fixed-interest investments including bonds.  Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026
climbed six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.08
percent at 3:40 p.m. in Johannesburg, the highest level on a
closing basis since Sept. 18. The rand appreciated 0.5 percent
to 10.0682 per dollar after declining 0.3 percent earlier.  The currency advanced before a report tomorrow that may
show claims for  unemployment benefits  in the U.S. rose last week
as a partial government shutdown threatens a recovery in the
world’s biggest economy. The  Federal Reserve  surprised the
market on Sept. 18 by maintaining its monthly bond purchases
after saying since May it may taper stimulus if employment
improves.  Jobs Data  Initial jobless claims rose to 314,000 in the week to Sept.
28 from 305,000 the previous week, according to the median
estimate of 48 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The economy
probably added 180,000 jobs in September, compared with 152,000
the previous month, a separate report may show Oct. 4.  “The market is consolidating ahead of the U.S. jobs
data,” Mohammed Nalla, head of strategic research at Nedbank
Group Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. “We’re still
fairly negative on the rand.”  South African vehicle sales fell 1.5 percent from a year
earlier to 54,281, the Pretoria-based National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa  said yesterday. Exports
dropped 75 percent as labor strikes hit output. The seasonally
adjusted purchasing managers’ index fell to an eight-month low
of 49.1 from 56.5 in August, Johannesburg-based Kagiso Tiso
Holdings said. The median estimate of seven economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was 54.  The central bank remains concerned about the effects of
strikes on the economy, Governor Gill Marcus said yesterday in a
speech to diplomats in  Pretoria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
