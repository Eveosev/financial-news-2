Gold had the biggest gain in almost
two weeks on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will delay
reducing fiscal stimulus amid the first U.S. government shutdown
in 17 years, stoking demand for the metal as a store of value.  A budget impasse triggered furloughs for 800,000 federal
workers as parks and other services were shuttered for a second
day, subtracting at least $300 million a day in economic output,
according to  IHS Inc. (IHS)  Companies added fewer workers than
forecast in September, the ADP Research Institute said today. On
Sept. 18, the Fed unexpectedly refrained from reducing its $85
billion of monthly bond purchases.  “The shutdown will lead to some delays in  government
spending , which will lead to a postponement in tapering as the
Fed wants to see more signs of growth,” Scott Carter, the chief
executive officer of Los Angeles-based Lear Capital, said in a
telephone interview. “Today’s ADP numbers showed that the
employment scenario still remains weak.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 2.7 percent to
settle at $1,320.70 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Sept.
19. Earlier, the price touched $1,276.90, the lowest since Aug.
7.  Debt Debate  Yesterday, the metal dropped 3.1 percent, the most since
July, as global  equities  gained amid speculation the shutdown
would be short-lived. The odds probably are increasing that the
standoff on a spending plan will be combined with the debate on
raising the debt limit later this month.  “We will also see some safe-haven bids for gold because of
the debt-ceiling worries,” Carter said.  The U.S. faced an impasse over raising the debt ceiling in
2011 before Congress approved a plan to head off a default. Gold
reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, 2011.  Gold has slumped 21 percent this year, partly on
speculation that the Fed will scale back stimulus amid gains in
the labor market.  Silver futures for December delivery jumped 3.4 percent to
$21.88 an ounce, the biggest gain since Sept. 19. Yesterday, the
price touched $20.63, the lowest since Aug. 12.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery advanced 0.6 percent to $1,393.40 an ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery gained 0.3 percent
to $721.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
