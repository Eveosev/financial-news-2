House Republicans said a government
shutdown is no excuse for delaying their lawsuit seeking
documents on the U.S. Justice Department’s botched Operation
Fast and Furious.  A Justice Department request for a suspension of the case
until the shutdown ends should be rejected because federal
courts are still open and the department has agreed to continue
working cases when ordered to by judges, according to papers
filed yesterday by the  House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee .  Their filing was in response to a Justice Department motion
for a delay for the duration of the shutdown, which began Oct.
1.  “The committee already has been waiting for near two years
for the subpoenaed documents -- the attorney general’s motion
should be denied,” committee lawyers wrote.  The bid to suspend the court proceedings followed a Sept.
30 ruling by Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejecting a government
motion to throw out the case.  The Republican-controlled House committee sued to enforce a
subpoena in the panel’s inquiry into Operation Fast and Furious,
a probe that allowed illegal gun purchases in the U.S. in an
effort to link the weapons to Mexican gangs.  The committee is seeking documents describing internal
Justice Department discussions about a February 2011 letter to
lawmakers that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder later said
mistakenly contained incorrect information.  The case is Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v.
Holder, 1:12-cv-01332, U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia 
( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
