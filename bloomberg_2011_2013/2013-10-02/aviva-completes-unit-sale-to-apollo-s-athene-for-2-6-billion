Aviva Plc (AV/)  rallied to a two-week high in London trading after it sold its U.S. business to  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  for a higher-than-expected $2.6 billion.  The stock climbed 1.4 percent to 413.1 pence, the highest level since Sept. 19, extending gains this year to 11 percent. Aviva said in December that the life-insurance and annuities business was priced at $1.8 billion when the companies agreed the deal.  “The additional $800 million of unexpected cash further de-risks Aviva’s financial position,” Jon Hocking, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London with an overweight rating, said in a note to clients. It “modestly adds to solvency ratios, but more importantly will materially improve the cash position.”  Aviva, the U.K.’s second-largest insurer by market value, is rebuilding reserves depleted by the financial crisis. Chief Executive Officer  Mark Wilson , who succeeded  Andrew Moss  this year, is eliminating jobs and cutting costs as the company shrinks a 5.1 billion-pound ($8.3 billion) internal loan.  “The sale of the U.S. business is another milestone for Aviva,” Wilson said in a statement. It “is a step toward our goal of creating a business focused on cash flow and growth,” he said.  Apollo’s Athene Holding Ltd. said it paid $1.55 billion for the Aviva unit, while the U.K. insurer said it gets $2.3 billion after a $290 million loan repayment. The higher-than-expected proceeds are tied to earnings and other financial results in the period from June 30, 2012, to Sept. 30, 2013, Aviva said.
