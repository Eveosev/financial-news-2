President  James Bullard  said community banks have a critical
role in providing credit to small businesses.  “Those community banks that survived and thrived through
the crisis and its aftermath retain an important role in the
 U.S. economy ,” Bullard said in opening remarks at a conference
in  St. Louis . “Although community banks account for only 20
percent of all loans made by commercial banks, they account for
52 percent of the small business and farm loans.”  Bullard made a reference to this week’s U.S. government
partial shutdown in introducing Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  at
the St. Louis Fed’s conference on “Community Banking in the
21st Century,” a research and policy conference for bankers,
regulators and academics.  “Washington has shut down and is no longer playing
baseball, the chairman’s favorite sport,” Bullard said. “ St.
Louis  has not shut down and continues to play baseball; so,
consider St. Louis your home for baseball, Mr. Chairman.”  Bullard didn’t comment on the U.S. economy or monetary
policy in his remarks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
