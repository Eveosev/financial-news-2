The cost of money in U.S. markets
fell as the first government shutdown in 17 years entered a
second day with President  Barack Obama  summoning the top four
leaders of Congress to the White House.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  was little
changed, falling 0.1 to 1.3 after increasing 0.1 yesterday. The
gauge measures stress in the markets by combining everything
from money-market rates to yields on government and corporate
bonds to volatility in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate
of August 2011, the index fell to as low as negative 1.631.  Treasury yields fell as the U.S. government started a
partial closure yesterday while lawmakers face a decision on
raising the $16.7 trillion U.S. debt limit this month to ensure
the government has enough money to pay all its bills. The first
shutdown since 1996 may cost the U.S. at least $300 million a
day in lost economic output at the start, according to
forecasting firm  IHS Inc. (IHS)   “The markets are trying to figure out the exact economic
impact of what the government shutdown means,” Robert Schumacher, head of fixed income in the U.S. at Axa Investment
Managers, said in a telephone interview. “It may come down to
the eleventh hour but I have a high level of confidence that the
debt ceiling gets resolved.”  Obama invited House Speaker  John Boehner , Senate Majority
Leader  Harry Reid , Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  and
House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi  for the first high-level
talks on reopening the government and raising the debt ceiling,
a White House official said on condition of anonymity.  Treasuries  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  U.S. Treasury  note fell
3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.62 percent at
4:59 p.m. in New York, Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show. The
yield is down from this year’s high of 3 percent on Sept. 6 and
compares with an average of 3.52 percent over the past decade.  Rate Derivatives  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, rose 0.44 basis point to 13.88 basis points.
The gauge widens when investors seek the perceived safety of
 government securities  and narrows when they favor assets such as
company debentures.  Credit  A gauge of U.S. company credit risk held. The Markit CDX
North American Investment Grade Index, a credit-default swaps
benchmark that investors use to hedge against losses or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 0.2 basis point to a
mid-price of 79.6 basis points, prices compiled by Bloomberg
show. The index, which typically climbs as investor confidence
in credit deteriorates and falls as it improves, has averaged
81.8 basis points this year.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the
performance of a basket of 10 leading global currencies against
the dollar, dropped 0.3 percent to 1,008.50 in New York. The
index has traded in a range of 1,008.4 and 1,054.48 the past
three months. The greenback held at $1.3581. The yen was little
changed at 97.37 per dollar.  Stocks  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  fell 0.1 percent to 1,693.87 in
New York, after rising 0.8 percent yesterday. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  dropped 0.39 percent, to 15,133.14.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, gained 6.82 percent to
16.6, below its high for the year of 20.49 in June and above the
low of 11.3 in March. Volatility in Treasuries as measured by
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index fell to 82.15
today, compared with the 69.12 average for the past year.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
rose $2.06 to $104.10 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . WTI decreased 0.3 percent yesterday to the lowest
close since July 3. Prices increased 6 percent last quarter.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 2.7 percent to
$1,321 an ounce on the Comex. Gold prices have tumbled 21
percent this year, heading for the first annual loss since 2000.  Copper futures for delivery in December gained 1.3 percent
to $3.32 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
