Delta Lloyd NV (DL) , the biggest Dutch
provider of group life insurance, plans to sell its Belgian
banking unit to help strengthen its main business.  “This decision is in line with the group’s strategy, which
includes the ambition to grow in the Belgian life insurance and
pensions market and to reinforce its distribution power in
 Belgium ,” the Amsterdam-based company said in a statement
today. Delta Lloyd may give an update on the sale process by the
end of 2013, it said.  The Dutch insurer last month agreed to buy Belgium’s ZA
Verzekeringen by raising 63 million euros ($85 million) in a
share sale. Delta Lloyd’s Belgian lender reported first-half net
income of 12.4 million euros and had 6.9 billion euros in assets
under management at the end of 2012.  Delta Lloyd  plans to have a long-term distribution
agreement with the Belgian bank as a part of a transaction to
continue to sell pension and life insurance products through its
network, it said. The lender operates 55 branches and 75
independent agents, according to the statement.  Moelis & Co. was named as financial adviser on the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
