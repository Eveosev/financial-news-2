Kenya ’s shilling headed for the
steepest loss in seven weeks on speculation a rally that pushed
the currency to its strongest level in three months was overdone
as  East Africa ’s biggest economy slows.  The currency retreated for a second day after the National
Bureau of Statistics said yesterday Kenya’s hotels and
restaurants industry contracted in the second quarter. The
shilling has gained 0.7 percent since Sept. 20, the day before
al-Shabaab Islamist militants attacked a shopping mall in the
capital, Nairobi, that left at least 67 people dead.  “Importers demand for dollars and profit-taking by banks”
weakened the shilling, John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  The currency weakened 0.5 percent to 86.75 per dollar by 4
p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, the biggest decline on a closing
basis since Aug. 12. It strengthened to 86.10 per dollar on
Sept. 30, its highest level since July 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  tourism industry  in Kenya contracted 11.4 percent in
the three months through June, compared with a growth of 2.9
percent a year earlier, as gross domestic product slowed to 4.3
percent in the same period, according to the statistics bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
