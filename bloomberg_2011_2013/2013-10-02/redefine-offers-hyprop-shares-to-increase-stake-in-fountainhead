Redefine Properties Ltd. (RDF) , South
Africa’s second-biggest property company, plans to increase its
stake in  Fountainhead Property Trust (FPT)  by acquiring as many as 250
million participatory units in an all-share deal.  The offer consists of 110 units of  Hyprop Investments Ltd. (HYP) 
for every 1,000 units of Fountainhead, Johannesburg-based
Redefine said in a statement today. Redefine already owns about
50 percent of Fountainhead, the two companies said.  Redefine holds 11.4 percent of Hyprop, valued at about 2
billion rand ($200 million), based on today’s share price,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Redefine Chief
Executive Officer Marc Wainer said May 30 he may use the stock
as a currency for an acquisition or sell the shares. Redefine
has reduced its stake from 30 percent, using the shares to help
amass a controlling stake in Fountainhead.  Fountainhead, Hyprop and Redefine own shopping centers and
office parks in  Africa ’s largest economy. The central bank
forecasts gross domestic product will expand 2 percent this
year, the slowest pace since a 2009 recession, after strikes by
thousands of workers in the mining, manufacturing and
construction industries in August and September crimped growth.  Fountainhead  shares  were unchanged at 7.87 rand as of 2:34
p.m. in Johannesburg trading, valuing the company at 9.2 billion
rand. Hyprop stock  fell  1.6 percent while Redefine fell 1.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
