David Einhorn, the poker-playing
hedge-fund manager, said  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  may be a takeover
target for  AT&T Inc. (T)  after the British phone company ends its
joint venture with  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)   Following Verizon’s $130 billion buyout of Vodafone’s
Verizon Wireless stake, the Newbury, England-based company could
be enticing to a range of companies looking to expand in Europe,
said Einhorn, the president of Greenlight Capital, which owns
Vodafone shares.  “Vodafone remains pretty attractive, because once you
strip out the consideration for Verizon, you’re left with the
European business,” Einhorn said on Bloomberg Television’s
“Market Makers” with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker. “If
nothing else, it could be a target for someone like AT&T, that
wants to get exposure to Europe.”  AT&T has said as recently as last week that Europe remains
attractive, based on the relatively lower value of the wireless
carriers there. It also sees an opportunity to benefit from
investment in network upgrades that might prime the pump for
higher mobile data consumption.  “It’s a value play,” AT&T Chief Executive Officer  Randall Stephenson  said to investors last month at a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. conference in New York. “If there are opportunities that
look like a good value and the opportunity is there to invest,
of course, we would do it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
