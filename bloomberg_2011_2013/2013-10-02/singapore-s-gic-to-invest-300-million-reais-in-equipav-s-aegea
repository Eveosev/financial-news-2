GIC Pte,  Singapore ’s state fund,
agreed to invest 300 million reais ($135 million) in a Brazilian
water and sewage treatment company as it expands its presence in
 Latin America ’s biggest economy.  GIC will subscribe to a capital increase in Aegea
Saneamento e Participacoes SA, a unit of Grupo Equipav, to help
the firm maintain its growth plans, the Brazilian company said
in a statement dated yesterday. Aegea’s shareholders will be
Equipav, GIC and International Financial Corp., the  World Bank ’s
financing arm, after closing the transaction, according to the
statement.  GIC’s investment in Aegea comes as the Latin American
country is boosting infrastructure investments.  Brazil ’s
national cities council, an advisory group created by the
government, in June approved a 508.5 billion-real sanitation
plan to provide clean water supplies to all urban areas of
Brazil over the next 10 years.  “Aegea manages an attractive portfolio of water and sewage
concessions in Brazil,” Tay Lim Hock, president of GIC Special
Investments, said in the statement.  GIC, which manages more than $100 billion of Singapore’s
reserves, is planning to open a Sao Paulo office next year after
investing in Brazil, a person familiar with the matter said in
June.  The Singapore investment firm teamed up with its affiliate
 Global Logistic Properties Ltd. (GLP)  and two other state funds in
November to buy assets in Brazil for 2.9 billion reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
