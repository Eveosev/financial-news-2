Agrium Inc. (AGU) , the largest U.S. farm-products retailer, said Chief Operating Officer Chuck Magro will
succeed Mike Wilson as chief executive officer at the beginning
of the year.  Magro will join the board immediately and Wilson, 62, will
retire from the company at the end of the year after 10 years as
CEO, Calgary-based Agrium said today in a statement.  Magro, who has been COO since 2012, also served in other
roles in the company including executive vice president of
corporate development, according to the statement. He has a
Master’s of Business Administration from the University of
Windsor, the company said.  Under Wilson, Agrium beat back a proxy challenge from
activist investor Jana Partners LLC in April. Jana, Agrium’s
largest shareholder, had been pushing the company to spin off
its retail division, a network of agricultural outlets that
sells seeds, fertilizer and crop-protection chemicals to
farmers.  Agrium said last month that third-quarter earnings before
interest and taxes for its wholesale fertilizer business would
be $200 million less than a year earlier. The unit makes
nitrogen, potash and phosphate-based products and accounted for
31 percent of  revenue last year , compared with 66 percent from
the retail business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
