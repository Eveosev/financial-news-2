Hillary Clinton has the most support
of any potential Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential
sweepstakes and would defeat any of three Republican candidates
tested in a poll released today.  The former secretary of state, 65, has the support of 61
percent of Democrats, according to the Quinnipiac University
national poll.  In the Democratic field, Clinton tops Vice President Joseph Biden 61 percent to 11 percent, with 7 percent favoring U.S.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and 2 percent
supporting  New York  Governor Andrew Cuomo.  “As she watches the hand-to-hand political combat in
Washington, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remains
above the fray and the queen of the 2016 mountain,” said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling
Institute.  Asked about the Republican field, 17 percent of those
polled said they’d support Senator Rand Paul of  Kentucky , 13
percent were for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 12 percent
backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and 11 percent said they’d
support former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.  Senator Ted Cruz of  Texas  and Representative Paul Ryan of
 Wisconsin  each had 10 percent.  In a head-to-head contest against Republicans, Clinton
would defeat Christie 49 percent to 36 percent, Paul 53 percent
to 36 percent, and Cruz 54 percent to 31 percent.  The survey conducted among 1,497 registered voters between
Sept. 23-29 has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
