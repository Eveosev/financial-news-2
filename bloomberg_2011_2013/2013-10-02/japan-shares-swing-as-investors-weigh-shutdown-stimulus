Japan 's  Topix index  fell for a
fourth day as the yen gained against the dollar amid the U.S.
government shutdown and investors weighed Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s  sales-tax  increase and stimulus plan.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets about 80 percent of sales
abroad, slipped 1.5 percent. Pacific Metals Co., which derives
96 percent of revenue from nickel, dropped 6.2 percent after
Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its outlook for the metal.
 SoftBank Corp. (9984)  advanced 4 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said new iPhone sales at competitor  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437)  may be more
affected by inventory shortages than at other Japanese carriers.  The Topix slid 1.5 percent to 1,175.16 at the close in
Tokyo, after rising as much as 0.5 percent. The U.S. government
began its first partial shutdown in 17 years yesterday after
lawmakers failed to agree on a  federal budget . Abe confirmed
yesterday Japan would raise the consumption levy and compile a
$51 billion stimulus plan to soften its effects. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average sank 2.2 percent today to 14,170.49.  “At the moment, investors think the U.S. shutdown will end
soon, but if it drags on it could start to hit economic
fundamentals, such as consumption, and that’ll strengthen the
yen and have a negative impact on Japan,” said Takashi Aoki, a
Tokyo-based  fund manager  at Mizuho Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $33 billion in assets. “On a Japanese macro
level, the stimulus package can cover the increase in the sales
tax. However, now that the decisions have been made, I’m
concerned we won’t see any further measures from the government
to support the economy for some time to come.”  Sales Tax  Abe yesterday announced plans to push ahead with a 3
percentage-point increase in the sales levy to 8 percent next
April, the first such increase since 1997. To counter its
negative effects, the prime minister also unveiled a 5 trillion
yen ($51 billion) program including measures to boost  capital
investment  by smaller companies; spending for the 2020 Olympics;
payments to low-income earners; and tax incentives for home
purchases. The package matched the median estimate of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The U.S. has begun using the final extraordinary means to
avoid breaching the nation’s borrowing limit, Treasury Secretary
Jacob J. Lew said yesterday. They will be exhausted no later
than Oct. 17, he wrote in a letter addressed to House Speaker
 John Boehner .  “The progress on policy measures in Japan is positive,”
said  Hiroichi Nishi , a Tokyo-based equities manager at SMBC
Nikko Securities, a unit of Japan’s second-biggest lender. “Abe
said he would seriously consider lowering the corporate tax and
that’s boosting optimism. But even though U.S. stocks rebounded
yesterday, if raising the debt ceiling gets delayed like the
budget funding, it’ll be a disaster.”  Partial Shutdown  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  slipped 0.3 percent today. The
U.S. government began a first partial shutdown yesterday as
Republicans and Democrats remained at odds over whether to tie
any changes to the 2010 Affordable Care Act to a short-term
extension of government funding. As many as 800,000 federal
employees were out of work, while some government services were
halted.  Closing down parts of the government will cost the U.S. at
least $300 million a day in lost economic output at the start,
according to IHS Inc., with effects increasing if a prolonged
impasse dents consumer and business confidence.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
unexpectedly rose to 56.2 for September, the strongest level
since April 2011, and up from from 55.7 in August. Readings
above 50 indicate growth. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists was for 55.  Yen Advances  Japan’s currency advanced 0.5 percent to 97.56 against the
greenback today after gaining 0.3 percent yesterday. Consumer
electronics shares and automakers were among the biggest  drags 
on the  Topix (TPX)  today. Honda lost 1.5 percent to 3,715 yen.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest carmaker, slid 1 percent to 6,210
yen. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, declined 1.9
percent to 3,055 yen.  Among other stocks that fell, Pacific Metals slumped 6.2
percent to 365 yen, the biggest drop on the Nikkei 225. Merrill
Lynch analyst Takashi Enomoto reiterated his underperform rating
on the stock after the brokerage reduced its outlook for nickel
prices. Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. lost 1.4 percent to 279
yen. A gauge tracking non-ferrous metal producers sank 3.2
percent, the most among the Topix subsectors.  SoftBank jumped 4 percent to 7,240 yen, the most on the
 Nikkei 225 . The impact of shortages in Japan of popular iPhone
models may be greater than expected and may result in a lack of
growth in sales of the products, Goldman Sachs analysts Ikuo Matsuhashi and Sen Yao wrote in a report yesterday. NTT DoCoMo,
Japan’s No. 1 carrier, faces the biggest shortages among Japan’s
big-three carriers, they wrote. The stock slid 1.3 percent to
1,546 yen.  GS Yuasa  Battery-maker  GS Yuasa Corp. (6674)  jumped 3.9 percent to 611 yen,
the second-largest gain on the Nikkei 225. The stock was rated
outperform by SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., which set its target
price at 750 yen.  The Topix traded at 1.23 times  book value  today, compared
with multiples of 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.76 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index yesterday. The Japanese measure’s 30-day
 historic volatility  was at 18.34 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.35, with volume on the measure 11 percent
above its 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
