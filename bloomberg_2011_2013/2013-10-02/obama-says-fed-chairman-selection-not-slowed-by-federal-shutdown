President  Barack Obama  said the
decision on a nominee to become Federal Reserve chairman hasn’t
been slowed by the standoff on the budget and the partial
government shutdown.  In a recorded interview with CNBC, Obama said the selection
process to replace Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is proceeding.
He didn’t give any indication of who he is considering.  “Ben Bernanke’s still there and he’s doing a fine job,”
Obama said. “The shutdown is not slowing down the vetting. The
person I’m going to end up appointing will be someone who
reflects the Fed’s dual mandate” to keep inflation and
unemployment low.  The Fed’s current vice chairman, Janet Yellen, 67, is the
leading contender to succeed Bernanke. Senator Dick Durbin of
 Illinois , the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber and a longtime Obama
ally, said last month that he “would bet a few bucks” that the
president will pick Yellen.  Bernanke’s term expires Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
