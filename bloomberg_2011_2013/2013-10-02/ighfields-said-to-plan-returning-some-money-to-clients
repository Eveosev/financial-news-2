Highfields Capital Management LP, the
$13 billion money-management firm run by Jonathon S. Jacobson,
is planning to return some money to clients at the end of the
year, according to a person briefed on the plan.  The Boston-based firm may return between 5 percent and 15
percent of its assets, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Highfields posted
a gain of 18 percent this year through September, according to 
the person.  Fund managers sometimes give back client money to limit the
amount of assets they have to invest, a move that makes it
easier to find profitable opportunities. Billionaire Louis Moore Bacon, founder of hedge-fund firm Moore Capital Management LLC,
last year told clients that he planned to return $2 billion, or
25 percent of his main hedge fund, because assets were too big
for him to achieve past investment returns.  Highfields, which sent a letter to clients notifying them
about the plan, will make a final decision at the end of the
year about how much it will hand back to clients, the person
said. Jacobson wasnâ€™t available to comment on the plan when
contacted by  Bloomberg News .  Reuters reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
