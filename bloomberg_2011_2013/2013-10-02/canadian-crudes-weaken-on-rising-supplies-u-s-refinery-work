Canadian crudes weakened for a second
day on the  spot market  with some grades trading at their widest
discounts to the U.S. benchmark oil in 18 months as supplies
rose and U.S. refinery demand began a seasonal slowdown.  The Syncrude upgrader in Alberta said yesterday  production 
rose 39 percent to 291,000 barrels a day in September as it
ramped up after maintenance. U.S. refinery utilization rates
fell for a second week, the Energy Information Administration
said today.  Syncrude, a benchmark for light oil produced in upgrader
plants, weakened for November delivery by $1 a barrel to an
$11.50 discount to U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, according
to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. It was the grade’s biggest
discount since March 14, 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Maintenance at the Syncrude upgrader ended Aug. 27.  Husky
Energy Inc. (HSE)  is scheduled to return the 82,000-barrel-a-day
Lloydminster upgrader to service after a 45-day turnaround and
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  plans to finish work at one of its two Fort
McMurray upgraders.  The U.S. refinery utilization  rate  slid 3.5 percentage
points over the past two weeks to 89 percent, the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, said. Refiners typically
cut back output or shut for maintenance at this time of year
after boosting production during the summer driving season.
Current rates are still more than 5 percentage points above the
historical average, according to EIA data.  Western Canadian Select heavy oil weakened by 95 cents a
barrel to a $32.85 discount to WTI, Net Energy said. It was the
widest discount since Jan. 24, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, and compared with a 12-month average discount of
$23.44 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
