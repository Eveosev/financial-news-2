     Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- TransCanada Corp., co-owner of
 Canada â€™s biggest wind farm, bought two power plants from
 Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  for C$95 million ($91.9 million).  The Brockville 2 and Burritts Rapids projects in eastern
Ontario total 16 megawatts and are among nine that TransCanada
agreed in 2011 to buy from Canadian Solar, the Guelph, Ontario-based solar company said in a statement today.  The nine-plant deal comprises 86 megawatts of solar farms
and will cost about C$470 million, according to the statement.
They will all sell electricity to the Ontario Power Authority
under 20-year agreements.  TransCanada acquired the Brockville 1 plant in June and the
remaining six are expected to be operational by the end of next
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
