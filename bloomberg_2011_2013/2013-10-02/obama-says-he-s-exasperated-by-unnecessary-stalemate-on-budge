President  Barack Obama  said he’s
“exasperated” by the stalemate with Republicans on the budget
and debt ceiling and accused his opponents in Congress of being
unwilling to compromise.  “I have bent over backward to work with the  Republican
Party ,” Obama said in an interview with CNBC recorded earlier
today. “Am I exasperated? Absolutely. Of course I’m exasperated
because this is entirely unnecessary.”  While saying he is “prepared to negotiate on anything,”
Obama said he won’t budge from his demand for Congress to pass a
government funding authorization and raise the federal debt
limit without bringing in side issues. Republicans are insisting
that the new health-care law be stripped of funding or delayed
as the price for a deal.  The president spoke before a White House meeting with the
Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate. The
two parties are at in a fiscal standoff that led to a partial
government shutdown, now in its second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
