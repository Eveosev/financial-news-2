Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a spot
cargo from Trinidad & Tobago next week, shipping data show.  The Hispania Spirit, with a capacity of about 138,000 cubic
meters, is scheduled to arrive Oct. 7 at Pecem, according to
transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. State-owned
Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, has a floating
regasification terminal at the port in northeastern Brazil.  The vessel sailed from Atlantic LNG Co.’s Point Fortin
terminal, where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and
departed on Sept. 25, the data show.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
Trinidad & Tobago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rio
de Janeiro-based Petrobras will import as many as 15 cargoes a
month in 2014, a company official said Sept. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
