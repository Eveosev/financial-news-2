Nintendo Co. (7974)  will soon halt
production of the Wii gaming console for Japan, the only major
market where its new machine outsells the 7-year-old device.  There are no plans to end output for foreign markets,
 Yasuhiro Minagawa , a spokesman for the Kyoto, Japan-based
company, said by phone today. He didn’t provide specifics on
when domestic production would stop.  Nintendo unveiled the Wii U last year adding a touch-screen
controller to the motion-capture console it introduced in 2006
in a bet it could lure players away from smartphones and tablet
computers. While the company posted Japanese Wii U sales of
90,000 in the June quarter, more than 4 times the domestic
shipments of the Wii, Nintendo sold 31 percent more of the
earlier console in global markets than the new device in the
same period.  “Japanese consumers tend to switch to new hardware and now
the Wii doesn’t sell well in Japan,” said  Eiji Maeda , an
analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “In America and
Europe, there are people who buy old hardware if it’s cheap and
it would be a waste to stop production for them and throw that
market away.”  Nintendo, creator of the Mario and Zelda franchises, has
sold more than 100 million Wii units since its 2006 release. The
company’s consoles are made by companies in China, Minagawa said
without identifying producers.  The decision to end Wii production for Japan comes about a
month before  Sony Corp. (6758)  and Microsoft Corp. are due to release
the new generation consoles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
