The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
dropped, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan tumbled 5 basis points to 150 basis
points as of 8:17 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The benchmark is set for its
lowest close since Sept. 26, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 4 basis points to
118 as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices. The measure is poised for its biggest decline
since Sept. 19, according to data from CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index retreated 3 basis points to
92 as of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The gauge is set for its lowest level since Sept. 23, CMA data
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
