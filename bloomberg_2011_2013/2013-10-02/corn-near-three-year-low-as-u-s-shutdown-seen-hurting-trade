Soybeans rose on speculation that
rain will slow the harvest in the U.S., the world’s top
producer, boosting demand for prompt supply. Wheat closed at the
highest since June, and corn erased a drop to a three-year low.  As much as 3 inches of  rain  in the next five days from
North Dakota to  Michigan  also may reduce the quality of some
soybeans ready for harvest, World Weather Inc. Overland Park,
 Kansas , said in a report. As of Sept. 29, the  harvest  trailed
the average in the past five years, government  data  showed.  “Some delays are going to tighten up available supplies,”
 Dan Cekander , the director of grain market analysis at Newedge
USA LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “There’s a
big line of boats waiting to load” for exports, and domestic
processors need supplies to make animal feed, he said.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.5 percent to
close at $12.7375 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Yesterday, the oilseed touched $12.635, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Aug. 16. The price has dropped 9.6
percent this year on speculation that U.S. production will
recover from a drought in 2012.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$6.86 a bushel, the highest settlement since June 24. Two days
ago, the USDA said inventories as of Sept. 1 trailed estimates
by analysts.  Corn futures for December delivery were unchanged at $4.39
a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $4.35, the lowest since
Aug. 31, 2010.  The USDA suspended reports on crop and livestock data
because of the federal government’s partial shutdown. The
National Agricultural Statistics Service won’t issue statistics
while employees are furloughed from duty, the agency said on
Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
