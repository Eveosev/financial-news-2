The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSI) 
of mainland stocks traded in  Hong Kong  is set to advance to
levels unseen since May, according to  Phillip Futures  Pte.  The gauge’s 50-day moving average climbed above its 100-day
measure on Sept. 30, forming a so-called  golden cross  for the
first time in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The gauge advanced about 21 percent from this year’s low on June
25 through Sept. 19, a rally that some traders consider entering
a  bull market , amid signs  China’s economy  is improving. Since
then the index has fallen 4.1 percent and is 9.1 percent below a
high reached in May.  “We see the golden cross as a very positive signal,” Wang
Zilong, a strategist at Singapore-based Phillip Futures, said by
e-mail. “We believe the uptrend will remain intact and that the
index may test the intraday high of 11,361.88 seen on May 10.”  The last time a  golden cross  pattern occurred between the
50-day and 100-day moving averages of the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index, on Sept. 27, 2012, the gauge advanced 25
percent through Feb. 1 to 12,215.03, the highest close this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A rally for the H-Share index may also support gains in the
benchmark Hang Seng Index, which also formed a  golden cross  in
September. The gauge’s 50-day moving average climbed above the
100-day one on Sept. 16 and continued to increase, approaching
the 200-day moving average yesterday, when the index closed at
22,984.48.  That’s a sign the index may advance to 23,500, Tan Chee
Tat, an analyst at Phillip Futures said.  The  Hang Seng Index  formed two golden crosses in September
2012. It surged 14 percent from the end of that month to a 21-month high on Jan. 30.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index. A golden cross forms when a short-term moving average
rises above a long-term measure, and is seen as a bullish
indicator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
