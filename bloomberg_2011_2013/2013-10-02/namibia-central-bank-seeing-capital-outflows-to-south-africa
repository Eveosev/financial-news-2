Namibia ’s central bank said the
limited depth of the country’s financial sector and a lack of
local investment opportunities are leading to capital outflows
to neighboring South Africa.  “The largest chunk of capital outflows is in the form of
portfolio investments and the vast majority of these investments
are to South Africa,” Ndangi Katoma, a spokesman for the Bank
of Namibia, said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday.
“Namibia invests large sums of money into investment assets in
South Africa largely through contractual savings and
institutional investors.”  Namibian portfolio investments in South Africa were 4.5
billion Namibian dollars ($446 million) last year, after inflows
of 224 million Namibian dollars in 2011, according to central
bank figures. Capital outflows from 2008 to 2010 totaled 13.7
billion Namibian dollars, the figures show.  Namibia, the world’s biggest offshore diamond miner and the
fourth-largest uranium producer, relies on income from a customs
union with South Africa, Swaziland,  Lesotho  and  Botswana  for
about a third of its budget, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
