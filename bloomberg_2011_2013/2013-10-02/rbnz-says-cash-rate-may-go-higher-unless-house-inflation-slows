New Zealand   interest rates  may rise
faster than the central bank currently projects unless house-price inflation is brought under control, Governor Graeme Wheeler said.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand last month forecast that
the official cash rate would start rising from a record-low 2.5
percent next year. It expects the rate will increase to about
4.5 percent by early 2016, Wheeler said in an  article  on the
central bank’s website today.  Wheeler has been reluctant to raise interest rates to curb
a housing boom because that may boost the currency and hurt New
Zealand’s economic recovery. This week he introduced limits on
property lending when the loan-to-valuation ratio exceeds 80
percent to slow the fastest annual increase in  house prices 
since early 2008.  “We are keen to see house-price inflation moderate
significantly,” Wheeler said today. “If the loan-to-value
speed limit is unable to slow house-price inflation, larger
increases in the official cash rate would be required.”  House prices  rose 8.5 percent in August from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since January 2008, according to
Quotable Value New Zealand, a government-owned property research
company. In Auckland, home to a third of the nation’s 4.54
million people, prices surged 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
