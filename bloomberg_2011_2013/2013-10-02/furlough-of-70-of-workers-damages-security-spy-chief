U.S. intelligence agencies furloughed
about 70 percent of their workers, creating an “extremely
damaging” situation that will get worse if the government
shutdown continues, Director of National Intelligence James
Clapper told lawmakers.  “This seriously damages our ability to protect the safety
and security of this nation and its citizens,” Clapper told the
Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing today when asked how
the shutdown is affecting intelligence operations.  The U.S. government shutdown entered its second day today
after Congress couldn’t agree on funding of agencies’ 2014
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. As many as 800,000 federal workers
were sent home yesterday without pay.  “I’ve never seen anything like this,” Clapper said.
“This is not just a Beltway issue. This affects our global
capability to support the military, to support diplomacy and to
support our policies.”  Clapper called the shutdown a “dreamland” for foreign
intelligence services to ramp up their recruitment efforts.
“From my standpoint, this is extremely damaging, and it will
increase so as this shutdown drags on,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
