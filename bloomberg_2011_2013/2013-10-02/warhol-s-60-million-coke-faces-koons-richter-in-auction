Andy Warhol ’s painting of an
oversized Coke bottle could sell for as much as $60 million in
New York next month.  The Warhol will be one of the star lots of Christie’s
evening auction of postwar and contemporary art on Nov. 12. The
sale also includes a Jeff Koons balloon-dog sculpture owned by
newsprint magnate  Peter Brant  and a Gerhard Richter owned by
Eric Clapton.  Unlike his later silkscreens, Warhol painted “Coca-Cola
(3)” by hand in 1962, depicting a stark, black bottle on a
white 6-foot-tall canvas.  “If you want to define Pop art, this is it,” said Brett Gorvy, chairman and international head of postwar and
contemporary art at Christie’s. “It’s got two icons in one:
Coca-Cola and Andy Warhol.”  In 2012, Warhol was the auction market leader, selling
$380.3 million of art; nine works went for more than $10
million, according to  Artnet (ART)  Price Database.  “Coca-Cola (3)” was consigned by the Mugrabi family, who
bought the painting in 1995 from billionaire Si Newhouse.  In 2010, another Warhol soda bottle, “Coca-Cola (4),” was
bought for $35.4 million at  Sotheby’s (BID)  by hedge-fund manager
 Steven A. Cohen . The Christie’s Coke painting is estimated at
$40 million to $60 million and doesn’t carry a guarantee.  “I don’t think it needed a guarantee,” said Alberto Mugrabi. “There’s only one other example of this painting; it
belongs to Stevie Cohen.”  The painting will be on display at Christie’s in London
Oct. 12-18.  Muse highlights include  Ryan Sutton  on dining, Laurie Muchnick on October books.  To contact the reporters of this story:
