Henderson Land Development Co. (12) , the
Hong Kong builder controlled by billionaire Lee Shau-kee, agreed
to buy HK$2.96 billion ($382 million) of shares from the founder
and his family to broaden its income stream as property sales
slow.  The property developer will buy shares in the city’s
largest gas supplier  Hong Kong & China Gas Co. (3) , known as
Towngas, Hong Kong Ferry Holdings Co.,  Henderson Investment Ltd. (97) 
and a hotel company, according to a filing to the city’s stock
exchange yesterday.  Lee joins fellow billionaire  Li Ka-shing  in selling Hong
Kong assets as  China ’s economy slows and property prices hover
near record highs. Henderson, which already owns 42 percent of
Towngas, said the purchase was an attractive investment
opportunity to increase its share of a company with stable
income.  “This may be a sign Lee is seeing limited opportunities in
Hong Kong real estate for Henderson Land,” said Lee Wee Liat, a
property analyst at BNP Paribas SA who advises investors to buy
Henderson Land’s shares. “Hong Kong is now at the peak of the
property cycle so he’s trying to help the company redeploy its
investment.”  Seeking Income  Henderson Land will buy 155.3 million shares, or a 1.6
percent stake, in Towngas for HK$18.57 each, or HK$2.88 billion,
according to the filing yesterday.  Towngas “currently provides a substantial stable income to
the group,” Henderson said in yesterday’s statement. “It
allows an attractive investment opportunity to the group at a
reasonable cost to increase its stake.”  Henderson agreed to buy 7 million shares in  Hong Kong Ferry
Holdings Co. (50)  for HK$53.7 million, or HK$7.67 each, and 40.4
million shares in Henderson Investment Ltd. for HK$23.1 million,
or 57.2 cents each, according to the statement.  Shares of Towngas fell 0.9 percent to HK$18.56 as of 12:32
p.m. in Hong Kong trading, while Henderson lost 0.2 percent to
HK$48.50. Hong Kong Ferry gained 0.4 percent to HK$7.75 and
Henderson Investment jumped 11 percent to 62 Hong Kong cents,
the biggest gain in three years. The announcement came after
stock trading ended yesterday.  The transactions are to simplify the structure of his
companies, said BNP’s Lee. The billionaire may increase his
stake in Henderson Land if the price is right, Radio Television
Hong Kong said, citing Henderson’s Lee.  Li, Asia’s richest man, is seeking to raise as much as $5
billion by selling a stake in  Power Assets Holdings Ltd. (6) ’s Hong
Kong electricity business to the public, two people with
knowledge of the plan said last week.  32nd Richest  Lee is 33 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net
worth of $21.1 billion. He founded Henderson Land in 1973 and
expanded it into one of the city’s biggest developers, mainly by
buying dilapidated and old apartment buildings with multiple
owners.  Henderson Land also said yesterday it will buy 5.05 million
shares in  Miramar Hotel & Investment Co. (71)  for HK$51.1 million
from Woo Po-shing. Woo is the father of Jackson Woo, an
independent non-executive director at Henderson.  All of the purchases are scheduled to be completed no later
than Oct. 15, Henderson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
