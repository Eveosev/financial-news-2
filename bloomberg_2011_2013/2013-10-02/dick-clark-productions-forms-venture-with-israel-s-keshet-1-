Dick Clark Productions, acquired last
year in a deal led by Guggenheim Partners LLC, formed a joint
venture with the Israeli company Keshet Media Group to bring
programs to the U.S.  The deal with Keshet, producer of the “Prisoners of War”
drama that became the model for Showtime’s hit series
“Homeland,” was announced today in an e-mailed statement.  The venture, called Keshet DCP, will focus on unscripted
programming such as “ Rising Star ,” a talent show airing in
Israel that incorporates real-time voting by viewers through an
app integrated into the program.  “By combining our powerful resources, we hope to create a
vast slate of the most compelling unscripted programming
possible,” Allen Shapiro, chief executive officer of Dick Clark
Productions, said in a statement.  Dick Clark Productions, founded by the late television
host, produces the talent competition “So You Think You Can
Dance” on the  Fox network  in the U.S., as well as the Golden
Globe Awards.  Keshet, started in 1993, is one of Israel’s largest media
companies, producing content for broadcast television, pay TV
and online channels. It is closely-held and based in  Tel Aviv .  To contact the reporter on this story:
