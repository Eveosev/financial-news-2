Crude oil volatility fell as futures
jumped 2 percent after  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  said it expects to
commission the southern leg of its Keystone pipeline expansion
from Oklahoma to the Texas Gulf Coast by the end of October.  Implied volatility for at-the-money November options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value,
fell to 19.74 percent at 3:45 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  from 21.36 percent yesterday.  Puts accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading volume
today. The five most active options in electronic trading were
November puts for $94, $95, $100, $93 and $98, in that order.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery rose
$2.06 to $104.10 a barrel, the highest settlement since Sept. 20
and biggest gain in two weeks. Futures rose on speculation that
the Keystone expansion will reduce inventories at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for the WTI contract.  November $94 puts fell 11 cents to 4 cents a barrel with
3,759 lots trading as of 3:44 p.m. November $95 puts slid 16
cents to 5 cents on volume of 3,363.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 57 percent of
the 104,940 lots traded.  November $92 puts were the most-active options yesterday,
with 8,034 contracts trading as they were unchanged at 8 cents a
barrel. November $95 puts held at 21 cents a barrel on volume of
4,959 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
41,694 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 40,828 lots
and December $100 calls with 31,768.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
