Orexo AB (ORX)  fell the most in more than a
year in Stockholm trading after the Affaersvaerlden business
magazine said it sees risks for disappointment when the company
presents sales data for its Zubsolv medication this month.  The  shares dropped  as much as 8.8 percent to 114 kronor,
their steepest intraday decline since Sept. 21 last year. The
stock lost 8 percent to 115 kronor as of 11:44 a.m. local time,
making it the biggest decliner among the 278 companies on the
OMX Stockholm All-Share Index today. Trading volume was more
than twice the daily average in the past three months.  Affaersvaerlden advised its readers to sell shares in
Uppsala, Sweden-based Orexo, which plans to publish the first
sales numbers for its opioid dependence medicine Zubsolv when it
reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 23. The market has priced
in “sales success of almost biblical proportions,”
Affaersvaerlden wrote in an analysis.  “There is no room for setbacks,”  Affaersvaerlden  said,
advising readers not to buy the shares until they have fallen to
87 kronor. “The risk for disappointment is big when the first
sales figures are presented.”  Orexo, which develops specialty pharmaceuticals, has more
than doubled in value since the end of last year. It trades on
an earnings multiple of 28 times projected 2015 earnings,
Affaersvaerlden said.  Zubsolv was approved for the maintenance treatment of
opioid dependence by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
