Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  and
Mosaic Co. were among fertilizer makers that rose after Dow
Jones reported Russia is pushing for OAO Uralkali to resume
cooperation on potash sales with its Belarussian rival.  Potash Corp. climbed 3.2 percent to C$33.92 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest gain since Sept. 10. Mosaic was up 3.7
percent in  New York  and  Agrium Inc. (AGU)  rose 1.4 percent.  Russia has told bidders for Suleiman Kerimov’s 22 percent
stake in Uralkali they should repair a rift with Belarus that
led to the end of a joint venture controlling 40 percent of
global potash exports, Dow Jones reported today, citing
unidentified people close to the discussions. The Uralkali stake
will probably be sold to a local investor, Dow Jones reported.  Producers including Potash Corp. plunged on July 30 after
Uralkali, the world’s largest potash maker, exited the trading
venture and said it would boost output of the crop nutrient. The
$20 billion potash market was “paralyzed” by Uralkali’s move,
Potash Corp. Chief Financial Officer Wayne Brownlee said Sept.
18.  Uralkali Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner was
arrested in Minsk after meeting with the Belarussian prime
minister.  Potash prices have declined since Uralkali exited its
venture with Belarus, Peter Prattas, a Toronto-based analyst
with Cantor Fitzgerald LP, said in a phone interview today. A
resumption of the relationship would be positive for North
American producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
