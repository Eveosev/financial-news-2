Strategic Value Partners LLCâ€™s
Vestolit GmbH is among bidders for a German polyvinyl chloride
plant put up for sale by Ineos Group Holdings, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  A sale of the site in Schkopau,  Germany , is crucial for
chemical companies Ineos and  Solvay SA (SOLB)  to get regulatory
approval for the planned 4.3 billion-euro ($5.8 billion) merger
of their PVC operations. Vestolit would add the site to its
existing PVC facility in Marl, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the discussions are private.  Strategic Value Partners, founded by former Merrill Lynch &
Co. managing director Victor Khosla, declined to comment.  Ineos and Solvay announced the PVC merger in May to cut
costs in areas from transport to marketing and raise
profitability at a commodity business suffering from inflated
raw material and energy costs. The company are in talks with
European Commission regulators to win approval and a sale of the
Schkopau site, valued at about 60 million euros, may be
announced this year, the people said.  The PVC industry is facing overcapacity and weak demand in
Europe, prompting companies in the labor-intensive and power-hungry industry to explore mergers. Vestolit previously explored
a merger with  Vinnolit , a PVC maker owned by Advent
International, though no agreement was reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
