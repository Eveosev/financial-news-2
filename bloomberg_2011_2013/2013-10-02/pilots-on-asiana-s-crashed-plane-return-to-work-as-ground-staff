Two pilots on the  Asiana Airlines
Inc. (020560)  plane that crash-landed at a  San Francisco  airport in July
will return to work as ground staff, the company said.  The pilots, Lee Kang Kuk and Lee Jung Min, will return to
work as early as this week, Lee Hyo Min, a spokeswoman for the
Seoul-based airline, said today. Their specific roles haven’t
been determined, she said.  Manual flying skills and cockpit teamwork are part of the
U.S. probe into the crash of Asiana Flight 214, which struck a
seawall short of the San Francisco airport on July 6, killing
three people. Lee Kang Kuk was in control of the  Boeing Co. 777 
plane and was being trained by Lee Jung Min on the flight. More
than 300 people survived the crash, the first fatal airline
accident in the U.S. since 2009.  Spokeswoman Lee declined to comment on whether the two
pilots will resume flying in the future.  Asiana fell 0.8 percent to 5,000 won in Seoul trading. The
stock has fallen 19 percent this year, compared with a 0.1
percent climb in South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index.  Lee Kang Kuk, 46, logged 9,793 flight hours before the
accident. Only 43 were on the 777, after he moved up from the
narrow-body  Boeing 737 , and he was making his first trip to San
Francisco on the wide-body aircraft.  Lee Jung Min, 49, a Korea Aerospace University graduate who
joined Asiana in 1996, had flown 12,387 hours, including 3,220
on the 777.  Two other pilots on Flight 214 returned to flying last
month, spokeswoman Lee said.  Safety Standards  Asiana, South Korea’s second-biggest airline, plans to
expand instruction for air crew and begin an outside review of
safety standards, it said last month. Pilots will get more hours
in flight simulators to prepare for approaches to airports
without landing guidance systems.  The carrier said it will also hire another company to
evaluate its procedures, add safety specialists and boost
maintenance.  Lee Kang Kuk was using a visual approach the day of the
accident because the instrument landing system’s glide slope,
which helps line up the correct path to the runway, was closed
for construction. Former Asiana pilots and trainers have said in
interviews that the company’s pilots were well trained on
automatic systems, yet rarely flew manually.  It was Asiana’s first fatal accident since a Boeing 747
cargo plane went down at sea in the southern part of  South Korea 
in July 2011.  Yonhap reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
