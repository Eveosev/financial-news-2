(Corrects time period in first paragraph of story
published Oct. 2.)  Ankur Kumar, the admissions director
at the  University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School for two
years, resigned amid a decline in applications.  She will be replaced, effective Oct. 4, by Deputy Vice Dean
Maryellen Lamb, according to a memo distributed today by Dean
Tom Robertson and Vice Dean Howie Kaufold. In April, Robertson
said he will step down in June 2014.  Wharton reported this year that MBA applications fell
almost 6 percent, triggering speculation that the school has
lost its luster. In an interview, Kumar said that was
“absolutely not” the reason she’s leaving.  “This is not an impetuous decision,” she said. “It’s one
that has been going on for quite a few months. It’s completely
unrelated to anything else that’s going on.”  Kumar has said that one reason for the drop in
applications, which came amid a surge at other top schools, was
a new group-based admissions interview unveiled last year. The
new procedure, which involves applicants meeting in small groups
to work as a team to solve a business problem, may have
discouraged some prospective students. Philadelphia-based
Wharton hasn’t indicated it plans to abandon the new process.  The idea came from Wharton’s “innovation group,” which
fields ideas for improving business school processes.  Kumar didn’t say what she plans to do, explaining in an e-mail to colleagues that she is “pursuing several different
opportunities” in  New York  City and timed her departure to
avoid disrupting the new application cycle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
