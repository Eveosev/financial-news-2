BlackBerry (BBRY)  Ltd., the smartphone maker
seeking to sell itself, will record costs of about $400 million,
four times the amount it originally projected, as the company
cuts staff by 40 percent and sells equipment and real estate.  The expenses cover the cost of firing 4,500 workers, a move
that will reduce BlackBerry’s staff to about 7,000 people, the
company said in a regulatory filing late yesterday. As part of
its cost-cutting plan, BlackBerry plans to unload factories,
manufacturing gear and property. Those assets will be listed
separately on its balance sheet until they are sold.  BlackBerry, coping with plunging sales and mounting red
ink, is streamlining the business as it looks to seal a $4.7
billion buyout deal with its largest shareholder,  Fairfax
Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH)  The company agreed to the tentative
offer last month after years of losing ground to Apple Inc. and
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  In addition to the job cuts, BlackBerry
is writing down unsold phone inventory by almost $1 billion.  Even with the cuts, reaching the break-even point again
will be a challenge, said Steven Li, an analyst at Raymond James
Ltd. in Toronto. The company’s lucrative services business,
which supports corporate customers’ wireless devices, continues
to decline, muddying the picture.  ‘Elusive’ Profit  “We think profitability could remain elusive,” Li, who
has the equivalent of a hold rating on BlackBerry shares, said
today in a report.  Shares of Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry were little
changed today, closing at $7.96 in  New York . The stock price is
trading more than a dollar below the $9-a-share offer price, an
indication that investors have doubts about the deal.  Fairfax, a Toronto investment company run by  Prem Watsa ,
hasn’t revealed the names of other buyers in its takeover
consortium, raising concern that broader support for the
transaction won’t materialize.  Aside from Fairfax, the private-equity firm Cerberus
Capital Management LP has expressed interest in BlackBerry,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Cerberus is looking to sign a confidentiality agreement
with BlackBerry that would give it access to additional
financial data, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the negotiations are private. Cerberus’s interest in
BlackBerry, which may not lead to a bid, was  reported earlier  by
the Wall Street Journal.  Adam Emery, a spokesman for BlackBerry, declined to discuss
any talks that may be under way.  “We do not intend to disclose further developments with
respect to the process until we approve a specific transaction
or otherwise conclude the review of strategic alternatives,” he
said.  Phone Manufacturing  The burgeoning restructuring costs signal that BlackBerry’s
turnaround will be more extensive than expected. And even with
the latest cuts, analysts are unsure just how small the company
ultimately may get.  Jabil Circuit Inc., an electronics supplier for BlackBerry,
said last week that it would probably sever ties with the
company in the coming months. That fueled speculation that
BlackBerry may stop making phones altogether and become a
wireless-services business.  “BlackBerry’s ongoing handset business will be much
smaller and could even disappear,”  Peter Misek , an analyst at
Jefferies Group LLC in New York, said in a report last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
