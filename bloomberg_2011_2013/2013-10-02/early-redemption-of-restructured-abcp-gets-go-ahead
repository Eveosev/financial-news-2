Investors in restructured debt that
emerged from the collapse of C$32 billion ($31 billion) of
Canadian asset-backed commercial paper in 2007 now have the
chance to redeem their notes before maturity.  A process that gives investors the option of early
redemption of the securities is now in place, Moelis & Co. said
in a statement today. Moelis, the New York-based investment bank
founded by  Kenneth Moelis , had been advising a group of
institutional investors pushing to unwind the debt since March
2011. The first redemptions will begin by Oct. 31.  Canada ’s market for non-bank administered ABCP collapsed in
August 2007 on concern that part of the debt was backed by risky
U.S.  subprime mortgages . More than 100 companies and about 1,765
individuals were stuck with paper that couldn’t trade until a
court-ordered plan to convert the debt into longer-term notes
was completed 17 months later. Most of those notes mature in
January 2017.  Companies today are being offered more than 89.5 cents on
the dollar for the highest-rated notes that came out of the
January 2009 restructuring, according to Colin Kilgour, whose
Toronto-based Kilgour Williams Group advises holders of the
debt. That’s up from about 74 cents for the Master Asset Vehicle
A1 notes 18 months ago, and more than double the first trades in
2009, he said.  “We would expect to see prices jump on successful
completion of the redemption initiative,” Kilgour said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
