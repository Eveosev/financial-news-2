Spot wholesale electricity rose from
 Washington  to Chicago as unusually warm weather boosted air-conditioning demand.  Temperatures in cities along the Interstate-95 corridor
from Washington to Boston will climb to the highest levels since
2002 while Midwestern cities will see the warmest weather since
at least 2007, Jim Southard, meteorologist with Frontier Weather
Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said in an e-mail late yesterday.  Power consumption on the 13-state grid operated by PJM
Interconnection LLC, serving more than 60 million people from
the East Coast to the Ohio Valley, gained 4.8 percent during the
hour ended at 1 p.m. from the same time yesterday.  Spot prices at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
deliveries to Washington, rose $6.79, or 18 percent, to $43.99 a
megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 1 p.m. from the same time
yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Eastern hub, which  New Jersey , eastern Pennsylvania,
 Maryland  and  Virginia , gained $10.24, or 29 percent, to $45.14 a
megawatt-hour. On-peak prices at the hub traded at an average
premium of 93 cents to the Western hub versus 53 cents
yesterday.  The high temperature in Washington today may be 89 degrees
Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 16 above normal, and Chicago may be 10
higher than average at 78 degrees, according to AccuWeather Inc.
in  State College , Pennsylvania.  New York ’s high may reach 85
degrees, 16 more than usual.  New York  New York City prices briefly topped $360 at 12:20 p.m. amid
higher-than-forecast demand and periodic transmission
bottlenecks that limited supply from the western part of the
state grid, according to the New York Independent System
Operator Inc.’s website. Prices in the west zone, including
Buffalo, traded at a premium to  New York City  for a third day.  Spot power in the city averaged $113.75 a megawatt-hour
during the hour ended at 1 p.m., up $52.72, or 86 percent, from
the same time yesterday. The West zone jumped $101.21, or 77
percent, to $131.85.  The  premium  for on-peak electricity in the West widened to
$53.73 from an average of $46.06 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
