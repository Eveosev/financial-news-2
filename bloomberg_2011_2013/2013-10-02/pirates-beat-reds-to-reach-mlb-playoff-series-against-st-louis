Russell Martin  hit two solo home runs
as the Pittsburgh Pirates won their first Major League Baseball
playoff game since 1992 to advance to the National League
Division Series against the  St. Louis  Cardinals.  The Pirates beat the Cincinnati Reds 6-2 at PNC Park in
Pittsburgh in the NL wild-card game last night. The best-of-five
series with the Cardinals begins tomorrow in St. Louis.  The Pirates last made the postseason 21 years ago, when a
team led by  Barry Bonds  lost the NL Championship Series four
games to three against the Atlanta Braves, who host the Los
Angeles Dodgers tomorrow in Game 1 of their NL division series.  Tonight, the Cleveland Indians host the Tampa Bay Rays in
the American League wild-card game, to determine who will play
the  Boston Red Sox  in a best-of-five series. The  Detroit Tigers 
take on the Oakland Athletics in the other AL division series.  Marlon Byrd and Martin hit home runs in the second inning
and Pedro Alvarez drove in Andrew McCutchen in the third to give
Pittsburgh a 3-0 lead.  After Shin-Soo Choo scored on Jay Bruce’s single for the
Reds in the top of the fourth, the Pirates added two more runs
in the bottom of the inning, the first on a double by Neil Walker, who then scored when Byrd grounded into a fielder’s
choice.  Martin’s second home run, in the seventh inning, made it
6-1 to the Pirates and Choo completed the scoring with a solo
home run for Cincinnati in the eighth.
