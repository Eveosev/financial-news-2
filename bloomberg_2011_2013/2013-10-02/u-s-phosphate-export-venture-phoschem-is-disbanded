Phosphate Chemicals Export
Association Inc. , a joint venture that marketed U.S. phosphate
exports from fertilizer producers Mosaic Co. and Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., was wound down.  The venture, also known as PhosChem, was disbanded
effective yesterday, Rob Litt, a spokesman for Plymouth,
Minnesota-based Mosaic, said today in a phone interview. Litt,
who declined to give a reason for the move, said Mosaic provided
about 93 percent of PhosChem’s export volumes, with the
remainder coming from Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  “There wasn’t a whole lot of Potash Corp. product moving
through PhosChem,”  Bill Johnson , a Potash Corp. spokesman, said
by phone, without elaborating on the reasons for ending the
venture. The Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based company mines
phosphate in  North Carolina .  The demise of PhosChem comes two months after OAO Uralkali,
the world’s largest supplier of potash fertilizer, withdrew from
Belarusian Potash Co., a marketing joint venture with rival
producer Belaruskali. That decision sent shares of potash
companies plunging globally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
