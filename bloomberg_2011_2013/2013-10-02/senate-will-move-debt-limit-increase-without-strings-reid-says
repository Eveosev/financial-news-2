The  U.S. Senate  will consider a debt-limit increase before an Oct. 17 deadline free of any of the
spending cuts or policy changes that Republicans are demanding,
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said today.  The Nevada Democrat, who is pressing House Speaker  John Boehner  to end a government shutdown by passing a Senate plan to
fund the government through Nov. 15, indicated that he may not
bring up the proposal to increase the debt limit until after the
shutdown ends.  “Not now -- sometime, but not now,” he said when asked
about timing.  The Senate is two weeks away from hitting the $16.7
trillion federal borrowing limit on Oct. 17. Under Senate rules,
it could take up to a week to pass legislation increasing the
debt ceiling and would need the votes of at least six
Republicans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
