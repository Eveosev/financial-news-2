Argentina , which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a
reloaded spot cargo from  Spain , shipping data show.  The LNG Gemini, with a capacity of about 127,000 cubic
meters, is scheduled to arrive tomorrow at Recalada near  Buenos
Aires , according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. The vessel loaded the supercooled gas from storage at
the Sagunto receiving terminal in eastern Spain and departed
Sept. 19, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  SAGGAS Planta de Regasificacion de Sagunto SA operates the
LNG receiving terminal in Sagunto, according to the company’s
website. Spain doesn’t produce LNG.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF opened a qualifying process Sept. 26 for potential
sellers in its tender to buy spot cargoes for 2014. Enarsa and
YPF have issued seven spot tenders since December seeking as
many as 150 shipments for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
