Treasury market volatility increased
the most in six weeks as a U.S. budget impasse forced a partial
shutdown of federal services and the government approached its
debt limit.  Price swings as measured by the Merrill Lynch Option
Volatility Estimate Index rose by 9 percent yesterday, the most
since Aug. 16. The gauge advanced for a fifth day, the longest
run of increases in about a month. The index level was at 87.37,
versus the average of 69.07 for the past year. Treasury
Secretary Jacob J. Lew said the U.S. has begun using the last
measures available to avoid breaching the nation’s debt limit.  “Things will remain volatile” as turbulence spreads from
the government to the market, said Roger Bridges, who helps
oversee the equivalent of about $21.6 billion as the head of
fixed income in Sydney at Tyndall Investment Management Ltd.,
part of Nikko Asset Management Co. “If it’s in the halls of
Congress, it’s going to be in the Treasury market.”  Ten-year U.S.  yields  were little changed at 2.64 percent as
of 6:55 a.m. in  London , Bloomberg Bond Trader data show. The
price of the 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 was 98 25/32.  Japan ’s 10-year yield slid two basis points to 0.64
percent, the lowest level since May 10. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Treasury Performance  Treasuries have fallen 2.5 percent this year, according to
the Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, reflecting concern the  Federal
Reserve  is planning to trim its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases as the  U.S. economy  improves.  Japan’s debt returned 2.1 percent, the indexes show, after
the central bank in April began its own debt-buying program to
support the economy, snapping up more than 7 trillion yen ($71.6
billion) of bonds a month.  Lew, in a letter to House Speaker  John Boehner  yesterday,
repeated that the debt measures will be exhausted no later than
Oct. 17 and urged Congress to extend the nation’s borrowing
authority immediately.  Once they run out, “we will be left to meet our country’s
commitments at that time with only approximately $30 billion,”
Lew said in the letter. “This amount would be far short of net
expenditures on certain days, which can be as high as $60
billion.”  The first U.S. government shutdown in 17 years has done
little to dent confidence in markets on speculation the stoppage
will end in time for lawmakers to tackle the nation’s debt
limit.  Stress Increases  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  rose
yesterday for the first time in seven days, increasing 13
percent to 1.325. The gauge measures stress in the markets by
combining everything from money-market rates to yields on
government and corporate bonds to volatility in equities.  Treasuries fell yesterday, with the 10-year yield advancing
four basis points, reflecting waning demand for haven assets.  Rates on U.S. bills due Oct. 24 were as high as 0.1 percent
yesterday, after touching negative 0.01 on Sept. 27.  Two years ago, one-month  yields  climbed to a 29-month high
of 0.18 percent as the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline set by Treasury to
avoid a default approached.  Three-month (USGG3M)  rates rose to 0.02 percent yesterday. They
touched negative 0.0101 percent on Sept. 27, the lowest level
this year. The 2013 average is 0.048 percent.  Trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker
of  U.S. government debt , declined 1 percent to $326 billion
yesterday. The average for the past year is $294 billion.  ISM Report  Treasuries also fell yesterday as the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  of U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly
climbed to the highest level since April 2011.  U.S. payrolls probably increased by 180,000 in September,
the most since April, after advancing by 169,000 in August,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The  jobless rate 
held at 7.3 percent, a separate survey showed.  The Labor Department won’t release the employment report as
scheduled Oct. 4 if the government is closed, according to a
government official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the process
and requested anonymity.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  on Sept. 18 left its
monthly asset purchases unchanged at $85 billion and signaled
that benchmark rates will remain low into 2016. The U.S. will
buy as much as $4 billion of notes today.  The U.S. shutdown is fueling speculation that the Fed will
delay reducing its debt purchases if it hurts the economy.  “Yields will go down a bit,” said Allen Lei, a trader of
Treasuries in Taipei at Hontai Life Insurance Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $6.2 billion. “The shutdown will
have some negative impact on the economy.” Lei said he bought
30-year Treasuries yesterday at 3.72 percent. The yield was 3.71
percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
