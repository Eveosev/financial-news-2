Ethanol plummeted against gasoline
after a government report signaled distillers are receiving
enough corn to allow them to boost output. Renewable
Identification Numbers also plunged.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 6.21 cents to
$1.0017 a gallon on Energy Information Administration data today
showing  production  last week jumped 5.2 percent to 875,000
barrels a day, the most since July 12. About 12 percent of the
corn crop was  harvested  as of Sept. 27, according to the
Agriculture Department.  “It’s amazing what a little new-crop corn or corn
availability can do,” said Garrett Toay, founder of Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Clive,  Iowa . “You’re seeing what
they’re able to do now that they’re getting corn. It’s just a
matter of time before supply gets refilled.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery tumbled 4.4 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to $1.627 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The October contract, which expires tomorrow, fell 12.3
cents, or 6.4 percent, to $1.787.  Gasoline for November delivery rose 1.81 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.6287 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  RINs Prices  A 2007 energy law requires the U.S. to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year. The government maintains
compliance with Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
tracking certificates attached to each batch of biofuel. They
can be traded among refiners and later submitted to the
Environmental Protection Agency.  Conventional ethanol RINs dropped 6 cents to 39 cents, the
lowest since Feb. 20, while advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, declined 4 cents to 49
cents, the cheapest since Jan. 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S. and one bushel
of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  Last month, the USDA predicted a record corn harvest of
13.843 billion bushels, 28 percent above last year. Harvest is
typically September through November.  Corn for December delivery was unchanged at $4.39 a bushel
in Chicago. The December corn crush spread of corn to ethanol
was minus 2 cents, down from break-even yesterday.  Ethanol Output  Ethanol  production  in the week ended Sept. 27 jumped the
most since April, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
analytical arm.  Stockpiles declined 0.7 percent to 15.5 million barrels,
the lowest since June 28, while  imports  tumbled 71 percent to
14,000 barrels a day, EIA said.  Ethanol blender and refinery inputs , a measure of demand,
slipped 0.7 percent.  In cash market trading, ethanol tumbled 33.5 cents to
$1.975 a gallon in Chicago, dropped 32 cents to $2.055 on the
 Gulf Coast , 21.5 cents to $2.05 on the West Coast and 7.5 cents
to $2.20 a gallon in  New York , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  New York’s premium to Chicago was 22.5 cents, compared with
a 3.5-cent deficit yesterday, while the West Coast’s discount to
the Gulf narrowed 10.5 cents to 0.5 cent.  Spot anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.22 a gallon as
of Sept. 27, the highest price since July 5, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
