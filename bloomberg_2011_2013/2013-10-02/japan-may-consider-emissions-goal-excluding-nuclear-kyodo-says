Japan’s environment minister,
 Nobuteru Ishihara , said the country’s target to cut greenhouse
gas emissions should be based on a scenario with no nuclear
power generation, the Kyodo News agency reported yesterday.  Discussions on emissions should take into account that
Japan will remain without nuclear reactors, Ishihara told a
meeting of four ministers yesterday, Kyodo reported.  The ministers have yet to agree on the new target or how
much nuclear power generation should account for Japan’s energy
mix, Kyodo reported, citing the minister.  Ishihara said in January that the country will set a new
target by November after reviewing the previous government’s
goal to reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels.  Japan ’s last operating nuclear reactor was halted for
maintenance in September, leaving the nation without nuclear
energy for the first time since July 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
