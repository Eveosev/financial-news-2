Baltika AS, the third-biggest listed
Baltic clothing company, fell the most in 18 months after
cutting this year’s profit target by half.  The stock fell as much as 11 percent to the lowest level
since January and closed down 9.6 percent at 0.642 euro in
 Estonia ’s capital Tallinn, where the retailer is based. Volume
of 144,738 shares was the most since Aug. 9, 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Baltika now sees 2013 net income similar to last year’s on
slower third-quarter sales, it said after trading yesterday. The
company cut a February forecast that profit would double this
year and estimated that sales at its 119 stores in the three
Baltic countries, Ukraine and  Russia  will grow 7 percent this
year instead of the previously forecast 10 percent.  “Warmer than usual weather in August and September reduced
consumer demand for autumnal garments in all five of Baltika’s
retail markets, thus decreasing the commercial margin and gross
profit for the group,” the company said.  Sales in September fell 8 percent from the same month last
year to 4.7 million euros ($6.4 million), it said.  Apranga AB, a Baltic clothing retailer based in Vilnius,
 Lithuania , said yesterday its sales grew 6 percent in September
from a year earlier to 16.4 million euros and increased at a 10
percent annual pace in January-September. Apranga shares, which
fell 0.4 percent yesterday after the report, were unchanged
today at 2.55 euros in Vilnius.  To contact the reporter on this story:
