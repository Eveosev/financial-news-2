The euro stayed weaker against the
yen after the  European Central Bank  left its benchmark  interest
rate  at a record low as it seeks to support the region’s
economic recovery.  Europe ’s common currency was about 0.5 percent from an
eight-month high versus the dollar. The ECB’s decision to keep
its main refinancing rate at 0.5 percent was predicted by all 52
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. ECB president  Mario Draghi  is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. in
Paris to explain the decision. The yen strengthened against all
its 16 major counterparts as the partial shutdown of the U.S.
government showed no signs of ending quickly, boosting demand
for safer assets.  “We’ll get dovish rhetoric from Draghi, almost
certainly,” Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in  London , said before the ECB’s rate decision.
“While he would like to try and soften the euro from current
levels, I’m not sure he’s going to have the clout to have a
sustained impact. The main determinant will be the U.S.”  The euro fell 0.6 percent to 131.72 yen at 12:46 p.m.
London time after dropping 0.3 percent yesterday. The common
currency was little changed at $1.3516 after rising to $1.3588
yesterday, the strongest level since Feb. 6. The yen jumped 0.6
percent to 97.45 per dollar.  The euro weakened 0.7 percent against the dollar on the day
of the previous ECB meeting on Sept. 5 when Draghi said
officials had discussed reducing interest rates. Draghi said on
Sept. 23 policy makers would consider another round of longer-term loans to banks if required to keep down borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
