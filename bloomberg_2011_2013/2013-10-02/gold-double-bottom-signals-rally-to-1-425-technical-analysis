Gold futures may rebound to $1,425 an
ounce in the fourth quarter after forming a “double bottom,”
according to technical analysis by Logic Advisors.  The price may climb 7.9 percent from the latest settlement,
said  Bill O’Neill , a partner at Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle
River, New Jersey. Yesterday, the price touched $1,276.90, the
cheapest in eight weeks, following the first trough of $1,271.80
on Aug. 7. A double bottom is a chart pattern showing a drop, a
rebound and then another decline approaching the previous low,
usually indicating price support.  Yesterday, gold had the biggest gain in almost two weeks on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will delay reducing
monetary stimulus amid the first U.S. government shutdown in 17
years. The price has dropped 21 percent this year, tumbling into
a  bear market  in April, as U.S.  equities  rose to a record and
inflation remained moderate, eroding the appeal of the metal as
a store of value.  “We have seen prices bounce back from the $1,270 level,
and it seems like we have found a bottom,” O’Neill said in a
telephone interview. “The political uncertainty and physical
demand should also provide support here.”  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold dropped
to 1,929.26 metric tons, the lowest since May 2010, cutting
$60.1 billion from the value of the funds this year.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
