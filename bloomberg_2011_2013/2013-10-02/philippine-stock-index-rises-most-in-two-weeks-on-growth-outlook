Philippine stocks  rose the most in
almost two weeks after the  Asian Development Bank  raised its
economic growth forecast for the southeast Asian economy.  LT Group Inc. (LTG) , owner of half of the nation’s largest
cigarette-maker, advanced 7.3 percent. Bank of the Philippine
Islands, the country’s largest bank by market value, jumped the
most since December.  SM Investments Corp. (SM)  climbed 3.8 percent
after saying its unit plans a reclamation project.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rallied 2.7 percent to
close at 6,362.26, the biggest gain since Sept. 19. The Asian
Development Bank in a report today lifted its expansion forecast
to 7 percent for this year from 6 percent previously, and also
increased its 2014 estimate to 6.1 percent from 5.9 percent.  “The favorable economic outlook is boosting investors
confidence that Philippine stocks remain a good bet,” Astro del Castillo, managing director at First Grade Finance Inc., said by
phone. “There is confidence that valuations are fundamentally
supported.”  Shares on the  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  trade at 17.2
times 12-month estimated earnings, down from a record 20.9 on
May 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation is well placed to withstand any volatility with
its current account surplus and high foreign exchange reserves,
the bank said.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index lost 4.2 percent in the
third quarter, extending a 5.6 percent slump in the three months
ended June 30, amid concern the U.S. will pare monetary
stimulus. The index closed at a record 7,392.20 on May 15 as
accelerating economic growth and two debt rating upgrades to
investment status lured foreign investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
