The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
is testing an overnight fixed-rate reverse repurchase agreement
facility that may be used to aid policy makers when they tighten
monetary policy.  The temporary open-market operations may extend through
Jan. 29, according to a New York Fed  statement  on Sept. 20. The
Fed drained $4.507 billion from the banking system yesterday.  Fed staff members presented officials the possibility of
the facility at the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s meeting in
July. The system would allow the central bank to offer an
overnight, risk-free  instrument  to a “wide range of market
participants,” and possibly improve its ability to keep short-term rates at desired levels, minutes from the gathering showed.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
