Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest airline, fell the most in a month after a stock
rating downgrade by Deutsche Bank AG raised concern that
analysts may lower their earnings estimates for next year.  The shares fell as much as 3.9 percent to 14.23 euros in
Frankfurt, the biggest intraday decline since Sept. 4. Lufthansa
traded at 14.29 euros as of 11:17 a.m., making the stock the
worst performer in the six-member Bloomberg EMEA Airlines Index
and valuing the company at 6.57 billion euros ($8.9 billion).  Lufthansa faces headwinds from currencies including the
Japanese yen and the  Indian rupee , while customer demand and
capacity discipline are not as strong as anticipated, analysts
including Michael Kuhn said in an Oct. 1 note to clients. Some
costs associated with its efficiency program, dubbed Score, may
be a “negative trigger event” if the Cologne-based company
provides more details in an Oct. 4 update, they said.  “Lufthansa’s reported operating profit could well be
flattish in 2014, while the market expectation still is a major
improvement,” said the analysts, who lowered their rating to
hold from buy with a 12-month price target of 14 euros. “This
may well result in disappointment in the short term.”  Operating profit at Lufthansa may increase 76 percent to
956.8 million euros this year, and another 43 percent to 1.38
billion euros in 2014, according to the average of 17 analyst
estimates  collected  by Bloomberg. The company plans to raise the
measure to 2.3 billion euros by 2015, contrasting with estimates
for 1.85 billion euros.  Lufthansa so far said project costs associated with the
Score program will amount to a “low three-digit million-euro
amount” to be booked in the fourth quarter, without being more
specific.  Deutsche Bank’s Kuhn said the charges aren’t reflected in
current analyst estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
