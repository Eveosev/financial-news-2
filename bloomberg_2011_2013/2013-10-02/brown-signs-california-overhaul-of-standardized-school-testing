California will switch to
computerized testing for schoolchildren based on Common Core
benchmarks adopted by 45 other states despite threats by federal
education officials to withhold funding.  The bill signed today by Governor  Jerry Brown , a 75-year-old Democrat, will overhaul annual standardized testing by
replacing the multiple-choice printed test students in the most
populous U.S. state have taken for more than a decade.  The Common Core math and language-arts standards for
kindergarten through high school are a response to U.S.
graduates falling behind those in other countries. They were
were finalized in 2010 by the National Governors Association
Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School
Officers, according to corestandards.org.  The federal education law known as No Child Left Behind
requires annual testing of students on state standardized
reading and math exams to measure school and individual
performance.  U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said last month that
 California  may lose federal funds if it switches systems because
the state would be left without required test scores for a year
while the new exams are brought online.  “Faced with the choice of preparing California’s children
for the future or continuing to cling to outdated policies of
the past, our state’s leaders worked together and made the right
choice for our students,” state schools Superintendent Tom Torlakson said in a statement.  The U.S. ranked 14th among 37 countries in the percentage
of 25- to 34-year-olds with higher education after being a world
leader a generation ago, according to a 2012 report by the
Paris-based  Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development . Only 39 percent of 2013 high-school graduates who
took the ACT standardized test met three or more of four
college-readiness benchmarks, and 31 percent met none, ACT Inc.,
a non-profit based in  Iowa  City, Iowa, said in an Aug. 21
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
