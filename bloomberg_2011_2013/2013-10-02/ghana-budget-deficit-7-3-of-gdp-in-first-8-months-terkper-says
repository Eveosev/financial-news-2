Ghana’s budget deficit stood at 7.3
percent of gross domestic product in the first eight months of
the year, and the country is on track to meet its full-year
target, Finance Minister Seth Terkper told reporters.  The shortfall compares with targets of 6.6 percent of GDP
for the period to August, and 9 percent for the year. Spending
ahead of December elections spurred the deficit to 12.1 percent
in 2012.  The government cut expenditure on goods and services to 463
million cedis ($213 million) in the year to August, while
capital expenditure has been lowered to 2.7 billion cedis
compared with a target of 3.2 billion, Terkper said in Accra. A
reduction in fuel and utility subsidies is also supporting
fiscal consolidation, he said.  Oil revenue reached $1.2 billion through August, compared
with a target of $788 million, according to Terkper. Tax revenue
during the period fell 14.5 percent below a budget target of
10.4 billion cedis, he said.  The currency of West Africa’s second biggest economy lost
0.2 percent to 2.1800 per dollar at 3:50: p.m. in Accra. It has
weakened by more than 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
