Revenue at the world’s biggest
investment banks may be down 18 percent in the third quarter
after a drop in their fixed-income, currencies and commodities
divisions, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said.  Third-quarter FICC revenue may decline 24 percent from the
previous quarter and by 35 percent from the same period last
year, analysts led by  Kian Abouhossein  wrote to clients today,
citing lower trading volume and tighter credit spreads.  Equities sales are expected to fall by 13 percent from the
prior quarter because of low volatility and weak volume in
equity derivatives. Advisory and underwriting revenue may slip
by 14 percent, the analysts said.  The global investment banks tracked by JPMorgan are  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  UBS (UBSN)  AG,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Societe Generale SA and BNP
Paribas SA.  JPMorgan recommends UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank,
because of its business mix and Deutsche Bank, which is the
cheapest among its peers based on price to earnings and price to
net asset value, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
