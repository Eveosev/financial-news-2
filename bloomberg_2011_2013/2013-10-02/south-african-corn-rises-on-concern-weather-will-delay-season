Corn futures traded in South Africa,
the continent’s largest producer of the grain, rose on concern
rain will delay the start of the season.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 0.5 percent to 2,349 rand ($232) a metric ton
by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. That was a seventh increase in eight sessions. The
yellow variety for the same delivery month rose 0.5 percent to
2,151 rand a ton.  “There are weather uncertainties,” Thys Grobbelaar, an
analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by
phone. “Midsummer rains are expected, and this might make the
season late. It’s not very good weather expected for the western
areas of the country.”  North West province, which grows about 16 percent of the
nation’s corn, was declared drought-stricken, the South African
Press Association reported Sept. 18, citing the local
government.  A meal made from white corn is one of South Africa’s staple
foods and the yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December added 0.5 percent to 3,428
rand a ton, also a seventh advance in eight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
