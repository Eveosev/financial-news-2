A case of 2010 Chateau Pichon-Longueville, a second-growth Bordeaux wine estate, fetched 1,260
pounds ($2,040) on the Liv-ex market in the past week, its low
for this year, as demand weakened for the region’s top wines.  The transaction, on Sept. 27, was followed by two more
cases selling for 1,350 pounds each on Oct. 1 and six bottles
fetching the equivalent of 1,336 pounds per case the same day.
With the exception of last week’s sale, those trades were also
at prices below previous deals this year on the exchange,
according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has fallen since mid-March
following a muted response to the sales campaign for Bordeaux
2012 wine futures. While gains in the first three months of the
year mean it has still risen 2 percent since the end of
December, wine investors have been looking for price growth
beyond the core Bordeaux markets. The broader Liv-ex 100 Index
has also dropped for the past six months.  “There were few buying trends in September,” Liv-ex said
in a market commentary blog on its website. “Only a handful of
wines in the Liv-ex 100 saw significant positive price moves.”  The transaction last week was 32 percent below the peak of
1,845 pounds paid for a case of the vintage in February, and 16
percent down from the 1,500 pound level at which three cases
changed hands in late December. The vintage first traded on Liv-ex at 1,400 pounds a case in June 2011 soon after its release to
the market.  Cabernet Sauvignon  The estate is owned by Axa Millesimes, a wine investment
unit of French insurer  Axa SA (CS) , and has 73 hectares (180 acres)
of vineyards planted with 65 percent  Cabernet Sauvignon  and 35
percent Merlot grapes.  Pichon-Longueville’s 2010 vintage is the wine estate’s most
expensive since 2000, according to merchant prices tracked by
Liv-ex.  The 2010 wines were awarded a rating of 97+ points by U.S.
critic  Robert Parker  in an online tasting note in February,
fractionally below the 98 points awarded to the 2009 wines and
making the two vintages the estate’s top-rated of the past 12
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
