Credit-default swaps on U.S.
Treasuries fell as trading of contracts insuring against losses
on the nation’s debt jumped.  Five-year swaps fell 3 basis points to 30 basis points,
after reaching a five-month high of 34 on Sept. 30, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts were the 15th most
traded of 1,000 entities tracked by the Depository Trust &
Clearing Corp. in the week through Sept. 27, up from 147th the
previous period.  Investors are speculating that lawmakers will agree to
raise the nation’s $16.7 trillion debt limit by Oct. 17 to avoid
default, which would trigger payouts on debt insurance. The U.S.
is taking extraordinary measures to avoid breaching the debt
ceiling after a standoff between Congressional leaders triggered
the first government shutdown in 17 years.  There were 56 trades covering a gross $2.1 billion of
Treasuries in the week through Sept. 27, compared with 10 trades
covering $290 million the previous week, according to DTCC,
which runs a central registry for the market.  The amount of Treasuries protected also increased last
week, with the 8 percent rise the biggest since June 2011, DTCC
data show. There are now 886 contracts covering a net $3.4
billion of Treasuries outstanding, the most since March and up
from an almost three-year low of $3.1 billion on Sept. 20.  That compares with $13.1 billion of protection on German
bunds and $16.9 billion on Italy’s debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
