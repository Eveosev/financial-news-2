BP Plc (BP/)  and  DuPont Co. (DD)  announced a
joint venture to retrofit an ethanol plant in  Minnesota  to make
a successor renewable fuel, biobutanol.  Highwater Ethanol LLC (HEOL)  licensed the technology from the
companies’ venture, Butamax, for its technology to retrofit an
ethanol plant. The facility will begin the first phase of
commercial production, in which corn oil will be made, in the
next few months, the company said in a statement today.  “This is the next step in the road to commercialization,”
Paul Beckwith, the chief executive of Butamax, said in an
interview.  The production of biobutanol, which is made from corn, is
important because the company says it has lower greenhouse-gas
emissions than corn-based ethanol and doesn’t present the same
kind of refining issues. Refiners such as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
say a drop in demand for gasoline means that the country is
close to hitting the so-called “blendwall” of 10 percent
mandated ethanol production.  Biobutanol, because of its chemistry, can be blended into
gasoline at twice that percentage without any negative impact on
automobile engines, Beckwith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
