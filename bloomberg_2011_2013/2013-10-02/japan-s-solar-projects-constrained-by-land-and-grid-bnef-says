Land and grid constraints mean only
14% of the solar projects approved under an incentive program
for clean energy by  Japan , set to become the largest solar
market this year, were generating power by May.  Of the 20.9 gigawatts of solar projects approved by that
month since the introduction of an incentive program in July
2012, only 2.9 gigawatts were operating, Bloomberg New Energy
Finance said in a report yesterday based on data released by the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.  Utility-scale projects account for much of the delay,
according to the report. Large-sized projects totaling 13
gigawatts have been approved, with only 0.44 gigawatts, or 3
percent of the approved capacity, commissioned.  The government is polling developers about the status of
their approved projects and expected date of the start of
operations, BNEF said.  Japan is set to become the largest solar market with 6.9
gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts of capacity estimated to be added
this year, according to BNEF.  The market is still dominated by Japanese manufacturers,
BNEF said. About half of the modules imported from outside Japan
in the three months ended June 30 came from Japanese
manufacturers with plants overseas, according to the London-based research agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
