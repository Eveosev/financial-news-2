Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.,
operator of a global registry for credit-default swaps and
processor of U.S. stock trades, bought Omgeo to expand as
regulators demand more transparency and push more contracts
through clearinghouses.  DTCC and  Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI) , which competes with
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP in financial news and data,
had previously been equal partners in the venture. Financial
terms of New York-based DTCC’s purchase of full ownership
weren’t disclosed in a statement today.  Omgeo  provides post-trade processing services.  The deal “enables DTCC and Omgeo to facilitate a unified
strategy around key industry initiatives including the move to
trade date affirmation of institutional trades, settlement
matching in DTCC’s subsidiary, Depository Trust Co., and the
adoption of shorter settlement cycles in various markets,”
Omgeo President and Chief Executive Officer Marianne Brown said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
