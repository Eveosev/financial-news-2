The  National Association of Home
Builders  lowered its forecast for U.S. single-family home  starts 
this year and next as higher interest rates slow the pace of
growth in the housing market.  Single-family home starts are expected to be 629,000 this
year, lower than an April estimate of 672,000, the Washington-based group said in a report today. In 2014, the total is
expected to be 826,000, compared with the prior forecast of
858,000. Work began on about 537,000 houses in 2012.  “We got unexpected softness in the spring,” Chief
Economist  David Crowe  said during a conference call today. “We
should pass the 1 million mark by 2015.”  Mortgage rates  jumped more than 1 percentage point from
near-record lows in May, slowing sales of new and existing
homes, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank may reduce its purchases of Treasury bonds and
mortgage-backed securities. Tight credit and shortages of
skilled labor, materials and ready-to-build lots in desirable
locations also have limited production, Crowe said.  Each new single-family home creates the equivalent of three
full-time jobs for two years, according to the trade
association’s estimates, so a reduction in new construction
lessens housing’s contribution to economic growth.  New single-family home starts will climb to about 1.16
million by 2015, according to the homebuilder group. That’s
about 93 percent of “normal,” said Robert Dent, the NAHB’s
assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis. Housing
starts fell to a low annual pace of 353,000 in March 2009 after
peaking at 1.82 million in January 2006.  The U.S. should produce about 1.7 million new homes and
apartments per year to provide for  population growth  and replace
obsolete residences,  Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody’s
Analytics Inc., said during the conference call.  “Going forward, we’re going to be in an environment of
undersupplied markets,” Zandi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
