New York  Life Insurance Co., the
largest policyholder-owned U.S. life insurer, named David Bedard
chief financial officer of the unit created last year to include
institutional asset management, mutual funds and annuities.  Bedard, 49, was rehired from ING U.S. Inc. as CFO of the
investments group and will report to John Kim, president of the
unit, the company said today in a statement. He worked for New
York Life from 2007 to 2010 and was president of the annuities
business at ING U.S.  New York Life last year divided the company into two
business units, the insurance and investments groups. Chris Ashe, who had been interim finance chief during the search for a
permanent executive, will be deputy CFO, said William Werfelman,
a spokesman for the insurer.  “David brings nearly three decades of experience in the
global investment management and annuities business, and we are
delighted to welcome him back,” Kim said in the statement.  Bedard has also worked at Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc., Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Coopers &
Lybrand LLP, where he became a partner, according to the
statement. ING U.S., an insurance subsidiary of the largest
Dutch financial services company, announced in January that it
hired Bedard from Hartford.  “We appreciated Dave’s contributions during his tenure
with ING U.S., and we wish him well,” the insurer said in an e-mailed statement. “We are currently in the process of looking
for his replacement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
