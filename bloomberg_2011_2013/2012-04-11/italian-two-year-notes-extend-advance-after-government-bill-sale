Italian two-year notes extended an
advance after the nation sold 11 billion euros of 91- and 361-
day bills, meeting its target for the auction.  The two-year note yield dropped nine basis points to 3.47
percent at 10:15 a.m. London time. Italyâ€™s 10-year bonds also
rose, pushing the yield down 15 basis points to 5.53 percent.  The Rome-based Treasury auctioned the 361-day bills at an
average yield of 2.84 percent, up from 1.405 percent at the last
sale of similar-maturity debt on March 13. Investors bid for
1.52 times the amount offered, up from 1.38 times last month. It
sold the three-month bills at 1.249 percent, compared with 0.492
last month.  Italy will auction as much as 5 billion euros of bonds
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
