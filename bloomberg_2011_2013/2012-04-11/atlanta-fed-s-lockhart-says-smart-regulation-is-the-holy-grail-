President  Dennis Lockhart  said financial regulators need to work
toward smarter regulation that reduces the risks to financial
stability.  “There is a tension” between “principles and simple
rules” versus “detailed prescriptions in regulations,”
Lockhart said at an Atlanta Fed conference at Stone Mountain,
Georgia today. “The holy grail this is all about is smart, and
I would say even wise, regulation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
