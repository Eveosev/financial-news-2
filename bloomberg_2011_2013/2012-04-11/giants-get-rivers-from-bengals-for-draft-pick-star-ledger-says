The  New York Giants  will acquire
linebacker Keith Rivers, a first-round draft pick in 2008, from
the  Cincinnati Bengals  for a fifth-round selection in this
month’s National Football League draft, according to the  Star-
Ledger  of Newark, New Jersey.  The Giants are finishing details of the trade, the Star-
Ledger said, citing an unidentified person with knowledge of the
negotiations.  Rivers, 25, was the Bengals’ second-leading tackler behind
Dhani Jones during the 2009 and 2010 seasons, then missed the
2011 campaign following wrist surgery. He has yet to play a full
season in his four-year NFL career, missing nine games as a
rookie with a broken jaw.  Rivers was the ninth pick in the 2008  NFL draft  out of the
University of Southern California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
