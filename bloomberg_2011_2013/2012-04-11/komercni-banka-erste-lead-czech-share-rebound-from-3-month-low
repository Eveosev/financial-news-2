Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit
of Societe Generale SA, and Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led
Czech shares in a rebound from the lowest in almost three
months.  Komercni Banka climbed 2.3 percent to 3,645 koruna by 9:43
a.m. in Prague, a second day of gains. Erste added 1.1 percent
to 386 koruna. The  PX (PX)  equity gauge, where the two lenders have a
combined 36 percent weighting, rose 0.6 percent to 931.30,
rising from the lowest level since Jan. 19 at yesterday’s close.  The Czech benchmark slumped 4.9 percent in the previous six
sessions, its longest stretch of losses in 4 1/2 months, driving
its 14-day relative strength  index  to 24 yesterday. Readings
lower than 30 suggest to technical analysts a security or an
index may rise. The RSI increased to 28 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
