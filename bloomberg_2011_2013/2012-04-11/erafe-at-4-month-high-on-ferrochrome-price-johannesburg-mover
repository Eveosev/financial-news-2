Merafe Resources Ltd. (MRF)  jumped to the
highest in more than four months after saying benchmark
ferrochrome prices rose 17 percent for the second quarter of
2012.  Shares in the company advanced 5.6 percent, the most since
Sept. 14, to 95 cents at the close in Johannesburg, the highest
since Dec. 6. More than 5.5 million shares changed hands, 244
percent of the daily traded average for the past three months.  The European benchmark ferrochrome price was settled at
$1.35 per pound for the second quarter of 2012, an increase of
17 percent from the $1.15 per pound price in the first quarter,
Merafe said in a statement. The company and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  co-own
the Xstrata-Merafe Chrome Venture, the largest producer of
ferrochrome, used in stainless steel.  “It was much greater than expected,” Lindsay Roots, an
analyst at Cape Town-based money manager BoE Private Clients,
said by phone.  A closure of furnaces as part of an accord with state power
company Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., in which the utility buys back
electricity, will only partially offset the benefits of the
price increase, Roots said.  Merafe said on March 30 the chrome joint venture would
close another two furnaces until May 31 as part of its agreement
with Eskom. The total ferrochrome production loss is estimated
at 130,000 metric tons in addition to the 30,000 tons from two
other closures, according to the company.  Eskom, which supplies about 95 percent of  South Africa ’s
electricity, is grappling with a mounting maintenance backlog as
usage remains too high for it to shut enough capacity for
repairs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
