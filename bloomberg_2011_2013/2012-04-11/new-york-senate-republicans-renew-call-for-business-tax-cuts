New York (STONY1)  Senate Republicans will
revive a proposal to give a 20 percent tax cut to small
businesses to create jobs, Majority Leader Dean Skelos said.  Under the plan, the corporate  tax rate  for businesses with
less than $250,000 in annual revenue would be cut to 5.5 percent
from 6.85 percent, a $65 million reduction affecting almost
200,000 entities. It would also give a 10 percent tax credit to
about 800,000 similarly sized businesses that have at least one
employee and pay personal income taxes. The credit would save
businesses $120 million, Republicans say.  “We’re looking to set the tone for the business community
that we mean business,” Skelos, a Long Island Republican, said
today in a telephone interview. “This will give them the
opportunity to start planning and hiring early.”  The tax cut and credits would be phased in as part of the
fiscal 2014 budget, which begins next April, he said.  Another piece of the plan would give businesses a tax
credit of as much as $5,000 for each new job, as much as $8,000
if the position goes to someone collecting  unemployment
insurance , or as much as $10,000 if the business hires a
returning veteran.  New York, the third-most-populous U.S. state, is facing a
$950 million budget gap in 2014, according to Budget Director
Robert Megna. The Republicans’ plan would cost about $200
million.  “We will find the money,” Skelos said. “Our focus is on
 job creation  in the state. That has been our focus the last two
years, and these tax credits for local businesses will help them
grow.”  In December, lawmakers approved a bill backed by Governor
 Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat, that cut income-tax rates for the
middle class and raised them for joint filers earning $2 million
or more. Employers in the 12 counties surrounding  New York  City
saw a reduction in the portion of their payroll taxes used to
support the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority .  To contact the reporter on this story:
