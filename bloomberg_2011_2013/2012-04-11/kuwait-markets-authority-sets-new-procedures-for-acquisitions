Kuwait ’s  Capital Markets Authority 
set new procedures for companies planning to acquire more than
30 percent of a listed stock, including requiring an independent
opinion, according to a circular published in local newspapers.  The stock exchange and its regulator must be informed of
the offer after an initial agreement between two companies,
according to the circular. It must be approved by the
competition protection authority, the markets authority and
shareholders, it said.  The offer must also be announced on the Kuwait stock
exchange’s website and published in at least two local
newspapers, the circular said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
