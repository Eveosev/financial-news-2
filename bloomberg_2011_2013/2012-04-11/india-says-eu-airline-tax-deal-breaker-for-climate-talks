The European Union’s move to make
airlines pay for their carbon emissions is a “deal breaker”
for international climate negotiations,  India ’s environment
minister said today.  “For me, it is a deal breaker,” Jayanthi Natarajan told a
conference in  New Delhi . “I strongly believe that as far as
climate change discussions are concerned, this is
unacceptable.”  As of Jan. 1, all airlines using airports in the trade bloc
were obliged to enter the EU’s carbon trading program, according
to the European Commission’s environment arm.  Natarajan called the move a “disguised” unilateral trade
measure that was introduced in the name of climate change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
