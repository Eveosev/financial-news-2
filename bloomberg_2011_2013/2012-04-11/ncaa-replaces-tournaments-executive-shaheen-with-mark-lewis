Mark Lewis  will replace Greg
Shaheen as vice president for championships and alliances at the
National College Athletic Association, giving him executive
oversight of 89 tournaments.  Lewis was president of Jet Set Sports, a hospitality and
event company. Lewis helped Olympic entities in the areas of
accommodation, event tickets, catering, ground transportation
and other services.  “Mark has the right skill set, knowledge and experiences
for this job,” NCAA President  Mark Emmert  said yesterday on the
organization’s website.  Before he joined Jet Set Sports, Lewis was vice president
of sponsorship at NBC, where he handled Olympic and National
Football League negotiations. He also was president of Olympic
Properties of the United States LLC in  Salt Lake City .  “I will work tirelessly to enhance opportunities for
student-athletes as we move forward,” Lewis said.  Shaheen, 44, who held the role for about a decade, may take
another position with the NCAA, Emmert said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
