PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) , the nation’s
biggest listed carrier, signed a firm order for 11  Airbus SAS (EAD) 
A330-300 planes as economic growth spurs business and leisure
travel.  The planes will be used for services to countries including
 South Korea ,  Japan  and Australia, Elisa Lumbantoruan, finance
director, said by phone today. The deal is valued at $2.5
billion based on average list prices. Carriers usually get
discounts for large orders.  The accord, signed during a visit by U.K. Prime Minister
 David Cameron  to Indonesia, boosts Garuda’s backlog of orders
for Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc-powered A330s to 21, Airbus said in
a statement. PT Lion Mentari Airlines, Indonesia’s biggest low-
cost carrier, also signed a record contract for 230  Boeing Co. (BA) 
aircraft in February because of rising demand.  Garuda plans to fund the purchase using cash, proceeds from
last year’s initial public offering and loans, Lumbantoruan
said. The airline flies to 31 cities in Indonesia and 19
overseas, according to its  website . It has 14 A330s in service,
Airbus said.  The carrier fell 3.2 percent to 600 rupiah at the close of
trading. The Jakarta Composite index slid 0.5 percent.  Cameron attended the signing ceremony, along with
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono during a trade
visit. Toulouse, France-based Airbus makes wings at a factory in
Wales and has a design center near Bristol in England.  The deal “is great news for the UK aerospace industry,”
he said in a statement released by his office.  Garuda’s 2011 net income rose to 805.5 billion rupiah ($88
million) from 515.5 billion rupiah a year earlier, Chief
Executive Officer Emirsyah Satar said March 21. Passenger
numbers rose 36 percent to 17.1 million.  Indonesia  may spend at least 3 trillion rupiah on airports
in 2012, Herry Bakti Gumay, director general of aviation at the
transport ministry, said Dec. 7. Airlines in Indonesia carried
68.1 million passengers last year, compared with 58.3 million a
year earlier, according to the ministry’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
