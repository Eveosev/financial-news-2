Chinese banks’ borrowing  costs 
dropped to the lowest level in 10 months on speculation the
government will spur the economy with more easing measures.  The  finance ministry  sold at least 30 billion yuan ($4.8
billion) of seven-year bonds at an average yield of 3.39 percent,
according to a trader at a  finance company  that participates in
government debt auctions. That compared with the 3.41 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of nine fixed-income
analysts and traders. A government report may show on April 13
 China ’s  economy  grew 8.4 percent in the first quarter, the least
since June 2009, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “The market is expecting more easing measures will come
out as the economy slows,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at
Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai.  The Shanghai interbank offered  rate  that banks charge each
other for three-month loans has fallen 63 basis points, or 0.63
percentage point, this year to 4.84 percent, the lowest level
since June 2011, according to a daily fixing compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. It declined one basis point
today.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis
point to 3.20 percent as of 5:46 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The People’s Bank of China didn’t gauge demand for bill
sales today, a sign it won’t issue such securities tomorrow,
according to a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. The monetary authority has refrained from selling
three-month and one-year bills since Dec. 22 and Dec. 27,
respectively.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, rose eight basis points to 3.78 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The yield on the 3.65 percent government bond due October
2018 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.40
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
