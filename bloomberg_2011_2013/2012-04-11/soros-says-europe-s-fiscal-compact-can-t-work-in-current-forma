Billionaire investor  George Soros 
said  Europe ’s fiscal compact to promote budgetary discipline
can’t work in its current format, while the euro is “broken and
needs to be fixed.”  “The fiscal compact is going to push Europe into a
deflationary debt trap with potentially catastrophic
consequences,” Soros said today at a book party in Berlin.
“This can be prevented if only it’s recognized there’s
fundamentally something wrong with the rules of the euro.”  Soros is best known for making $1 billion in 1992 betting
the U.K. would be forced to devalue the pound. Soros Fund
Management LLC decided in July to return outside capital and
focus on running assets for Soros and his family, who made up
the bulk of its then $25.5 billion assets, to avoid having to
register with the Securities and Exchange Commission by last
month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
