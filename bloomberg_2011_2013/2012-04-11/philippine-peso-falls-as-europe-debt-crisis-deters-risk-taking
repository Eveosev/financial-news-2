The Philippine peso reversed
earlier losses on speculation crude  oil prices  near a two-month
low will limit the nation’s import bill. Ten-year bonds gained.  The Philippines buys almost all of the oil it uses from
abroad and the cost of crude on New York has dropped 8.6 percent
since reaching this year’s high of $110.55 a barrel on March 1.
The peso earlier fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks as
concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen curbed demand for
riskier assets.  “The exceptionally stronger peso can also be attributed to
the lower oil price,’ said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market
strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. in Manila. “There’s less demand
for foreign currency.”  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to close at 42.755 per
dollar in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 42.895 today, the weakest level since March 30. One-
month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 5.70 percent.  The currency may trade between 42.70 and 43 for the rest of
the week, Ravelas predicted.  Oil traded at $101.08 in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It reached $100.68 yesterday, the lowest
level since Feb. 15.  Government data tomorrow is expected to show exports
increased 1.7 percent from a year earlier in February following
a 3.1 percent gain in January, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on the  Philippines ’ 15 percent bonds due March
2022 slipped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.8
percent, according to noon fixing prices from the Philippine
Dealing & Exchange Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
