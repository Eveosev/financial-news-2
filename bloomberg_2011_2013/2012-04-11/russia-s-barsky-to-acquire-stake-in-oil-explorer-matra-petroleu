Maxim Barsky, former deputy chief
executive officer of Russian oil producer TNK-BP, is set to buy
29.8 percent of  Matra Petroleum Plc (MTA)  for 4.6 million pounds ($7.3
million).  Barsky agreed to subscribe for a placing of 575 million new
shares at 0.8 pence apiece, subject to shareholder approval,
Chertsey, England-based Matra said today in an e-mailed
statement. Barsky confirmed the agreement.  The proceeds will help fund operations at Solokovskoye in
 Russia ’s Orenburg region, while bringing “considerable new
project acquisition opportunities,” Matra said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
