The  International Monetary Fund 
will make a compulsory review of Argentina’s economy because of
the country’s refusal to allow the lender to examine its
finances since 2006, newspaper  La Nacion  reported.  The Washington-based fund will report on the situation in
Argentina and other member countries that haven’t submitted
required annual reviews of economic policies and data, La Nacion
said, citing IMF officials it didn’t identify.  The IMF will use both official statistics and private
estimates to prepare the report, the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
