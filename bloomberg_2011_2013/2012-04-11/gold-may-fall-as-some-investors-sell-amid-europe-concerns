Gold may drop for the first time in
four sessions as U.S. equities halted the longest slump of the
year, eroding demand for the precious metal as a haven.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of shares advanced as much
as 1.1 percent, ending a five-session slump, as  Alcoa Inc. (AA) 
opened the earnings season with an unexpected profit. Gold
prices jumped 2.9 percent in the previous three sessions.  “People are leaning towards equities today,” Lance Roberts, the chief executive officer of Streettalk Advisors LLC
in Houston, said in a telephone interview. “Investors are
moving money out of gold to invest in stocks.”  Gold futures for June delivery declined 0.1 percent to
$1,659.70 an ounce at 10:25 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Before today, prices gained 6 percent in 2012 after advancing
for 11 consecutive years.  Holdings in bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  slipped
1.1 metric tons to 2,396.4 tons yesterday. They rose to a record
2,410.2 tons on March 13, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 0.1 percent to $31.635
an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
