Liechtenstein may draw several
hundred managers of  hedge funds  and venture capital firms from
 Switzerland  after the principality transposed a European Union
directive on investor protection into law,  Handelsblatt  said,
citing a confidential study by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Fund managers will need the new license to operate in the
EU from 2013, the German newspaper reported. While Switzerland
is working on a revision of its legislation, it can only be
applied from 2015 because the country isnâ€™t a member of the
European Economic Area, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
