Argentina ’s government plans to
take over management of  YPF SA (YPFD)  and give the country’s provinces
seats on the board of directors, newspaper El Cronista said,
citing Jorge Sapag, governor of Neuquen province.  Argentina plans to make YPF a so-called “mixed company,”
with 25 directors, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper cited Sapag
as saying. The government will control YPF while encouraging
private investments, the newspaper said. The provinces will
especially be involved in decisions regarding oil and gas
production, Cronista reported.  The government still has to decide whether it will take
control of 33 percent or 51 percent of YPF, El Cronista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
