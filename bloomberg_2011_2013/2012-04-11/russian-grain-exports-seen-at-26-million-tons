Russia ’s  grain exports  are expected
to be a record 26 million metric tons this season, 1 million
tons lower than an estimate made last month, said SovEcon, a
Moscow-based agricultural researcher.  Russia’s grain exports for the year ending June 30 will
still beat the 2008-09 record of 23 million tons, according to
Andrei Sizov Jr., managing director at SovEcon.  The country may harvest about 90 million tons in 2012-13,
down from 94.2 million tons this season, Sizov said today by
phone in Moscow. The crop is expected to be smaller because cold
weather in Russia’s main growing regions in the south has
affected the condition of winter grains, he said.  Winter crops are expected to be 40 million tons, down from
the multi-year average of 43.4 million tons, Sizov said.  Russia’s grain shipments are seen between 20 million and 26
million tons in 2012-13, Sizov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
