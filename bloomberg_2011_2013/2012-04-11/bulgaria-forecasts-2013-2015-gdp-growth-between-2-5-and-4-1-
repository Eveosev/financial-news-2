Bulgaria ’s government forecasts
economic expansion of 2.5 percent to 4 percent between 2013 and
2015, according to a three-year fiscal plan to be submitted to
the European Commission.  The Cabinet’s estimate for this year’s economic growth is
1.4 percent, in line with its earlier budget assumptions, the
government said in an e-mailed statement today. Bulgaria’s
economy grew 1.7 percent last year and 0.4 percent in 2010.  “This year’s economic growth will be based on gradual
recovery of domestic consumption,” the government said.
“Exports are expected to increase in the period 2012-2015 as
well as domestic demand.”  Bulgaria, the EU’s poorest country in terms of economic
output per capita, weathered the global crisis without borrowing
from international lenders. The government seeks to cut the
budget gap to 1.35 percent of gross domestic product this year
from 2.1 percent in 2011 to help contain fallout from the euro
debt crisis.  Balanced Budget  The three-year fiscal plan envisages keeping  budget
deficits  below 3 percent of GDP and achieving a balanced budget
by 2015, the government said.  The government’s 1.4 percent growth forecast for this year
matches the EU estimate on Feb. 23. The Bulgarian central bank’s
forecast is 0.7 percent, based on “expectations for a recession
in the European Union,” central bank Governor Ivan Iskrov said
on April 3.  The sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area, which buys 60
percent of Bulgaria’s exports, is curbing economic growth in the
Balkan country as it emerges from its first recession in more
than a decade through exports of its metals, machinery, textiles
and furniture.  The country’s priorities also include overhauling pension
and health-care systems, keeping taxes unchanged and linking
wage growth to productivity, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
