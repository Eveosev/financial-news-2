MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , Africa’s largest
mobile-phone operator, plans to spend as much as 15 percent of
revenue over the next five years to upgrade and expand its
infrastructure, Chief Financial Officer Nazir Patel said in a
corporate report published by the  Financial Mail .  The bulk of the money would be spent in the major markets
of Nigeria, Iran and South Africa, the Johannesburg-based weekly
magazine reported. MTN will use Chinese vendors, including  ZTE
Corp. (000063)  and Huawei Technologies Co., to buy its equipment,
 Financial Mail  said.  Price wars in markets that include Nigeria, MTN’s biggest,
may have come to an end, the magazine cited Chief Executive
Officer Sifiso Dabengwa as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
