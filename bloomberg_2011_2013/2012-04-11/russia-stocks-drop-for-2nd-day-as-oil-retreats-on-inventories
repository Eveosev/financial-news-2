Russian  stocks  dropped for a second
day as oil, the country’s main revenue earner, traded near its
lowest price in almost two months after an industry report
showed stockpiles rose for a third week in the U.S.  The Micex Index of 30 shares slipped as much as 0.8 percent
and traded 0.1 percent lower at 1,496.7 by 11:46 a.m. in Moscow.
Oil producer  OAO Tatneft (TATN)  lost 1 percent. OAO Novolipetsk Steel,
Russian billionaire Vladimir Lisin’s steelmaker, fell 0.7
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index decreased 0.5 percent
to 1,599.82.  Oil for May delivery was at $101.20 a barrel, up 18 cents,
in  New York  after falling 1.4 percent yesterday. U.S.
inventories increased by 6.6 million barrels last week,
according to the  American Petroleum Institute . An Energy
Department report today may show they rose by 2 million to the
highest level for this time of year since 1990, according to a
Bloomberg survey. The U.S. cut its price forecast for domestic
and imported grades used by its refiners because of rising
output in  Canada  and  North Dakota .  “The price of oil is slowly declining and even though
there is almost no risk of a major collapse, the journey to a
new trading range or support platform will continue to weigh on
sentiment toward Russia,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at
Troika Dialog in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, gained 0.1
percent to $117.33, paring yesterday’s 1.9 percent loss.  The Market Vectors  Russia  ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, lost 2.3 percent yesterday to $29.24. The
 RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in the
index futures, gained 0.9 percent to 32.66 points.  Russian stocks rallied 8.2 percent in the first three
months of the year, the biggest quarterly gain in more than a
year, on signs the global economy recovery is spurring demand
for commodities. The gauge trades at 5.6 times analysts’
earnings estimates for member companies, below the 11.8 ratio
for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
