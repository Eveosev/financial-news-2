Germany ’s bank employee labor union
has canceled agreements related to four  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  units
as it seeks better terms for staff, said Oliver Popp, a
spokesman for the DBV union.  While strikes can’t be ruled out, the labor union expects
talks with the bank to succeed, Popp said, confirming comments
made by lead DBV negotiator Stephan Szukalski in an interview
published today by Die Welt newspaper.  The labor union wants the 4,000 to 5,000 workers it
estimates to be affected to benefit from the same conditions as
colleagues at the Frankfurt-based lender’s  Deutsche Postbank AG (DPB) 
unit, who work fewer hours per week and get more holiday,
according to DBV.  Deutsche Bank expects a “constructive process” when the
company starts talks with labor unions next month, said
Friederike Borgmann, a spokeswoman for the firm. About 1,500
employees are subject to the labor agreements, according to the
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
