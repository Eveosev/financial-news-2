  Russia , the world’s biggest  oil 
producer, may reduce its  export duty  on most crude shipments by
as much as 2.7 percent from May 1 on lower Urals prices.  The standard duty may fall to $448.20 to $451.50 a metric
ton, or $61.15 to $61.60 a barrel, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on Finance Ministry data. That compares with
$460.70 a ton in April.  The discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea oil may fall in May to within a range of $232.10 to $234.60
a ton, compared with $241.50 this month.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
 Urals (RUOIEX%) , Russia’s benchmark export blend, may average $120.68 to
$121.43 a barrel during this period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today. In the previous
monitoring period, the crude price averaged $123.53, according
to the ministry.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign off on the levies
before they take effect. The government lowered the crude  tax
rate  applying a coefficient of 60 percent, down from 65 percent,
and unified the duty on most refined products at 66 percent of
that levy since October.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products may grow
to within a range from $295.80 to $298 a ton next month, from
$304 in April.  A gasoline tax that Putin imposed from May 2011 to counter
domestic shortages may be set in a range from $403.40 to $406.40
a ton, from $414.60 this month. That is 90 percent of the crude
oil duty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
