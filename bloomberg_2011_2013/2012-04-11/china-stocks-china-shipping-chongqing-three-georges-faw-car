Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 3.06 points, or 0.1 percent, to
2,308.93, the highest close since March 27. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
gained less than 0.1 percent to 2,520.04.  Automakers:  FAW Car Co. (000800)  (000800 CH), which makes passenger
cars in China with Volkswagen AG, gained 2.9 percent to 10.96
yuan. Jiangling Motors Corp. (000550 CH), the Chinese commercial
vehicle partner of Ford Motor Co., climbed 1.9 percent to 22.07
yuan. BYD Co. (002594 CH), the automaker part-owned by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., jumped 6.5 percent to 30.60
yuan.  China’s passenger-car sales grew 4.5 percent in March,
beating analyst estimates, the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers said today in a statement after the market closed.
Sales were forecast to increase 3.9 percent, according to the
average estimate of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Chongqing-based companies:  Chongqing Three Gorges Water
Conservancy and Electric Power Co.  (600116 CH) lost 1.6 percent
to 14.39 yuan.  Chongqing Brewery Co. (600132)  (600132 CH) slid 0.9
percent to 28.09 yuan.  Bo Xilai, the former top official in the southwestern
municipality, was suspended from his Communist Party posts, the
Xinhua News Agency reported late yesterday. Gu Kailai, Bo’s
wife, and a domestic helper are “highly suspected” of killing
British businessman Neil Heywood, who died in Chongqing in
November, Xinhua said.  China Shipping Development Co. (600026)  (600026 CH), a unit of
China’s second-biggest sea-cargo group, fell 1.2 percent to 6.01
yuan. China Shipping probably slumped to a first-quarter loss
because “insufficient” demand and excess global capacity
caused a decline in rates, the company said in a statement
yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
