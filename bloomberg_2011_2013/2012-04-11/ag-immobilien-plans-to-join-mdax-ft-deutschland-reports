TAG Immobilien AG (TEG)  will probably
join  Germany ’s MDAX index of mid-sized companies after its
purchase of DKB Immobilien AG, the Financial Times Deutschland
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Rolf Elgeti.  The real-estate company, which forecast 27 million euros
($35 million) of funds from operations this year, expects the
160 million-euro acquisition to help it become “sustainably
profitable,” the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
