Sugar output in  Mexico , the world’s
sixth-largest producer, has fallen 11 percent so far this
season, according to industry committee Conadesuca.  Production in the 2011-12 season, which started in October,
totaled 3.88 million metric tons through April 7, Conadesuca
said yesterday in a report on its website. That compares with
4.35 million tons a year earlier.  Mexico will produce 5.04 million tons of sugar this season,
down from a previous forecast of 5.1 million tons, Conadesuca
estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
