Krka Group d.d.  gained as
Slovenia’s biggest pharmaceutical company made its debut on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)  today.  The shares traded at 204 zloty by 11:20 a.m. in Warsaw,
compared with a reference price set by the bourse at 202.1
zloty. The company’s stock in Ljubljana rose 1.1 percent to
48.95 euro.  “Although trading liquidity may take time to build up, we
believe a listing on the Warsaw Stock Exchange will broaden our
shareholder base,” Krka said in a  statement  yesterday.  The drugmaker, whose majority revenue stream is linked to
central and eastern  Europe , joined Slovenia’s  Nova Kreditna
Banka Maribor d.d. , which listed in Warsaw last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
