Iraq plans to buy 30,000 metric
tons of Basmati rice from  India  and  Pakistan , according to
Fawziyeh Hameed, a spokeswoman for the Trade Ministry.  The deadline for suppliers to submit bids is April 22, she
said by telephone from  Baghdad  today. Bids should be valid until
April 26, she said.  Iraq bought 53,000 tons of Basmati from India in a previous
tender that expired April 10, Hassan Ibrahim, director general
of the country’s grain board, said in a phone interview from
Baghdad today.  Iraq consumes 1.25 million tons of rice a year, most of it
imported, Ibrahim said on Dec. 6. The country’s annual harvest
has started, with production forecast to climb to 250,000 tons
from last year’s 150,000 tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
