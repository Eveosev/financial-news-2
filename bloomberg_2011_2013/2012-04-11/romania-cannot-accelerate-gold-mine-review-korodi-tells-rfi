Romania cannot speed up the permit-
application process for  Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU) ’s gold-mine, as
requested by the country’s president, because the size of the
project requires caution, Environment Minister Attila Korodi
told radio station  Radio France International .  Korodi, who took over as minister yesterday, said he will
“analyze in great detail in the next few weeks” the Rosia
Montana project’s environment assessment procedure, according to
RFI. Rosia Montana Gold Corp., majority-owned by Gabriel
Resources, needs an environmental permit to start work at the
mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
