Sweden will probably shelve a plan
to raise the tax on some income from carried interest on owners
in private-equity funds, a government spokesman said.  “The purpose of the proposal was to get more tax income
from the private-equity industry,” Daniel Valiollahi, a
spokesman at the  Finance Ministry , said by phone. “The
opposition has pretty clearly announced they won’t let it go
through so it will likely be put on hold.”  The government proposed last month to tax income as high as
5 million kronor ($750,000) as regular income while earnings
above that would be taxed as  capital gains  at the rate of 30
percent.  The changes would affect 100 to 200 individuals and raise
income tax intake by about 100 million kronor a year, the
Finance Ministry said in the proposal. The Swedish private-
equity industry is the second-biggest in  Europe  as a share of
gross domestic product, the ministry said, with 180,000 people
employed in 2010.  The proposal was too generous to private equity investors,
Magdalena Andersson, spokeswoman on economic matters for the
 Social Democrats , the largest opposition party, told Swedish
news agency TT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
