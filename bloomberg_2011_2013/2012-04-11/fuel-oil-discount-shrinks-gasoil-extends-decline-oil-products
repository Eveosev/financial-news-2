Fuel oil ’s discount to crude
narrowed in  Asia , signaling reduced losses for refiners turning
oil into residual products. Gasoil swaps entered the longest
losing streak in 10 months.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil rose 35 cents to $5.34 a barrel below Asian-marker
Dubai crude at 11:15 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the smallest  discount 
since March 5.  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for May fell $9.50, or 1.3
percent, to $721 a ton, PVM said. Prices were down for a fifth
day, the longest stretch since November. The premium of 180-
centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade, or the  viscosity
spread , was unchanged for a second day at $11.25. This means
bunker, or marine fuel, moved in tandem with higher-quality fuel
oil.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil (PVMPSO1M) , or diesel, swaps for May dropped $1.40, or 1.1
percent, to $132.05 a barrel, according to PVM. Prices are down
for a fifth day, the longest losing streak since August.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude climbed 41 cents to $15.79
a barrel, PVM said. This  crack spread , a measure of refining
profit, widened for the first time in six days. Jet fuel’s
premium to gasoil gained 5 cents to 25 cents. This  regrade  has
lost more than half its value in the past week, showing it is
less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Naphtha (PVMPNA1M)  swaps for May declined $14.75, or 1.4 percent, to
$1,022.75 a metric ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical
feedstock decreased for a fourth day, the longest run since
January.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
$16.78 to $117.54 a ton, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The
difference is also known as the crack spread. Gasoline’s premium
to naphtha yesterday dropped $1.15 to $17.90 a barrel, the
lowest since March 26. A narrowing  reforming margin  indicates it
is less profitable to produce motor fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
