Winter-grain plantings in  Russia ’s
top-growing areas in the south are improving because of rain and
warm weather, according to the national forecaster.  Most of the winter crops in the Southern Federal District
are in “good condition,” said Anna Strashnaya, head of the
agricultural forecasts department at the Federal
Hydrometeorological Center in Moscow. About 5 to 30 percent of
the plants are weak and thin, down from as much as 50 percent in
the last 10 days of March, she said by phone today.  Crops in some parts of North Osetia-Alania Republic,
Stavropol and Rostov are in bad condition and may require re-
planting, she said, adding the winter grain death rate in all of
the southern regions will be lower than last year.  The weather will be warmer than average and rain will
support good soil moisture in Russia’s south through to April
20, Strashnaya said. In the eastern part of the North-Caucasus
federal district dry, hot weather may decrease the soil moisture
level during that period, she said.  Last year, Russia’s Southern and North-Caucasus federal
districts harvested about 35 percent of the country’s grain
crop, or about 33 million metric tons, according to state
statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
