The U.S. government’s  budget
deficit  widened 5.3 percent in March, as outlays increased on
recurring benefit payments and a subsidy re-estimate for the
Troubled Asset Relief Program.  The shortfall expanded to $198.2 billion from $188.2
billion a year earlier, the Treasury Department said today.
Economists projected a $196 billion gap, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The government budget deficit is still bursting at the
seams with little chance that either side of the aisle is
willing to shake hands and get a deal done,”  Chris Rupkey ,
chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
in  New York , said before the report.‘ ‘The economy is growing
again but we can’t grow our way out of these trillion dollar
deficits.”  Republicans rejected President  Barack Obama ’s $3.8
trillion election-year budget plan, saying it didn’t go far
enough to reduce the deficit or boost economic growth. Obama
said the House Republican budget, written by Wisconsin
Representative Paul Ryan, represented a “doubling down” on
“trickle-down” economic policies that have depressed middle-
class incomes while the wealthy have gained.  The House on March 29 approved Ryan’s $3.5 trillion fiscal
2013 budget by a vote of 228-191, with no Democrats voting for
it. Ryan says the plan would overhaul Medicare and cut  food
stamps ,  Pell grants  and other programs for the poor while
boosting defense spending and reducing taxes on high earners, in
a bid to erase deficits exceeding $1 trillion.  Timing-Related  The deficit in March was “impacted by several timing-
related transactions,” the Treasury said. These include “$30
billion of monthly recurring benefit payments” and “a net
subsidy re-estimate for TARP totaling $20 billion,” Treasury
said in a statement.  Before today’s report, estimates of the March budget gap
ranged from $210 billion to $180 billion, in a survey of 24
economists.  In the first six months of the fiscal year that began in
October, the budget deficit was $779 billion compared with
$829.4 billion in the same period last year.  Spending rose by 8.9 percent in March from a year earlier
to $369.4 billion, while revenue gained 13.5 percent from a year
earlier to $171.2 billion.  Individual income tax receipts in the first six months of
this fiscal year rose 1.8 percent to $484.1 billion. Corporate
income tax receipts climbed 53.5 percent to $84.5 billion in the
same time period.  The non-partisan  Congressional Budget Office  estimated last
week the March budget deficit would reach $196 billion.  The CBO said in a report dated April 6 that outlays were
$29 billion higher in March than they were in the same month
last year, mostly because about $31 billion in payments that
would ordinarily be made in April were instead made last month.  “In addition, revisions to the estimated cost of several
credit programs -- mostly the Troubled Asset Relief Program --
added $7 billion to spending this March compared with outlays
last March,” the CBO said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
