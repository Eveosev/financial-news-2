Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest
offshore energy producer, and  Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil
company, agreed to expand exploration in the  South China Sea .  Cnooc’s parent, China National Offshore Oil Corp., signed a
production-sharing contract with Eni for the deepwater Block
30/27, the Beijing-based company said today in a statement. Eni
will conduct a seismic survey of the area and drill a well.  “All expenditures incurred during the exploration period
will be borne by Eni,” Cnooc said. The Chinese company “has
the right to participate in up to 51 percent working interest in
any commercial discoveries in the block.”  The block is 400 kilometers (250 miles) off Hong Kong and
covers 5,130 square kilometers in an “attractive” deepwater
area with “high” exploration potential, Eni said in a
 statement  on its website.  The Rome-based company, active in China since 1984, is
working at three other blocks in the South China Sea. It’s
examining opportunities for shale-gas exploration in the country
with China National Petroleum Corp. and  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028)   To contact the reporter on this story:
