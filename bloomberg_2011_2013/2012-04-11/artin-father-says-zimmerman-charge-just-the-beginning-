A second-degree murder charge filed
against George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Florida
teenager Trayvon Martin is “just the beginning,” the victim’s
father, Tracy Martin, said.  “We’ve got a long way to go and we have faith,” Martin
said today at a Washington news conference after a Florida state
prosecutor announced the charge against Zimmerman.  The U.S.  Justice Department  should continue its
investigation of possible civil-rights violations, said  Benjamin
Crump , an attorney for the Martin family.  “We fully expect that both investigations are going to go
forward,” Crump said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
