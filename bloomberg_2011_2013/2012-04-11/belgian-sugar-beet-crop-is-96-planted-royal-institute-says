Belgium ’s sugar-beet crop was about
96 percent planted as of yesterday, said the Royal Belgian
Institute for Beet Improvement, or KBIVB.  Farmers sowed the root on about 60,310 hectares (149,029
acres), up from 50,195 hectares a week earlier, the institute
said in a  report  on its website today.  Frost damage on the night of April 1 was limited, while
about 10 millimeters (0.4 inch) of rain over the Easter weekend
benefited emerging beets, KBIVB said. Rainfall has been 50
percent or less of normal since February, according to the
institute.  “There is a significant water shortage since the start of
February,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
