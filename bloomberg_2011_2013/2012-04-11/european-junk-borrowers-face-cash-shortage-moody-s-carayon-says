Junk-rated companies in  Europe , the
 Middle East  and Africa with about $180 billion of debt maturing
in the next two years face a cash shortage as banks become
increasingly reluctant to lend, according to Jean-Michel Carayon, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service.  Carayon spoke in an April 4 interview.  On bank lending:  “We see less willingness from banks to lend. They want to
reduce their balance sheet and optimize use of capital so we
anticipate there might be some risk of diminishing liquidity for
the next quarters.”  “The refinancing of corporates is probably going to be
increasingly complicated in Europe. Issuers with the highest
leverage and relatively weak business models might struggle to
refinance their debt maturities.”  On potential downgrades:  “We anticipate more downgrades than upgrades.” Some B-
rated companies “might struggle to refinance because of their
high indebtedness and the reduced appetite of banks to lend.
Therefore we would consider lowering some ratings because of the
increased probability of default.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
