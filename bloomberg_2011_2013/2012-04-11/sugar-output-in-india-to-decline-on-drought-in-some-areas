Sugar output in  India , the second-
biggest producer, will drop for the first time in four years
next season as dry weather in some regions spurs farmers to
plant other crops, broker and researcher Kingsman SA said.  The harvest may total 24.5 million metric tons in the
season beginning Oct. 1 from as much as 25.8 million tons this
year, Charlotte Kingsman, a New Delhi-based sugar analyst, said
in an e-mail. The nation may continue exports for a third year
as supplies from the new crop and inventories will exceed
domestic demand by about 6.5 million tons, she said.  Futures have lost 36 percent since reaching a three-decade
high in February last year as the global market swung to a
surplus, ending three years of shortages. Smaller crops in India
and  Thailand  may cut the surplus in 2012-2013, Kingsman said.  “We don’t expect the  surplus  in 2012-2013 to be as large
as for 2011-2012, but it will definitely be big enough to keep
world prices under pressure,” she said. “Both the Thai and the
Indian crop are expected to be large in 2012-2013. This means
that we continue to foresee a surplus.”  The global surplus may fall to 8 million tons in the
2012-2013 season starting in April, down from 11.1 million tons
in 2011-2012, according to Sucres et Denrees SA.  Raw sugar for July delivery dropped 1.9 percent to end at
23.16 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  yesterday,
the lowest close since Jan. 5. White sugar for August delivery
declined 1.9 percent to $621 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  ‘Increase Profitability’  “Sugar prices in India will rise from the current levels
because of an expected drop in production,” said Anup Ranadive,
an analyst at Derivium Tradition Securities (India) Pvt. “This
will help sugar mills increase profitability.”  Prices have fallen 4.2 percent this year on the National
Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. The April-delivery
contract traded little changed at 2,760 rupees ($54) per 100
kilograms at 10:55 a.m. Mumbai time.  Production in Brazil’s Center South region will be 33
million tons, up from 31.3 million in 2011-2012, on cane output
of 518 million tons, compared with 494.2 million tons a year
earlier, according to Sucden Financial Ltd.  “There are still doubts as to what the Brazilian crop will
be, but by the middle of the third quarter of this year we
anticipate a significant surplus available on the market,
putting pressure on prices,” Kingsman said. Indian sugar “has
to compete with Thai sugar and soon with Brazilian sugar.”  Thai Crop  Thai output may total 10.3 million tons in 2012-2013,
compared with 10.67 million tons a year earlier, Kingsman said.
The Lausanne, Switzerland-based Kingsman SA was founded by
 Jonathan Kingsman , who’s traded the commodity for more than
three decades.  India, which is  exporting sugar  for a second straight year,
may have a surplus of at least 1 million tons more to ship this
season, Kingsman said.  “Whether the government allows some more exports on top of
the 3 million tons already announced will depend on domestic
prices and cane arrears,” Kingsman said. “In theory, India has
the capacity to export more than 500,000 per month, so the sugar
could move out without too many difficulties.”  Production (US43CSIN)  in India climbed 13 percent to 23.2 million tons
in the six months ended March 31, according to the Indian Sugar
Mills Association.  Indian mills are seeking approval for additional exports as
they need money to pay farmers for cane. Sugar-makers owed
growers 84 billion rupees ($1.6 billion) in arrears as of Feb.
29, Food Minister K.V. Thomas told parliament on March 26.  “Farmers seem confident that they will receive the amount
due,” Kingsman said. “We do expect a drop in acreage in
Maharashtra. The drought in certain areas has pushed some
farmers to switch to less water-consuming crops like soybean,
even though the returns are not that good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
