Brazilian coffee producers will be
granted a 2 billion-real ($1.09 billion) loan from Banco do
Brasil SA, said Silas Brasileiro, president of the National
Coffee Council.  The loan should be available starting in June before the
harvest begins, Brasileiro said today in a telephone interview
from Brasilia. Last year, producers began to receive financing
after the harvest in September, he said.  Brasileiro predicted that coffee prices will end this year
at a level close to 2011. Banco do Brasil wasn’t immediately
available to comment.  The price of arabica beans rose to a 14-year high of $3.089
a pound in  New York  on May 3 as heavy rainfall cut output in
 Colombia . Coffee slipped 5.7 percent in New York last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We never considered retaining coffee,” Brasileiro said.
“We want to have a coordinated flow of production.”  Arabica coffee futures for May delivery gained 1.4 percent
to $1.8065 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York today.  Brazil ’s government has stated that there are plans to
double financing available for coffee storage this year for the
world’s largest coffee producer.  Investment for storage would rise to 1.5 billion reais,
Edilson Martins de Alcantara, director of the coffee department
at the country’s Ministry of Agriculture, said in an interview
in  London  on March 6.  “The aim is to enable the producer to store coffee and to
sell it at the best opportunity,” he said at a meeting of the
 International Coffee Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
