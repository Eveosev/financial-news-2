(Corrects title of report in second paragraph.)  Rising investor demand for so-
called safe assets could potentially hurt global financial
stability, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a report.  Growing demand will make safe assets less available,
“increasing the price for safety in global markets,” the IMF
said in a chapter of its Global Financial Stability Report
released today. “The tightening market for safe assets can have
considerable implications for global financial stability,
including an uneven or disruptive pricing process for safety.”  The idea of “absolute safety” implied by credit-rating
firms’ highest ratings “can lead to an erroneously high level
of perceived safety,” the Washington-based IMF said. As
investors try to find “scarce safe assets, they may be
compelled to move down the safety scale, prompting the average
investor to settle for assets that embed higher risks.”  In a separate chapter about the financial impact of people
living longer, the IMF said “few governments or pension
providers adequately recognize longevity risk.”  If the issue isn’t addressed soon, it “could have large
negative effects on already weakened private- and public-sector
balance sheets, making them more vulnerable to other shocks and
potentially affecting financial stability,” according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
