Algeria plans to change the way it
levies tax on energy projects, to attract foreign investment, El
Khabar reported, citing Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi.  Yousfi said proposed amendments to the country’s
hydrocarbon law will ease tax pressure on companies operating in
difficult areas; tax will be calculated on the basis of
projects’ profitability rather than on revenue, the newspaper
reported on its website.  The existing system was set up when  oil prices  were $20 to
$30 a barrel and foreign companies have pushed for a change,
Khabar cited the minister as saying.  Yousfi also said he hoped a decision on a proposed  gas
pipeline  to  Italy  will be made by the end of the year, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story: Salah Slimani in Algiers
