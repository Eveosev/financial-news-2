Oil rose for a second day in  New
York  after fuel stockpiles declined more than expected in the
U.S., the world’s biggest gasoline consumer.  Futures climbed as much as 0.4 percent after closing
yesterday at the highest price in almost a week. U.S. gasoline
inventories fell  4.3 million barrels , the  Department of Energy 
said. Supplies were projected to drop 1.38 million barrels,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. The decrease countered
figures that showed imports and  demand  for the motor fuel fell.
Gasoline prices at the pump have slid five straight days, the
longest streak since December.  “This report was mostly bullish, due to products,”
 Michael Wittner , the head of oil market research at Societe
Generale SA in New York, said in a report. “The most consistent
driver for the product draws was lower supply rather than
healthy demand.”  Crude for May delivery rose as much as 44 cents to $103.14
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $103.06 at 2:23 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday climbed $1.68, or 1.7 percent, to $102.70,
the highest close since April 5. Prices are up 4.3 percent this
year.  Brent oil for May settlement rose 26 cents, or 0.2 percent,
to $120.44 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark contract’s  premium  to  New York- 
traded West Texas Intermediate was at $17.41, from $17.48
yesterday.  Gasoline Demand  Refinery utilization  fell 1.9 percentage points to 83.8
percent of capacity last week, according to the Energy
Department. That’s the biggest drop since the period ended Feb.
24. Motor-gasoline products supplied, a proxy for demand, shrank
102,000 barrels a day and  imports  slid 180,000 barrels a day.  Prices at the pump may have peaked for the year. Regular
gasoline, averaged nationwide, declined for a fifth day to
 $3.915 a gallon  on April 10 after surging 20 percent and
reaching $3.936 on April 4, according to data from AAA, the
biggest U.S. motoring club. Americans have purchased 5.3 percent
less gasoline so far this year than in 2011, data from credit-
card receipts analyzed by  MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s SpendingPulse showed
on April 10.  U.S. distillate inventories, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, declined  4 million barrels , the Energy
Department report showed. They were forecast to slip 250,000
barrels, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in the
Bloomberg survey. Crude stockpiles rose 2.8 million barrels
compared with a projected increase of 2 million.  Europe, Iran  Oil prices  have gained this year on concern that tension
with  Iran  will disrupt global supplies.  France  remains “open”
to the possibility of a release of crude stockpiles by
International Energy Agency member countries to keep prices in
check, Industry Minister Eric Besson said yesterday.  Crude’s advance in New York created a so-called bullish
engulfing pattern on the candlestick chart, signaling increased
buying, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures also
settled above the 100-day moving average, which represents
technical support today at $101.63 a barrel.  Natural gas futures in New York closed below $2 per million
British thermal units yesterday for the first time in a decade
on a growing supply glut caused by mild weather and record
production. Prices for May delivery slid 2.3 percent to $1.984
per million British thermal units on the Nymex yesterday, the
lowest settlement price since Jan. 28, 2002. They were unchanged
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
