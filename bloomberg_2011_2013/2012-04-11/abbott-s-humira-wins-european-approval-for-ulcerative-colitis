Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  said the
European Commission approved its Humira injection for
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults who
haven’t responded well to conventional treatment.  The decision makes Humira the first self-injectable
biologic therapy for these patients,  Abbott Park , Illinois-based
Abbott said today in a statement. It’s the seventh approved use
for the drug since it was first cleared in the European Union in
2003, the company said.  Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease
that causes ulcers in the colon and may affect as many as 1.2
million people in the EU, according to Abbott.  To contact the reporter on this story:
