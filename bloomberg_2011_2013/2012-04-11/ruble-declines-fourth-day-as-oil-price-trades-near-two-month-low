The ruble weakened against the
dollar and the euro for a fourth day as oil, the country’s chief
export, traded near its weakest level in two months.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 29.7761 per
dollar by 11:01 a.m. in Moscow, after losing 0.3 percent
yesterday. Russia’s 114 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) of local
OFZ bonds due 2021 traded little changed with the yield steady
at 8.01 percent. The government plans to sell 35.8 billion
rubles of the securities at an auction today.  Crude futures traded at $101.20 a barrel, up 18 cents, in
electronic trading in  New York  after dropping 1.4 percent
yesterday to its lowest level since Feb. 14 as an industry
report showed U.S. crude inventories rose for a third week,
adding 6.6 million barrels.  The ruble was 0.5 percent weaker at 39.09 per euro, its
weakest level this month, and declined 0.3 percent to 33.9712
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Investors
increased bets on the currency depreciating, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 30.1639 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 30.1280 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
