Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi 
said that authorities are watching  currency markets  closely as
the government seeks to sustain an economic recovery.  “We’re monitoring the currency market with great interest,
and I won’t be swayed by daily movements,” Azumi said in a
group interview in  Tokyo . “Our reaction will be determined by
examining trends in currencies.”  Government interventions last year pulled the yen back from
a post-World War II high of 75.35 against the dollar, aiding
exporters who face reduced sales and profits when the currency
gains. Monetary loosening by the Bank of Japan has also helped
to rein in the currency, with the yen at 80.70 as of 6:21 p.m.
in Tokyo today.  Azumi added that he’s “fully aware of the impact of
currencies on the economy, and I believe the  Bank of Japan  is
also watching the currency market with great interest.”  He said he doesn’t see the need to revise the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
Law, which guarantees the bank’s independence, nor set up a new
legal accord to require the bank to coordinate policies with the
government.  The finance chief said the government will this week start
“concrete high-level discussions” with other countries about
contributions to the International Monetary Fund’s efforts to
contain  Europe ’s debt crisis. Azumi said that while Europe has
made some progress in building firewalls to prevent financial
contagion, more can be done.  To contact the reporters on this story:
