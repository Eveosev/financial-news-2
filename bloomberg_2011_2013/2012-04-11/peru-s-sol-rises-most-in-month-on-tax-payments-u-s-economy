Peru’s sol advanced the most in a
month after companies bought the currency to pay taxes and as
signs of strength in the  U.S. economy  spurred demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.6620 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, from 2.6658 yesterday, according to Deutsche
Bank AG’s local unit.  “There has been a lot dollar selling by companies needing
to pay income tax,” said  Roberto Melzi , a strategist at
Barclays Capital Inc. in New York. “Latin American currencies
should appreciate because they are linked to the U.S. economy,
which is doing relatively well.”  The Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy expanded at a
“modest to moderate” pace from mid-February through late March
as manufacturing, hiring and retail sales strengthened.  Peru’s central bank bought $82 million in the spot currency
market today to stem gains in the sol. It paid an average of
2.6635 soles per dollar, the bank said in a statement on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
