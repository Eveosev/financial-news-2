Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said that a spread between Spanish and German 10-year
bond yields of more than 400 basis points for a prolonged period
would complicate the country’s ability to fund its debt.  “The key is that independently from short term movements,
we should look at the underlying medium-term trend,” de Guindos
told reporters in Barcelona today. “In this sense, a spread of
more than 400 basis points is obviously a problem for the public
sector and also the private sector’s funding.”  The difference between the yield on the benchmark Spanish
10-year bonds and comparable German debt fell 24 basis points to
409.6 today. The spread closed above the 400 level on April 5
for the first time since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
