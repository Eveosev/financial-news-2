Australia  gained the momentum
heading into the final day of the series-opening cricket Test
against West Indies, which leads by 114 runs with five second-
innings wickets remaining.  West Indies reached 71-5 at stumps on day four at the
Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, after touring captain
Michael Clarke earlier declared Australia’s first innings at
406-9 with his team still trailing by 43 runs.  Ben Hilfenhaus then removed the West Indies’ top three
batsmen with just four runs on the board before  Ryan Harris , who
earlier scored a Test-best 68 not out, had first-innings
centurion Shivnarine Chanderpaul caught behind.  Peter Siddle 
added the wicket of Dwayne Bravo.  “To declare and put them in straight away, it probably
didn’t give them a chance to get their head around batting,”
Harris said in a news conference. “It was a good declaration.
We want to win the Test match.”  The teams are scheduled to play three Tests with matches in
Trinidad and Dominica to follow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
