Middle East and slowing seasonal demand.  Dubai was down $1.76 to $117.05 a barrel, the lowest since
Feb. 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The crude’s
 backwardation , when the price for delivery now is  greater  than
that for later, dropped 10 cents. Swaps for May were $1.40 a
barrel more than July, according to data PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a London-based broker. That price spread is down 17
percent so far this month and signals weakening demand from oil
refiners for immediate shipments.  “It could be that momentum is changing and that market
participants are beginning to notice the stock builds occurring
on the back of ramped-up production out of the Middle East,”
Vienna-based JBC Energy GmbH said in a research note today.
“With Saudi storage facilities now full, the Kingdom’s barrels
are entering the market directly and soaking up seasonally lower
demand.”  Profits from turning a barrel of Dubai crude into fuel and
products priced in  Singapore  averaged $3.13 during the last five
days, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg, compared with a
