South Africa doesn’t believe  Brazil 
will approach the World Trade Organization about the African
nation’s decision to impose higher tariffs on some poultry
imports, Trade Minister  Rob Davies  said.  There is “no big crisis” with Brazil on poultry, Davies
said today at a trade conference in Sun City, northwest of
Johannesburg. “There has been a certain amount of exaggeration
about whether this will go to the WTO or not,” Davies said.  Brazil’s poultry association said it would ask the
government to approach the WTO about import charges South Africa
imposed on the South American nation’s exports, it said in a
Feb. 13 statement.  Import charges of 6 percent to 63 percent had been imposed
on the poultry for six months, as initial information showed
Brazilian producers were dumping products in  South Africa  and
neighboring countries, Francois Dubbelman of Pretoria-based FC
Dubbelman and Associates, which represents the South African
Poultry Association, said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
