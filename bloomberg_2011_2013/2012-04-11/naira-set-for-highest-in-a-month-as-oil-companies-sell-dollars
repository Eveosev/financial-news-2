Nigeria’s naira strengthened to its
highest in almost seven weeks as  oil companies  and the  central
bank  sold dollars and the  European Central Bank  signalled it may
act to help stem the spread of the region’s debt crisis.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer appreciated
0.1 percent to 157.30 per dollar as of 4:09 p.m. on the
 interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital, its strongest
since Feb. 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The oil industry is the second major supplier of foreign
exchange after the Central Bank of Nigeria that holds twice-
weekly auctions on Mondays and Wednesday’s to stabilize the
naira. Crude rose from the lowest close in almost two months in
New York after ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure
suggested the bank may restart bond purchases for  Spain . The
nation’s bonny light crude is trading at more than $50 a barrel
above the $72 a barrel incorporated into the country’s 2012
budget, as at yesterday, according to the central bank.  The naira should “strengthen further due to dollar sales
by oil companies,” Access Bank analysts led by Tony Monye and
Michael Ndiomu wrote in e-mailed note to clients.  Nigeria  sold  $150 million at a foreign-currency auction
today, with lenders buying the entire amount on offer, the
Abuja-based central bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Dollars were sold for between 155.80 naira and 156.01 naira
each, with the marginal rate, which is also used as the
prevailing exchange rate strengthened by 0.1 percent to 155.80
naira per dollar, it said.  Borrowing costs on the West African nation’s $500 million
of dollar bonds rose seven basis points to 5.51 percent at 4:09
p.m. in  London .  Ghana’s cedi appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 1.79 per
dollar at 4:09 p.m. in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
