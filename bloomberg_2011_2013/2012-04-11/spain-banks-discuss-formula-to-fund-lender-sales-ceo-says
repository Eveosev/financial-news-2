The Spanish government and banks
are talking about a formula to fund the state’s deposit-
guarantee fund so that it can keep supporting the sale of  failed
lenders , said Jose Antonio Garcia Cantera, chief executive
officer of  Banco Espanol de Credito SA. (BTO)   The solution may mean the fund is recapitalized in such a
way that banks won’t have to book further contributions against
earnings, Cantera told reporters in  Madrid  today. Spanish Deputy
Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said at the same event
that the government was still considering options for boosting
the fund.  Spain  has used the deposit-guarantee fund, which is
underwritten by the country’s banks, to help finance the sale of
failed lenders, including Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo,
without passing the cost to the government. The process has
sapped the fund’s reserves, causing doubts about whether it has
the resources to support the sale of other lenders, including
CatalunyaCaixa and Banco de Valenca.  “Between all of us the right solution will emerge,” said
Cantera, adding that a final formula hasn’t been agreed.
“What’s clear is that money will have to be brought forward
because at the moment it’s not there.”  The government used the fund to inject 5.25 billion euros
($6.9 billion) into  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM)  when it
agreed to sell it to Banco Sabadell SA in December. The fund
will also absorb 953 million euros of costs related to the sale
announced last month of Unnim, another bailed-out bank, to  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
