Gasoline fell following reports
that U.S. inventories rose last week and that demand at the pump
is weakening as retail prices increase.  Futures retreated after the industry-funded  American
Petroleum Institute  said yesterday that stockpiles of the motor
fuel advanced by 1.18 million barrels and crude oil supplies
increased 6.8 million barrels. The Energy Department reduced its
demand forecast for 2012 and 2013 amid higher pump prices.  “Refiners will be coming off maintenance soon and, with a
lot of crude sitting around, they will have no choice but to
make a lot of gasoline,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “More and more people are
believing that gasoline has peaked.”  Gasoline for May delivery declined 1.02 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.2394 a gallon at 9:33 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington . The report is
expected to show a 1.38 million-barrel decline in gasoline,
according to the median of 10 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Demand will average 8.65 million barrels a day in 2012,
down from 8.74 million in 2011, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said yesterday in its monthly Short-
Term Energy Outlook. That’s 20,000 barrels a day below last
month’s projection of 8.67 million.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.7
cent yesterday to $3.915 a gallon, according to AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring club.  May-delivery heating oil rose 0.19 cent to $3.0976 a gallon
on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
