The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and share prices are as of the close in Buenos
Aires.  The  Merval (MERVAL)  index rose 0.3 percent to 2,503.90.  Banco Macro SA (BMA)   rose 3.2 percent to 9.60 pesos, the
biggest gain in more than two weeks. Argentina’s largest lender
by market share advanced in line with global stocks after Alcoa
Inc.’s first-quarter profit beat expectations and as the
European Central Bank signaled it may revive its bond-purchase
program.  YPF SA (YPFD)   slumped 5 percent to 114.5 pesos, its
lowest price since June 2009. Argentina’s government plans to
take over management of YPF SA and give the country’s provinces
a seat on the board of directors, Jorge Sapag, the governor of
Neuquen province, said on the local government’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
