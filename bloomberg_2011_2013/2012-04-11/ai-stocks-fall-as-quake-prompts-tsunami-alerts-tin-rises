Indonesia ’s rupiah fell to its
lowest level in almost three weeks and Thai  stocks  slumped after
northwestern Indonesia was hit by a magnitude 8.7 earthquake
that prompted tsunami warnings across parts of Asia.  Indonesia’s rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 9,205 per dollar
after strengthening 0.4 percent before the quake. It touched
9,208, the weakest level since March 23. Thailand’s benchmark
SET Index sank 1 percent to a one-month low of 1,154.49. Tin for
delivery in three months in  London  gained 0.1 percent to $22,773
a metric ton, after falling 1.4 percent today, on speculation
output from Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter, will be
disrupted.  The earthquake struck off Indonesia’s Sumatra island, the
 U.S. Geological Survey  said today, prompting residents to flee
to higher ground as Indonesia,  India  and Thailand issued tsunami
warnings. More than 220,000 people were killed in 12 countries
after a magnitude-9.1 earthquake off Sumatra in 2004 unleashed
waves that destroyed coastal areas around the  Indian Ocean .  “The market will surely be concerned about the impact,”
said Putu Andi Wijaya, a Jakarta-based foreign-exchange dealer
at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia. “The tsunami is still a warning,
so we haven’t seen the entire reaction yet. We still don’t know
the extent of the damage.”  Indonesia’s 4.875 percent dollar bonds maturing in May 2021
fell after the news. Its yield climbed one basis point to 3.77
percent, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show. The yield
on 7 percent rupiah-denominated notes due May 2022 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.97 percent,
according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association. That’s the
highest level since March 16.  Full Reaction  News of the quake emerged about 15 minutes before
Indonesian  stock trading  ended at 4 p.m. local time. The  Jakarta
Composite Index (JCI)  was little changed afterward before paring
losses in the final minute of trade. It ended the day 0.5
percent lower at 4,130.01.  “The quake happened at closing time, so we haven’t seen
the full reaction yet,” said Artanavaro Gasali, Jakarta-based
head of global markets at PT Bank ICBC Indonesia. “If the
quake’s impact is seen as significant to the economy like last
time then there will be a significant reaction in the market.”  Central Plaza Hotel Pcl (CENTEL) , Thailand’s biggest hotel operator
by market value, slumped 4.1 percent.  Laguna Resorts & Hotels
Pcl (LRH) , which operates hotels in the coastal province of Phuket,
sank 2.4 percent. Thailand’s airport operator temporarily closed
Phuket’s international airport as a precaution following the
quake.  Weaker Sentiment  The nation’s SET Index has slumped 4.7 percent since April
3, when valuations rose to the highest relative to the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index in three months. The SET  trades  for 12.1 times
estimated profit, a 4 percent discount to the Asian gauge’s
multiple of 12.6.  “The tsunami report has further weakened investors’
sentiment in the Thai market, which has already been under
selling pressure from profit taking,” Andy Jenwipakul, the head
of research at SCB Securities Co. said by phone today. “The
impact on economy and human lives will probably be a lot less
than the 2004 as the preparation and warning systems are much
better.”  Adani Enterprises Ltd. (ADE)  and  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) , which own stakes
in Indonesian coal mines, sank at least 2 percent in India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
