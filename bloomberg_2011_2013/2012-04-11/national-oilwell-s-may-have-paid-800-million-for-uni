National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV) , the
largest U.S. maker of oil equipment, may have paid as much as
$800 million for a  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  pipe-distribution unit,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  National Oilwell Varco and Schlumberger didn’t disclose
terms of the all-cash transaction in separate releases
yesterday. Schlumberger’s Wilson unit sells pipes, valves,
fittings and other tools for oil and natural-gas companies.  Wilson is expected to have sales of $2.7 billion this year
with profit margin of 4 percent to 5 percent, J.  David Anderson ,
an analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in a note to investors. The
segment is worth about six to seven times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or $700 million
to $800 million, he said.  Wilson is “a hardware store for the oilfield-services
industry,” Anderson wrote. Houston-based National Oilwell Varco
“has been building out its manufacturing capabilities to serve
its distribution business, so adding Wilson provides even
greater opportunities to expand the business.”  The deal is subject to regulatory approval, the companies
said yesterday.  Loren Singletary, a spokesman for National Oilwell Varco,
declined to comment on the estimated transaction value. Mary Jo
Caliandro, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Schlumberger, had no
comment.  Schlumberger climbed 1.3 percent to $68.12 at the close in
 New York . National Oilwell Varco rose 1.3 percent to $76.97.  To contact the reporter on this story:
