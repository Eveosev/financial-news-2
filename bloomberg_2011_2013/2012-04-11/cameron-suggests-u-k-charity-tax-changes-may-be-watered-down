Prime Minister  David Cameron 
suggested he may water down plans to prevent tax avoidance on
charitable donations, saying he will listen to British charities
that fear a loss of income.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  proposed last
month to cap tax relief, including that on donations, at 50,000
pounds ($80,000) a year or no higher than a quarter of an
individual’s income to stop rich donors from using such
contributions to lower their tax bill. Charities attacked the
plan.  “There is no doubt that abuse is taking place,” Cameron
said at a news conference in Jakarta today during a trip to
 Southeast Asia . He promised to “look very sympathetically” at
the case put forward by charities before the government
publishes proposals in the third quarter.  Cameron said this week he’s ready to be the first British
premier to publish his tax returns, according to a person close
to him, as he seeks to defuse accusations that he’ll benefit
personally from a cut in the top rate of income tax next year.
Osborne reduced the levy on incomes above 150,000 pounds a year
to 45 percent from 50 percent, arguing that it would help cut
down  tax avoidance .  John Low, the chief executive of the Charities Aid
Foundation, said in a  statement on the body’s website  yesterday
that philanthropists give much more than they can claim as tax
relief.  To contact the reporter on this story:
