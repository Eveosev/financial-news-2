Oi SA (BRTO4) , the company formerly known
as  Brazil  Telecom SA, fell after Morgan Stanley said it expects
the telephone company will cut dividend payments.  Oi fell 2.3 percent to 9.16 reais at 1:30 p.m. in Sao
Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa index advanced 0.3 percent. Michel Morin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, predicts Brazil’s second-
biggest phone company will cut its annual dividend payments to 1
billion reais ($546 million) from 2 billion reais. Oi is
scheduled to hold meetings with investors on April 17, according
to Morgan Stanley.  It’s “unlikely the 2011 dividend of 2 billion reais is
sustainable going forward,” Morgan Stanley said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
