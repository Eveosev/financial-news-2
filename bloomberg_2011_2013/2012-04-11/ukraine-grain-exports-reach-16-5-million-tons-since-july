Ukraineâ€™s grain exports reached
16.5 million metric tons since July 1, Agriculture Minister
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  Another 7 million tons may be exported by June 30,
Prysyazhnyuk told reporters today in the capital, Kiev. That
would take total exports in the marketing year to 23.5 million
tons, nearly double the 12.1 million tons shipped in the
previous marketing year.  Winter grains for the 2012 harvest have sprouted on 7.5
million hectares (18.5 million acres), Prysyazhnyuk said, with
plants deemed to be in good and satisfactory condition on 4.8
million hectares.  Farmers have sown spring grains on 2.3 million hectares, or
57 percent of the planned area, he said. Some 24,000 hectares
were planted with sunflowers and 107,000 hectares with sugar
beets, the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
