Nokia Siemens Networks wants to
reduce annual costs by 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion), Financial
Times Deutschland reported, citing unidentified persons close to
the company.  Part of the effort is a new management structure disclosed
to employees in an e-mail, the newspaper said in a preview of an
article for tomorrow’s edition.  Daily leadership tasks will now be handled by a committee
of three, composed of Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri and
the company’s chief financial and chief operating officers,
according to FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
