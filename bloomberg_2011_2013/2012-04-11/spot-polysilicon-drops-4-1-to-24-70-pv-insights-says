The spot price of solar-grade
polysilicion, the main raw material for photovoltaic panels,
tumbled for a sixth straight week, according to a survey by PV
Insights.  Polysilicon dropped 4.1 percent to $24.70 a kilogram from
the previous week, accelerating from a 2.1 percent decline over
the previous seven days, the research company said on its
 website . Solar panels fell 1.7 percent to 87 U.S. cents a watt.  Spot prices for the material have fallen by two-thirds in
the past year as makers such as  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) 
boosted output, surpassing demand for panels and creating a
glut, according to London-based Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Renewable Energy Corp ASA (REC) ,  Europe â€™s second-biggest
polysilicon producer, erased gains of as much as 5.9 percent
before the pricing figures were published to trade 3.3 percent
higher at 1:38 p.m. in Oslo.  Solar cells fell 1.1 percent to 46 U.S. cents a watt while
6-inch multicrystalline solar wafers slid 2 percent to $1.09.  To contact the reporter on this story:
