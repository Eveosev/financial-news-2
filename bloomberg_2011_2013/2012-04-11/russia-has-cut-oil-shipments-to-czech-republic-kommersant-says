Russia will ship only 80,000 tons
of oil to the  Czech Republic  this month, rather than the 350,000
tons originally scheduled,  Kommersant  reported.  OAO Lukoil and OAO Rosneft have cut supplies to the Central
European country in favor of other markets, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
