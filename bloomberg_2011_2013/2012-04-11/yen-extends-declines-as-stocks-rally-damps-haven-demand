The dollar fell versus most of its
major peers as data showed the most Americans since January
filed for jobless benefits last week, supporting the argument
that monetary policy should stay stimulative to spur growth.  Australia ’s currency rallied after employment increased
more than economists forecast and  China ’s new yuan loans were
the highest in a year. The greenback dropped after Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman Janet L Yellen and New York Fed President
William C. Dudley said U.S. borrowing costs will remain low
following a report on April 6 that showed employers added the
fewest jobs in March in five months.  “The initial jobless claims buttressed the original trend
of the day of buying higher-yielding currencies and not the
dollar,” said Ravi Bharadwaj, a market analyst in  Washington  at
Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co.
“The Fed is intensely analyzing the latest employment results
to see if it’s reflective of broader weakness or not, so they’re
in the thick of it just as much as the market.”  The dollar slid 0.6 percent to $1.3188 per euro at 5 p.m.
New York time and touched $1.3213, the weakest level since April
4.  Japan ’s currency dropped 0.6 percent to 106.68 per euro. The
yen was little changed at 80.89 per dollar.  Stocks rose as investors sought higher-yielding assets,
with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advancing 1.4 percent.  Yellen, Dudley  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s  Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners, dropped 0.5 percent after Yellen said yesterday
additional debt purchases by the Fed may be warranted.  “Over the next several years, I anticipate that we will
fall far short in achieving our maximum employment objective,
and I expect inflation to remain at or below” the Fed’s 2
percent target, she said in a speech in  New York .  Dudley said today in Syracuse, New York, that it’s “too
soon to conclude that we are out of the woods, as underlined by
the March labor-market release.” While he voiced concern that
more bond purchases by the Fed could spark anxieties about
inflation, he said he supports holding interest rates close to
zero through late 2014.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of assets in two rounds of so-
called quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to
support the economy. It has held its benchmark  interest rate  in
a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and has
pledged to keep it low through at least late 2014.  Jobs Data  The dollar extended losses against the euro after Labor
Department data showed initial claims for U.S. unemployment
benefits increased by 13,000 in the week ended April 7 to
380,000, the highest since Jan. 28. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists was for 355,000. The
department reported last week that U.S. nonfarm payrolls added
120,000 jobs in March, versus a forecast of 205,000.  “The U.S. data has slipped over the past couple of weeks
and the Fed has seen it soften somewhat as well, and they are
conscious of that and they are telling the market that, ‘Look,
we’re keeping rates low for a very long time,’” said Blake Jespersen, managing director of foreign exchange in Toronto at
Bank of Montreal.  The Australian currency climbed as the number of people
employed rose by 44,000 last month. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had forecast a gain of 6,500.  ‘Positive Surprise’  Comments from Yellen “certainly helped, as did the
positive surprise on the employment data in Australia,” said
 Adam Cole , global head of foreign-exchange strategy in  London  at
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, in a telephone
interview. “Australia is kind of a bellwether cyclical, and if
Australia’s doing well then cyclical currencies and assets tend
to do well. It was those two things taken together that are
helping to support risk appetite.”  The Aussie strengthened 1.3 percent, the biggest jump since
Jan. 3, to $1.0438. It rallied 1.4 percent to 84.44 yen.  In China, Australia’s largest trading partner, local-
currency-denominated  loans  were 1.01 trillion yuan ($160.1
billion) in March, the People’s Bank of China said today. That
exceeded all 28 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey, reassuring
investors the nation may avoid a deep slowdown.  The yuan was little changed at 6.3074 per dollar. The
central bank raised the currency’s reference rate by 0.05
percent to 6.2984 today, the strongest since March 30.  Rand, Kiwi Gain  The South African rand climbed 1.7 percent to 7.8722 per
dollar.  New Zealand ’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, advanced 1.2
percent to 82.78 U.S. cents, and the Canadian dollar appreciated
1 percent to 99.43 cents to the greenback.  The yen dropped versus most major peers as  Bank of Japan (8301) 
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said policy makers will “pursue
powerful easing.” Defeating deflation and achieving sustained
growth are important tasks for the central bank, Shirakawa said
today in  Tokyo . It unexpectedly expanded bond purchases by 10
trillion yen on Feb. 14 and set an inflation goal of 1 percent.  The yen has tumbled 8.3 percent over the past three months,
the biggest decline among the 10 currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar was the second-worst
performer with a 3.1 percent drop. The euro rose 1.2 percent.  The euro strengthened versus the dollar as  Italy ’s 10-year
bonds rose for a second day, pushing  yields  down from an almost
two-month high of 5.73 percent reached yesterday. The nation
sold 4.88 euros ($6.4 billion) of securities, close to its 5
billion-euro maximum target for the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
