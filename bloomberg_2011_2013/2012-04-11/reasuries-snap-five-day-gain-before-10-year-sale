Treasuries weakened for the first
time in six days on speculation tumbling yields may erode demand
when the U.S. auctions $21 billion of 10-year securities today.  The  Federal Reserve  sold $8.6 billion in Treasuries
maturing between July 2012 and January 2013 as part of the
central bank’s economic stimulus plan. Spain’s Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said the nation won’t need a bailout after debt
concern drove U.S.  10-year note yields  below 2 percent yesterday
for the first time in four weeks.  “You have pressure on the flight-to-quality trade,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “It wasn’t as bad as
everybody thought it was in Spain. Not a lot of people want to
buy 2 percent notes; 2.10 percent gives you a little bit of a
hedge.”  Benchmark 10-year note yields increased four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.02 percent at 11:28 a.m.  New York 
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 fell 11/32, or $3.44 per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 25/32. The yields slid yesterday to
1.96 percent, the lowest level since March 7.  Yield Pattern  The benchmark note yields touched a 2012 high of 2.4
percent on March 20 and a 2012 low of 1.79 percent on Jan. 31.
The 10-year note yields are 84 basis points below the rate of
consumer-price inflation. It reached 49 basis points below on
March 19.  Two-year note yields increased one basis point to 0.30
percent today. The extra  yield  10-year securities offer over
two-year debt shrank yesterday to 1.67 percentage points, the
narrowest in a month.  The 10-year U.S. Treasuries scheduled for sale today
yielded 2.03 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.076
percent at the previous offering March 13.  “The 10-year looks much richer,” said  Thomas Roth , senior
Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA
Inc. “It’s a big chunk of paper that you’ve got to take down at
rich levels. We’ve come too far too fast.”  Investors  bid  for 3.24 times the amount of debt offered
last month, compared with the average of 3.13 for the past 10
auctions. Indirect bidders, the group that includes foreign
central banks, bought 38.6 percent of the debt, versus the 10-
sale average of 43.1 percent.  Debt Returns  The 10-year note has returned 2 percent this month,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.  The U.S. sold $32 billion of three-year notes yesterday,
with the class of bidders that includes foreign central banks
taking 40 percent of the debt, the most since August.  The Treasury plans to auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds
tomorrow, completing this week’s sales of coupon-bearing debt
totaling $66 billion.  U.S. three-year notes have returned 0.3 percent this month,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Thirty-year
bonds surged 4.1 percent, the figures show.  Benchmark Treasury yields earlier touched 1.99 percent
today, matching the so-called lower Bollinger level. Bollinger
bands gauge volatility by plotting standard deviations above and
below a moving average. Analysts use them to determine a
probable range for a rate or security.  Spain’s Debt  Treasuries rallied yesterday as Spanish 10-year yields
climbed 22 basis points to 5.98 percent. Italy’s increased 23
basis points to 5.69 percent.  The difference between Spanish and German 10-year yields
widened to 4.37 percentage points today, the most since
November, before narrowing. An announcement by  Spain ’s Rajoy
this week that he would cut an additional 10 billion euros
($13.1 billion) in education and health spending failed to ease
concern that the nation will become the fourth member of the
euro area to need a bailout.  Ten-year Treasuries  yield  22 basis points more than
similar-maturity debt in  Germany , reflecting demand for bunds
because of  Europe ’s fiscal crisis. The spread widened to 49
basis points on April 3, the most since January 2011.  Volatility declined yesterday. Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures Treasury price swings based
on options, fell to 75.1 basis points, the lowest since March
13. It reached 93.3 basis points on March 20, the highest level
this year.  The Fed sold notes today as part of the central bank’s
effort to replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its
holdings with longer maturities to hold down borrowing costs.
The U.S. central bank is also due to release its Beige Book
business survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
