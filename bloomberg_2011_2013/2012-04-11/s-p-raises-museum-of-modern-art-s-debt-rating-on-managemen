Standard & Poor’s  raised its 
long-term rating for the  Museum of Modern Art  in New York as 
it benefited from the fundraising of its trustees.  S&P cited the museum management’s “plan to reduce debt as
well as MoMA’s increased financial resources and liquidity.”  MoMA’s rating was raised to AA from AA-. The change reflects
“our view of MoMA’s continued strong giving by the board, which
we view as instrumental to funding high depreciation and
interest charges that are not fully incorporated into the
operating budget,” S&P’s credit analyst Bobbi Gajwani wrote in
a report.  As of June 30, 2011, the museum’s outstanding debt was
$332.9 million, according to MoMA’s annual report. Jerry I. Speyer, co-chief executive officer of Tishman Speyer Properties
LP, serves the chairman of MoMA’s board of trustees. Glenn D. Lowry is the director of the museum.  S&P listed the issuing of new debt and declines in
fundraising as factors that could put pressure on the rating in
the future.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
