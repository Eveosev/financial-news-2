The $60 billion diamond jewelry
market may face structural shortages and price increases,
particularly for large stones, as demand doubles by 2020, led by
growth in China and India, according to consultant Bain & Co.  Diamond demand in carats will rise more than 6 percent a
year until 2020, outpacing the 2.8 percent annual growth in
supply, Bain said today in a report for the  Antwerp World
Diamond Centre . Production will reach almost 175 million carats
by then, exceeding the peak reached in 2007.  “Even in the most conservative growth scenario, the
estimates are clearly very positive,” said Bain, whose forecast
is based on a doubling of the middle classes in China and India,
which will account for 30 percent of the global market by 2020,
the same as the U.S.  Financial speculation may play a role in the anticipated
price increase, according to Bain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
