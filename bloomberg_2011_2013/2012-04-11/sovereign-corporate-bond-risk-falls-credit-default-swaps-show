The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index linked to 15
governments fell three basis points to 275 at 12:22 p.m. in
London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 19.5
basis points to 678.5, according to BNP Paribas SA. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings fell four basis points to 143 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell eight basis points to 250 and the
subordinated index declined 10.5 to 402.5, BNP Paribas prices
show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
