Latvia plans to find 70 million
lati ($132 million) in savings in the 2013 budget, equivalent to
about 0.5 percent of gross domestic product, said Prime Minister
Valdis Dombrovskis.  The savings will come from “economic growth and
restricting increases in spending,” Dombrovskis said today on
the  Latvijas Radio  program Krustpunkts.  The Baltic country passed spending cuts and tax increases
of almost 18 percent after taking a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.9
billion) loan from a group led by the European Commission and
the  International Monetary Fund  in late 2008. Latvia completed
the program in December and plans to adopt the euro in 2014
after posting a budget deficit of about 2.5 percent of GDP this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
