Volga Gas Plc (VGAS) , a Russian oil and
gas explorer listed in London, said the Yuzhny Romanovskaya-1
well in southern Russia failed to find hydrocarbons.  “Exploration drilling on the YR-1 well is disappointing as
this was considered to be a relatively low-risk target,” Chief
Executive Officer Mikhail Ivanov said today in a regulatory
filing. Its resource potential hadn’t been included in previous
reserves disclosures, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
