More than a quarter of all jobs in
the U.S. are with companies that rely on patents, copyrights and
trademarks to protect products from competition and promote
investment, the Commerce Department said.  About 27.1 million jobs in 2010 were in industries that
rely heavily on intellectual property protections, and another
12.9 million positions were indirectly affected. The 75
industries deemed “IP-intensive” accounted for $5.06 trillion,
or about 35 percent of the gross domestic product in 2010,
according to a study released today by the Economics and
Statistics Administration and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  The Commerce Department sought to quantify the portion of
the  U.S. economy  relying on intellectual property rights as
President  Barack Obama  calls for more innovation to boost job
growth. Workers in industries deemed intellectual property
intensive earned $1,156 a week on average in 2010, 42 percent
more than those in other sectors, the report found.  “These good-paying jobs help support an economic security
for America’s middle class,”  Rebecca Blank , deputy Commerce
secretary, said today on a conference call with reporters.  While almost all companies rely on some intellectual
property, such as the trademark for their name, the study
selected 75 that were considered more reliant, including makers
of electronics, medical devices, software, drugs, motor
vehicles,  consumer goods  and movies.  Jobs Growth  “The largest and most innovative industries in the U.S.
rely on IP for global competitiveness,” said patent office
Director David Kappos. Strong intellectual property protection
is “paying dividends in growth of the economy and growth of
jobs.”  The U.S. jobless rate was at 8.2 percent in March as Obama
campaigns for a second term in November’s presidential election.
A loss of manufacturing jobs has meant that employment in the
patent-reliant industries fell, though there was rapid growth in
jobs in areas such as software that rely more on copyright
protection.  U.S. exports of merchandise from industries that are
intensive in intellectual property, including electronics and
chemicals, increased about 53 percent, to $775 billion, from
2000 to 2010, according to the report. They account for almost
61 percent of all U.S. goods exported.  Imports from industries intensive in intellectual property
increased almost 62 percent during the past decade, to $1.34
billion in 2010.  Measuring Effect  “We must ensure that American IP-intensive industries
remain confident that their copyrights, patents, and trademarks
will be enforced,”  Thomas Donohue , the president of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said at a White House event announcing the
report.  Quantifying the economic contribution of intellectual
property has been difficult, with a 2010 GAO  report  saying that
it was impossible to measure the amount that pirated goods hurt
the economy.  Trade statistics don’t capture the “complete picture” of
the importance of some industries, such as electronics, to the
U.S. economy, according to the report. For example, low-wage
workers assemble iPhones abroad for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the Cupertino,
California-based company that employs highly skilled workers in
the U.S. and is a global leader in computer manufacturing, the
report said.  The report took no policy positions, though Blank said it
would be used in talks with  China  on its need to crack down on
 counterfeit goods .  To contact the reporters on this story:
