The European Union is reviewing
anti-dumping measures against ethanolamine imports from the U.S.
as they apply to  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  after the company increased
its prices.  The EU said Dow, based in Midland,  Michigan , requested the
review after raising its export prices for ethanolamines, which
are used for products including detergents, textiles, herbicides
and cement. The company provided “evidence showing that the
continued imposition of the measure at its current level is no
longer necessary to counteract the injurious dumping,” the EU
said today in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
