The  International Monetary Fund 
approved a $987 million loan to Bangladesh today after rising
oil imports depleted the country’s currency reserves.  Bangladesh will immediately receive $141 million under the
three-year arrangement, the IMF said in an e-mailed statement.
Conditions for the loan include a “restrained” monetary
policy, a reduction of trade barriers and “moderate” fiscal
consolidation, according to the release.  “Macroeconomic pressures have intensified in Bangladesh
since late 2010 due to a negative terms-of-trade shock, rising
oil and infrastructure-related imports, and accommodative
policies,” IMF Deputy Managing Director  Naoyuki Shinohara ,
acting chairman of the meeting, said in the statement.  “More recently, a weakening in external demand and a surge
in  oil prices  have further weakened  Bangladesh ’s balance of
payments and added to fiscal and inflationary pressures,” he
said.  The South Asian nation is dependent on remittances and
export earnings, both of which have fallen recently, to pay for
import of its oil, wheat and sugar requirements. Remittances
fell to $1.1 billion in March from $1.13 billion in Feb., the
central bank said last week while exports fell 8 percent in
February from the previous month.  The IMF said that Bangladesh’s central bank, which has
already tightened monetary policy, was committed to taking more
measures if needed to keep a lid on inflation.  Bangladesh’s economic size will be about $124 billion this
year, the IMF forecast in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
