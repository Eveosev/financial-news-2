Russian President-elect  Vladimir Putin  urged energy producers from the world’s biggest natural-
gas exporter to “rise to the challenge” of a changing market
as the U.S. increases output of shale gas.  U.S. shale gas production may “seriously” restructure
supply and demand in the global hydrocarbons market, Putin said
today in an address to the Russian lower house of parliament.  The U.S. overtook  Russia  as the biggest producer of gas in
2009 as it extracted fuel trapped in shale rocks. That has cut
prices and led nations from  China  to  Poland  to explore for such
resources, potentially cutting their reliance on Russian gas.  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , Russia’s biggest gas producer, has played down
the threat of U.S. competition and said the gas industry will
benefit from the shale boom. The Moscow-based exporter is
seeking to join a U.S. project to liquefy the fuel for shipment
by tanker, Frederic Barnaud, LNG executive director at the
company’s London marketing unit, said last month.  The U.S. plans to be a net exporter of LNG from 2016, with
initial sales of 1.1 billion cubic feet (31.1 million cubic
meters) a day doubling after three years.  Exports may begin in a decade, Gazprom Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Alexander Medvedev said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
