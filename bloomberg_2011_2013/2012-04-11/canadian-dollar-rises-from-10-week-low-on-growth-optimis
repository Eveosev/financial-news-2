The Canadian currency touched the
lowest level since January as it fluctuated before the Bank of
 Canada  releases its monetary policy report next week.  Canada’s dollar saw gains sputter even as global equities
and crude oil, two principal drivers of the nation’s exchange
rate, advanced. The so-called loonie climbed earlier today as
much as 0.4 percent. It had its biggest loss against the
Australian dollar among the most-traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “Very disappointing price action for the Canadian dollar
today, with stocks positive and commodities stable,”  Steve Butler , managing director in Toronto at Bank of  Nova Scotia ’s
 Scotia Capital  unit, wrote by e-mail. “There are a lot of
nervous long Canadian-dollar positions,” he said, referring to
bets that the currency will increase in value.  The currency was little changed at C$1.0038 per  U.S. dollar 
at 5 p.m. in Toronto after appreciating earlier to C$1.0009. It
touched C$1.0053, the weakest level since Jan. 31. One Canadian
dollar buys 99.62 U.S. cents.  “I think C$1.0050 to C$1.0070 is still the place to buy
the Canadian dollar,” said Scotia Capital’s Butler. “However,
if there’s a close at about that level, I will exit my long
Canadian dollar position. At that point I’ll have to reassess
things completely.” A long position is a bet that a currency
will strengthen.  The loonie has traded in a two-cent range of 98.42 cents to
C$1.0054 since the end of January.  “We’ve been stuck in a range for months, and a clean break
should open up for a decent move higher,” Butler said.  Government Bonds  Ten-year  government bonds  fell for the first time in three
days, pushing the yields up three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.01 percent. The yields fell yesterday to
below 2 percent for the first time since March 13.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7 percent today
after dropping 1.7 percent yesterday. Crude for May delivery
increased 1.7 percent to $102.59 a barrel in  New York .  Canada auctioned C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) of two-year
bonds at an average yield of 1.264 percent. The bid-to-cover
ratio was 2.55 for the 2.25 percent notes. The auction of two-
year bonds on Feb. 29 drew an average yield of 1.116 percent.  The loonie advanced earlier as gains in equities and
commodities burnished the appeal of riskier assets and a report
showed Canadian housing starts accelerated last month.  “We quite like the Canadian dollar as a currency,” said
Ankita Dudani, a foreign-currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, by phone from  London . “More likely than
not, the  Bank of Canada  should revise up the domestic and
international outlook. Conditions have improved in Canada, the
U.S. and globally as well.” RBS is long on the currency versus
the euro and the greenback, she said.  Housing Starts  Housing starts rose in March to 215,600 at a seasonally
adjusted annual pace from a revised 205,300 in the prior month,
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said today on its website.
Economists forecast a reading of 200,000, according to the
median of 18 responses to a Bloomberg News survey.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said in an April 2
speech that the Canadian economy is stronger than the central
bank had forecast. Policy makers will meet April 17 to set rates
and will release their quarterly policy report the next day.  The Canadian currency will strengthen to 98 cents per U.S.
dollar by year-end, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
