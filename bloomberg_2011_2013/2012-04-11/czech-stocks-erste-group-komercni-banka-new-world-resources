The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
jumped the most in six weeks, rising 1.5 percent to 939.70 at
its close in Prague, rebounding from an almost three-month low.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, fell
0.4 percent to 784 koruna. Electricity for next-year delivery in
Germany, where CEZ exports part of its output, dropped for a
second day to 51.20 euros per megawatt-hour, a two-month low.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , a unit of Societe Generale SA,

Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   surged 5.1 percent to
401.5 koruna. Financial stocks led a rally in European shares
after Alcoa Inc. opened the earnings season with an unexpected
profit and Spanish and Italian bonds rebounded.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, rebounded from the lowest in almost four months,
gaining 0.9 percent to 126.5 koruna. Commodities rallied as car

purchases of Spanish bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
