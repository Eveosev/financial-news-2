(Corrects third paragraph to say the franc breached the cap
only once.)  The Swiss franc strengthened
against the dollar after the country sold bonds amid demand for
its assets as a refuge from the euro region’s debt crisis.  The Swiss currency was little changed against the euro.
 Switzerland  auctioned securities maturing in April 2021 and
April 2042, a day after six-month bills were sold at a rate of
minus 0.251 percent. The franc appreciated against 11 of 16
major peers tracked by Bloomberg today.  The franc rose 0.2 percent to 91.66 centimes per dollar at
4:54 p.m. London time, its third advance in the past four days.
Switzerland’s currency was at 1.20105 per euro, from 1.20149
yesterday, having breached the 1.20 per euro ceiling once in the
past week.  The Zurich-based  Swiss National Bank  established the cap on
Sept. 6 to protect exports after investors seeking a haven from
the euro-area turmoil drove the currency to a record 1.00749
against the 17-nation euro.  The franc has gained 1 percent this year, making it the
third-best performer, after the  New Zealand dollar  and the
Norwegian krone, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, which track 10 developed-nation currencies.  Swiss bonds fell, with the yield on the 2 percent security
due April 2021 rising four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 0.70 percent. The price of the security was at 111.335
percent of face value.  Switzerland sold 872.3 million francs of 30-year bonds at
an average yield of 1.168 percent, and auctioned 177.4 million
francs of the 2021 securities at a yield of 0.705 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
