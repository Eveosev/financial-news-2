Bubba Watson’s pink driver, which
he used to win golf’s  Masters Tournament , will be sold as a
limited edition with a portion of the proceeds going to charity.  Ping will produce 5,000 G20 drivers with pink shafts and
heads. The company said in a statement on its website it will
give 5 percent of the proceeds to a fundraising effort by the
golfer, without specifying if the amount would come from the
retail price. G20s sell for $299 on the  Golf Galaxy  website. The
pink drivers will cost $430, ESPN said.  Watson, 33, in January set himself a target of raising  $1
million for charities  this year. Ping made a $10,000 donation
and will give another $300 for every drive Watson hits of 300
yards (274 meters) or more. To date, Ping has pledged $61,600,
with the money going to Phoenix-area causes the company chooses
with Watson’s support.  “Even prior to his win at the Masters, golfers were
requesting pink G20s,” John A. Solheim, the chairman and chief
executive officer of Ping, a unit of Phoenix-based Karsten
Manufacturing Corp., said in the statement.  Watson uses the distinctive club in support of  cancer
research . His father, Gerry, died of  lung cancer  in October
2010.  Watson on April 8 beat 2010 British Open champion  Louis Oosthuizen  of  South Africa  on the second hole of a playoff to
win the Masters, the first of golf’s four annual major
championships.  He climbed to No. 4 in the  Official World Golf Ranking  with
his first major title, making him the top-ranked American
player. He now has four career wins on the U.S.  PGA Tour .  The pink drivers will be available starting about June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
