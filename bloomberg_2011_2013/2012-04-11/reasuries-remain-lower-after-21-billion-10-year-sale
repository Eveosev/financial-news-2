Treasuries weakened for the first
time in six days on speculation  Spain ’s fiscal problems won’t
require a bailout, sapping demand at a $21 billion auction of
10-year notes.  Bond yields in Spain and  Italy  fell, reducing concern the
European debt crisis was widening, which drove  10-year yields 
below 2 percent yesterday for the first time in four weeks. The
primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve  were awarded
the largest share at today’s note sale since the October
auction.  “You see the  euro zone  being the key to this, day-to-day
in the absence of economic numbers,” said  Kevin Giddis , head of
fixed-income sales, trading and research at brokerage firm
Morgan Keegan Inc. in  Memphis ,  Tennessee . “As that tone’s a
little better, it will get some of the Treasury buyers to turn
and” sell.  The  yield  on the current 10-year note rose six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.04 percent, at 5 p.m. in
 New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. The 2
percent securities maturing in February 2022 fell 15/32, or
$4.69 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 22/32.  Two-year note yields
were little changed at 0.29 percent.  Benchmark 10-year note yields touched a 2012 high of 2.4
percent on March 20 and a 2012 low of 1.79 percent on Jan. 31.
The 10-year note yields are 84 basis points below the rate of
consumer-price inflation. It reached 49 basis points below on
March 19.  Auction Results  Today’s auction drew a yield of 2.043 percent, compared
with a forecast of 2.040 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
10 of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 3.08, compared with an average of 3.13
for the past 10 sales.  “The market is trading a little heavy,” said Jason Rogan,
director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC,
a New York-based brokerage for institutional investors. “The
recent run-up in prices was a little too aggressive and now we
are seeing some giveback of the rally in Treasuries.”  Primary dealers purchased 50.5 percent of the notes, the
most since 58.5 percent in October. Indirect bidders, an
investor class that includes foreign central banks, purchased
38.5 percent of the debt, compared with an average of 43.1
percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 11 percent of
the securities at the sale, compared with an average of 14.3
percent for the past 10 auctions.  Weekly Offerings  The Treasury is selling $66 billion of notes and bonds this
week, according to Treasury Department data. It’s due to auction
$13 billion of 30-year debt tomorrow after a $32 billion three-
year note sale yesterday that drew a yield of 0.427 percent,
percent, compared with a forecast of 0.424 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of primary dealers.  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has lost 0.15 percent this year,
matching the losses in the broader Treasury market. The notes
returned 17 percent in 2011, almost double the 9.8 percent gain
by Treasuries overall, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  Benchmark Treasury yields earlier touched 1.99 percent
today, matching the so-called lower Bollinger level. Bollinger
bands gauge volatility by plotting standard deviations above and
below a moving average. Analysts use them to determine a
probable range for a rate or security.  Treasuries rallied yesterday as Spanish 10-year yields
climbed 22 basis points to 5.98 percent. Italy’s increased 23
basis points to 5.69 percent.  European Yields  The difference between Spanish and German 10-year yields
widened to 4.37 percentage points today, the most since
November, before narrowing. The Spanish 10-year note yield
declined 0.11 percentage point to 5.83 percent and the Italian
10-year yield fell 0.16 percentage point to 5.50 percent.  “You have pressure on the flight-to-quality trade,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “It wasn’t as bad as
everybody thought it was in Spain. Not a lot of people want to
buy 2 percent notes; 2.10 percent gives you a little bit of a
hedge.”  Ten-year Treasuries  yield  22 basis points more than
similar-maturity debt in  Germany , reflecting demand for bunds
because of  Europe ’s fiscal crisis. The spread widened to 49
basis points on April 3, the most since January 2011.  Volatility declined yesterday. Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures Treasury price swings based
on options, fell to 75.1 basis points, the lowest since March
13. It reached 93.3 basis points on March 20, the highest level
this year.  Fed Moves  The Fed sold $8.6 billion in Treasuries maturing between
July 2012 and January 2013 as part of the central bank’s effort
to replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings
with longer maturities to hold down borrowing costs.  The Fed said the economy maintained its expansion in all 12
of its regions as manufacturing, hiring and retail sales showed
signs of strength in the face of higher fuel prices.  “The economy continued to expand at a modest to moderate
pace from mid-February through late March,” the Fed said today
in its Beige Book business survey, published two weeks before
the  Federal Open Market Committee  meets to set monetary policy.
“Hiring was steady or showed a modest increase across many
districts.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
