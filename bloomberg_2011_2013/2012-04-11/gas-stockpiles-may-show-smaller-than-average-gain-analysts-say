U.S. natural-gas stockpiles
expanded by 0.8 percent last week, less than the five-year
average, adding to  record  levels after warm weather reduced
demand, according to analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  Inventories rose by 21 billion cubic feet to 2.5 trillion
in the week ended April 6, based on the median of 21 estimates.
The five-year average change for the week is an increase of 22
billion, according to the Energy Department, which is scheduled
to release its weekly supply report tomorrow.  Gas has dropped 33 percent this year to decade lows as the
 surplus  to the average expanded to 61 percent in the week ended
March 31, the  biggest gap  since April 2006, department data
show. Stockpiles last week totaled 2.479 trillion.  “I see a bearish reaction to the report,” said  Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch & Associates, a Galena,
Illinois-based consulting firm, who estimated stocks gained 23
billion cubic feet.  U.S. heating demand was 28 percent below normal for the
week ended April 7, according to Weather Derivatives. The
Belton, Missouri-forecaster predicted demand would be 36 percent
below normal through April 18.  Winter in the lower 48 states was the warmest since 2000,
the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville,  North Carolina ,
said March 7.  Record Production  U.S. gas production reached record levels in 2011 on
increased output from shale formations from  Pennsylvania  to
 Texas . Output gained 0.8 percent in January to 83.17 billion
cubic feet a day from December, the Energy Department said in
its EIA-914 report March 29.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the department.  Gas consumption in the U.S. declines after the winter
heating season ends and before hot weather boosts consumption by
 power plants  to run air conditioners.  The analysts’ stockpile estimates ranged from gains of 13
billion cubic feet to 41 billion.  Natural gas futures last week dropped 3.7 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.089 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Gas fell today to $1.984, the lowest
settlement since January 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
