Sugar fell to the lowest level in
eight weeks in  London  as exports from  India , the world’s second-
largest producer, will compensate for a delay to the crop in top
grower  Brazil . Coffee advanced.  India has allowed exports of 3 million metric tons as local
supplies are higher than demand. The harvest in Brazil, which
usually would have started by now, will begin later this month
or in early May, according to Cepea, a University of Sao Paulo
research group. The sugar cane crop in Brazil’s main growing
region will be 500 million tons, down from a previous forecast
of 520 million tons, Macquarie Group Ltd. estimates.  “The market finally discovered that the April and June
sugar trade flow is not as tight as was expected,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers in Rolle,  Switzerland ,
said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Delays to the harvest and a
smaller crop in Brazil are not “important to the world market”
as Indian exports “will be there to fill the Brazilian gap.”  White, or refined, sugar for August delivery slid 0.8
percent to $616.20 a ton by 10:36 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London,
after touching $616 a ton, the lowest since Feb. 15. Raw sugar
for July delivery was little changed at 23.12 cents a pound on
ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Sugar has fallen 4.1 percent in London and 2.8 percent in
New York this month as a forecast surplus becomes available to
the market. The commodity rose 6.9 percent on NYSE Liffe and
2.2 percent on ICE in the first quarter on speculation supplies
would be limited due to the crop delay in Brazil.  The sugar cane crop in  Thailand , the second-biggest sugar
exporter, may be near 104 million tons, “exceeding all
expectations,” Beydoun said in the report.  Robusta coffee for July was up 0.7 percent to $2,004 a ton
on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for May delivery rose 0.9 percent
to $1.7975 a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for July delivery was little changed at 1,387 pounds
($2,204) a ton in London. Cocoa for May delivery climbed 0.2
percent to $2,075 a metric ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
