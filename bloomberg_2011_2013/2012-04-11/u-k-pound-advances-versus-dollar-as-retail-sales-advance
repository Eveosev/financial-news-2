The pound rose the most this month
against the dollar after an industry report showed retail sales
increased in March, boosting the appeal of U.K. assets.  Sterling advanced for the first time in six days against
the yen as European stocks and Spanish bonds rallied, easing
concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening. Gilts fell as the
retail-sales data added to signs the U.K. economy is improving,
damping demand for the safety of government debt. The U.K. sold
4.5 billion pounds ($7.2 billion) of five-year notes.  “Sterling will be one of the places to go to when
confidence returns to global markets,” said  Neil Jones , head of
European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
 London . “U.K. data has been showing some kind of green shoots
of recovery recently.”  The pound advanced 0.2 percent to $1.5891 at 4:44 p.m.
London time after climbing as much as 0.5 percent, the most
since March 30. The U.K. currency climbed 0.5 percent to 128.60
yen, and was little changed at 82.47 pence per euro.  Sales at U.K. stores open at least 12 months gained 1.3
percent last month from a year earlier, after dropping 0.3
percent in February, the London-based  British Retail Consortium 
said. Data last week showed U.K. services growth unexpectedly
accelerated and manufacturing and construction strengthened.  Sterling has appreciated 0.8 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The euro weakened 0.5 percent, and
the dollar dropped 1.7 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.7 percent, and  Spain ’s
10-year bond yield dropped 10 basis points to 5.87 percent.  ‘Good Cap’  The pound may “have difficulties” extending gains beyond
$1.59, said  Roberto Mialich , a senior currency strategist at
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan. Any advance to $1.60 “should remain a
good cap unless there’s something really positive” for the U.K.
economy, he said.  The  yield  on the 10-year gilt climbed four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.05 percent. The 4 percent bond
maturing in March 2022 fell 0.425, or 4.25 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 117.365. The five-year yield increased two
basis points to 0.96 percent.  The U.K. sold 1 percent notes due in September 2017 at an
average yield of 1.147 percent, the Debt Management Office said.
The government last auctioned the maturity on March 7 at a yield
of 1.198 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
