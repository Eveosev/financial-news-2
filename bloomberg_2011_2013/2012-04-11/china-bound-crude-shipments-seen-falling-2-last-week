Crude-oil shipments aboard
supertankers bound for  China  fell 2 percent last week, according
to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vessels with a total carrying capacity of 18.9 million
deadweight tons were heading for the Asian nation as of April 6,
down from 19.3 million tons in the preceding week. About 14
percent of the fleet of the largest  oil tankers  signaling future
destinations was bound for China, the world’s biggest energy
consumer. The ships would haul about 138.6 million barrels of
oil, assuming a conversion factor of 7.33 barrels a ton.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 439 very large crude
carriers, out of a global fleet of 559, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Average drafts are expressed as a
percentage of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size. Each country’s percentage share of total oil
shipments is shown for last week and the week before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
