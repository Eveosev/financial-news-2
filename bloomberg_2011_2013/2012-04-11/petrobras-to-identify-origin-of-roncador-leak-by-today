Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  said it will
diagnose by today the origin of the fluid collected at an area
in the Roncador field where it identified a leak on April 8.  Petrobras, as the state-owned company is known, will have
more information on the seep after analyses of the site, the Rio
de Janeiro-based company said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  Drops of crude were detected coming out of the seabed at
the Roncador area, Brazilâ€™s petroleum regulator, known as ANP,
said in an e-mailed statement on April 9. The area is near the
Frade field, where Chevron Corp. leaked 3,000 barrels of oil
into the Atlantic Ocean in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
