Japanese  stock   futures  rose after
the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  yesterday capped the longest losing
streak since 2009 as optimism about U.S. corporate earnings and
a drop in Spanish bond yields boosted demand for riskier assets.
Australian stock futures gained.  American depositary receipts of Toyota Corp., Asia’s
biggest carmaker that generates 28 percent of its sales in  North
America , rose 0.5 percent from the closing share price in  Tokyo 
after Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, reported
an unexpected first-quarter profit. Those of electronics maker
Kyocera Corp., which gets 17 percent of its revenue in Europe,
gained 0.7 percent. ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s
second-biggest oil and gas producer, climbed 0.6 percent after
crude prices gained.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,500 in  Chicago  yesterday, up from 9,440 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,510 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index added 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose
0.5 percent in Wellington.  “Today we will see a little bit of rebound after five or
so days of negative market activity, but there are significant
headwinds on the horizon,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps
manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
Melbourne. “Overall, clearly the U.S. economy is improving. The
question is whether we are reading too much into a better-than-
expected Alcoa result.”  Beige Book  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  gained 0.2
percent today. The index rose 0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday
after Alcoa kicked off the earnings seasons with a positive
tone. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book business survey showed
the economy maintained its expansion in all 12 of its regions as
manufacturing, hiring and retail sales showed signs of strength
in the face of higher fuel prices.  Stocks also rose after Spanish debt yields retreated from
this year’s high, while European Central Bank board member
Benoit Coeure spurred speculation the central bank will help
reduce Spain’s borrowing costs.  Crude oil for May delivery rose $1.68 to settle at $102.70
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 3.9
percent this year.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 8.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.8 percent advance by the
S&P 500 and a 4 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 10.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. added 1.8 percent to 101.22 yesterday
in New York yesterday, the biggest advance since March 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
