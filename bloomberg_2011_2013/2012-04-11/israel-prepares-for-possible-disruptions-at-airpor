Israel  is preparing for possible
disturbances at Ben-Gurion International Airport outside Tel
Aviv on April 15, as hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists are
planning to fly in to take part in protests next week.  “Security measures will be implemented both in the airport
and outside of it beginning this weekend in order to deal with
any disruptions,” Micky Rosenfeld, an Israel police spokesman,
said by phone today.  More than 1,500 activists from at least 15 countries will
arrive in Israel next week to take part in activities protesting
the government’s policies in the  West Bank  and  Gaza Strip , the
Welcome to Palestine Campaign said in an e-mailed statement.  The group tried to organize a similar action in July.
Several hundred activists were prevented by airlines from flying
to Israel or were denied entry into the country at Ben-Gurion,
though there were no flight disruptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
