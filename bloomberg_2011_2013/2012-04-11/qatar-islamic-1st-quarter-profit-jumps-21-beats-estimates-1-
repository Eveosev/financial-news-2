     April 11 (Bloomberg) -- Qatar Islamic Bank, the Persian
Gulf country’s biggest Sharia-compliant lender by assets, said
first-quarter profit jumped 21 percent on higher fee and
commission revenue, beating analysts estimates.  Net income rose to 388 million riyals ($106.6 million) from
321 million riyals a year earlier, the bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The average  estimate  of four analysts was for a
profit of 331 million riyals, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Income from fees and commissions rose 69 percent to
99.6 million riyals. Financing income increased 7.2 percent to
490.4 million riyals.  Qatar’s banks boosted lending as the country raised
spending on infrastructure including a new airport, seaport,
roads and rail systems. The nation’s total credit facilities,
including loans, rose an annual 31 percent in February while
deposits were up 5.5 percent, according to central bank data.  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , Qatar’s biggest lender, posted a
17 percent gain in first-quarter profit, meeting analysts’
estimates, on increased lending and foreign-exchange gains.  Qatar’s Sharia-compliant lenders face reduced competition
this year after the central bank ordered commercial lenders to
close Islamic banking arms last year. Qatar Islamic acquired
closely-held International Bank of Qatar’s Islamic banking
portfolio in December.  Qatar Islamic’s earnings per share rose to 1.65 riyals from
1.45 a year earlier, the bank said. Assets rose 18 percent to
49.8 billion riyals and customer deposits gained 17 percent to
29.9 billion riyals.  Qatar Islamic shares  fell 0.5 percent to 77 riyals on the
Qatar Exchange today before the results were released. The
shares declined 8.7 percent this year compared with a 0.2
percent drop for the  QE Index. (DSM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
