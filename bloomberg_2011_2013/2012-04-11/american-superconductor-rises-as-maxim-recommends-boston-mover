American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
maker of wind turbine and power-grid electronics, rose the most
in more than two months after an analyst at Maxim Group LLC
recommended buying the shares.  The stock rose 14 percent to $4.22 at the close in New
York, the biggest increase since Jan. 18. Devens, Massachusetts-
based American Superconductor has one buy, eight hold and three
sell ratings from analysts. The shares have declined 68 percent
in the past year.  Rising use of variable electricity sources such as wind and
solar will boost demand for American Superconductor’s voltage
regulators and a potential settlement over a dispute with a
former customer, Chinese turbine maker Sinovel Wind Group Co.,
may provide a “surprising lifeline,” according to Aaron Chew,
an analyst at Maxim in  New York .  “With the intermittency of renewable energy causing sudden
voltage changes, utilities are likely to increase spending on
grid management,” Chew said in a note to clients after the
close of trading yesterday. “With estimates reset and sentiment
at a trough, positive surprise can drive up the stock
materially.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
