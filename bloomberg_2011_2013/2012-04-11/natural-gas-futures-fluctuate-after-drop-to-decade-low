Natural gas futures in  New York 
dropped below $2 per million British thermal units for the first
time in a decade on a growing supply glut caused by mild weather
and record production.  Gas is down 33 percent this year, making it the worst
performer on the Standard & Poor’s  GSCI (SPGSCI)  commodity index. U.S.
stockpiles last month were at an all-time high for the season
after the lower 48 states experienced the warmest March on
record. Production has climbed, driven by gains at shale
formations from  Texas  to Pennsylvania.  “The bulls continue to make a stand at every support level
but there’s no fundamental reason to be long right now,” said
 Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at PFGBest Research in
 Chicago .  Natural gas for May delivery declined 3 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.001 per million British thermal units at 1:35
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after sliding to
$1.999, the lowest intraday price since Jan. 29, 2002.  More than 15,000 temperature records were broken in the
continental U.S. last month, according to  the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration . Temperatures averaged 51.1
degrees Fahrenheit (10.6 Celsius), 8.6 degrees above the 20th
century average, the warmest March in data going back to 1895.  Temperatures during the heating season from October through
March were 3.8 degrees above average, making it the second-
warmest for the period on record after 1999-2000, government
agency said.  Heating Demand  U.S. heating demand this winter was 18 percent below normal
through April 7, according to Weather Derivatives in Belton,
 Missouri . About 51 percent of U.S. households use gas for
heating. Fuel consumption  typically slumps  after the winter
heating season ends and before hot weather drives demand from
power plants to run air conditioners.  U.S. stockpiles  totaled 2.479 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended March 30, a high for that time of the year, according
to the Energy Department. A  surplus  of the fuel to the five-year
average widened to 61 percent, the most in six years, from 59
percent the previous week.  Supplies may reach a record 3.851 trillion cubic feet by
the end of October, the department said yesterday in its monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook .  U.S. gas output increased by 0.8 percent in January to
83.17 billion cubic feet a day from the previous month, led by
gains in the Marcellus shale in  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio , the
Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration said in
its monthly  EIA-914 report  on March 29. Production in 2011 was a
record 28.6 trillion cubic feet.  Gas Output  Production in the lower 48 states rose every month but one
from July through January as drillers shifted operations to more
profitable liquid-rich shale deposits. Gas output in the region
increased 0.5 percent in January to 72.85 billion cubic feet,
department data show.  The  number of rigs  drilling for gas fell 11 to 647 last
week, the lowest level since May 2002, according to Baker Hughes
Inc. The  oil-rig count  gained 11 to 1,329, representing 67
percent of the total, according to the Houston-based oil-
services company.  The Energy Department cut its 2012 forecast for spot gas
prices at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , by 66 cents, or 21
percent, to an average of $2.51 per million Btu from last
month’s estimate. The spot price at the hub, the delivery point
for Nymex futures, averaged $4 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
