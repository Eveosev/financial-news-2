The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 7 basis points to
162 basis points as of 10:04 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The benchmark is set for its highest close
since Jan. 20, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 5 basis points to 172.5 as of
8:07 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The measure is on course for its highest close since Feb.
1, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 3.5 basis points to
172 basis points as of 9:05 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The gauge is poised for its highest close since
Jan. 23, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
