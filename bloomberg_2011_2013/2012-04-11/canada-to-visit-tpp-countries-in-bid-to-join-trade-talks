Canada ’s Trade Minister Ed Fast
will visit the nine nations negotiating the Pacific trade accord
to garner support for its bid to join the talks.  Canada “brings a high level of ambition to the negotiating
table and will be a valuable asset” to the Trans-Pacific
Partnership negotiations, Fast said at a news conference in
Lima.  Already participating are the U.S., Australia, Chile, Peru
and Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, Vietnam and Brunei. Those
nations would need to reach consensus on any new members joining
the talks. Peru supports for Canada’s participation in the
talks, said Fast, who was accompanied by Peruvian Trade Minister
Jose Silva. Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei support Canada taking
part, Fast said in a Feb. 17 interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
