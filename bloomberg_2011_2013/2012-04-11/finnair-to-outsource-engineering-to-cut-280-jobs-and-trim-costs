Finnair Oyj (FIA1S) , Finland’s biggest
airline, said it plans to cut 280 jobs and outsource engineering
operations to trim costs.  SR Technics, based in Zurich, will provide engine and
component services as the carrier plans to close its own
engineering works, Vantaa, Finland-based Finnair said in a
statement today. Cost savings will be “significant,” Finnair
said, without giving details.  Finnair is targeting 140 million euros ($183 million) of
cost cuts by 2014 as pressure from low-cost airlines squeezes
profit. The carrier has established more routes to Asia to tap
the growing business travel from the  emerging markets .  Line maintenance, which “forms the core of aircrafts’
airworthiness” and employs 550 people, remains an “integral”
part of the company’s operations, Finnair said.  The stock  was
unchanged as 2.27 euros at 11:09 a.m. in Helsinki, giving the
airline a valuation of 291 million euros.  Finnish trade union Pro, which represents managerial
employees in the engineering unit, will hold a press conference
at 2 p.m. in Helsinki on the cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
