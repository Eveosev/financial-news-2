Saudi Arabia ’s gross domestic
product expanded 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier on additional  government spending  and higher oil prices.  The government sector grew by 3.6 percent and the private
sector by 9.9 percent, the  Central Department of Statistics and
Information  in Riyadh said on its website today. The oil
industry expanded by 6.1 percent.  Saudi Arabia’s economy benefited last year from a 23
percent increase in government spending as the kingdom’s rulers
sought to create jobs and build houses in order to avert the
kind of popular uprising that swept other Middle Eastern
countries.  The government’s allocation of an additional 224 billion
riyals ($60 billion) was backed by  oil prices  that averaged $95
a barrel last year, up from $80 in 2010. The economy’s 6.8
percent full-year growth in 2011 was the fastest in eight years.
Growth will probably slow to 3.8 percent this year on lower oil
output, according to the median estimate of 13 economists
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
