Spanish  industrial production 
declined by the most in three months in February as the economy
sank into its second recession since 2009 and Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  stepped up austerity efforts.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days fell 5.1 percent from a year earlier, the
National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said today in an e-
mailed statement. That compares with a revised decline of 4.3
percent in January.  Rajoy’s government presented the deepest budget cuts in
more than three decades on March 30 even as it forecasts an
economic contraction of 1.7 percent this year.  Spain ’s  10-year
borrowing costs  surged to more than 6 percent today, the highest
since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
