Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  may face strikes
at its four biggest subsidiaries as worker representatives
demand more vacation and shorter working hours to bring them
into line with staff at the lenderâ€™s Postbank unit,  Welt said ,
citing Stephan Szukalski of the DBV financial services union.  Postbank staff work 39 hours a week and are entitled to 30
days vacation, while workers at the  Deutsche Bank (DBK)  subsidiaries
have a 42-hour week and can take just 27 days off, the newspaper
said. The DBV canceled the industrywide wage agreement at the
end of March, Welt said.  Negotiations on behalf of the 4,000 to 5,000 workers will
begin next month, Welt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
