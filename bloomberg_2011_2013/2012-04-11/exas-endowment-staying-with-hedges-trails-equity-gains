Texas (STOTX1) ’s public university endowment
increased 5.1 percent this year through February, according to
the University of Texas Investment Management Co., trailing the
benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities.  The endowment, the second-largest in the U.S., rose to
$20.1 billion, the management company known as Utimco reported
at a meeting today in Austin. Utimco said total assets under
management, including operating funds, climbed to $27.3 billion.  “Some markets have done better than others,” said  Bruce Zimmerman , Utimco’s chief executive officer and head of
investing. “We continue to have confidence in our diversified
portfolio.”  In 2011, Utimco allocated more capital to real estate,
natural resources and  hedge funds  to guard against slumping
equities. The endowment put $1 billion into gold bullion to
insure against inflation and declines in other asset classes.
Gold futures gained 6.9 percent this year through February,
while the  S&P 500   rose  9 percent, with reinvested dividends.  “There’s a cost to buying insurance,” Zimmerman said in
an interview at the meeting. “If nothing bad happens, then
you’re simply out your premium. And that’s been the case over
the last six months.”  “We haven’t seen severe negative events, and that’s OK
because the rest of our portfolio is performing as expected,”
Zimmerman said. “Because we remain concerned about the
potential for severe negative events,” Utimco is sticking with
its diversification strategy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
