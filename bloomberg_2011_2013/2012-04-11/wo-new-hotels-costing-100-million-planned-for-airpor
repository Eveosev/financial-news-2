Sonnenblick Development LLC , which
helped develop Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, will spend $100
million on two hotels at  California ’s Sacramento International
Airport, the site’s first new lodging properties in 30 years.  The Los Angeles-based company won the contract to build the
hotels, to be attached to the airport’s new Terminal B,
according to Robert Sonnenblick, the company’s principal.
Construction of a 225-room full-service hotel and a 150-room
limited-service property will start in mid-2013, with an opening
planned for the first quarter of 2015, he said.  Hotel development has been stagnant in California and
across the U.S. because construction financing has been
difficult to obtain, according to Sonnenblick. The Sacramento
airport’s only hotel, a 150-room property from the mid-1970s,
was demolished to make room for the new terminal, he said.  “An airport of this size can support several hotels but
currently has none,” Sonnenblick said. “We see this as a
specific opportunity that provides us with a monopoly in the
foreseeable future.”  Sonnenblick’s company will begin interviewing potential
hotel operators for the airport properties this month, he said.
The contract to build the hotels is with Sacramento County,
which is leasing the land to Sonnenblick Development.  The firm has spent $100 million over the past two years to
buy seven parcels on the U.S. coasts, in locations it hasn’t
disclosed, for  luxury resorts .  To contact the reporter on this story:
