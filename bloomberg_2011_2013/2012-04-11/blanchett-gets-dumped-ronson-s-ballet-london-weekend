Amadou & Mariam have taken three
decades to become two of the hottest names in world music.  The blind husband-and-wife duo from Mali -- who have
performed alongside  Stevie Wonder  and U2 -- are in  London  to
play tracks from their sunny Afro-pop album “Folila,” released
this week. The Friday show features Ebony Bones, a guest on the
new CD.  April 13 at O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire, Shepherd’s Bush
Green, W12 8TT. Information:  http://www.amadou-mariam.com/ ,

was born 170 years before him.  The 17th-century painter Claude Gellee, known as Le
Lorrain, is said to have made Turner weep with a pair of scenes
inspired by  Rome . They open the  National Gallery ’s show,
“Turner Inspired: In the Light of Claude” (through June 5).  The views aren’t exactly true to life: Peek through the
trees in one of the Claude oils, and you’ll see the Pantheon,
perched on a verdant hilltop.  Turner produced a sketch of one of the paintings that’s in
the show. He soon went beyond emulation to produce hazy pictures
that made him a master in his own right.  Information:  http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk  or +44-20-
7747-2885.  Also this weekend, you can view one of art history’s best-
known pictures at  Sotheby’s (BID) : Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” (1895),
one of four versions by the Norwegian artist, is on view through
Sunday. The pastel-on-board, set to be auctioned on May 2 in  New
York , carries an estimate of at least $80 million.  Through April 18 at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New  Bond Street , W1.

service as a street sweeper in New York.  The singer is currently on stage at the Royal Opera House -
- belting “I Want Somebody to Love Me” in a band featuring
 Mark Ronson  on bass -- while the Royal Ballet performs Wayne
McGregor’s energizing work, “Carbon Life.”  There are plenty of other surprises in the triple bill. A
prostitute gets knifed by her lover in Liam Scarlett’s “Sweet
Violets” (based on a real-life killing in Jack the Ripper’s
day), and a model (principal Marianela Nunez) strips to the
waist to beguile a famous artist in his studio.  “Polyphonia,” “Sweet Violets” and “Carbon Life” end
their run on April 23. Information:  http://www.roh.org.uk  or
+44-20-7304-4000.  The 10 Cases, a short walk from the opera house, is a
British bistro with a menu that changes daily and a wine list
that showcases 10 whites and 10 reds. Information:

husband walks out.  The Oscar-winning Australian actress is Lotte Kotta in
Botho Strauss’s “Big and Small,” one of the headline
productions in London’s Olympic-year cultural lineup. She’s
vacationing in  Morocco  when her spouse suddenly absconds.
Lotte’s quest for human connection becomes more and more
desperate and surreal as the play proceeds.  “Big and Small” ends April 29; the Sunday matinee
performance is at 4 p.m. Information:

Centre, serving real ale and British food from a kitchen that
features a spit rotisserie and a charcoal grill. Information:
