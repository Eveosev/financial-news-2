(Corrects amount to 2,500 euros from 1,500 euros in second
paragraph.)  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said
the Spanish government will implement a series of measures to
fight tax fraud at a Cabinet meeting on April 13 including
limits on the use of cash.  Transactions of more than 2,500 euros that “involve at
least one professional entrepreneur” won’t be allowed to be
made in cash, Rajoy told Parliament today in the weekly
question-and-answer session. Fines of 25 percent of the
transaction amount will be handed to those breaking the rule, he
said.  The government chose to implement an amnesty on tax
evaders, which it expects will raise 2.5 billion euros, as it
wanted to avoid increasing taxes, Rajoy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
