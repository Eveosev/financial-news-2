Chile’s peso rebounded from the
biggest drop in more than a month as reduced concern about the
outlook for  Europe ’s debt crisis spurred demand for emerging-
market currencies.  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 486.88 per  U.S. dollar  after
falling 0.8 percent yesterday. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin
American Currency Index  gained  0.2 percent.  Investors sought out higher yielding assets after a
surprise profit from Alcoa Inc. opened the U.S. earnings season
and yields on Spanish  government bonds  fell, bolstering the
outlook for global economic growth. The peso yesterday declined
the most in five weeks after copper fell through $3.70 a pound
on data showing  China ’s imports rose less than forecast.  “The market is a bit more optimistic,” said Andres de la
Cerda, a money-markets trader at Bice Inversiones in Santiago.
“There’s not much local data but everything’s appreciating
against the dollar. European markets have improved.”  European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure
suggested the bank could start buying Spanish bonds to control
the country’s borrowing costs.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had
a $6.4 billion bet against the currency on April 9. Local
investors had a $15.7 billion long peso position, down from
$17.5 billion at the end of March.  The reduction in the long peso forwards position may
reflect that pension funds have reduced exposure to foreign
assets. Pension funds increased holdings of foreign equities for
a third straight month in March. At the same time they reduced
holdings of Chilean fixed-income securities to 45.6 percent of
total assets, the lowest since March.  Bond Sale  Chile’s government sold $314 million of fixed-rate and
inflation-linked bonds due in 10 and 20 years at an auction
managed by the central bank.  The government sold 45 billion pesos of 10-year fixed-rate
bonds at a yield of 5.9 percent, a discount of seven basis
points from the 5.83 percent yield on bonds yesterday, and 21.3
billion pesos of 20-year fixed-rate bonds at 6 percent. It sold
$111 million of 10-year inflation-linked bonds at 2.63 percent
and $66 million of 20-year inflation bonds at 2.83 percent.  Pension funds and insurers bought 97 percent of the 20-year
fixed-rate bonds and 72 percent of the inflation-linked 20-year
bonds.  The ratio of orders to bonds sold was higher in the fixed-
rate bonds. The bid-to-cover ratio on the 20-year fixed rate
bonds was three while on the 20-year inflation bonds it was 1.6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
