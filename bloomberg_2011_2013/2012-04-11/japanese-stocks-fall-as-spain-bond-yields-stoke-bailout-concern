     April 11 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell a seventh day,
with the Nikkei 225 Stock Average extending its longest losing
streak since 2009, after Spanish bond yields surged to levels
that prompted other euro members to seek bailouts. Sony Corp.
plunged after posting a record loss.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets almost a fifth of
its sales in  Europe , dropped 2.2 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306)  paced losses among banking shares on
concern Europe’s crisis will further damage the global financial
system. Sony plunged 4.5 percent after its loss was twice as big
as forecast on a writedown of deferred tax assets.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 percent to 9,458.74 as of 3:12 p.m.
in  Tokyo , with almost eight stocks falling for each that rose.
The broader Topix Index dropped 0.9 percent to 805.84, with
about three shares rising for each that fell.  “The current situation is quite similiar to 2009,” said
Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer at Tokyo-based Myojo
Asset Management  Japan  Co., describing a period when investors
were unsure of the rebound. “Once the market bottoms, those
investors will rush to the market, trying not to miss the rally
as they did after 2009’s losing streak.”  The Topix gained about 11 percent this year on optimism the
 Bank of Japan  will introduce more measures to spur growth after
boosting its asset-purchase program in February and that
reconstruction after last year’s disasters will escalate.  All of the gauge’s  33 industry groups  declined. Stocks
extended losses from yesterday when the Bank of Japan refrained
from adding more stimulus, driving the yen higher.  2009 Slump  The last time the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  experienced a losing streak in
excess of six days was in July 2009, when it fell 9.1 percent
over nine days. That drop coincided with a strengthening yen and
a period of political uncertainty ahead of elections that saw
the country’s  Liberal Democratic Party  lose its grip on power
after a half century of almost unbroken rule.  The gauge has declined 6.4 percent since April 2 as renewed
concern about Europe’s debt crisis and warnings from the U.S.
Federal Reserve about continued weakness in the world’s largest
economy have undermined the global demand outlook. Japan’s
currency has surged 2.6 percent against the  U.S. dollar  this
month amid renewed demand for a safe haven, damping the earnings
outlook for exporters.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.4 percent
today. The gauge fell 1.7 percent in  New York  yesterday as
Spanish bonds slumped after Economy Minister Luis de Guindos
declined to rule out a rescue. The Bank of  Spain  said the
nation’s lenders may need extra capital if the economy weakens
more than expected.  ‘Difficult Situation’  Stocks linked to Europe slipped, with Mazda retreating 2.2
percent to 131 yen.  Shimano Inc. (7309) , a maker of bicycle parts that
generates 36 percent of its revenue in the region, lost 1.3
percent to 4,660 yen in  Osaka . Canon Inc., the camera maker that
counts Europe as its biggest market, dropped 0.4 percent to
3,735 yen.  “Tougher austerity measures are taking a toll on the
Spanish economy,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s
third-largest bank by market value. “We don’t see  risk aversion 
coming to a halt, and circumstances are getting chaotic. The
markets are calling for policy action.”  Financial stocks fell on concern the debt crisis would
spread. Mitsubishi UFJ slid 1 percent to 390 yen.  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (3604) , the nation’s biggest brokerage, fell 2.8 percent
to 342 yen.  Exporters, Yen  Exporters also fell as the yen rose against all of its 16
major counterparts yesterday, damping the outlook for Japanese
earnings abroad. The yen touched 80.62 against the dollar today,
the highest since March 7, while reaching 105.45 per euro, the
strongest since Feb. 22.  The value of the Nikkei 225 reached 11.8 times that of the
broader Topix on April 2, the highest since 2000. The ratio has
narrowed as investors shift to domestic-focused companies from
exporters on expectations the yen will rally.  Shares on the Topix are  valued  at 0.99 times book value,
compared with 1.36 times for the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, 2.21
times for the S&P 500 and 1.39 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. A number below one means that investors can buy companies
for less than the value of their assets.  Machinery makers rose after a report showed today Japan’s
orders in the sector unexpectedly climbed in February. Fanuc
Corp., the world’s biggest maker of controls for machinery tools,
gained 1.9 percent to 14,220 yen. Okuma Corp. added 1.1 percent
to 632 yen.  Sony’s Record Loss  Sony (6758)  dropped 4.5 percent to 1,515 yen after yesterday
reporting a record loss of 520 billion yen ($6.4 billion) for
the year ended March 31. Earnings were hurt by plans to take a
300 billion yen charge to writedown assets as well as falling
global TV shipments.  Sharp Corp. (6753) , Japan’s largest maker of
liquid-crystal displays, fell 3.2 percent to 513 yen after
reporting a record full-year loss of  380 billion yen .  Among stocks that rose, Chiyoda Co. gained 7.4 percent to
1,738 yen. The specialty retailer said net income surged to 4.84
billion yen in the year ended Feb. 29 from 1.05 billion yen a
year earlier, citing cost cuts and streamlining of unprofitable
stores. The company forecast profit will rise 19 percent to 5.78
billion yen this fiscal year.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  advanced 6.4 percent to
21.15, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.1 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume was 14
percent above the 10-day average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
