Wireless carriers agreed to disable
stolen smartphones after pressure from U.S. regulators and a
police chief who told the industry “shame on you” for not
helping to stem a spike in violent robberies.  “I think I have to take that back,”  Cathy Lanier , the
 Washington  chief whose remarks were broadcast on March 22, said
yesterday. “Today I say to the cell carriers, ‘Thank you.’ ”  Lanier spoke at a Washington press conference where five
U.S. police chiefs, a trade group leader and the Federal
Communications Commission chairman announced the accord to deter
theft by disabling stolen mobile gear, making it worthless.  Within six months carriers are to create a national
database so companies can lock out phones, tablet computers and
other stolen devices, according a summary distributed by the
FCC. Carriers are to urge consumers to lock phones with
passwords. The FCC said it will consider writing rules if the
companies fall behind schedule.  In recent months wireless industry leaders heard calls from
Congress, police and regulators for a solution to a robbery
issue characterized by the FCC as a “growing epidemic.” Device
thefts have soared to account for more than 40 percent of
robberies in  New York City , according to the agency.  “We made sure that they saw the statistics, that they
understood how important this was to the police chiefs,” FCC
Chairman  Julius Genachowski  said in an interview. “And to their
credit they said, ‘You know what? You’re right. This is a
priority, we’re going to get it done.’ ”  Participate, or Not  Negotiations spilled over into the past weekend against a
deadline set by the FCC to make an announcement about stolen
phones, Josh Gottheimer, an adviser to the FCC chairman, said in
an interview.  The FCC had said it would stage an event alongside police
officers, Chris Guttman-McCabe, vice president of regulatory
affairs for CTIA-The Wireless Association, a Washington-based
trade group for wireless carriers and equipment makers, said in
an interview.  “They were going to hold an event, and we wanted it to be
a positive event,” Guttman-McCabe said.  Mobile providers taking part in the agreement -- leading
U.S. carrier  Verizon Wireless , No. 2  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S)  and T-Mobile USA Inc. -- cover 90 percent of U.S.
subscribers, the FCC said.  Goodwill at FCC  Wireless carriers “began to get political pressure for
this,” Jeffrey Silva, a Washington-based analyst for Medley
Global Advisors LLC, said in an interview. “They would much
prefer to have industry policing itself.”  Carriers need more airwaves, or spectrum, to meet expanding
wireless demand, Silva said.  “Maybe this will earn them some goodwill at the FCC, where
they all have important pending items, and making spectrum
available is top on that list,” Silva said.  Lanier, the Washington police chief, said “shame on you!”
to the industry during  a segment  that appeared on NBC’s
“Today”  show , describing violent robberies.  “They’ve stepped up,” Lanier said in the interview
yesterday, “so I felt that they deserved for me to take that
back.”  Lanier said yesterday the issue hadn’t been explained “in
the terms that I was trying to explain it: a woman pushing a
baby stroller having her jaw broken for her phone.”  ‘Point of Gun’  Senator  Charles Schumer , a  New York  Democrat, wrote to the
FCC’s Genachowski and to chief executives of AT&T, T-Mobile and
Sprint in August asking for steps to reduce theft. Senator
Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, in a March 23 letter to
the CTIA president, Steve Largent, urged action and in March New
York Democratic Representative Eliot Engel filed a bill to
require service cutoffs for stolen phones.  In a February resolution the Major Cities Chiefs
Association asked the FCC to require carriers to use a database
and deactivation network. The group represents police chiefs in
the 50 largest U.S. cities including New York, Philadelphia,
 Chicago  and  Los Angeles .  “These devices are being taken point of gun, they’re being
taken after serious assaults,” Charles Ramsey, head of
Philadelphia’s police and president of the Major Cities Chiefs
Association, said at yesterday’s announcement. Ramsey likened
the surge to assaults and robberies a decade ago over  Nike
Inc. (NKE) ’s Air Jordan athletic shoes.  Verizon, AT&T  Verizon Wireless doesn’t allow devices reported as stolen
to be activated on its network, Kathleen Grillo, senior vice
president, federal regulatory relations, said in an e-mailed
statement. The company, based in Basking Ridge,  New Jersey , is
owned by  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)  It
supports the initiative announced yesterday, Grillo said.  AT&T was “pleased” to join the announcement, Jim Bugel,
assistant vice president, public safety and homeland security,
said in a  blog posting .  Third-largest U.S. carrier Sprint cuts off phones that its
customers report as stolen and supports the initiative announced
yesterday, Vonya McCann, senior vice president of government
affairs for the company based in Overland Park,  Kansas , said in
a statement yesterday.  T-Mobile, the  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  unit based in Bellevue,
Washington, suspends service to accounts of phones reported as
stolen, Kathleen Ham, vice president of federal regulatory
affairs, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
