The 12-month target price for  OAO
Gazprom’s (OGZD)  London-listed depositary receipts was cut to $15.30
from $17 by ING Groep NV on speculation the Russian government
may link the company’s mineral extraction tax rate to natural
gas prices.  ING maintained its recommendation that investors buy the
shares, Igor Kurinnyy, a London-based analyst at the bank, said
in an e-mailed report dated April 10.  “We maintain our ‘buy’ rating as we think this risk is
already reflected in the share price,” Kurinnyy said in the
report. “Risks of tax hikes weaken the investment case for
Gazprom. While it is almost certain that the tax load on Gazprom
will continue to rise, the extent and timing of tax hikes has
yet to be decided.”  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in Moscow the
mineral extraction tax rate for Gazprom may be decided this
week, RIA Novosti reported on April 6. The government intends to
raise the tax from 2013, RIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
