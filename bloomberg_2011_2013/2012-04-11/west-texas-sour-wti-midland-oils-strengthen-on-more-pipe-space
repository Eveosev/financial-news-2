The discount for West  Texas  Sour
and West Texas Intermediate oil priced in Midland, Texas,
narrowed against the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing,  Oklahoma .  The grades have both strengthened the past two days after
 Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL)  said last week it would begin
deliveries on a pipeline system that transports crude from West
Texas to Houston.  The system begins in Colorado City, Texas, and extends
about 460 miles (740 kilometers) southeast to Goodrich, Texas,
where it intersects the southern portion of the company’s
Kilgore line, which carries the oil south to Houston.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount narrowed $1.50 to $7 below WTI
at 12:11 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. West Texas Intermediate at Midland also strengthened
$1.50 to a $7 discount.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium narrowed 85 cents to $20.25
a barrel over WTI.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  decreased $1.25 to a
premium of $21 a barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s premium narrowed $2.20 to $16 a barrel over
WTI, and  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  lost 85 cents to a premium of $13.
Poseidon’s premium narrowed 95 cents to $11.75, while Southern
Green Canyon’s lost $1.40 to $12.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount narrowed $1.40 to $19.50 a
barrel, Bakken oil’s narrowed $2 to $9 and Syncrude’s narrowed
10 cents to $2.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
