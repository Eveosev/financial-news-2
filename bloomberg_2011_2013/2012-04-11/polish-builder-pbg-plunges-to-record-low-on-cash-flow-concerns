PBG SA (PBG)  tumbled to an all-time low
after Poland’s third-largest construction company warned of
negative operating cash flow expectations in the second quarter.  The shares dropped as much as 7.2 percent to 31 zloty, the
lowest since 2004 when the builder listed on the  Warsaw Stock
Exchange , and traded 4.4 percent lower at 1:18 p.m.  PBG expects to see negative operating cash flow this
quarter due to delays in payments related to road contracts, the
company’s chief financial officer, Przemyslaw Szkudlarczyk, said
in a phone interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
