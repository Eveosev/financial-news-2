A U.S. investigation of the fatal
shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin will be “thorough
and independent,” said U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.  The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  is working with
authorities in Florida to probe the shooting, Holder said today
in Washington. The  Justice Department  is looking into whether
there were civil rights violations in the Feb. 26 shooting of
Martin, 17, in Sanford, Florida.  The shooting has prompted rallies around the country, and
civil rights activists including Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton
have called for the arrest of the shooter, George Zimmerman,
whose mother is Hispanic and father is white. Zimmerman, a
neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, told police he shot the
unarmed teenager in self-defense.  “In this investigation, and in all cases, we will examine
the facts and the law,” Holder said. “If we find evidence of a
potential federal criminal civil rights crime, we will take
appropriate action. And, at every step, the facts and the law
will guide us forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
