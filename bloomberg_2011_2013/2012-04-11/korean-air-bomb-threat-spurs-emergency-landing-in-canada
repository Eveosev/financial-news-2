A  Korean Air Lines Co. (003490)  aircraft
with 147 people onboard made an emergency landing in Canada
following a bomb threat.  The  Boeing Co. (BA)  777 touched down yesterday afternoon local
time at the Comox military airbase, about 70 miles northeast of
Vancouver, the Seoul-based carrier said in a statement. The plane
was escorted by U.S. fighters, Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said 
on its website, citing Victoriaâ€™s Search and Rescue Coordination 
Centre.  Flight KE 72 left Vancouver headed for Seoul at 2:35 p.m.,
the carrier said. About 25 minutes later, its U.S. call center
received a threat that explosives were onboard, it said.  The people onboard included 134 passengers and 13 crew. The
carrier said it will hold talks with authorities before deciding
what steps to take next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
