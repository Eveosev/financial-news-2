China ’s  finance ministry  sold
seven-year bonds at a lower yield than traders forecast on
speculation demand for the debt will rise as the supply of cash
increases.  The ministry issued at least 30 billion yuan ($4.8 billion)
of securities at an average yield of 3.39 percent, according to
a trader at a  finance company  that participates in the auctions.
That compared with the 3.41 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Shanghai interbank offered  rate  that
banks charge each other for three-month loans has fallen 63
basis points, or 0.63 percentage point, this year to 4.84
percent, the lowest level since June 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The improving liquidity is helping increase banks’ demand
for  government bonds ,” said Liu Junyu, a Shenzhen-based bond
analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest
lender.  The highest winning-bid yield at the sale was 3.42 percent
and the auction drew orders for 1.95 times the amount offered,
according to the trader. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.14 times
at the last sale of similar-maturity notes on March 7.  In December, the finance ministry published a list of 55
underwriters required to bid at its debt sales, including
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,
China Citic Bank Corp., Postal Savings Bank of China, Industrial
Bank Co., Guotai Junan Securities Co. and BOC International
