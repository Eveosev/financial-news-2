New York University  has reduced a
plan to expand its campus by about 377,000 square feet of space,
or 19 percent, in a deal struck by Scott Stringer, the  Manhattan 
borough president.  Stringer is supporting approval of the project in the
historic Greenwich Village section of Manhattan, he said in a
statement posted on his  website  today.  NYU, the largest private, nonprofit university in the U.S.
by enrollment, is looking to expand by building new academic
facilities, student and faculty housing and retail space in time
for its  200th anniversary in 2031 . Officials from the school,
neighborhood and Stringer’s community task force have held more
than 50 meetings in five years on the issue.  “This is a good and important step, and a recognition that
universities need to grow to maintain excellence and that strong
universities are important to keeping our city strong,” NYU
President John Sexton said in the statement. The agreement
“will enable NYU to meet the long-term academic space needs of
its faculty and students while being sensitive to the concerns
of our surrounding community.”  Alumni of NYU, founded in 1831, include former Federal
Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  and Rudolph Giuliani, the former
New York City mayor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
