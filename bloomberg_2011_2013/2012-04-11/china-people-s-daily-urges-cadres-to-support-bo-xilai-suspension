The Chinese Communist Party’s
official People’s Daily urged cadres support the decision to
suspend Bo Xilai from his senior party posts after his wife’s
arrest on suspicion of murdering a British citizen.  Bo, the former top official in the municipality of
Chongqing, was suspended from the Politburo and  Central
Committee , the official Xinhua News Agency reported late
yesterday.  The central committee’s decision to investigate Bo is
“completely in accordance with our Party’s fundamental
requirement of strict Party governance” and shows the Party’s
“firm determination of maintaining its own purity,” according
to the front page  article  by an unidentified editorial writer at
the newspaper. “Bo has seriously violated Party discipline,
causing damage to the cause and the image of the Party and
state.”  Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, and a domestic helper, Zhang Xiaojun,
are “highly suspected” of killing British businessman Neil
Heywood, who died in Chongqing in November, according to Xinhua.
They have been transferred to judicial authorities on suspicion
of intentional homicide, Xinhua said.  Today’s editorial said that the decision “highlights the
Party and the government’s apparent attitude of firmly
maintaining discipline and laws” that will “certainly get the
wholehearted support from the whole party and all of the
nation’s people.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
