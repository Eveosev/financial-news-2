A Brazilian federal judge denied a
request from a prosecutor seeking to ban  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and
 Transocean Ltd (RIG) . from operating in the country after two oil
spills.  Prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira sought to halt
Chevron and Transocean’s operations in  Brazil  as part of a 20
billion reais ($11 billion) lawsuit for environmental damage
after an oil spill last month at its Frade field, according to
an e-mailed statement from the court today.  The legal action against Chevron comes as Brazil increases
scrutiny of offshore oil production following the 2010 Macondo
spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Chevron is also battling a
separate lawsuit by the country’s main oil union to ban it and
Transocean from operating in the country.  “Chevron Brasil is confident that at all times it acted
diligently and appropriately, and in accordance with the best
practices in the oil industry,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement.  The decision refers to the second lawsuit targeting  San
Ramon , California-based Chevron and Transocean for oil spills in
Brazil. Prosecutors filed the first lawsuit, also seeking 20
billion reais in damages, in November last year after a 3,000-
barrel spill that same month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
