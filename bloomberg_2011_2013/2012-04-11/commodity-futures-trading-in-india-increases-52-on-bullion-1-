Commodity futures trading in  India ,
the world’s biggest gold and sugar user, surged 52 percent in
value to a record last year, driven by bullion and farm goods.  The value of commodities traded on bourses, including the
 Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. , advanced to 181.3
trillion rupees ($3.5 trillion) in the year ended March 31 from
119.5 trillion rupees a year earlier, the Forward Markets
Commission, the industry regulator, said on its  website  today.  Bullion worth 101.8 trillion rupees was traded last year,
85 percent more than a year earlier, as gold futures in India
rallied to a record in December, data from the regulator showed.
Trading in farm commodities gained 51 percent, while the value
of trade in crude oil, natural gas and other energy products
climbed 23 percent, it said.  “It’s more of a price jump, rather than a participation
increase,” said  Kishore Narne , head of research at Anand Rathi
Commodities Ltd., in Mumbai.  Commodity futures trading volumes may decline this year
after the regulator banned some contracts and increased margins,
Narne said.  The market regulator this month barred exchanges from
offering new contracts in soybeans, while raising margins on
trading in mustard seeds, gram and potatoes to curb speculation.  Domestic traders, producers and consuming companies are the
main participants in India’s 21 exchanges. Overseas funds aren’t
allowed to buy and sell commodity futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
