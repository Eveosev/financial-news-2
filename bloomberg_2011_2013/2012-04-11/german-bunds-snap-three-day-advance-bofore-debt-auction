Italian bonds rose, pushing 10-year
yields down from the highest level in almost eight weeks, amid
optimism the nation will attract sufficient demand as it
prepares to auction bills today and sells bonds tomorrow.  German 10-year bonds dropped for the first time in four
days before the nation offers debt maturing in July 2022 today.
Spanish debt outperformed bunds as Prime MinisterMariano Rajoy
prepared to address lawmakers of his  People’s Party  to explain
the deepest budget cuts in three decades.  Spain ’s 10-year yields
have jumped more than 50 basis points this month as the nation’s
borrowing costs increased at an auction on April 4.  “Italian banks have got access to lots of liquidity,”
said  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income research at HSBC
Holdings Plc in London. “They can lever up and generate very
high returns so Italian banks buy the short paper. I don’t think
you’ll see a result like the Spanish auction,” he said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown” with  Mark Barton  and  David Tweed .  Italy’s 10-year yield dropped 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage points, to 5.56 percent at 10:01 a.m.  London  time.
The 5 percent bond due in March 2022 rose 0.88, or 8.80 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,312) face amount, to 96.32.  The yield on  Germany ’s 2 percent bond maturing in January
2022 climbed three basis points to 1.67 percent. Benchmark 10-
year yields dropped to a record 0.636 percent on Sept. 23.  German Sale  Germany will sell as much as 5 billion euros of the new 10-
year benchmark securities. The lowest yield on record for a 10-
year  auction  was 1.8 percent at a sale on Sept. 21, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The German two-year yield climbed three basis points to
0.12 percent. The yield slid to 0.091 percent yesterday, the
lowest since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1990, after
a U.S. report on April 6 showed payrolls increased by the fewest
in five months.  “Yesterday’s trading encapsulates the reaction to the weak
U.S. jobs report and the deterioration in periphery market
sentiment,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The
main uncertainty this morning is on the supply side.”  Spain’s 10-year bond yield declined nine basis points to
5.89 percent after jumping 22 basis points yesterday.  German bunds returned 1.2 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French bonds gained 1.6 percent,
and Spanish securities lost 2.2 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
