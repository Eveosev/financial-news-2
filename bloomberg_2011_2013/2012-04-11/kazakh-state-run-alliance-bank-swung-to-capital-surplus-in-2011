State-run  Alliance (ASBN)  Bank, the first
Kazakh lender to default in 2009, said it rebuilt a capital
surplus last year and predicts profit will reach 2 billion tenge
($13.5 million) in 2012.  Alliance had a surplus of 1.32 billion tenge, the Almaty-
based lender said in a statement today, citing consolidated data
calculated in accordance with international financial reporting
standards. Its capital shortage was 105 billion tenge in 2010.  Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna holds the
government’s 67 percent stake in Alliance and 79.9 percent in
Temirbank after they were brought under state control in 2009.
The fund is discussing a merger of the two lenders, which issued
new bonds and offered shares and cash to creditors in 2010 after
writing off and extending payments on some of their debt.  Net income was 39.9 billion tenge in 2011, compared with
the 334 billion tenge it earned after undergoing a debt
restructuring in 2010, Alliance the bank said. The bank
forecasts profit of about 2 billion tenge this year, Chief
Executive Officer Maksat Kabashev told reporters in Almaty
today. Assets rose to 530 billion tenge from 428 billion tenge.  Bad Loans  Alliance plans to move as much as 50 billion tenge of bad
loans to a subsidiary it plans to create in May to manage
souring debt, Kabashev said. The transfer will help the lender
collect non-banking income and allow the release of 50 percent
of the provisions set aside to cover those loans, he said.  Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev yesterday told
government and central bank officials to stabilize Alliance and
BTA, two of the defaulted lenders brought under state control in
2009. While Alliance’s future was discussed, the situation there
is “quite normal,” central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko
said today. Talks on BTA were related to its second debt
restructuring, Marchenko said, without elaborating.  Alliance plans to resume negotiations on selling a stake of
as much as 25 percent to the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, depending on the bank’s capital surplus,
Kabashev said Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
