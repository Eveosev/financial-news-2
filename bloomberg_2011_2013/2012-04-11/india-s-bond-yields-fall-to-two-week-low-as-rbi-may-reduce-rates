India ’s 10-year bonds rose for a
third day, pushing yields to a two-week low, on speculation the
central bank will cut borrowing costs next week for the first
time in three years.  Ten of fifteen economists in a Bloomberg News survey
predict the repurchase rate will be cut 25 basis points to 8.25
percent at the  Reserve Bank  of India’s policy review on April
17. Three forecast no change while two forecast a reduction of
50 basis points. Data may show tomorrow that annual gains in
 factory output  slowed to 6.7 percent in February from 6.8
percent the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  “There is a possibility of a 25-basis-point cut in the
repo rate,” said Arvind Chari, a senior  fund manager  at Quantum
Asset Management Co. Pvt. in Mumbai. “Growth concerns probably
would have to be addressed.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.55 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
is the lowest since March 27.  The  Reserve Bank of India  boosted the  repurchase  rate 13
times between March 2010 and October 2011. Ten of the fifteen
economists in the Bloomberg survey predict the  cash reserve
ratio  will be left unchanged at 4.75 percent while the
remainder, including Morgan Stanley, forecast a reduction.  The reserve requirement may be cut by 75 to 100 basis
points even before the next policy review, Morgan Stanley
analysts Chetan Ahya and Upasana Chachra wrote in a note
yesterday. The RBI has lowered the  cash reserve ratio  by 125
basis points this year.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points to 7.99 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
