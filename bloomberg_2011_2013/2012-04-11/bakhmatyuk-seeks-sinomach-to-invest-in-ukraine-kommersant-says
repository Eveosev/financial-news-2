Ukrainian agriculture holding
company UkrLandFarming, owned by Oleg Bakhmatyuk, signed a
memorandum with Sinomach Automobile Co., a Chinese producer of
heavy machinery and equipment,  Kommersant-Ukraine  reported,
citing the company’s press office.  The memorandum envisages $4 billion in Chinese investments
into Ukraine’s agriculture industry as UkrLandFarming wants
Sinomach to be a strategical partner in constructing grain
terminals and upgrading sugar plants, the newspaper said.
UkrLandFarming doesn’t plan to sell a stake to Simonach.  Bakhmatyuk spokeswoman Larisa Millings could not
immediately tell how UkrLandFarming may form a strategical
partnership with Sinomach, when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
