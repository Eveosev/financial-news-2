Libya  plans to set up a free-trade
zone in Benghazi as it seeks to shift its economy away from
dependence on oil, government officials said.  The revived plan for Benghazi, the second-biggest city,
could help create more than 40,000 jobs and restore its status
as a trade hub, Rajab Khalil, undersecretary at the  Economy
Ministry , said in a televised press conference late yesterday.
 Economy Minister Ahmed El-Koushly said that Libya is trying to
target new sources of revenue and improve its business climate.  Libya’s transitional government is struggling to restore
Libya’s economy amid a deteriorating security situation and
inter-militia fighting after last year’s civil war that ended
with Muammar Qaddafi’s ouster and killing. While oil production
is almost back at pre-war levels, the country has yet to attract
significant foreign investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
