Grupo  Elektra (ELEKTRA*)  SA, the banking and
retail company controlled by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas ,
reported a first-quarter net loss as derivatives based on its
stock declined in value.  The net loss was 3.83 billion pesos ($292 million),
compared with net income of 622 million pesos a year earlier,
Mexico City-based Elektra said in a filing today. Sales rose 35
percent to 15.1 billion pesos on a surge in loans to small
businesses and pawn-shop customers.  A decrease in the value of an equity swap held by Elektra
cut 7.08 billion pesos from profit, the company said. The
company recorded the non-cash charge because it must value the
derivative instrument at the end of every quarter.  The instrument allows Elektra to bet on its stock price as
if it held the shares itself, and lost value as the shares fell
13 percent in the quarter. The decline came after a person
familiar with the matter said in January that  Mexico â€™s stock-
exchange operator, Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB, was looking
into ways to make more of the shares available for trading.  The stock had more than doubled in value last year, partly
because the other party in the derivative swap normally buys up
shares as a hedge, a process that would have made Elektra shares
scarce.  Leaving out the derivative charge, along with interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, profit rose 54 percent to
3.3 billion pesos, Elektra said.  Elektra rose 3.9 percent to 1,258.08 pesos at the close in
Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
