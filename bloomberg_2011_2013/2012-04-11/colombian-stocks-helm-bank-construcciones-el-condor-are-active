“advise in the analysis of business alternatives for its
investment” in the lender.  Oil producers rose following an increase in crude prices

makers may act to stem the spread of the region’s debt crisis.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , climbed 5.9
percent to 50,900 pesos.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE)  , the Calgary-based  oil
