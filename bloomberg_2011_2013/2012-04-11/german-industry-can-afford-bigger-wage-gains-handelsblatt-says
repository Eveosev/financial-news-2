German industrial companies can
afford wage increases that exceed raises set for the public
sector,  Handelsblatt  said, citing interviews with German
economists.  A raise of more than the 6.3 percent over two years won by
the Ver.di labor union for the public sector would be justified
because companies are benefiting from increasing demand from
emerging economies, the newspaper cited Ferdinand Fichtner,
economist at the Berlin-based DIW economic institute, as saying.  Higher wages would boost German domestic demand at a time
of subdued growth in  Europe , Gustav Horn, head of the labor
union-affiliated IMK institute, told the newspaper. Wage
increases wouldnâ€™t hurt German competitiveness, Horn said.  Growth would be restrained by a wage increase of 5 percent
in the economy as a whole, the newspaper cited economist Klaus Zimmermann of the Bonn-based IZA institute as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
