Baylor University was put on three
years probation because of recruiting violations by its men’s
and national champion women’s basketball teams.  The  National Collegiate Athletic Association  also suspended
men’s basketball coach Scott Drew for the first two  Big 12
Conference  games of the 2012-13 season for failing to monitor
his team.  The NCAA penalized Baylor after an investigation found
coaches made 528 phone calls and sent 738  text messages  to
recruits that weren’t permissible. The penalties were proposed
by Baylor and accepted by the NCAA infractions committee.  “The report identifies mistakes in our staff’s (proper)
recording of recruiting phone calls and sending inadvertent text
messages to individuals related to prospects,” Drew said
yesterday in a  statement  on the Baylor website. “Our program
has taken steps to correct these mistakes and we are grateful
that the NCAA has accepted those actions.”  The  men’s team  lost one scholarship, leaving it with 12 for
the next two academic years. Official recruiting visits were
reduced to seven from 12 for the 2012-13 academic year, with
recruiting evaluation days cut to 115 from 130.  Women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey, who led her team to a
40-0 record in winning the  national championship  this season,
was barred from off-campus recruiting in July.  The women’s team also lost two scholarships, leaving it
with 13 for the 2011-12 academic year. An assistant coach was
banned from making recruiting calls from January through the end
of this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
