Japan ’s zinc demand may increase
7.2 percent this year to a four-year high as the economy
recovers from an earthquake and tsunami and the weaker yen helps
boost exporters, the country’s largest smelter said.  Demand will rise to 537,400 metric tons, the highest level
since 2008, from 501,200 tons in 2011, said  Nobuyuki Nakamoto ,
general manager at  Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. (5706) ’s zinc business.  Zinc, the second-best performer among six base metals on
the London Metal Exchange, has gained 7.6 percent this year on
signs economic growth is accelerating. Japan’s machinery orders
exceeded all economists’ estimates in February, signaling gains
in  capital spending . An increase in demand may boost prices of
the metal used to galvanize steel and benefit producers such as
Korea Zinc Co.,  Nyrstar (NYR)  NV and  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)   “Domestic consumption is recovering,” Nakamoto said in an
interview on April 9. “We expect demand for rebuilding to
emerge up at the end of this year or early next year.”  Japan’s March 11 disaster, the yen’s strength and
Thailand’s worst floods in almost 70 years curbed demand last
year from the auto and electronics parts industries.
Reconstruction may require an additional 20,000 tons of zinc
each year for about three years, he said. The yen has fallen
from a post-World War II high of 75.35 per dollar in October and
traded at 80.88 today.  Japan was Asia’s fourth-biggest user in 2011 after China,
India and  South Korea , according to the International Lead and
Zinc Study Group. The country’s demand accounted for 4 percent
of the world’s 12.7 million tons.  Deficit  The market may swing to a deficit in 2013 from a surplus
this year,  Michael Widmer , head of metals research at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, said in a weekly note on April 2.  Surpluses have been declining at a steady pace since 2009
because of muted increases in mine supply, Widmer said. The
market may swing into a deficit of 160,000 tons in 2013 from a
surplus of 141,000 tons in 2012, he said. Supply exceeded demand
by 561,000 tons in 2011, down from a surplus of 699,000 tons in
2010 and 789,000 tons in 2009.  Zinc for three-month delivery on the LME declined 0.3
percent to $1,984.50 a ton at 4:12 p.m.  Tokyo  time. The metal
will average $2,133 in 2012 and $2,425 in 2013, Widmer said.  Zinc stockpiles monitored by the LME rose 0.5 percent to
899,825 tons, the highest since May 23, 1995, bourse data showed
April 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
