Peru declared a state of emergency
for 60 days in a jungle district in the south of the country
after “terrorists” abducted employees of Swedish construction
company  Skanska AB (SKAB)  and a local government official.  The measure, which grants the army extra powers including
the right to make arrests without a warrant, is designed to
restore order in the Echarate district of Cuzco where the
kidnappings took place April 9, the Cabinet Chief’s office said
in an e-mail.  Guerrillas are demanding a $10 million ransom for the
release of the hostages abducted from their hotel, Fedia Castro,
the mayor of La Convencion province in Cuzco, said yesterday.
Skanska employees accounted for 31 of the 40 kidnapped workers,
who were all Peruvian, she said. Skanska was contracted by
Transportadora de Gas del Peru SA to build the Kepashiato gas
compressor station for its pipeline from the Camisea gas fields,
the country’s largest.  “The government needs to establish a military base in
Kepashiato to guarantee the security of the local population and
the Camisea project,” Castro told Radio Programas today.  Cabinet Chief Oscar Valdes confirmed that 40 people had
been abducted in comments broadcast on state TV  Peru  today. The
channel said 600 soldiers and police officers are patrolling the
Kepashiato area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
