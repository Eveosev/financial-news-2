UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
named Gerard Cremoux head of investment banking for  Latin
America , according to a memo to employees today.  Cremoux, 41, will relocate to UBS’s Sao Paulo office from
New York and oversee expansion of the firm’s Latin America
business, Aryeh Bourkoff, head of investment banking for the
Americas, said in the memo. A copy of the note was obtained by
Bloomberg News and the contents were confirmed by  Christiaan Brakman , a spokesman for the Zurich-based lender.  The biggest investment banks are pushing into emerging
markets in Latin America and Asia as their economies expand. Of
more than $500 billion in global announced transactions this
year, at least $140 billion had targets in the Latin American,
Caribbean and  Asia  Pacific regions, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Cremoux joined UBS in 1994 and became head of financial
institutions for Latin America in 2001. He advised Grupo de
Inversiones Suramericana on its $3.7 billion purchase of ING
Groep NV’s Latin American pension and wealth-management
business, according to the memo.  Carolina Lacerda, who leads investment banking in Brazil,
will report to Cremoux and Lywal Salles, the chief executive
officer of UBS’s business in that country, according to the
memo. Enrique Vivot, who leads UBS’s Andean-region operations
from Buenos Aires, will also report to Cremoux.  To contact the reporter on this story:
