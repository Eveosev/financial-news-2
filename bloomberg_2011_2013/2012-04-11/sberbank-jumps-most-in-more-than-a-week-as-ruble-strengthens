OAO Sberbank (SBER03) ,  Russia ’s largest
lender, jumped by the most in more than a week as the ruble
gained against the dollar.  The stock advanced as much as 1.6 percent, the biggest rise
since April 3, and traded 1.3 percent higher at 96.81 rubles in
Moscow.  The ruble strengthened for the first time in four days,
appreciating 0.4 percent to 29.6358 per dollar. A stronger ruble
discourages Russians from withdrawing and converting ruble
deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding.  VTB Group, Russia’s second-largest bank, also increased,
adding 0.5 percent to 6.715 kopeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
