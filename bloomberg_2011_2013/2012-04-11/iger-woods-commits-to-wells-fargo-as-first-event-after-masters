Tiger Woods will play in the Wells
Fargo Championship, making his sixth career appearance at the
U.S. PGA Tour event that he won in 2007.  The May 3-6 event at Quail Hollow Club in  Charlotte , North
Carolina, will be the first Tour appearance for Woods since last
weekendâ€™s Masters Tournament, where he tied for 40th, 15 strokes
behind champion Bubba Watson.  Organizers of the Wells Fargo tournament said in a news
release today that Woods, a 14-time major champion, had
officially committed to play.  The 36-year-old Woods is eighth in the  Official World Golf
Ranking . He missed the cut in 2010 in Charlotte, the last time
he played the event. Watson, ranked fourth, also committed to
the Wells Fargo tournament, along with No. 2-ranked Rory McIlroy
and No. 3-ranked  Lee Westwood .  To contact the reporter on this story:
