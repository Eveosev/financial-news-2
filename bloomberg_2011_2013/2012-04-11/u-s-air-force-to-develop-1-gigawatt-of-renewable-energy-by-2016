The U.S.  Air Force  will develop 1
gigawatt of renewable energy by 2016, a Department of Defense
spokesman said.  The Air Forceâ€™s energy goals are part of a 2007
congressional mandate that 25 percent of all power at U.S.
military bases be from renewable sources by 2025. The Army and
Navy each plan to get 1 gigawatt from renewables by 2020, which
would be four years after the Air Force, Dave Foster, a Pentagon
spokesman, said earlier today in a telephone interview.  One gigawatt is enough to power about 800,000 homes,
according to the  Department of Energy .  The Air Force said in an e-mail that it generated 6 percent
of its energy in 2011 from renewables, including wind, solar and
landfill gas.  The Defense Department operates 2.2 billion square feet in
about 300,000 buildings, or three times as much as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., according to Dorothy Robyn, deputy undersecretary
of defense for installations and environment, in an interview on
March 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
