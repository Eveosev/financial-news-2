Bobby Petrino was fired as football
coach at the  University of Arkansas , nine days after he was
injured in a motorcycle accident and then covered up the fact
that a female football staff member also was on the bike.  Athletic Director Jeff Long said in a news conference last
night at Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville,  Arkansas , that
Petrino had been reckless and was involved in a “pattern of
misleading and manipulative behavior.”  Long said Petrino gave the female employee $20,000 at one
point, though he did not specify what the money was for. Petrino
was fired with cause and will not receive a buyout included in
his contract, the athletic director said.  “He made the decision to mislead the public,” Long said,
choking up at points during the news conference.  Petrino, a former head coach of the  Atlanta Falcons  of the
 National Football League , led Arkansas to a Cotton Bowl win and
a No. 5 final ranking in the Associated Press national college
football poll this past season.  Petrino, 51, who had a 34-17 record in four seasons leading
the Razorbacks, was left with four broken ribs and other
injuries in the April 1 motorcycle accident. He was placed on
paid leave after acknowledging he had lied at a news conference
about the presence of the 25-year-old woman.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
