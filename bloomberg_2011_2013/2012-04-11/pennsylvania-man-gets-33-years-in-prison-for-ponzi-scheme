A  Pennsylvania  man who admitted his
role in a $17.6 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded 260
investors was sentenced to more than 33 years in prison by a
federal judge.  Robert Stinson Jr., 56, of Berwyn, pleaded guilty last year
to 26 charges, including wire and mail fraud,  money laundering 
and bank fraud, according to U.S. Justice Department officials.  “Stinson ran a company called Life’s Good Inc., that
solicited investments in one of four real estate hedge funds,”
promising returns of as much as 16 percent, according to a
statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Philadelphia.  U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson yesterday also ordered
Stinson to pay $14 million in restitution.  Officials said Stinson used some of the proceeds to buy two
Mercedes-Benz sedans, and falsely told investors he was a
graduate of  Massachusetts Institute of Technology .  The case is U.S. v. Stinson, 10-cr-00724; a related
lawsuit is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stinson, 2:10-
cv-3130, both in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
