BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3)  said the state of
 Rio de Janeiro  plans to use the power of eminent domain to take
over Rio’s Stock Exchange building in the downtown area to house
the city’s legislature.  BM&FBovespa will take measures to guarantee it will be paid
a “fair price” for the property, the company said in a
regulatory filing today.  The building is home to the now extinct Rio Stock Exchange,
acquired by BM&FBovespa in 2002, BB Gestao de Recursos DTVM SA,
 Latin America ’s largest asset manager, and the Brazilian office
of Fitch Ratings Ltd, among other firms. The building that
currently houses Rio’s legislature, also in the downtown area,
will become a cultural center, said communications director
Luisi Valadao.  Brazil ’s telecommunications agency, known as Anatel, also
has an office in the  building , and wasn’t included in the
governor’s decree published April 10 authorizing the
expropriation. The Rio state government will negotiate Anatel’s
removal from the building separately, Valadao said.  Fitch said it wasn’t informed of the government’s plan for
the building, according to its press office in Rio. BB Gestao de
Recursos didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail sent by
Bloomberg News requesting comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
