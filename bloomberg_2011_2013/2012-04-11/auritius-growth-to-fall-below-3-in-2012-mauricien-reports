Mauritiusâ€™s economy will probably
expand by less than 3 percent in 2012, le Mauricien reported,
citing Finance Minister Xavier Luc Duval.  Growth may slow because of delays in foreign direct
investment and a decline in income from tourism, the Port Louis-
based daily cited Duval as saying in a letter to the  World Bank .  Growth could decelerate to as low as 1.7 percent this year
before rebounding in 2015, the newspaper said, citing the World
Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
