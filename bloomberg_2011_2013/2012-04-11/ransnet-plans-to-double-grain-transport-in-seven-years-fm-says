Transnet SOC Ltd.,  South Africa â€™s
state-owned ports and rail company, plans to double the amount
of grain it transports over the next seven years as it increases
capacity, the  Financial Mail  said, citing Agriculture Sales and
Marketing Executive Manager Albert Swart.  Transnet transported 3.3 million metric tons of grain last
year, or 20 percent of all local output, the Johannesburg-based
weekly reported.  To contact the reporters on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha
