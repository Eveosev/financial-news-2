Latvian consumer prices grew at the
slowest pace in 15 months in March as the cost of health care,
clothes and communications fell.  The inflation rate dropped to 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent
the previous month, the  statistics office  in the capital, Riga,
said today on its website. Thatâ€™s below the 3.1 percent median
estimate of five economists in a Bloomberg  survey . Consumer
prices rose 0.6 percent from February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
