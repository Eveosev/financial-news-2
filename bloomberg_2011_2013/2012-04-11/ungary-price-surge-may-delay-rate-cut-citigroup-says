Hungary’s  inflation , the fastest in
the European Union, slowed in March on food costs.  Consumer prices rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier after
a 5.9 percent increase in February, which was the fastest since
March 2010, the statistics office in Budapest said today. The
inflation rate matched the median  estimate  of 17 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices rose 0.8 percent from February.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which targets 3 percent inflation,
on March 27 kept the  benchmark interest rate  unchanged at 7
percent, the EU’s highest, for a third month, citing delays in
the government’s talks for financial assistance from the
 International Monetary Fund . The central bank also raised its
inflation forecast.  The central bank last month forecast an average inflation
rate of 5.6 percent in 2012, up from a previous estimate of 5
percent, and 3 percent in 2013, more than its previous forecast
of 2.6 percent.  Food-price growth was 4.7 percent in March from a year
earlier after a 6 percent increase in February. Household energy
costs rose 6.8 percent after jumping 8.1 percent in the previous
month. Services-costs growth slowed to 4.1 percent from 4.5
percent.  Alcohol and tobacco prices rose 10.8 percent in March from
a year ago after a 7.6 percent increase in the previous month.
On the month, fuel prices rose 1.2 percent and the price of
alcohol and tobacco rose 3 percent.  The core inflation rate, which strips out volatile energy
and food prices, rose 5 percent in March from a year earlier
after rising 5.4 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
