New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie ’s approval rating reached its highest level since the
first-term Republican took office in 2010, a  Quinnipiac
University (78104MF)  poll shows.  Registered voters approved of how the governor is doing his
job 59 percent to 36 percent, according to the survey released
today. That’s four percentage points higher than in February and
up from a low of 44 percent in June. He scored highest ratings
among Republicans, at 92 percent, and was at 64 percent among
independents. Democrats disapproved, 64 percent to 30 percent.  “Whether Governor Christopher Christie is traveling the
nation, campaigning for former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney or traveling to  Israel  to tout New Jersey business, his
job-approval rating at home in Trenton continues to climb,”
 Maurice Carroll , director of the Quinnipiac University Polling
Institute in Hamden,  Connecticut , said in a statement.  Christie proposed a 10 percent income- tax cut  in February,
part of a $32.1 billion spending plan that counts on  tax revenue 
increasing 7.3 percent, the most since before the recession that
began in December 2007. Reducing taxes is possible now that the
state’s “fiscal house is in order,” Christie has said, and is
part of what he calls the “New Jersey comeback.”  Support for the tax cut remained roughly unchanged from
February, with 54 percent backing the plan, the poll showed.
Support was highest at 58 percent among households making less
than $50,000 annually and those making more than $250,000.  Given a choice, voters favor a plan by Democratic lawmakers
to instead ease the state’s property-tax burden, 49 percent to
38 percent who prefer Christie’s proposal. Voters support by 57
percent to 24 percent state Senate President  Stephen Sweeney ’s
bid for a 10 percent property-tax credit for households with an
annual income of $250,000 or less.  The telephone survey of 1,607 voters April 3-9 had a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
