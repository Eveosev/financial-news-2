Serbiaâ€™s foreign-currency reserves
fell for a third month in March as the nation repaid debt to
foreign creditors and the central bank sold euros to prop up the
dinar.  Foreign-exchange reserves dropped to 11.07 billion euros
($14.5 billion) from 11.2 billion euros in February, the
Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-mail today.
Total foreign-exchange reserves stood at 12 billion euros at the
end of 2011.  The central bank spent 310 million euros in the foreign-
exchange market in March to slow declines in the dinar, which
has depreciated 6 percent in nominal terms since the start of
the year, the bank said. The government repaid 112.5 million
euros to foreign creditors.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , fell to 6.14 billion euros in March from 6.35 billion
euros in February. The amount of net reserves equaled 461
percent of M1 money supply, up from 429 percent in the previous
month and remained sufficient for more than seven months of
imports, the bank said.  Interbank trading volumes of 1.01 billion euros in March
were 673.8 million euros lower than in February, pushing the
three-month trading volumes to 4.5 billion euros, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
