The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rallied with stocks amid demand for riskier assets.  New Zealand’s dollar rebounded from almost a one-month low
against the yen after data showed business confidence improved
in the first quarter, adding to signs the country’s economy
remains resilient. The Aussie rose from the weakest in three
months as commodities prices tumbled amid concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is worsening.  “The Australian and New Zealand’s dollars are being bought
back after yesterday’s selloffs,” said Takuya Kawabata, a
researcher at Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd. in  Tokyo , unit
of Japan’s largest currency-margin company, referring to April
10. “While a positive business sentiment report alone may not
drive the New Zealand dollar higher, we could see follow-through
if economic data continue to improve and we start to see a tick
up in consumer prices.”  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.5 percent to $1.0301 at 5:00 p.m.
yesterday in  New York , after touching $1.0226, the lowest since
Jan. 9. It climbed 0.7 percent to 83.28 yen after it touched
82.49 yen, the weakest since Feb. 7.　New Zealand’s currency
added 0.4 percent to 81.81 U.S. cents. The kiwi advanced 0.6
percent to 66.16 yen.  In New Zealand, a net 13 percent of 797 companies surveyed
expect the economy will improve during the next six months, from
zero in the fourth-quarter survey, the New Zealand Institute of
Economic Research Inc. said yesterday in Wellington. The net
figure subtracts the proportion of pessimists from optimists.  “The New Zealand dollar is being torn between the
negatives of the waning risk appetite and building domestic
momentum,” said  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at Bank of
New Zealand in Wellington. “That tug-of-war continues and
you’re likely to see the kiwi chopped around between the 80.90-
82.50 range for the rest of the week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
