Fighting in  Syria  has curbed
 Turkey ’s chemical exports to the country by 92 percent and dealt
a “heavy blow” to the industry, according to the Turkish
chemical products exporters’ union.  Shipments to Syria, Turkey’s third-largest market for
chemical products last year, fell to $10.7 million in the first
quarter of 2012 from $127.3 million a year ago, the group said.  “Instability in the country has dealt a heavy blow to the
chemicals sector,” union chief Murat Akyuz said in an e-mailed
statement from Istanbul today. “The biggest factor is that
drivers refuse to go because there’s no safety.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
