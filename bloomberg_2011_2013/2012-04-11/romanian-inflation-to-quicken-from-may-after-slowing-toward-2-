Romania ’s inflation will accelerate
beginning next month because of a statistical base effect,
though the rate won’t exceed 3 percent, Adrian Vasilescu, an
adviser to central bank Governor Mugur Isarescu, wrote in an
 opinion column  in Ziarul Financiar.  The  inflation rate , which fell to a record-low 2.4 percent
in March from a year earlier, will probably drop toward 2
percent in April from a year earlier, as consumer-price monthly
growth may be about 0.4 percent, Vasilescu wrote in the column.  To contact the reporter on this story:
