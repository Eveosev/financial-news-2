Stephen Strasburg  struck out nine
batters in six scoreless innings as the  Washington Nationals 
defeated the New York Mets 4-0 today for Johan Santana’s first
loss of the Major League Baseball season.  Strasburg, 23, allowed two hits and three walks in his
first victory of the year. Mets pitchers walked 10 batters,
including two with the bases loaded, and New York hitters left
eight runners on base at Citi Field on the 50th anniversary of
the Mets’ inaugural game as a franchise.  Santana threw 99 pitches, struck out eight and walked three
in the loss, the four-time All-Star’s second start since missing
the entire 2011 season following shoulder surgery.  The Nationals took a 1-0 lead in the second inning on a
wild pitch and added single runs in the seventh, eighth and
ninth innings against New York relief pitchers.  The Mets have dropped their past two games after opening
the year with four wins. The Nationals also are 4-2, tied with
the Mets for first place in the National League East division.  Strasburg, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 MLB Draft,
threw 108 pitches, the first time in his career he has passed
the 100-pitch mark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
