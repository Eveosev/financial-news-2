U.K. stocks  climbed, rebounding
from the lowest level this year, as mining companies and banks
rallied after Alcoa Inc. kicked of the U.S. earnings season with
an unexpected first-quarter profit.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  rose with copper.
Barclays Plc advanced 2.8 percent as  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
strategists upgraded European banks.  G4S (GFS)  Plc increased 2.6
percent after Morgan Stanley recommended the security company.
 BT Group (BT/A)  Plc and  Michael Page International Plc (MPI)  declined.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 39.19, or 0.7 percent, to 5,634.74
at the close in  London . The gauge sank 2.2 percent yesterday
amid renewed concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and worse-than-
forecast U.S. jobs data. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also
climbed 0.7 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.1 percent
in Dublin.  “Traders are breathing a deep sigh of relief as
yesterday’s rout seems to have come to an abrupt end,” said
 Manoj Ladwa , a senior trader at ETX Capital in London. “Alcoa
reported well last night and investors have stepped in to pick
up cheap stocks.”  The FTSE 100 swung between gains and losses at least 10
times today. The number of shares in the index changing hands
was 18 percent greater than the average over the past 30 days,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Alcoa kicked of the U.S. reporting season with an
unexpected first-quarter profit after orders rose and as the
largest U.S. aluminum producer closed its higher-cost smelting
capacity. Alcoa was the first company in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  to report results from last quarter.  Kazakhmys, Rio Tinto  Mining companies advanced as copper gained in London.
Kazakhmys increased 1.9 percent to 869 pence, Antofagasta gained
3.5 percent to 1,110 pence and BHP Billiton Ltd. climbed 1.3
percent to 1,855.5 pence.  A gauge of U.K.-listed mining companies yesterday sank 3.9
percent as copper fell on a report that  China , the world’s
largest user, imported less metal last month.  Barclays paced a rally in European banks, climbing 2.8
percent to 212.1 pence as Investec Plc raised its recommendation
for Britain’s second-largest lender by assets to buy from hold.  Separately, HSBC upgraded European banks to overweight for
the first time in four years, meaning investors should own more
shares in the industry than are represented in benchmark
indexes. HSBC strategist Peter Sullivan said European bank
earnings could have “bottomed” so long as the euro area’s
economy doesn’t contact by more than 2 percent in 2012.  Lloyds Gains  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  rallied 2.7 percent to 30.59
pence,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  gained 0.8 percent to 1,493.5
pence and HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, advanced 0.7 percent to
540.9 pence.  A  gauge of U.K. banks stocks  increased 1.2 percent,
rebounding from a four-day retreat.  G4S surged 2.6 percent to 280.1 pence as Morgan Stanley
raised its recommendation for the world’s largest security
company to overweight, the equivalent of a buy rating. The
analysts cited “an impressive recent win rate and a strong bid
pipeline in U.K government outsourcing.”  BT Group paced declining shares, falling 2.5 percent to
213.2 pence. JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded the U.K.’s largest
phone company to neutral from overweight, saying BT is unlikely
to raise its dividend in the short term. The brokerage also said
regulatory hurdles may prompt the company to reduce its full-
year sales guidance on May 10.  Michael Page  sank 3.6 percent to 437.8 pence even after the
recruitment company reported a 6.8 percent increase in first-
quarter gross profit to 136 million pounds ($216 million).  “Markets continue to be weak and visibility remains
limited,” Michael Page said in a statement today.  Investec lowered its recommendation for the shares to hold
from buy, citing the stock’s strong performance over the past
three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
