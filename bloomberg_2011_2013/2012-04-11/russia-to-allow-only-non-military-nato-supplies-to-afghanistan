Russia will allow the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to transport only non-military
supplies via a Russian airbase to  Afghanistan , the Foreign
Ministry said.  NATO wonâ€™t be permitted to station any personnel at the
airbase, the Moscow-based ministry said on its website today.  An airbase in Ulyanovsk, a Volga city about 900 kilometers
(559 miles) east of Moscow, could be made available as a transit
point for NATO forces based in Afghanistan, Russian Foreign
Minister  Sergei Lavrov  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
