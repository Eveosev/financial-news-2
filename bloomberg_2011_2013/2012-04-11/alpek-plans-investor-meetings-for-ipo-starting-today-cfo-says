Alpek SAB plans to meet with
investors beginning today in an effort to drum up demand for
 Mexico ’s first initial public offering in nine months, said
Ramon Leal, chief financial officer of the parent company.  Alpek, the country’s biggest petrochemical company, will
hold the meetings in at least four countries over the next two
weeks, according to Leal, who spoke by phone from London.  The company is seeking to raise as much as 11.2 billion
pesos ($853.8 million) through an IPO planned for April 25,
according to a prospectus published today on the stock
exchange’s website. Shares in the company, which is based in the
suburbs of Monterrey, will be priced at 27.50 pesos to 31.50
pesos each, the filing showed.  A team will meet with investors in  London  starting today,
and meetings in Mexico and the U.S. will begin April 16, said
Leal, the finance chief at parent company Alfa SAB, the world’s
largest producer of aluminum engine heads. Alpek will also meet
with investors in Toronto before the sale, Leal said.  Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit and HSBC Holdings Plc are
managing the share sale, according to the prospectus. Credit
Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley are also participating in the
effort.  To contact the reporter on this story:
