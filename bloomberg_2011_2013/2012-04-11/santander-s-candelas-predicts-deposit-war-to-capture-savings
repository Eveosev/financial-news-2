A “deposit war” is set to break
out in Spain as banks compete for customer funds, said Enrique Candelas, head of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s consumer banking business
in the country.  “The economy has to deleverage and this means a lower
demand for credit and also implies that in the medium term that
there will be the need for more saving,” Candelas said in a
speech in  Madrid  today. “This is undoubtedly going to provoke a
deposit war.”  Higher financing costs, lower revenue from commissions and
falling credit demand have made the Spanish banking industry
barely profitable, Candelas said. The solution lies in adjusting
the prices of loans and products to reflect the greater costs of
doing business and seeking efficiency gains, he said.  Candelas predicted that 10,000 to 12,000 bank  branches  may
need to close in  Spain  as the industry cuts costs. He said
Santander, Spain’s largest bank, won’t close any branches as it
seeks to wrest market share from competitors. Bank branches in
Spain have already dropped to about 39,800 from a 2008 peak of
about 45,700, according to Bank of Spain data.  As Spain faces its second recession since 2009, Santander’s
strategy is focused on seeking business with companies and
higher-income customers, Candelas said. The bank will only
consider buying banks rescued by the government under “very
favorable” terms, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
