Hidrock Realty , a New York
developer, bought a vacant lot near the  World Trade Center site 
in lower Manhattan where it plans to build a 300-room hotel.  The property at 133 Greenwich St. was purchased in a joint
venture with Robert Finvarb Cos. for $27.9 million, Hidrock said
today in a statement. The partners plan to spend an additional
$70 million to develop the 28-story hotel, which is slated to
open in 2015, according to the statement.  The land deal is part of Hidrock’s goal to acquire $250
million in new assets by the middle of 2013. The company expects
returns on this type of investment “north of 20 percent,”
Hidrock President Abraham Hidary said in the statement.  Hidrock, which is adding lodging properties after having
focused primarily on office buildings, plans to buy another
hotel development site in  Manhattan  within six months, Hidary
said in a telephone interview today.  “Development in Manhattan is very difficult,” he said.
“There aren’t many companies that are set up for it. That
diminishes competition, pushes prices lower and ultimately
results in higher profits.”  The company also is converting a former office building at
960 Sixth Ave. in Manhattan’s Fashion District into a Courtyard,
a  Marriott International Inc. (MAR)  brand, for about $300,000 a room.
The total cost of $72 million includes a bank branch on the
bottom floor, Hidary said in October.  Hidrock is developing a SpringHill Suites, also a Marriott-
owned name, at 25 West 37th St. in a partnership with Robert
Finvarb Cos. at a cost of $53.1 million, or $320,000 a room.  To contact the reporter on this story:
