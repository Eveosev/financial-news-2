TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , Sweden’s biggest
phone company, said it’s negotiating with investment partners
Altimo and AF Telecom on the future of  OAO MegaFon (MFON) ,  Russia ’s
second-largest mobile operator.  “The three main shareholders are in talks since about
three months back regarding the ownership structure and future
governance of  MegaFon ,”  Cecilia Edstroem , a spokeswoman at
Stockholm-based TeliaSonera, said in a phone interview,
declining to elaborate further on a statement today that the
discussions are taking place. Altimo Vice President Evgeny Dumalkin also verified the talks during a phone interview.  RBC Daily  reported April 2 that Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s AF Telecom is looking to buy out Altimo’s 25.1 percent
stake in MegaFon for $5 billion, citing unidentified people at
telephone operators. That would make AF Telecom a majority owner
with the power to make new deals with other companies such as
fixed-line phone company OAO Rostelecom and Scartel, which runs
fourth-generation mobile service Yota.  “There’s been pressure for something to happen for some
time, given the proximity of MegaFon and Rostelecom and given
that AF Telecom is blocking any dividend distribution from
MegaFon,” Barry Zeitoune, a London-based analyst at Berenberg
Bank, said in a telephone interview. “MegaFon’s cash position
is growing and it doesn’t have a particularly efficient  capital
structure .”  Stock Rises  TeliaSonera rose as much as 2.8 percent to 42.72 kronor as
of 11:45 a.m. in Stockholm.  The reported figure of $5 billion doesn’t materially change
the value of TeliaSonera’s stake, Zeitoune said.  Usmanov currently owns 31.13 percent of MegaFon and
TeliaSonera holds 43.77 percent, according to the company’s
 website .  Altimo’s Dumalkin said he had no information about a
possible initial public offering for MegaFon. The operator may
stage an IPO after Usmanov boosts his stake, Vedomosti reported
earlier today, citing unidentified people close to MegaFon and
three investment banks.  TeliaSonera and Altimo, the telecommunications arm of  Alfa
Group , agreed in 2009 to combine their stakes in MegaFon and
 Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL)  into a new company to clarify
ownership and increase dividends. The agreement hasn’t come into
force because of a dispute over a stake sale in Turkcell.  “The agreement with Altimo is still valid, and obviously
if we reach an agreement on MegaFon, the prior agreement will
focus entirely on resolving the ownership disputes in  Turkey ,”
Edstroem said.  Usmanov is seeking to create a new telecommunications
company by gaining a controlling stake in MegaFon and swapping
some of its shares for a majority in Scartel, Vedomosti reported
yesterday, citing two people close to MegaFon shareholders and
one person close to MegaFon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
