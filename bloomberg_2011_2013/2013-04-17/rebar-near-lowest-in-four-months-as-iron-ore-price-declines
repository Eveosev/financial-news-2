Steel reinforcement-bar futures
fell to near the lowest level in more than four months as the
price of  iron ore , used to make the building material, fell.  The contract for delivery in October on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange dropped as much as 0.8 percent to 3,722  yuan 
($603) a metric ton and traded at 3,727 yuan at 10:40 a.m. local
time. Futures yesterday touched 3,665 yuan, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Dec. 12.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port dropped by 1.1 percent to
$139.40 a dry ton yesterday, the lowest level in a week, The
Steel Index Ltd. data show.  “Steel mills are in cut-throat competition so their
pricing is usually benchmarked on the cost of production,”
Zhang Lei, analyst at Nanhua Futures Co., said by phone from
Tianjin today. “A decline in the price of iron ore directly
suppresses steel prices.”  The average  spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,634 yuan yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
