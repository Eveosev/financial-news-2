The euro extended losses versus the
dollar and yen after Dow Jones reported Bundesbank President
Jens Weidmann said the European Central Bank may cut interest
rates if new information warrants the move.  The dollar strengthened versus most major peers as a
decline in stocks boosted haven demand. The yen declined for a
second day against the dollar amid speculation  Japan  will escape
censure over its weak currency at a Group-of-20 meeting this
week. Sweden’s krona slid the most since 2011 against the
greenback after the Riksbank delayed interest-rate increases.  “Sometimes you get a bit of complacency, but these
comments underscore and remind people that more accommodation
could be coming from the ECB,” Brian Kim, a currency strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland’s RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. “It shows that
people need to be on guard because the fundamental situation
still isn’t great in the euro zone.”  The 17-nation currency fell 1 percent to $1.3043 at 10:46
a.m. New York time after touching $1.3202 yesterday, the
strongest level since Feb. 25. The yen weakened 0.2 percent to
97.71 per dollar after declining earlier as much as 0.9 percent.
The Japanese currency rallied 3 percent in the previous two
sessions. It lost 0.8 percent to 127.46 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
