Arabtec Holding PJSC (ARTC) , the Persian
Gulf’s largest publicly traded  construction  company, formed a
venture with  Samsung Engineering Co. (028050)  to further its expansion in
the oil and gas industry.  Arabtec-Samsung Engineering will be 60 percent owned by
Arabtec and 40 percent owned by Seoul-based Samsung Engineering.
Management will be appointed shortly, according to a statement
by the two companies today.  The joint venture will “undertake large-scale projects in
oil & gas, power and infrastructure in the Middle East and North
Africa,” the companies said. Arabtec-Samsung will bid for
contracts ranging from $3 billion to $10 billion in value.
Samsung Engineering currently has a $10 billion contract backlog
in the regions.  Arabtec, which helped build the world’s tallest tower in
Dubai, in February replaced its management and said it plans to
more than double its market value. The Dubai-based company also
said it’s planning to raise 6.4 billion dirhams ($1.7 billion)
through a bond and share sale. The proceeds will be used to
bolster the company’s oil-and-gas installation business and
expand its affordable housing capacity, Arabtec said in March.  Yesterday, Arabtec signed a 10-year agreement to lease the
59-floor office tower in Abu Dhabi where Arabtec Construction
and Arabtec-Samsung Engineering will be based, the company’s
Chief Executive Officer Hasan Ismaik said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
