Vietnam ’s bonds rose, pushing the
three-year yield to the lowest level since 2007, on speculation
slower inflation will give the central bank room to cut interest
rates to support the economy. The dong gained.  The State Bank of Vietnam, which lowered its refinance rate
by 1 percentage point to 8 percent last month, may reduce it to
7.5 percent this quarter, Standard Chartered Plc economist Betty Wang said in Hanoi today.  Consumer prices  gained 6.64 percent in
March from a year earlier, the least in six months, official
data show. Vietnam’s economic growth slowed to 4.89 percent in
the first quarter from 5.44 percent in the previous three
months, according to General Statistics Office figures.  “Government bond yields will likely go sideways or drop
slightly in the near future,” Ha Thi Thu Hang and Dang Mai
Trang, Hanoi-based analysts at  Bao Viet Securities Co. (BVS) , wrote in
a research note e-mailed yesterday. “Bond demand is forecast to
continue to increase, especially as credit growth is low and
interest rates may be reduced by 0.5 percentage point towards
the end of the second quarter.”  The  three-year  yield fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 7.73 percent, the lowest level since
November 2007, according to a daily fixing from lenders compiled
by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,903 per dollar as of 2:45
p.m. in Hanoi, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The State Bank
of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since
December 2011, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the daily
fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
