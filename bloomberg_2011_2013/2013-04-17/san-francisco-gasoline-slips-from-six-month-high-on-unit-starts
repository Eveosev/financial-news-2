Spot gasoline in San Francisco
weakened from a six-month high against futures as  Chevron Corp. (CVX) 
and  Phillips 66 (PSX)  were said to be preparing to start units at
refineries in Northern California.  Chevron Corp.’s 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond plant planned
to fill its only crude unit, shut since an Aug. 6 fire, with oil
on April 20, a person familiar with operations said April 15.
Phillips 66’s Rodeo  refinery  was scheduled to start a
hydrocracker after finishing pump repairs tomorrow, a person
with knowledge of the work said yesterday.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco fell
1.5 cents to a premium of 22.5 cents a gallon against futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:10 p.m. East
Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel
climbed yesterday to the highest premium since Oct. 12.  Carbob in  Los Angeles  gained 2.5 cents to a premium of 8
cents a gallon.  Gasoline inventories  on the U.S. West Coast, known as the
PADD 5 region, dropped 3 percent in the week ended April 12 to
27.6 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, said today. That’s the
lowest level since October.  California-blend, or CARB,  diesel in San Francisco  climbed
0.5 cent to 6.5 cents a gallon above ultra-low-sulfur diesel
futures on the Nymex. The same fuel in Los Angeles was unchanged
at a 0.75-cent-a-gallon premium versus futures.  Conventional gasoline  in  Portland ,  Oregon , dropped 1.5
cents against Nymex gasoline futures to a premium of 4.5 cents a
gallon.  Low-sulfur diesel  there weakened by 1 cent to 5 cents a
gallon above futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles gained for the
first time in three days, rising 54 cents to $18.64 a barrel at
4:24 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
