Swiss stocks  declined for a fourth
day as  Adecco (ADEN)  SA, the world’s biggest supplier of temporary
workers, dropped.  Adecco slid 2.7 percent after HSBC Holdings Plc downgraded
the shares.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  fell 1.6 percent. UBS AG and  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  both fell more than 1 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  lost 0.6 percent to 7,671.05 at
10:51 a.m. in Zurich. The benchmark measure has still rallied 12
percent this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise
budget and data fueled optimism that the world’s biggest economy
is recovering. The broader Swiss Performance Index also dropped
0.6 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 53 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Federal Reserve releases its Beige Book report at 2
p.m. in  Washington . The survey analyzes economic conditions in
12 U.S. districts. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on April 8
that “the economy is significantly stronger than it was four
years ago, although conditions are clearly still far from where
we would all like them to be.”  Adecco slid 2.7 percent to 48.38 Swiss francs, its lowest
price this year. The stock was cut to neutral from overweight at
HSBC, which said growth at staffing companies is anaemic.  ABB, the world’s largest maker of power transformers, fell
1.6 percent to 20.37 francs.  UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland’s two
largest banks, fell 1.6 percent to 14.77 francs and 1.1 percent
to 26.16 francs, respectively.  Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  retreated 3.8 percent to 106 francs. The
 hearing-aid maker  said it will reassess provisions for legal
claims after a Kentucky court awarded a plaintiff $7.3 million
for an implant covered by a voluntary recall in 2006.  Panalpina Welttransport Holding AG (PWTN)  added 3.5 percent to
90.85 francs, halting three days of losses. The freight-
forwarding company was raised to overweight from equal weight at
Morgan Stanley, meaning that investors should hold more of the
shares than are represented in benchmark indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
