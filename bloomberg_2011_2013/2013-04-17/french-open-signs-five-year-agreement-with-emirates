The  French Open  tennis tournament
signed a five-year sponsorship agreement with Emirates, the
world’s biggest airline by international passenger traffic.  Under the pact, Emirates will display its logo on tennis
courts at Roland Garros and have access to corporate hospitality
suites during the event, the tournament and airline said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The French Open, the world’s only clay-court Grand Slam,
starts May 26 at Roland Garros in Paris.  The tournament announced two days ago that it would lift
prize money for next month by 3 million euros ($3.9 million) to
22 million euros.  Emirates also sponsors the U.S. Open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
