Gasoline futures slipped as
refineries started units and a stronger dollar reduced the
appeal of commodities as an investment. Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures fell 1.1 percent as Motiva Enterprises LLC’s  Port
Arthur , Texas, refinery is starting units after an April 14 area
power loss. The dollar rose 0.4 percent against the euro at 9:54
a.m. in  New York . The fuel’s crack spread versus May West Texas
Intermediate narrowed 34 cents to $27.54 a barrel, and the June
spread versus Brent sank 25 cents to $16.35.  “The idea that the Port Arthur refineries are coming back
suggests it was a very temporary blip,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .
“It looks like yesterday’s firmness was a bit of short-
covering.”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 2.99 cents to $2.7519 a
gallon at 9:52 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , on
trading volume that was 9.7 percent above the 100-day average.  The power loss in Port Arthur affected three refineries,
including two owned by Total Petrochemicals USA Inc. and Valero
Energy Corp., that have a combined oil processing capacity of
1.08 million barrels a day. Total has declined to comment on its
plant’s status, while Valero said yesterday all units are
operating.  The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to
report last week’s inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in
Washington. The statistical arm of the  Department of Energy  will
probably report that gasoline supplies fell 800,000 barrels last
week and distillate stockpiles declined 350,000 barrels,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported
yesterday that gasoline inventories rose 253,000 barrels and
distillate supplies increased 1.26 million barrels.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery declined 3.34
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.7731 a gallon on volume that was 11
percent above the 100-day average. Prices touched $2.7683, the
lowest intraday level since July 13.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.3 cent to
$3.519 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
fallen 26.7 cents from the year-to-date high of $3.786 on Feb.
26 and are 38.5 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
