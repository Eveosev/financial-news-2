Canadian  stocks  fell, led by
commodity producers, after the  Bank of Canada  cut its growth
outlook for the economy and said that economic slack will
persist for more than two years.  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest diversified miner,
and  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  dropped at least 3.8 percent as
copper plunged. Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. lost more than 1.2 percent as crude fell for the
fourth time in five days.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 94.27
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,025.65 at 10:23 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge has fallen 3.3 percent this year.  The Bank of Canada cut its growth forecast for 2013 to 1.5
percent from 2 percent as “a material degree of slack has re-
emerged in the Canadian economy,” policy makers with the bank
said today. The bank also held the benchmark  interest rate  at 1
percent for the 21st consecutive meeting, as expected by all 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
