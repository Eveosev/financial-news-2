The test launch of  Orbital Sciences
Corp. (ORB) ’s new rocket has been called off after a cable
disconnected.  The liftoff of the Antares rocket was scheduled for 5 p.m.
Washington time from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration’s Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia’s Eastern
Shore.  The launch “has been been scrubbed due to a premature
separation of one of the umbilicals up there on the second stage
of the Antares rocket,” a NASA TV announcer said.  The practice run was to be a key milestone in the Dulles,
Virginia-based company’s plan to begin regular cargo deliveries
to the International  Space Station  as early as September.  The test launch involves delivering a simulated version of
the Cygnus unmanned supply ship to orbit. The replica won’t
connect with the station.  Orbital is trying to match the success of billionaire Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which last May
became the first company to dock a commercial craft at the
station.  Orbital has a $1.9 billion contract with  NASA  for eight
cargo resupply flights to the space station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
