Landsbankinn hf proposed its first
payout to Iceland’s government, following a similar move by
competitor Islandsbanki hf, after the 2008 banking crisis.  The bank, which is fully owned by the Treasury, proposed a
dividend of 9.95 billion kronur ($85 million), according to a
 statement  published on the Reykjavik-based lender’s website. The
payout is 0.42 kronur per share, or 39 percent of its 25.5
billion-krona profit.  Landsbankinn was created in 2008 from the domestic
operations of  Landsbanki Islands hf  after it collapsed that
year. The creditors of the failed bank were compensated with a
260 billion-krona bond from the new bank and 18.7 percent of the
new lender’s shares. Iceland’s Treasury owned more than 80
percent of Landsbankinn until April 11, when it bought the
remaining shares from Landsbanki creditors.  Landsbanki’s collapse threatened to wipe out the savings of
about 350,000 U.K. and Dutch depositors, before their
governments stepped in to cover the losses. The administrators
of the failed bank now estimate that the proceeds from the
bank’s liquidated assets will be enough to compensate the two
countries in full.  Islandsbanki hf, the state-created successor to failed
Icelandic lender Glitnir Bank hf, proposed paying 7 billion
kronur in dividends on Feb. 27. The last dividend payment by
Landsbanki Islands was 4.3 billion kronur for the year 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
