Equatorial Guinea plans to keep
exports of its Zafiro crude unchanged in June at three cargoes,
according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The size of the lots will be 1 million barrels, compared
with 950,000 barrels in May, the plan shows.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
