Zeder Investments Ltd. (ZED) , an investor
in agricultural companies, said it would buy a stake in South
Africa’s biggest fruit exporter Capespan Group Ltd. from  Total
Produce Plc. (TOT)  for 258 million rand ($28.3 million).  Zeder, which made an unsuccessful takeover bid for Capespan
two years ago, will buy Total’s 25.3 percent stake and will now
own 71.1 percent of the company, Stellenbosch, South Africa-
based Zeder said in a statement today.  Total Produce (TOT) , a European fruit and vegetable distributor,
agreed to the deal after a “strategic review of the long-term
benefits of holding a minority stake”, the Dundalk, Ireland-
based company said in a separate statement. The transaction will
be completed in the coming weeks.  South Africa is the world’s biggest exporter of whole
oranges and the largest shipper of grapefruit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
