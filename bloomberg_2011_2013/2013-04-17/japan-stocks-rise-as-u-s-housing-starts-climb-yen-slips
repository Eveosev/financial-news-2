Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rebounding from the longest losing
streak in three months, after U.S. housing starts beat estimates
and the yen dropped, buoying the earnings outlook for exporters.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Japanese automaker with the highest
proportion of exports, gained 5.9 percent. Toshiba Corp. paced
gains among technology shares after bellwether  Intel Corp .
forecast sales that exceeded analysts’ estimates. Taiyo Yuden
Co., a maker of smartphone parts, jumped 6.2 percent after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended the shares.  Olympus Corp. (7733) ,
the world’s biggest maker of endoscopes, gained 2.3 percent

in Tokyo, rising for the first time in four days. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index added 1.5 percent to 1,136.01, with about five
stocks gaining for each that fell.  “U.S. housing starts are giving the market peace of mind
after several disappointing economic reports,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based strategist at Daiwa Securities Group
Inc.,  Japan ’s second-largest brokerage. “Today’s advance is
bigger than I expected. Investors who haven’t gotten into the
rally are definitely looking to buy on dips.”  The Topix surged 57 percent from mid-November, gaining the
most among major global indexes, amid confidence Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will tackle
deflation. The gauge traded at 17.2  times average estimated
earnings , compared with 14.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Housing  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.2 percent. The measure
climbed 1.4 percent yesterday, rebounding from its biggest drop
since November, as new U.S. home construction rose more than
forecast in March to the highest level since June 2008. Shares
also advanced as earnings from Coca-Cola Co. to Johnson &
Johnson topped estimates.  Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, forecast
second-quarter sales will be as much as $13.4 billion on strong
demand for server chips. Analysts on average predicted sales of
$12.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Technology shares gained. Toshiba, which makes flash-memory
chips, rose 5.5 percent to 561 yen.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , a maker of
memory-chip testers, added 2 percent to 1,365 yen. Murata
Manufacturing Co., a maker of capacitors for Apple Inc.’s
iPhone, gained 3.8 percent to 8,150 yen.  Yen Slides  Japanese exporters advanced as the yen extended yesterday’s
losses. In the last six-months, Japan’s currency has declined
the most among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Mazda added 5.9 percent to 322 yen. The carmaker’s shares
have tripled since mid-November, when the yen started its slide
amid optimisim Abe would become the next prime minister.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker by market
value, rose 1.8 percent to 5,550 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that gets 79 percent of its revenue abroad, advanced 1.7 percent
to 3,670 yen.  “Expectations for BOJ easing are still having an impact on
the market, adding downward pressure to the yen,” said Ichiro Yamada, who helps oversee about 300 billion yen ($3.1 billion)
in stocks as general manager at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance in
Tokyo. “Long-term investment money seems to be flowing into
Japan as well as short-term money from  hedge funds .”  Taiyo Yuden climbed 6.2 percent to 1,424 yen after its
rating was raised from neutral to buy at Goldman, citing a
weaker yen and strong demand for smartphone products.  Olympus, Sony  Olympus advanced 2.3 percent to 2,387 yen after announcing
a medical venture with Sony to develop new medical imaging
products. Even after a five-fold gain in the last 18 months,
Olympus’s shares haven’t recouped losses from a 2011 accounting
scandal. Sony gained 2.3 percent to 1,626 yen today.  Among stocks that fell,  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  dropped 2.3
percent to 754 yen as prosecutors said they aim to seize 1.8
billion euros ($2.4 billion) of the brokerage’s assets as part
of a probe into posssible fraud at an Italian bank. Banca Monte
dei Paschi di Siena SpA has claimed Nomura colluded with former
managers in devising a derivative used to hide losses.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  slid 8.5 percent
to 25.76, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.4 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume of
the Nikkei 225 was about 8.5 percent above the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
