Ausdrill Ltd. (ASL) , an Australian mining
services provider, slumped to the lowest in more than 2 1/2
years after cutting full-year profit guidance by as much as 20
percent because of a slowdown in the mining sector.  Ausdrill, which counts BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto
Group as its major customers, fell 7.6 percent to A$1.960 at
10:21 a.m. in Sydney trading, the lowest since Sept. 7, 2010.
The company’s shares earlier dropped as much as 20 percent.  Profit will probably be A$90 million ($93 million) to A$96
million for the 12 months ending June 30, Ausdrill said today in
a statement. The Perth-based company forecast profit of about
$112 million in February when it gave six-month results.  “The group’s profits are expected to be impacted by the
general slowdown in activity in the Australian mining sector
that has occurred from September 2012 onwards, and which has not
recovered as previously expected,” Ausdrill said.  Mining companies are cutting expenditure and deferring new
projects as commodity prices decline. Equity and commodity
markets tumbled after  China , the biggest metals user, this week
reported that economic growth unexpectedly lost momentum last
quarter, further pressuring profit expectations for miners.  Separately,  Emeco Holdings Ltd. (EHL) , which rents earthmoving
equipment to the mining industry, said earnings in the six
months to June 30 will be below the first half, reflecting
challenging market conditions in Australia and  Indonesia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
