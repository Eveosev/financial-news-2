Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  Chairman Rolf Soiron
pledged to push through plant closures while employees of the
world’s largest cement maker demonstrated against job losses
outside the company’s annual general meeting today.  “There will be plant closures,” Soiron told investors at
the meeting in Dubendorf, a suburb of Zurich. “If the market is
no longer there, we have to reduce capacity.”  About 200 Holcim workers were outside the meeting hall
protesting against Europe-wide job cuts and plant closures
announced last year.  Chief Executive Officer Bernard Fontana is guiding Jona,
Switzerland-based Holcim through a cost cutting program to save
1.5 billion francs ($1.6 billion) with efficiency gains in areas
from procurement to a 10 percent reduction of cement capacity in
 Europe  to counter slumping demand for building materials. Holcim
has announced measures to close plants or reduce operations from
 Spain  to Hungary.  Fontana, who took over in February 2012, said Holcim
eliminated 1,678 positions in Europe and 407 in  North America 
last year, responding to a question from Rudolf Meyer, who heads
the Actares shareholder group. Holcim continues to talk with
worker representatives as some initiatives are “ongoing,”
Fontana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
