Taiwan dollar  forwards touched a
two-week high on signs the U.S. and Japanese economies are
improving.  Government bonds  gained for a fourth day.  New-home construction in the U.S. jumped more than forecast
in March, and the  International Monetary Fund  raised its 2013
expansion estimate for Japan to 1.6 percent from 1.2 percent.
Strong domestic consumption and overseas demand for exports have
buoyed Taiwan’s manufacturing sector, leading to relatively
robust growth, HSBC Holdings Plc economists led by Hong Kong-
based Qu Hongbin wrote in an April 15 research report.  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.85 per dollar as of 4:25 p.m. in Taipei, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They touched NT$29.810 earlier, the strongest
level since April 2. The contracts weakened 3.2 percent this
year. The Taiwan dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.9, Taipei
Forex Inc. prices show, paring its 2013 decline to 2.6 percent.  “Sentiment is quite good today after some U.S. data
showing economic growth is picking up,” said  Frances Cheung , a
Hong Kong-based strategist at  Credit Agricole SA. (ACA)  “The Taiwan
dollar has weakened quite a bit lately. It’s experiencing some
correction.”  The central bank has sold the Taiwan dollar in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, slipped nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.43 percent.  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018
dropped two basis points to 0.928 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. That’s the lowest level since March 7. The
 overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at 0.386
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the  Taiwan 
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
