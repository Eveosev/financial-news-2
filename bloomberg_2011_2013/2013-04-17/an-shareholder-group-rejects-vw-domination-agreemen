Revelation Capital Management Ltd.
has rejected  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s offer of 80.89 euros and 3.30 euros
guaranteed dividend as too low.  “We have asked MAN’s boards in previous letters and we now
ask MAN’s boards publicly to negotiate much higher final offers
from VW, or to reject the offers,” Revelation Capital said in a
letter obtained by Bloomberg. The company said it was acting on
behalf of funds with an interest of approximately 210,000 MAN SE
shares.  Volkswagen is pushing for deeper integration between MAN,
its own commercial-vehicles unit and Swedish truckmaker  Scania
AB (SCVB) , which it also controls, to leapfrog  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  and  Daimler AG (DAI) 
as the biggest producer of heavy trucks in  Europe .  The minority shareholder group said that “anything less
than the higher of the 95 euros offered by VW in 2011 and the
highest price VW paid to build MAN stake to 75 percent would be
unfair.”  The guaranteed dividend of 3.30 euros is “also below
estimates”, the group said. A normal procedure using risk-free
rate and the cost of equity would “yield a guaranteed dividend
closer to 5.5 percent or 4.45 euros,” it said.  Volkswagen, which owns 75.03 percent of the Munich-based
company’s voting rights, will set the final cash offer after it
receives valuation reports from auditors, MAN said March 21 in
an DGAP ad-hoc release. The offer price represents a 7.1 percent
discount to MAN’s closing price today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
