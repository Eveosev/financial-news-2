BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, named diamond unit president Tim Cutt to
succeed the retiring Michael Yeager as head of its petroleum
division as part of a senior management shakeup.  Yeager, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, will retire 
on July 1, Melbourne-based BHP said today in a statement. 
Alberto Calderon will be replaced as aluminum President by Daniel 
Malchuk, though will remain as an advisor to incoming Chief 
Executive Officer  Andrew Mackenzie , who will succeed Marius Kloppers as CEO on May 10.  Yeager, who led BHP’s $20 billion move into the U.S. shale
gas industry, joined the petroleum unit in 2006 after 25 years 
with Exxon Mobil Corp., according to BHP’s website. Before becoming 
the top oil executive, Yeager was vice president of Exxon Mobil 
Development Co. where he was responsible for 22 projects worldwide.  “The removal of a layer of management brings the
operations closer to the CEO and ensures alignment between
strategic and managerial leadership,” Mackenzie said in the
statement.  Before becoming diamond unit president in 2011, Cutt led
the company’s petroleum production activities after joining from
Exxon Mobil in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
