Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC (CBQK) , the
country’s second-biggest lender by assets, and  Doha Bank QSC (DHBK) 
reported a better-than-expected rise in first-quarter profit as
non-interest income made up for losses from lending.  Commercial Bank’s net income climbed 7 percent to 506
million riyals ($135 million), the bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The mean estimate of six analysts was for a
profit of 483 million riyals, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
 Net income  at Doha Bank, Qatar’s fourth-largest lender, rose 1.4
percent to 395.3 million riyals versus the 374 million-riyal
mean estimate of five analysts.  “The growth came from investment income and other non-
recurring items,” Abdullah Amin, senior research analyst at
Qatar National Bank Financial Services, said in an e-mail. Net
interest margins “are under pressure because of liquidity in
the system, loan re-pricing and relatively sticky deposit
rates.”  Commercial Bank recorded a 48 percent increase in non-
interest income to 299 million riyals including fees and
“improved gains” from investments, the lender said. Doha
Bank’s income from fees and commissions climbed 13 percent to
92.7 million riyals, and income from investment securities rose
57 percent to 83.3 million riyals.  Commercial Bank’s net interest income, a measure of the
profitability of lending, fell 5 percent and Doha Bank’s
declined 2.9 percent as margins shrank in Qatar. The net
interest margin for the emirate’s eight publicly traded banks
fell to 3.29 percent last year from 3.93 percent in 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Commercial Bank shares rose 0.8 percent to 68 riyals on the
 Qatar Exchange (DSM)  today, and Doha Bank’s fell 0.1 percent. Both
lenders reported financial results after the market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
