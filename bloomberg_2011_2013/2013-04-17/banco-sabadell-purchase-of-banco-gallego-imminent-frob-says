Banco Sabadell SA (SAB) , Spain’s fifth-
biggest bank, made the best offer to buy nationalized-lender
Banco Gallego SA, the country’s bank rescue fund said.  Talks are under way with Sabadell over the terms of the
contract to take control of Gallego, the rescue fund, known as
Frob, said in an e-mailed statement today. The award of La
Coruna, Spain-based Gallego to Sabadell is “predictable and
imminent,” it said.  Spain is selling Gallego, a lender with 4.7 billion euros
($6.2 billion) of assets that was 49 percent-owned by NCG Banco,
a nationalized bank, as Frob seeks buyers for banks it took
control of in the wake of the country’s property crash. Gallego
would help Sabadell extend its earnings in the north western
region of Galicia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
