Votorantim Cimentos SA, the biggest
cement producer in  Brazil , filed to raise as much as $5.4
billion in an initial public offering.  The amount is a placeholder that may change. The company
applied to list American depositary receipts on the New York
Stock Exchange and on the Bovespa, according to a regulatory 
filing today. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Banco Itau 
BBA SA, Credit Suisse Group AG and BTG Pactual SA are managing
the sale.  Votorantim Cimentos, founded in 1933, operates in North and
South America, Europe,  Africa  and Asia. The Sao Paulo-based
companyâ€™s products include cement, ready-mix concrete and other
building materials.  The IPO will probably take place in the second half of this
year, people familiar with the matter said last month.
Votorantim, led by Chief Executive Officer Paulo Henrique de Oliveira Santos, plans to use the proceeds to continue its
expansion outside of Brazil and for potential acquisitions, the
filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
