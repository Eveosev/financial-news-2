The  California Public Employees’ Retirement System  bought 345 apartments in two adjacent Manhattan towers from a partnership including  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , gaining rentals in  New York  as lease rates approach a peak.  The purchase includes 136 units in the  Aldyn  on Riverside Boulevard and the 209-unit  Ashley  on West 63rd Street,  HFF Inc. (HF) , the broker on the sale, said in an e-mailed statement, which didn’t include the transaction’s terms. Calpers, as the Sacramento-based fund is known, made the purchase through Boston-based GID Investment Advisers LLC, the pension’s real estate manager for residential transactions.  The price was about $400 million, according to a person with knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be named because the details are private. On a per-unit basis, it was the most expensive deal for more than 100 units on the Upper West Side since the 2007 purchase of the Apthorp, according to data from New York-based research firm  Real Capital Analytics Inc. (APRTMHPU)   Manhattan apartment rents rose in March at the fastest pace in six months as limited for-sale  inventory  fueled competition among tenants. The median monthly rent climbed 6.7 percent from a year earlier to $3,195, while new-lease signings jumped 10 percent, according to a report by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate. The vacancy rate dropped to a two-year low of 1.46 percent.
