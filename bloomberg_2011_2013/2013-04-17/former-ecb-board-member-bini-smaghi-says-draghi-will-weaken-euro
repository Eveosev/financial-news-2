Former European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said policy makers led by President  Mario Draghi  will act to weaken the euro.  “They have to find ways to avoid that the euro appreciates and actually try to make it depreciate,” Bini Smaghi said in an interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Sara Eisen and  Tom Keene  today. “They will do something, I think that’s unavoidable.”  The euro fell as Bini Smaghi spoke, dropping to $1.3124 at 2 p.m. in  Frankfurt  from $1.3153 beforehand. The euro has climbed more than 2.5 percent against the dollar in the past three weeks as the ECB refrained from adding to stimulus while counterparts in  Japan  and the U.S. employed loose monetary policies to spur growth.  “ Europe  is weaker than Japan and the U.S. so the euro should be weaker,” Bini Smaghi said. “But if we look day by day, it’s actually been strengthening, especially after what happened in Japan.”  The  Bank of Japan  on April 4 announced a doubling of its monthly bond purchases and set a two-year horizon for achieving its goal of 2 percent inflation, prompting the yen to slide against all of its main counterparts. The  Federal Reserve  is also engaged in so-called quantitative easing, buying $85 billion of government and mortgage debt each month in a bid to spur growth and boost employment.  While the ECB has pledged to buy the bonds of distressed euro-area nations if yields are unjustifiably high, it requires them to sign up to strict conditions and no governments have applied for the aid.  ECB Struggles  The Frankfurt-based ECB is struggling to find new ways to help the 17-nation euro economy shake off its second recession in four years. While Draghi signalled this month that policy makers are considering cutting  interest rates  further, he said they haven’t yet come up with a plan to get banks lending to small and medium-sized businesses -- something the ECB has long identified as an area of economic weakness.  Bini Smaghi said there’s no point in the ECB engaging in QE like the Fed, as that would involve it buying the sovereign bonds of countries like  Germany , which already have record-low borrowing costs.
