Google Inc. (GOOG)  said it will bring its
Google Fiber broadband Internet service to Provo, Utah, the
third U.S. city slated for the program, as the company steps up
plans to expand speedy online access to consumers.  The  Mountain View , California-based company has signed an
agreement to purchase iProvo, an existing fiber-optic network
owned by the city, Kevin Lo, general manager at Google Fiber,
said in a blog  post  today. Google, whose plan needs approval by
the city council at a vote scheduled for next week, aims to
upgrade and finish construction of the network, which will
deliver speeds of 1 gigabit per second.  The owner of the world’s most popular search engine is
pushing out high-speed broadband services that could attract
more users to its own online features where it makes money from
advertising. In choosing Provo, Google touted the city’s
business-friendly environment and its technology companies,
include family-research site Ancestry.com Inc.  “We believe the future of the Internet will be built on
gigabit speeds, and we’re sure the businesses and residents of
Provo already have some good ideas for what they’d build with a
gig,” Lo said in the blog.  The company already has announced plans to introduce
broadband and TV service in  Kansas City , Kansas, and Austin,
 Texas .  The city of Provo began construction on the municipal
network in 2004, Google said. In 2011, the city started looking
for a partner that could acquire the system and provide
“affordable service” to residents, the company said.  -- Editors: Stephen West, Jillian Ward  To contact the reporter on this story:
