(Corrects market capitalization in fourth paragraph.)  Hargreaves Lansdown Plc (HL/) , the U.K.’s
largest retail broker, reported record net inflows of 1.8
billion pounds ($2.8 billion,) in the third quarter, as yield-
hungry investors poured cash into equity funds.  Assets under administration jumped 35 percent to 35.1
billion pounds by March 31 from a year earlier, the Bristol,
England-based company said in its statement published today.
Revenue jumped 23 percent to 76.3 million pounds.  “Interest rates remain depressed across the savings and
investment industry,” Chief Executive Officer Ian Gorham said
in the statement. “This aids our company by encouraging equity
investment, as retail investors face persistently poor returns
on cash.”  The  shares  rose 3.3 percent to 930 pence at 8:28 a.m. in
 London . They have increased 37 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 4.4 billion pounds.  Retail investors are increasingly looking to equities and
other higher-yielding investments due to the poor returns
offered by bank accounts and fixed-income instruments in a low
interest rate environment. While driving customer numbers, that
development could weigh on income next year, the company said.  “As our fixed term deposits mature, the lower interest
rates have a negative effect on our interest income,” Gorham
said. “Whilst strong asset and associated revenue growth
continues, 2014 revenue growth will also be subject to some drag
from reduced interest income if low interest rates persist.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
