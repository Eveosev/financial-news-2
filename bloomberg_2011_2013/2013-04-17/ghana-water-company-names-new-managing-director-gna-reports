Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama replaced Kweku Botwe as acting managing director of the
state water utility and promoted his deputy, Kwaku Godwin Dovlo,
 Ghana  News Agency reported, citing a company statement.  The change at the Ghana Water Co. took effect on April 12,
the Accra-based agency reported today. No reason for the
dismissal was given.  Dovlo will face a challenge of meeting the rising demand
for water in Ghana, where growth in its $35 billion economy is
set to outpace the sub-Saharan African average for a sixth year
in 2013. In an interview earlier this year, Botwe said the
utility can’t account for 55 percent of the water it produces.  In a speech last month in Accra, Mahama said Ghana is
“burdened with a major energy and water crisis.”  Botwe has been told to report to the Ministry of Water
Resources, Works and Housing for a new job, according to GNA.  Dovlo, who trained as a civil engineer at the Kwame Nkrumah
University of Science and Technology in Ghana’s second-biggest
city, Kumasi, joined the water company there in 1979, GNA
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
