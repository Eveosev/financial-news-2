Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s Asian operations
raised more than $50 billion for clients from capital markets
last quarter, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  Citigroup sold bonds for clients including  Bharti Airtel
Ltd. (BHARTI) , Noble Group Ltd. and  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , helping the
region contribute the most to the bank’s profit outside of North
America, the memo showed. James Griffiths, a spokesman in Hong
Kong for Citigroup, confirmed the contents of the document.  Net income from Asia rose 1 percent in the three months
ended March 31 from a year earlier to $1.1 billion, the New
York-based bank reported on April 15. The region’s revenue from
securities and banking rose 12 percent to $1.4 billion, the
figures showed.  “It was a solid result,” Asia-Pacific Chief Executive
Officer Stephen Bird said in the memo, which was distributed to
employees in the region yesterday.  Citigroup closed the biggest outbound takeover from China
in the quarter when it advised oil producer  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  on its
purchase of Nexen Inc., according to the memo, which gave a
valuation of $17.9 billion for the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
