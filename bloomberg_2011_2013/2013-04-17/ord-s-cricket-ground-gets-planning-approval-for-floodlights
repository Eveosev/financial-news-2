Lord’s cricket ground in  London 
will be able to use floodlights for another five years until
2019 after getting planning permission from the local council.  Westminster City Council approved the renewal for the
lights, which had permission through the end of the year.
Starting next year, the 2.7 million-pound ($4.1 million)
retractable lights can be used two extra times during day
matches, illuminating 14 day and 10 night matches, according to
an e-mailed statement from the Marlyebone Cricket Club.  “It is crucial that the club, going forward, has the
ability to use the floodlights if required during all its major
match days because no one wants to see play lost to bad light,”
 John Stephenson , MCC’s head of cricket and estates, said in the
statement. “Thanks to constructive and co-operative relations
with both the local residents and the council, we have an
agreement which ensures Lord’s retains its place as the finest
ground to watch and play cricket.”  For day matches, the lights must be switched off by 7:30
p.m., and for day/night and evening matches, they must be
reduced by 50 percent by 9:50 p.m. and off by 11 p.m., the MCC
said in the statement. The new approval expires in January 2019.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
