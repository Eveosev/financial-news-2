The  New York Yankees  played “Sweet
Caroline,” a song traditionally played at the Red Sox’s Fenway
Park, after the third inning of their Major League Baseball game
last night to honor the victims of the  Boston Marathon bombings .  A moment of silence was observed before the 4-2 win over
the Arizona Diamondbacks at Yankee Stadium.  “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and the
families who were affected by the bombings and our respect and
admiration go out to the police, medical personnel and first
responders who acted so heroically,” the Yankees said in a
statement.  The Yankees were remembering the three people who were
killed and more than 175 who were injured in two bomb explosions
near the end of the Boston Marathon two days ago.  Martin Richard, an 8-year-old from Boston’s Dorchester
neighborhood, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell of suburban Medford
and a Chinese national who was a graduate student at  Boston
University  were killed in the blasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
