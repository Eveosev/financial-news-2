Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF) , Canada’s
largest non-bank brokerage, fell the most in eight months after
TD Securities analyst Graham Ryding cut his rating to hold from
buy amid slumping commodities.  Canaccord slid 8.2 percent to C$5.86 at 12:01 p.m. in
Toronto, its biggest intraday retreat since Aug. 9. The shares
have declined 13 percent this year, compared with a 4 percent
 drop  in the 237-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite index.  “With the recent weakness in commodities and the Canadian
materials sector, a key sector for Canaccord Financial’s
Canadian capital markets activity, we now see a less compelling
outlook,” Ryding said today in a note.  The  S&P/TSX Materials Index (STMATR)  has fallen 30 percent this
year, and mining company takeovers and financings have stalled
in  Canada , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gold plunged
the most since 1980 this week, with copper and oil prices also
falling. A resource slump could hurt Canaccord’s Canadian
activity since the Toronto-based firm is highly leveraged to
materials-based deals, Ryding said.  Ryding reduced Canaccord’s revenue and earnings estimates
for fiscal 2014 and 2015 because of “muted” brokerage
activity. Ryding estimated adjusted earnings per share of 65
cents for Canaccord in 2014, down from his prior estimate of 85
cents, and 90 cents in 2015, less than his previous C$1
estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
