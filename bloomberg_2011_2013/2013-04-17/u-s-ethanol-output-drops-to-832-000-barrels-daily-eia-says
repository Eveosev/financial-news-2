Ethanol  production  in the U.S. fell
2.6 percent to 832,000 barrels a day, the biggest weekly decline
since January and the lowest level for this time of year in
records going back to June 2010.  Stockpiles sank 1.6 percent to 17.5 million barrels in the
week ended April 12, led by a drop on the West Coast, a report
from the Energy Information Administration showed today. Total
inventories were down 20 percent from a year earlier.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 94 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, down from a record 96 percent the
previous week, the Energy Department’s analytical arm said.  For a second week, the U.S. didn’t  import  any of the
biofuel, the EIA said. That compares to foreign purchases of
21,000 barrels a day a year earlier.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery advanced 3.9 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $2.443 a gallon at 11:18 a.m.  New York  time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have gained 12 percent this
year.  Production dropped the most since Jan. 25 and was down 5.9
percent from a year earlier, the EIA report showed. Output
reached a record 963,000 barrels a day in December 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
