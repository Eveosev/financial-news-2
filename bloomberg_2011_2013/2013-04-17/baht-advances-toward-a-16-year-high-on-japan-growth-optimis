The baht rose toward a 16-year high
after the  International Monetary Fund  raised its economic growth
forecast for Japan,  Thailand ’s biggest source of foreign
investment and second-largest export market.  The currency gained 0.2 percent from April 12 to 28.96 per
dollar as of 9:10 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Local financial markets were shut the last two days
for the Thai New Year holiday, known as Songkran. The currency
touched 28.88 on April 10, the highest level since a devaluation
in July 1997 that sparked the Asian financial crisis.  Japan’s economy may expand 1.6 percent this year, more than
a January estimate of 1.2 percent, the IMF said yesterday.
Companies based in  Asia ’s second-largest economy accounted for
64 percent of the projects approved by the Thai Board of
Investment last year, according to  Japan  External Trade
Organization data. A Thai government report showed Japan bought
10 percent of shipments from Thailand in that period, a
proportion second only to  China .  “Japan’s growth momentum should help some Southeast Asian
countries, especially Thailand, through exports and foreign
direct investment,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-
exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “Japan is a big investor
for Thailand and our major export market, so that should help
the Thai economy too.”  The Bank of Thailand raised its 2013 growth forecast to 5.1
percent on April 12 from a January prediction of 4.9 percent.
The central bank continues to monitor capital inflows and the
baht, which has strengthened “faster than expected,” Assistant
Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said the same day.  Bond Inflows  One-month implied volatility for the baht, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, from April 12 to
5.29 percent.  Global funds  bought  $1.4 billion more sovereign debt than
they sold this month through April 12, taking this year’s net
purchases to $11 billion, according to Thai Bond Market
Association data.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 fell two basis points to 3.4 percent, the lowest level
since August, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The strong baht outlook helps bond investment in Thailand
from overseas,” Bangkok Bank’s Disawat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
