Saudi Arabia boosted crude exports
in February to the highest level since June while it cut oil use
at local power plants and refineries to the lowest since March
2011, according to Joint Organizations Data Initiative.  The kingdom, the world’s largest crude exporter, increased
daily shipments to 7.45 million from 7.09 million a month
earlier, the initiative known as Jodi said on its website today.
It produced 9.15 million barrels a day during the month, the
data show.  The country burned 294,000 barrels a day of crude at power
plants, while processing 1.5 million barrels at refineries,
according to the data.  Saudi Arabia’s Petroleum Ministry expects a bigger gain in
oil demand this year than forecast by groups such as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the
International Energy Agency. It estimates world demand will
increase by about 1 million barrels a day this year and exceed
90 million barrels “for the first time in history,” Ibrahim al-Muhanna, an adviser to Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi , said
on April 10 in  Kuwait .  JODI, supervised by Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on production, imports and exports for oil-
producing and consuming nations. Its data include crude and
condensates, exclude natural gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
