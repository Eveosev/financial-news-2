News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox pulled an episode
of the “Family Guy” animated comedy from the Fox.com and Hulu
websites after scenes were altered to resemble the  Boston
Marathon bombings  and posted on YouTube.  The episode, “Turban Cowboy,” which aired in mid-March,
was taken down, the network said yesterday. Scenes from the
episode were combined, showing the cartoon family’s father
running over athletes in his car and inadvertently using a
mobile phone to set off blasts to win the race.  “The edited ‘Family Guy’ clip currently circulating is
abhorrent,” Seth MacFarlane, the show’s creator, wrote in a
Twitter post. “The event was a crime and a tragedy, and my
thoughts are with the victims.”  Fox, based in  Los Angeles , declined to make any additional
comment. TV networks often alter schedules to avoid airing
sensitive material following natural disasters or tragedies like
the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings in December.  Authorities are combing the site of the two April 15
explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. The
blasts killed three people and wounded more than 170. Evidence
suggests the bomber used weapons made from metal pressure
cookers to maximize the charge, according to investigators.  The episode’s removal from Hulu and Fox.com was reported
earlier by the Los Angeles Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
