panel television maker  Hisense Electric Co. (600060)  led appliance stocks
higher after reporting a jump in profit. Banks declined on

high higher before the release of first-quarter earnings today.

a top pick, along with Moutai.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016)  slid

at the close. The CSI 300 Index fell 0.1 percent to 2,458.47.

potential with the government putting great efforts to bolster
the industry,” said Wang Zheng, Shanghai-based chief investment
officer at Jingxi Investment Management Co., which manages $120
million. “China’s banks will suffer from falling demand for
loans as the old growth model of relying on investment cannot be
sustained.”  Moutai Earnings  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 9.8 percent from a Feb. 6
high amid concern measure to cool  property  prices will hurt
economic growth. Valuations on the gauge dropped to 9 times

compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 32 percent lower
than the 30-day average today, according to data compiled by

latter jumped 2.6 percent.  Moutai, the biggest maker of baijiu liquor, rose 3.1
percent to 178.49  yuan , paring its loss this year to 15 percent
amid concern a government crackdown on extravagant spending will
curb demand for high-priced alcohol. The stock closed at its
highest level since March 14.  Moutai’s first-quarter earnings per share may rise 20
percent from a year earlier to 3.43 yuan, according to the
 median estimate  of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hisense Electric jumped 7 percent to 14.98 yuan after

added 2.4 percent to 37.61 yuan. CLSA said it was “most
confident” of technology companies in terms of reporting
earnings that will match or beat analysts’ estimates.  Chinese A-share companies’ earnings may have a “gloomy
start” to the year, with machinery, retail and environmental
shares likely to disappoint, CLSA said. The brokerage has an
overweight allocation on health-care companies, technology
stocks and consumer shares and named  Gree Electric Appliances
Inc. (000651)  and Yunnan Baiyao Group Co. among top picks.  Less Lending  A gauge of financial stocks in the CSI 300 slid 0.9
