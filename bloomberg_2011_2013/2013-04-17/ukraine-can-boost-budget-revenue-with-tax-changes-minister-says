Ukraine can increase budget revenue
through tax changes, even as analysts predict “moderate”
economic growth, according to Revenues and Fees Minister
Oleksandr Klymenko.  “We see the opportunity to secure an increase in budget
revenue by reviewing tax benefits and introducing transfer-
pricing controls,” Klymenko said today in e-mailed comments to
 Bloomberg News . “We expect to get an additional 20 billion
hryvnia ($2.5 billion) for the budget in the next three years”
from new  transfer-pricing  rules.  First-quarter budget revenue rose 6.7 percent from a year
earlier to 102.5 billion hryvnia, Klymenko said. To take the
effect, a bill on transfer pricing must be approved by
parliament and signed by the president, she said.  Ukraine slipped into its second  recession  in four years in
the second half of 2012 as demand for exports such as steel
weakened on global markets. The economy contracted 0.5 percent
from a year earlier in January, according to the central bank.
It will shrink by 1.8 percent this year,  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  estimated Jan. 24, while the International Monetary Fund
yesterday predicted zero growth.  The budget assumes 3.4 percent economic expansion and
revenue of 362.8 billion hryvnia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
