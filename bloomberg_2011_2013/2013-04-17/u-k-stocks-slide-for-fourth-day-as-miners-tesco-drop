U.K. stocks  fell for a fourth day
as  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  reported its first profit drop in almost two
decades and as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  led mining companies lower.  Tesco declined 3.5 percent after saying it will leave the
U.S. BHP slid to a seven-month low as quarterly iron-ore output
missed analysts’ estimates.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  jumped 2.8
percent as revenue beat forecasts.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  retreated 54.78 points, or 0.9 percent,
to 6,249.8 at 3:39 p.m. in London. The benchmark, which had
gained 0.5 percent at 8:01 a.m., slumped 1.2 percent at 8:51
a.m., before paring losses. The broader FTSE All-Share Index
fell 0.8 percent today. Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.7 percent.  “The FTSE has been given little to cheer about from
equities, with retail-sector bellwether stock Tesco coming out
with their first profits fall in 20 years,” Alastair McCaig,
market analyst at IG in  London , wrote in a note. “Once again,
fear rather than optimism is the overriding factor affecting
European traders, and early market rumors of a German debt
downgrade have seen the DAX lead the way lower.”  Some 14,000  DAX Index futures  contracts expiring in June
changed hands in a a five-minute period about 9:50 a.m. in
Frankfurt today, more than 15 times the 20-day average volume
for that time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Risk Off  The FTSE 100 has lost 2.3 percent since April 11 as Chinese
economic growth missed forecasts and commodity stocks tumbled,
paring its gains so far this year to 6.3 percent.  “We’re seeing some rotation away from risk assets after
some economic data missed expectations,” said Guy Foster, head
of portfolio strategy at Brewin Dolphin Securities Ltd. in
London. “Losses on commodities have prompted traders and  hedge
funds  to shrink their gross exposure to equities. We remain
negative on mining stocks.”  Minutes of the  Bank of England ’s April policy meeting
released today showed that Governor  Mervyn King  was defeated for
a third month in a push for more stimulus.  Six of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the
target for quantitative easing at 375 billion pounds ($575
billion) this month, the central bank said. King,  David Miles 
and  Paul Fisher  wanted to increase it by 25 billion pounds.  In the U.S., the  Federal Reserve  releases its Beige Book
report at 2 p.m.  New York  time. That includes a summary and
analysis of economic conditions in 12 U.S. districts.  Tesco Tumbles  Tesco declined 3.5 percent to 371.55 pence, the biggest
decrease since Oct. 5. The Cheshunt, England-based company said
it will exit the U.S. and scale back U.K. store expansion after
posting the first drop in annual profit in almost two decades.  The withdrawal from the U.S. will cut profit by about 1.2
billion pounds, the company said. Tesco also took an 804
million-pound charge to write down the value of properties it no
longer plans to develop.  BHP retreated 3.2 percent to 1,782 pence, the lowest price
since Sept. 5, after the world’s biggest mining company said
third-quarter iron-ore output rose to 40.2 million metric tons,
missing the average analyst estimate of 42.3 million tons.  A  gauge of miners  in the FTSE 350 Index declined 3.1
percent, extending a drop so far this week to 7.1 percent. Rio
Tinto Group, the second-biggest miner, slid 3.8 percent to
2,850.5 pence and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  lost 2.3 percent to 963.2 pence.  Hikma Review  Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc (HIK)  retreated 5.3 percent to 927
pence, the biggest tumble since March 2012, as the drugmaker
said after concluding a review that it won’t sell its
injectable-medicine business. The company cited “excellent
long-term growth prospects.” Hikma said March 1 it was
considering a possible sale after receiving unsolicited
approaches for the business.  CPP Group Plc (CPP)  plummeted 45 percent to 4 pence after saying
it has until Sept. 30 to discuss refinancing terms with its
lenders and major shareholder Hamish Macgregor Ogston. The
company, which provides protection against credit-card and
identity theft, also agreed to sell its North American unit to
AMT Warranty Corp. for $40 million.  “The Group is likely to continue to face significant
financial challenges in the short to medium term,” the company
said in a statement. CPP shares have sunk 80 percent since
January.  Burberry rose 2.8 percent to 1,301 pence. The U.K.’s
largest luxury-goods maker said fourth-quarter sales rose 11
percent to 503 million pounds, beating the 485.1 million-pound
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Hargreaves Lansdown Plc (HL/)  climbed 4.6 percent to 941.5 pence,
the highest price since it sold shares to the public in 2007,
after the U.K.’s largest retail broker reported record net
inflows of 1.8 billion pounds in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
