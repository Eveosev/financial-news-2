Japan  plans to set up a large-size
storage battery to stabilize the flow of solar power on the
northern island of Hokkaido where inexpensive land is attracting
projects to tap the renewable source of energy.  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will allocate
about 20 billion yen ($204 million) to install the system at a
substation with 60 megawatt hour of storage capacity, Hiroaki Niihara, an official in charge of energy conservation and
renewable energy, said at a news conference today in Tokyo.  The battery, to be installed by March 2015, is among the
three plans the ministry announced today to respond to the high
concentration of solar projects in Hokkaido. The islandâ€™s power
grids are nearing their limit to handle the influx of clean
energy, according to a ministry statement today.  Japan began an incentive program for clean energy in July
to diversify its energy mix. The country added 1,394 megawatts
of clean energy, including 1,329 megawatts of solar, between
April last year and the end of January, the ministry announced
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
