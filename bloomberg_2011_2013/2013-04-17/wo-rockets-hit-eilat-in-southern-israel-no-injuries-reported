At least two rockets struck open
areas in the southern Israeli city of Eilat this morning, police
said. No injuries or damage was reported in the resort town,
which sits adjacent to Egypt’s  Sinai peninsula .  Eilat has been the target of previous rocket attacks from
Islamic militant groups in Sinai over the past two years. The
Egyptian government boosted its forces in Sinai after 16
soldiers were killed in a clash with militants on the Egypt-
Israel border last August.  Israel’s  Army Radio  reported that the Eilat airport was
closed and that two rockets also struck the adjacent city of
Aqaba, Jordan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
