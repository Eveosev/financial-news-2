Hong Kong  stocks  rose for the first
time in four days, with the city’s benchmark index rebounding
from a five-month low, after new-home construction in the U.S.
jumped more than forecast.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 0.4 percent to 21,759.97 as of
9:39 a.m. in Hong Kong. The gauge dropped 1.9 percent in the
past three days after Chinese economic growth and industrial
production expanded less than economists’ estimated. The
 International Monetary Fund  cut its 2013 growth projection for
China to 8 percent from 8.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
