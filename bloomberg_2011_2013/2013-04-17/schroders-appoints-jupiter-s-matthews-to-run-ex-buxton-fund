Schroders Plc (SDR) , Europe’s biggest
publicly traded money manager by market value, hired Philip Matthews from Jupiter Fund Management Plc to run its 3.1
billion-pound ($4.7 billion) Alpha Plus fund.  Matthews, 39, will manage the fund in place of  Richard Buxton , head of U.K. equities, who plans to join  Old Mutual Plc (OML) ,
London-based Schroders said today in a  statement . Alex Breese,
formerly of Neptune Investment Management Ltd., also joins to
run the Schroder U.K. Equity and Schroder ISF U.K. Equity funds.  Schroders is looking to prevent outflows from its Alpha
Plus fund, which has beaten 83 percent of rivals over the past
five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, after Old
Mutual announced it was hiring Buxton last month. Today’s
appointment leaves Jupiter with a hole to fill as Matthews had
been in line to take over the 525 million-pound  Jupiter High
Income Fund (JUPHINI)  in July from Anthony Nutt, who is retiring next
year.  Matthews and Breese “are two highly rated U.K. equity fund
managers with excellent performance track records,” Peter Harrison, global head of equities at Schroders, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
