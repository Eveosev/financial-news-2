Bayern Munich  kept alive its bid
for an unprecedented sweep of three major soccer trophies by
routing VfL Wolfsburg 6-1 to reach the German Cup final.  With his team leading 3-1 last night,  Mario Gomez  came off
the substituteâ€™s bench to score a six-minute hat trick as Bayern
advanced to a record-extending 19th German Cup final. It won 15
of its previous 18 appearances in the title game.  Bayern, which will meet Stuttgart or Freiburg in the June 1
Cup final, already secured its 23rd German league championship
and meets Barcelona in the Champions League semifinals. No
German team has won all three competitions in the same season.  Bayern visits Hannover in the Bundesliga in three days
before hosting Barcelona in the opener of their two-match
semifinal on April 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
