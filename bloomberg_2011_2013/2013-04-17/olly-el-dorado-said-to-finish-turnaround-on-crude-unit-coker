HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  finished a
turnaround today that included work on a crude unit, coker and
gofiner at its 135,000-barrel-a-day refinery in El Dorado,
Kansas, according to a person familiar with operations at the
plant.  The work began March 24, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the information isnâ€™t public.  HollyFrontier Chief Operating Officer David Lamp said
during a Feb. 26 conference call that the company expected to
begin a turnaround on the units in the third week of March.  Julia Heidenreich, a Holly spokeswoman in  Dallas , did not
immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment on the work.  The El Dorado refinery can process a variety of crudes and
has direct access to oil from the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub
that is the delivery point for oil futures contracts traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
