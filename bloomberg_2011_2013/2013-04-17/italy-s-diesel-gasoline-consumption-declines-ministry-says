Italy’s diesel consumption fell in
March, according to  data  from the  Ministry of Economic
Development , as the country’s economy probably contracted in the
first quarter.  Diesel use declined 5.5 percent to 2.2 million metric tons
compared with a year earlier, data posted today on the
ministry’s website show. Diesel demand in February was the
lowest since August 2003.  Gasoline consumption fell 7.5 percent to 666,000 tons last
month after rising in February for the first time in more than a
year, according to the data.  Italian gross domestic product probably decreased “less
sharply” in the first quarter than in the previous three
months,  Bank of Italy  said today in a report. The country’s
economy shrank 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, according to the latest data available from national
statistics office  Istat .  To contact the reporter on this story:
