The ruble weakened against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket as Brent crude traded
under $100 a barrel, curbing appetite for the currency of the
world’s biggest energy exporter.  The ruble declined 0.2 percent against the basket to
35.8032 by 1:23 p.m. in Moscow and lost 0.2 percent against the
dollar to 31.3145. The yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February
2027 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.13
percent.  Brent oil fell for the sixth day, declining 0.4 percent to
$99.52 per barrel, the lowest level since July. Revenue from oil
and gas comprise about 50 percent of the Russia’s state budget
income. The central bank intervened on April 15 to curb ruble
losses as the currency traded beyond 35.65 to the basket for the
first time in a week. Bank Rossii said it sold the equivalent of
1.61 billion rubles ($51 million) of foreign currency, according
to a website statement.  “Whilst oil prices remain weak, the ruble will find little
support,” Tradition UK analysts said in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
