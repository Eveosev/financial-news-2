Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-
biggest lender, is facing shareholder resistance to plans to
issue contingent convertible bonds, or CoCos, that may dilute
existing investors, people with knowledge of the talks said.  The  Association of British Insurers , which represents 
companies with 1.8 trillion pounds ($2.8 trillion) of assets
including Barclays' shares, issued a so-called amber top over 
the plan, a method of highlighting concern that the proposal 
may not be in investors’ interests, said the people, who asked 
not to be identified because the talks are private. It isn’t an 
instruction to vote against the resolution.  Under the plan, Barclays would seek approval to issue new
stock equivalent to about 26 percent of its existing capital,
according to the agenda for London-based Barclays’s annual
general meeting on April 25. The new shares would only be issued
if the CoCos converted into equity should the lender’s core Tier
1  capital ratio  fall below 7 percent of assets weighted by risk.  Contingent convertible debt securities are a new addition
to banks’ capital, introduced after the 2008 financial crisis
showed that many of the debt instruments lenders counted as
capital weren’t able to absorb losses. Barclays has issued $4
billion of notes that will be written down to zero if its
capital ratio falls below 7 percent.  Officials at Barclays and the ABI declined to comment. The
Guardian reported the alert earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
