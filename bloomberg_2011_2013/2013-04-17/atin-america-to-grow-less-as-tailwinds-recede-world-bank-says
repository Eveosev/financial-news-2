The pace of economic growth in
Latin America will slow in the coming years as a result of lower
commodity prices and a deceleration in  China , the World Bank
said.  The Latin America and Caribbean region’s average annual
growth should fall to about 3.5 percent from 5.5 percent over
the past decade as a result of less favorable global conditions,
the Washington-based lender said in a report today.  “The tailwinds are receding,” Augusto de la Torre, the
World Bank’s chief economist for Latin America and the
Caribbean, said at an event in Washington today. “Unless big
reforms are undertaken, growth will be slower.”  While capital is still flowing into the region in large
amounts, the challenge for policy makers in the coming years
will be to tap domestic engines of growth, especially by
boosting the competitiveness of the services sector, de la Torre
said. If it fails to do so, progress over the past decade
reducing poverty could be compromised, he said.  “The future of the region depends on three words:
productivity, productivity, productivity,” he said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
