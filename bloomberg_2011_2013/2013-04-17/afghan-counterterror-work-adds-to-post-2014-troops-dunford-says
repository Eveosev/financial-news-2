Estimates for a NATO-led force of
as many as 12,000 troops in  Afghanistan  after 2014 doesn’t
include forces for counterterrorism operations and protection of
U.S. diplomats, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford said.  The 8,000-to-12,000 person estimate for NATO troops refers
to post-2014 operations for training, advising and assisting
Afghan forces “and not the other aspects of U.S. presence” in
Afghanistan, Dunford told the House Armed Services Committee
today.  “The next big mission is the counterterrorism piece, which
is not included in those NATO numbers,” said Dunford, who
commands the  International Security Assistance Force . More
troops will also be needed to support the State Department’s
mission after U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan end in
December 2014.  Dunford is the first top military official to draw
distinctions between various missions and spelling out the need
for additional troops to continue the fight against remnants of
al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. The NATO force estimate was endorsed
last week by General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff as a “reasonable target.”  In February, former U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
told his counterparts in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
that he foresees having about 8,000 to 12,000 allied forces in
Afghanistan after the war effort ends in 2014.  Larger Presence  Other U.S. officials have called for a larger U.S. military
presence than the range that is under discussion. The White
House hasn’t announced a final number as the U.S. and
Afghanistan continue to negotiate a bilateral security agreement
that would provide immunity to U.S. troops from local law.  In March, Marine General James Mattis, who retired as the
head of the U.S. Central Command, told a Senate panel that he
favored as many as 13,600 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. NATO may
add 50 percent more for a total of 20,000 forces, he said.  The 13,600 number has been endorsed by Ambassador James Cunningham, the U.S. envoy to Afghanistan, and lawmakers
including House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard P. “Buck” McKeon, a California Republican.  To contact the reporter on this story:
