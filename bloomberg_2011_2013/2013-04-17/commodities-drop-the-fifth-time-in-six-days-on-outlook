Commodities dropped for the fifth
time in sixth days, led by copper, diesel and crude oil, after
the dollar advanced and the  International Monetary Fund  cut its
forecast for global economic growth.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
dropped as much as 1.8 percent to 599.13, just short of the
nine-month low of 597.96 touched yesterday. West Texas
Intermediate oil fell 2.3 percent and  Brent crude  traded in
 London  slipped to the lowest level since July. Copper dropped to
the lowest price since October 2011.  The dollar gained versus most of its major peers amid
speculation that the yen’s decline will continue unabated and
that the  European Central Bank  may cut  interest rates , spurring
demand for haven assets. A rising dollar reduces the appeal of
investment in raw materials denominated in the U.S. currency.  “The strength of the  U.S. dollar  coupled with the downward
revision to the general economic outlook isn’t supportive of
commodity price inflation,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “There may be bullish
factors at work in individual commodity markets but they’re
being overwhelmed by the macro picture.”  The global economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, less
than the 3.5 percent forecast in January, after 3.2 percent
growth in 2012, the Washington-based IMF said yesterday, cutting
its 2013 prediction for a fourth consecutive time.  Crude Drops  WTI crude oil for May delivery declined $2.04 to $86.68 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Dec. 14. The contract dropped as much as $2.66,
or 3 percent, to $86.06 during intraday trading.  Brent oil for June settlement fell $2.22, or 2.2 percent,
to end the session at $97.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the lowest level since July 2.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery declined 7.19
cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.7346 a gallon on the Nymex, the
lowest settlement since July 10. Gasoline for May delivery
dropped 5.28 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.729 a gallon, the
lowest level since Jan. 16.  Copper for delivery in May slid 3.6 percent to close at
$3.1875 a pound on the Comex in  New York , the least since Oct.
20, 2011.  Gold futures for June delivery retreated 0.3 percent to
settle at $1,382.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York. The metal
dropped to $1,360.60 on May 15, the lowest settlement since Feb.
11, 2011.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 1.4 percent to close
at $23.307 an ounce in New York, the least since Oct. 22, 2010.  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to
