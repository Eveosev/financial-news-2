Newcastle defender Ryan Taylor may
miss all of next season with a knee injury, the Premier League
soccer club said on its  website .  Taylor, 28, has been out since August after injuring a
cruciate ligament during a Europa League qualifying match. He
underwent surgery and recently returned to training, where a
further cruciate injury occurred.  “Ryan has worked so hard and diligently since his
injury,” Newcastle manager  Alan Pardew  said. “He has been a
model patient and has given his all to ensure he could return to
full training in the best condition possible. Clearly everyone
at the club is deeply saddened by this news.”  Newcastle said Taylor will probably miss the majority, if
not all, of next season, which begins in August.  The club also said that goalkeeper  Tim Krul  will have
surgery next week after dislocating his shoulder in the 3-0 loss
to Sunderland three days ago. He’s expected to return to
training at the end of July.  Newcastle is 13th in the 20-team league with 36 points,
five above the three-team relegation zone at the bottom of the
standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
