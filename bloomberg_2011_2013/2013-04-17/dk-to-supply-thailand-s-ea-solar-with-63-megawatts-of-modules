LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the maker of solar
wafers that yesterday said it missed a bond repayment deadline,
will supply 63 megawatts of modules to EA Solar Nakornsawan Co.  LDK, the world’s second-biggest producer of wafers used to
make solar cells, plans to start weekly shipments of about 6.3
megawatts to the Thai project developer in August, the Xinyu,
China-based company said today in a statement on its website.  “This contract demonstrates the continued demand for our
solar modules,” Chief Executive Officer Tong Xingxue said in
the statement. LDK said yesterday it missed a deadline to repay
$23.8 million of bonds that matured April 15 as it lacked cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
