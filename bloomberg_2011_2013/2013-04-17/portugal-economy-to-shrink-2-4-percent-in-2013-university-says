Portugal ’s economy will contract
2.4 percent this year and shrink again next year, the Catholic
University of Lisbon forecast.  Portugal’s economic recovery depends on its ability to
export its products,  NECEP/CEA , a unit of the Economics Faculty
of Lisbon’s Catholic University, said in an e-mailed report
today. “The sovereign debt crisis in the euro area will have a
decisive impact on the trajectory of the Portuguese economy.”  The university forecasts a deeper recession than the
government, which predicts the country’s economy will contract
2.3 percent this year before growing 0.6 percent next year.  The Catholic University forecasts Portugal’s economy will
contract 0.4 percent next year.  Portugal’s government is cutting spending and raising taxes
to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($102 billion) aid plan
from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. As
the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal followed Greece
and Ireland in 2011 in seeking a bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
