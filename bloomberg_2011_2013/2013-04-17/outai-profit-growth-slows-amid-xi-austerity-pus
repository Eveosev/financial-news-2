Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , China’s
largest maker of baijiu liquor, said first-quarter profit rose
21 percent, less than half the pace of the year-earlier period
as President Xi Jinping pushes to curb extravagant spending by
government officials.  Earnings increased to 3.59 billion  yuan  ($582 million) in
the three months ended March, according to a company statement
to the Shanghai Stock Exchange yesterday. First-quarter earnings
rose 58 percent in the year-earlier period.  Xi’s austerity campaign has hurt demand for high-end
baijiu, popular at official banquets and for gift giving in
China. Moutai’s sales rose 19 percent to 7.17 billion yuan in
the latest quarter, the slowest growth since the third quarter
of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s sorghum spirit can fetch $300 a bottle. In
Communist Party lore, the company’s 106-proof liquor was used to
clean the wounds of soldiers during the Long March, when
Chairman  Mao Zedong ’s soldiers endured immense hardships as they
fled over snow-clad mountains and through deadly marshes to
evade Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist forces.  As  China’s economy  boomed following  Deng Xiaoping ’s market
opening in the late 1980s, the fiery spirit came to symbolize
the growing wealth and power of the country’s elite. The
Guizhou-based company’s market value soared from less than $1
billion a decade ago to peak at about $41 billion last year.  Xi warned in November that resentment at graft and the
enrichment of cadres and their families threatened the Party’s
grip on power.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
