Indian banks will review loans
backed by gold and call for more collateral as the price of the
metal falls, said Rajiv Takru, secretary for financial services
at the  Finance Ministry .  The central bank “moved immediately” to call on banks to
review lending when gold prices began falling, Takru said in an
interview in  New Delhi  yesterday.  Gold futures in  New York  slumped 17 percent this year
through yesterday, the worst start since 1981. Physical savings
including gold account for about 66 percent of Indian household
assets, the highest proportion among major economies, according
to Vishal Narnolia, a Mumbai-based analyst at SMC  Global
Securities Ltd. (GLBS)   “Banks will be looking at all accounts to see if more
security is required and will probably call for it,” Takru
said. “There is no systemic risk to  India ’s financial system on
account of falling gold prices.”  The selloff was sparked by investor concern that European
governments may have to follow Cyprus in selling part of their
holdings, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) 
called the price move a “panic event.”  Muthoot Finance Ltd. (MUTH) , India’s biggest lender using gold
jewelry as collateral, rose 6.5 percent to 125.9 rupees at 10:26
a.m., paring its loss this year to 40 percent.    Manappuram
Finance Ltd. (MGFL) , a Thrissur, Kerala-based gold loan company dropped
as much as 4.8 percent before gaining 1.6 percent to 15.95
rupees.  To contact the reporters on this story:
