U.S. stocks  are poised for a
“spring break” that will bring losses to investors as economic
growth slows and corporate earnings weaken, according to
 Jonathan Golub  at UBS AG.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 7.1 percent on
average from May to August in the last three years, according to
data compiled by UBS. The benchmark gauge for American equities
rallied 8.8 percent between January and April and climbed 8.2
percent during the final four months from 2010 to 2012, the data
show.  “The market’s advance has been out of sync with weak
earnings and economic trends,” Golub, chief U.S. equity
strategist at UBS, wrote in a note dated yesterday. “Another
spring break is likely to materialize and that now is a good
time to begin dialing back on risk.”  The S&P 500 reached an all-time high of 1,593.37 on April
11 amid optimism that monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve
will spur economic growth. The index has since fallen 2.9
percent as analysts project the first quarterly profit decline
since 2009 and economic data from employment to manufacturing
and retail sales missed economists’ estimates.  The benchmark index retreated 1.8 percent today as
companies from Bank of America Corp. to Textron Inc. reported
disappointing results. First-quarter income from  S&P 500 (SPX) 
companies probably fell 1.4 percent, according to analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which measures the
degree to which economic data exceeded or missed projections,
has dropped 64 percent this year and earlier this week reached
the lowest level since November.  Golub forecasts the S&P 500 will drop 9.5 percent from
yesterday’s close to 1,425 by the end of this year. That is more
pessimistic than the average estimate of 1,583 from 17
strategists, including Golub, surveyed by Bloomberg.  Investors should buy defensive stocks whose earnings are
less tied to economic swings, he said in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
