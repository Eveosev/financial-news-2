Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium
against West Texas Intermediate sank to a nine-month low as
WTI’s discount to  Brent crude  neared $10 a barrel.  WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed for the fifth time in six
days, to $10.70 a barrel from $10.88 yesterday at 2:34 p.m. New
York time, based on June contracts. The spread is down from as
much as $23.44 in February. When Brent drops versus WTI, it
decreases the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with
West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened by 40 cents a barrel to a
premium of $13 over WTI at 12:14 p.m. New York time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, the lowest level since July 5.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 20 cents to
reach $13 as well, also a nine-month low.  Poseidon’s premium gained 10 cents to $6.85 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon strengthened 25 cents to a $5.75 premium.
Mars Blend’s premium to WTI weakened by 10 cents to $7 a barrel.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was
unchanged at $9.60 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
