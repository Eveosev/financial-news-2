Marcelo Marangon, an executive
director of Banco Itau BBA SA, and at least four directors have
left the bank amid a restructuring with management changes,
three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  The departing directors include Andre Cury, Antonio
Sanches, Jorge Bedran Jettar and Paulo di Paula Abreu, said two
of the people, who requested anonymity because the departures
haven’t been announced publicly. Marangon and the bank declined
to comment.  Marangon, the former head of global banking in  Brazil  for
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , was hired by Sao Paulo-based Banco Itau in
October 2011 to handle a newly created unit catering to large
corporations.  Banco Itau BBA is the wholesale arm of  Itau Unibanco
Holding SA (ITUB4) , the biggest Latin American bank by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
