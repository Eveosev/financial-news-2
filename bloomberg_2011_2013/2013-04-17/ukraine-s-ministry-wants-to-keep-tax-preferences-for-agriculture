Ukraine’s  Agriculture Ministry 
wants to keep tax preferences for agriculture companies until
2018.  Tax preferences, introduced in 1998, have helped stimulate
investments in the agriculture industry in Ukraine, Agriculture
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The government considered an option to make local farms pay
a 7 percent value-added tax, Income and Tax Minister Oleksandr Klymenko said on April 1.  Ukraine, which according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates is the world’s biggest exporter of sunflower oil and
fourth biggest exporter of corn, swung to a state budget deficit
in the first two months of the year on higher spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
