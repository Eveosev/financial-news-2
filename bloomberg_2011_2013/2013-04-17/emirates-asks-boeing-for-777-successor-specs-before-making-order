Emirates, the biggest operator of
the  Boeing Co. (BA)  777, is pressing for more information about a
successor aircraft before considering an order for the
replacement of the U.S. manufacturer’s bestselling airliner.  “We’re working closely to get to specifications we’re
happy with,” Emirates President Tim Clark said in an interview
in Paris today. “That means layouts, the seats, the galleys,
getting the weights right, getting the fuel burn.”  Clark has said he may need as many as 275 777s for
replacement and expansion, a requirement so large his airline is
likely to become the so-called launch customer of the successor
plane. While Emirates is more advanced in talks with Boeing than
other carriers, it doesn’t expect to be ready to table an order
at the  Paris Air Show  in June, Clark said.  Boeing’s 777 is the centerpiece of the planemaker’s wide-
body strategy, a lucrative segment of the civil aviation market
that’s coming under fresh attack from Airbus SAS and its new
A350, specifically the A350-1000 that’s similar in size.  The Airbus model will hold 350 passengers and is promising
25 percent greater operating efficiency than the best-selling
777 variant, the 777-300ER. The successor, dubbed 777X, will
have new wings and engines. Boeing in March named a general
manager for the project and said  General Electric Co. (GE) , the sole
powerplant supplier for the 777-300ER, would be the engine
partner.  Emirates has ordered a total of 139 777 planes, which seat
about 365 people and cost $315 million at list price in the most
popular variant. Customers typically receive discounts.  Other airlines that have expressed potential interest in
the 777X include  IAG SA (IAG) ’s British Airways unit and  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG. (LHA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
