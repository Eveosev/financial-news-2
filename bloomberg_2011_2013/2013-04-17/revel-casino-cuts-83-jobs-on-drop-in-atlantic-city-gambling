Revel AC Inc., the bankrupt owner
of Atlantic City’s newest casino, said it eliminated 83 jobs to
bring costs in line as the New Jersey resort town’s gambling
business shrinks.  The cuts amount to about 2.5 percent of the Atlantic City-
based company’s total employment, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  “We must adjust our staffing to align with business
demands,” interim Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Hartmann said
in the statement. “It will ultimately strengthen Revel’s
position within the highly competitive Atlantic City
marketplace.”  Gambling revenue in Atlantic City fell 11 percent in March
to $238.5 million, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement
said on April 10. Year-to-date revenue declined 12 percent, the
agency said.  After opening its casino in April 2012, Revel AC filed for
bankruptcy protection last month after reaching an agreement
with lenders on a debt-for-equity swap. The closely held company
listed $1.1 billion in assets and $1.5 billion in debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
