Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced by the
most in a week on optimism exports will recover after the
 International Monetary Fund  raised its forecast for Japan’s
economic growth.  Government bonds  were steady.  The world’s third-largest economy will expand 1.6 percent
this year, more than the previous prediction for 1.2 percent,
the IMF said in a report yesterday. Japan is the second-biggest
destination for Indonesia’s non-oil exports, behind  China .
Commodities such as animal or vegetable oil, rubber products,
mineral fuel and ores account for 40 percent of such shipments.  “Risk appetite has returned to the market, so we see the
rupiah rebounding on the prospect of commodity exports picking
up,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB
Niaga in Jakarta. “The rally will be limited due to the
uncertainty over fuel subsidies.”  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 9,720 per dollar as of
9:08 a.m. in Jakarta, the most since April 10, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It traded at a
0.1 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards,
which strengthened 0.2 percent to 9,730, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,725 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore ,
compared with 9,714 on April 15. Today’s rate will be released
at 11:30 a.m. Jakarta time. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, dropped one basis point to 5.93 percent.  Indonesia may increase the price of gasoline for private
cars to between 6,500 and 7,000 rupiah a liter, from 4,500
rupiah currently, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Jero
Wacik said yesterday.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 was
little changed at 5.48 percent, data from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show. The finance ministry plans to exchange
