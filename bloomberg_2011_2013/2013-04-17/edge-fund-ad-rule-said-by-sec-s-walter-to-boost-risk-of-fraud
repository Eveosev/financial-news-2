A regulation letting  hedge funds 
advertise for investors could force the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to expand enforcement activity to guard
against fraud, SEC Commissioner Elisse B. Walter said today.  Investor-protection concerns caused the SEC to miss a
congressional deadline for finishing the rule called for in last
year’s Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, Walter said in
testimony at a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing.  “We would have to expend examination and enforcement
resources that we would not otherwise have to,” she said in
addressing questions about why commissioners didn’t accelerate
work on the measure as some SEC staff members suggested. The
agency needed to analyze questions raised by investor advocates,
said Walter, who served as SEC chairman from December until Mary Jo White took the helm this month.  The SEC issued a proposal to lift the ban on hedge-fund
advertising in August, four months after the JOBS Act became
law. Debate over how to proceed sparked conflict between  Mary Schapiro , who stepped down as chairman in December, and
Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, who said he was furious that
Schapiro changed her mind about how to proceed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
