An Egyptian court sentenced Prime
Minister Hisham Qandil to one year in prison for failing to
comply with a previous ruling over the return of a textile
company to the state.  The court also ruled that Qandil should be dismissed from
his role as premier for failing to re-nationalize Tanta Flax and
 Oil Company , Dokki Misdemeanor Court said in a faxed statement
today, citing judge Mohamed El-Sawy.  The ruling will be appealed, the Cabinet said in an e-
mailed statement, citing spokesman Alaa El-Hadidi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
