Cocoa swung between losses and
gains in  New York  after a rally yesterday and as data showed
bean processing in  Europe , the world’s main consuming region,
remained weak. Sugar slid and coffee advanced.  Europe’s cocoa-bean processing fell 3.9 percent in the
first quarter, the Brussels-based European Cocoa Association
said in a report today. While that’s bigger than the drop of 2.4
percent expected by traders in an April 9 Bloomberg survey, it
shows a recovery from the 6.2 percent decline in the previous
three months and from the retreat of 16 percent in the third
quarter. Futures climbed 6.7 percent in New York and 5.2 percent
in  London  this month partly on technical indicators.  “While Europe is facing particular issues, other areas of
the globe should be able to pick up the slack,” Sterling Smith,
a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , wrote in a
report e-mailed yesterday. Global consumption of cocoa is “on
an upward path,” he said.  Cocoa futures for July delivery were unchanged at $2,316 a
ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York by 5:59 a.m. They fell as
much as 0.7 percent and gained as much as 0.1 percent earlier
today. Futures trading volumes were 76 percent higher than the
average for the past 100 days for this time of day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures for the same month were 0.7
percent higher at 1,543 pounds ($2,355) a ton on NYSE Liffe in
London.  Cocoa gained 1.9 percent in London yesterday and 2.2
percent in New York.  Grindings in Europe dropped to 339,377 tons in the first
quarter from 353,311 tons a year earlier, industry group ECA
said. In  Germany , grindings dropped 13 percent to 97,998.9 tons,
according to the Bonn-based Association of the German
Confectionery Industry.  ‘Better’ Performance  Several factors may mean that the decline in the European
grind was closer to 1 percent, “a far better performance than
anticipated by a large number of those in the business,”
 Jonathan Parkman , co-head of agriculture at London-based Marex
Spectron, said today in an e-mailed note.  West African producers are starting to harvest the smaller
of two annual crops and the harvest in  Indonesia  is delayed,
Citigroup’s Smith said. Slow cocoa purchases from  Ghana , the
world’s second-biggest grower after  Ivory Coast , also added to
the price rally yesterday, he said.  Raw sugar for July delivery slid 0.4 percent to 17.80 cents
a pound in New York. White sugar for August delivery was little
changed at $505.50 a ton in London.  The premium raw sugar for May delivery commands over the
July futures fell to 0.11 cent a pound from a high of 0.27 cent
a pound two days ago as the weather turned dry in  Brazil ,
potentially helping the harvest advance. The main growing region
of center south will be mostly dry this week, MDA Information
Systems LLC said in a report yesterday.  Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in July rose 0.7
percent to $1.382 a pound on ICE. Robusta-coffee futures for
delivery in July rose 0.3 percent to $2,078 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
