German, Dutch and Belgian pig
prices increased this week while those in Spain were stable,
industry group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter
Deutschlands e.V. reported.  Hog prices in  Germany , the European Union’s biggest
producer, added 2 cents to 1.646 euros ($2.15) a kilogram (2.2
pounds) from a week ago, while Dutch and Belgian prices rose
about 1 cent, Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in an online  report 
yesterday.  Pork accounts for about half of meat consumption in the EU.
Average consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is forecast to
fall to 40.1 kilograms per person this year from 40.5 kilograms
in 2012, the EU reported last month.  “In the trends, there is a clear north-south slant,” ISN
wrote. While values in southern  Europe  “tended to be weaker,
the prices in the north and center of Europe are strengthening
slightly.”  Prices in Spain, the EU’s second-biggest pig producer, were
little changed at 1.819 euros a kilogram from 1.818 euros a week
ago. In  France , the third-biggest producer, prices fell for a
fourth week to 1.630 euros a kilogram from 1.653 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
