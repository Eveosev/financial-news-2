Rubber declined for a fourth day,
heading for a five-month low reached yesterday, on concerns that
a slowing economy and rising inventories in  China , the biggest
buyer, will reduce demand for the commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in September lost as much as 1.2
percent to 254.5 yen a kilogram ($2,590 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, before trading at 255.7 yen by 11:28
a.m. local time. Futures, which lost 7 percent in the past three
days, plunged to 247 yen yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 15.  Rubber stockpiles at Qingdao, China’s largest hub for the
commodity, rose to a record 366,900 tons by April 15, according
to the Qingdao International Rubber Exchange Market.  China’s
economy  grew 7.7 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, government data showed April 15. That marked the first
time in data going back two decades that four quarters in a row
have seen growth of less than 8 percent.  Rubber declined “amid concerns over slow growth in China
and high stock levels,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity
broker Yutaka Shoji Co. Still, a weakening Japanese currency may
help limit losses, he said by phone today.  The yen fell for a second day against all 16 of its major
peers as investors speculated Japan will escape censure at a
Group of 20 meeting this week over monetary policies that have
weakened its currency. G-20 finance ministers and central
bankers meet for two days from tomorrow in Washington, ahead of
weekend talks of the  International Monetary Fund  and  World Bank .  The IMF yesterday trimmed its forecast for China’s 2013
growth to 8 percent from 8.2 percent after World Bank cut the
forecast to 8.3 percent from 8.4 percent on April 15.  The contract for September delivery fell 0.7 percent to
19,785  yuan  ($3,204) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
