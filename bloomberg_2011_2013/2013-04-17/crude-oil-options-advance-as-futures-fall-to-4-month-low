Crude oil options volatility
increased after the underlying futures tumbled to a four-month
low as equities slipped and U.S. output rose.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.15 percent at 4:30 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 24.74 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for May delivery fell $2.04, or 2.3
percent, to $86.68 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest settlement
since Dec. 14. The volume of all futures traded was 44 percent
above the 100-day average for the time of day as of 3:16 p.m. in
New York.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slumped 1.4 percent as
earnings from companies including  Bank of America Corp.  and  EBay
Inc. (EBAY)  missed analysts’ estimates. Crude-oil output was 7.2
million barrels a day, the most since July 1992, according to
the Energy Information Administration, the Department of
Energy’s statistical arm.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $85 puts, which sank 5 cents to 1 cent a barrel on volume of
9,752 contracts at 4:37 p.m. June $80 puts were the second-most
active, rising 51 cents to 98 cents on volume of 8,097 lots. May
options expire today.  Puts accounted for 65 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Bearish bets made up 59 percent of yesterday’s volume of
246,297 contracts.  July $80 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 8,511 contracts changing hands. They
dropped 14 cents to 87 cents a barrel. May $90 calls declined 22
cents to 18 cents a barrel on 7,463 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
36,133 contracts. Next were June $80 puts with 36,114 and June
$85 puts with 34,418.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
