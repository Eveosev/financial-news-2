Toru Ueda, co-founder of hedge-fund
firm Hachiman Capital Management, sued his former partner
Yashwant Bajaj, claiming he was shortchanged after the two
decided to shut the company.  Bajaj transferred $458,965 from Hachiman to his Juggernaut
Capital Management Pte without Ueda’s consent, according to
Ueda’s lawsuit filed at the Singapore High Court last month.
Bajaj also incurred a trading loss of $247,197, which wasn’t
accounted for, Ueda said in his complaint.  The two men had an agreement preventing them from
withdrawing more than their stakes in the company that they
founded in 2004, according to the complaint. The duo decided to
part ways in September 2010 and agreed that from March 29, 2011
each would be responsible for any losses from their individual
investments and not the company, Ueda said in the lawsuit.  “The claims against me are wholly without basis,” Bajaj,
who hasn’t filed his defense, said in court papers. Bajaj, a
former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. managing director, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. A closed hearing is scheduled for
today.  Total assets under management for Asian  hedge funds  fell
7.8 percent to $135.5 billion in 2012, underscoring the
challenges in raising capital, according to Singapore-based GFIA
Pte, which advises on hedge-fund investments.  Ueda, now a  senior adviser  with Tokyo-based HFC Advisory
Group, is seeking at least $365,400 compensation from Bajaj.  The case is Toru Ueda v Yashwant Bajaj. S205/2013.
