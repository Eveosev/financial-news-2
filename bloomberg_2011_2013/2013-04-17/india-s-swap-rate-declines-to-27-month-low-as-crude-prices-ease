(Corrects proportion of oil imports in second paragraph.)  India ’s one-year  interest-rate
swaps  fell to a 27-month low on speculation that a drop in
commodity prices and slowing inflation will give the central
bank room to cut borrowing costs.  Brent crude  has slipped 9.8 percent this month to $100.23 a
barrel, which may help cut costs for a nation that imports about
80 percent of its oil requirement. Wholesale  prices  rose 5.96
percent in March, the slowest pace since November 2009, official
data showed this week. That was below the central bank’s 6.8
percent projection for the month.  “The outlook for prices to ease further has increased with
the fall in global commodity prices,” said Arvind Chari, a
senior  fund manager  at Quantum Asset Management Co. “This
should provide scope for the central bank to cut rates, and
swaps are reflecting that expectation.”  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis points to
7.30 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in Mumbai, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the lowest level since January 2011.  The plunge in gold in 2013 could lower import costs by
almost $7 billion in the 12 months ending March 2014, according
to a research note from Barclays Plc. Gold purchases account for
more than two-thirds of India’s current-account  deficit ,
according to the  Reserve Bank  of India.  The monetary authority last reduced the benchmark
repurchase  rate  by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent on March 19.
The next policy review is due on May 3.  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds maturing in
June 2022 was little changed at 7.83 percent, according to the
central bank’s trading system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
