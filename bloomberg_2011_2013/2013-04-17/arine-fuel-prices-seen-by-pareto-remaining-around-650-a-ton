Marine fuel, known as  bunkers , will
stay at about $650 a metric ton for the next year, based on a
crude-oil price of $120 a barrel, according to Oslo-based
investment bank Pareto Securities AS.  Following are comments by Nicolai Hansteen, chief economist
at Pareto Shipping, a unit of Pareto Securities, who spoke at
the  3rd Scandinavian Shipping & Ship Finance Conference 2013  in
Copenhagen today. Fuel prices averaged about $631 a ton so far
this year, according to figures from 25 global ports compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We see global oil demand at 90 million barrels a day,”
Hansteen said. “Chinese oil demand is about 10 million barrels
a day.”  A very large crude carrier can transport 2 million barrels
of oil.  On orders for new ships and costs:  “There are 79 dry-bulk carriers ordered so far this year
and 31 oil-product tankers. The new-build quote for a very large
crude carrier at Chinese shipyards is about $83 million.”  On financing the global fleet:  “The value of the current global fleet is about $460
billion, compared with $430 billion that’s in shipping loans
globally. Bonds account for 7 percent, or $32 billion, of the
cost of financing the fleet, while bank debt accounts for $433
billion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
