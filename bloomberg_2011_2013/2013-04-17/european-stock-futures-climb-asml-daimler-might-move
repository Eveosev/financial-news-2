European stocks  declined for a
fourth day, with the benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  falling to
its lowest level this year, as commodity producers and
automakers slid.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  retreated to a seven-month low after the
world’s largest mining company said third-quarter  iron ore 
production rose less than expected. Volkswagen AG and Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG fell at least 2.8 percent as data showed
European car sales fell 10 percent in March.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  lost 3.9
percent after reporting the first annual profit drop in almost
20 years and saying it will exit the U.S.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.5 percent to 283.73 at
the close of trading, its lowest level since Dec. 31. The gauge
earlier slid amid speculation Germany’s credit rating could be
downgraded, before recovering some of the losses within 15
minutes. The measure has still gained 1.5 percent this year as
U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget and central banks
maintained stimulus measures.  “Investors are worried that  Germany ’s economy isn’t
holding up so strongly anymore, and German downgrade rumors are
spreading more fear in the markets today,” said John Plassard,
who helps oversee $28 billion as vice president at Mirabaud
Securities LLP in Geneva. “Coupled with the disappointing
Chinese GDP numbers from earlier this week and the plunging gold
prices, we’re in the middle of a phase of uncertainty and
possibly a correction -- the last thing market participants want
to hear in such a period are downgrade rumors.”  Futures Surge  Some 14,000 DAX Index futures contracts expiring in June
changed hands in a five-minute period about 9:50 a.m. in
 Frankfurt  today, more than 15 times the 20-day average volume
for that time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The index’s volatility was caused by external events,  Deutsche
Boerse , the exchange’s operator, said in a statement.  National benchmark indexes declined in 16 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slipped 1 percent,
Germany’s DAX Index slid 2.3 percent and France’s CAC 40 lost
2.4 percent.  “In the shorter term, we have seen a bit of nervousness
linked to the poor figures out of  China  and the selloff in
commodities -- and we’re seeing mining stocks also weighing
today,” said Jean-Paul Jeckelmann, chief investment officer at
Banque Bonhote & Cie. in Neuchatel,  Switzerland , who helps
manage $1.4 billion in equities.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 6.1 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.K. Unemployment  U.K. unemployment rose at its fastest pace in more than a
year and wage increases slowed. Unemployment as measured by
International Labour Organisation methods rose by 70,000 to 2.56
million in the three months through February, the most since
November 2011, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
 London . The median forecast of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for the rate to stay unchanged.  A separate release showed that  Bank of England  Governor
 Mervyn King  was defeated for a third month in a push for more
stimulus. Six of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the
target for quantitative easing at 375 billion pounds ($575
billion) this month, the central bank said in the minutes of the
April 3-4 meeting, published in London today. King,  David Miles 
and  Paul Fisher  wanted to increase it by 25 billion pounds.  The  Federal Reserve  releases its Beige Book report at 2
p.m.  New York  time, which includes a summary and analysis of
economic conditions in 12 U.S. districts. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said April 8 that the economy is “significantly
stronger” than it was four years ago. Still, he also said
conditions are “far from where we would all like them.”  Miners Slide  BHP Billiton (BLT)  dropped 3.4 percent to 1,779 pence. Output of
iron ore, its biggest earner, was 40.2 million metric tons in
the three months to March 31, missing the median estimate of
42.3 million tons in a Bloomberg survey.  A gauge of European mining companies slid to its lowest
level since July 2009, with Rio Tinto Group and Anglo American
Plc retreating 3.6 percent to 2,854.5 pence, and 2.1 percent to
1,553 pence, respectively.  Preferred shares of Volkswagen lost 2.9 percent to 141.45
euros. BMW decreased 2.8 percent to 65 euros. European car sales
are heading toward a 20-year low as registrations in March fell
10 percent, led by Germany’s auto market, which plummeted 17
percent, the Brussels-based  European Automobile Manufacturers’
Association , or ACEA, said today.  A measure of auto-related companies fell the most of the 19
industry groups on the Stoxx 600.  Tesco Sales  Tesco declined 3.9 percent to 369.8 pence after the U.K.’s
largest retailer said it will exit the U.S. and took a 1.2
billion-pound charge to end the Fresh & Easy business. So-called
trading profit fell 13 percent to 3.45 billion pounds in the 52
weeks ended Feb. 23, the company said.  BASF SE slid 3.8 percent to 65.55 euros, its lowest price
in almost five months, after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its
recommendation on the world’s biggest chemicals maker to
neutral, the equivalent of hold, from buy, citing above-average
downside risks to consensus forecasts.  Bayer AG slipped 4.3 percent to 77.58 euros after a U.S.
appeals court ruled the company’s patent on the birth control
pill Yaz is invalid, ensuring Actavis Inc. and Novartis AG’s
Sandoz unit can sell copies of the contraceptive.  ASML Holding NV (ASML)  climbed 2.5 percent to 52.55 euros.
Europe’s largest semiconductor-equipment supplier posted first-
quarter sales of 892 million euros, topping the 874 million-euro
analyst estimate. The company also announced a share buyback
program of as much as 1 billion euros and said Chief Executive
Officer Eric Meurice will step down as of July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
