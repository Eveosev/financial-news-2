Cattle futures rose to a one-week
high on signs of shrinking U.S. supplies of animals. Hog prices
posted the biggest gain in almost six weeks.  Feedlots probably purchased or placed 1.5 percent fewer
cattle last month compared to a year earlier, according to the
average of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The Department of
Agriculture will release inventory figures at 3 p.m. April 19 in
 Washington . At the start of 2013, the cattle herd was the
smallest since 1952 after the most-severe drought since the
1930s cut livestock-feed supplies and damaged pastures.  “There will be a period of time where you’re just not
going to have that many cattle come to market,”  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity Investments Co.
in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “The amount of
cattle in general is still going to be tight.”  Cattle futures for June delivery rose 1.1 percent to settle
at $1.21825 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.22, the highest for the
most-active contract since April 9. The commodity has dropped
7.9 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.7
percent to $1.475 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement rose 1.5 percent to 90.35
cents a pound, the biggest gain since March 7. The commodity has
climbed 5.4 percent this year.  Meat demand will rise as people grill outdoors in warmer
weather, Mayer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
