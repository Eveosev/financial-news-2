 Mortgage loan growth will slow to
about 2 percent to 4 percent in the next two years from 5.4
percent as home sales and prices cool, RBC Capital Markets said
today in a note.  Loan growth reached a recent peak of 13 percent in May
2008, according to Geoffrey Kwan and Sean Adamick, analysts at
the Royal Bank of Canada unit. Mortgage loan losses will remain
low partly due to employment growth, they said.  Growth rates over the next two years will be similar to the
1990s housing downturn, the analysts said.  Canada’s banks hold a 65 percent to 70 percent market share
of the C$1.2 trillion ($1.17 trillion) residential mortgage
market, RBC said. Almost 65 percent of the mortgage debt is
insured, through the government’s Canada Mortgage and Housing
Corp.,  Genworth MI Canada Inc. (MIC)  and Canada Guaranty Mortgage
Insurance Co.  Mortgage lenders and insurers that RBC covers have no more
than 8 percent of total loans exposed to the country’s condo
market, RBC said.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  has the most for
mortgage loans of condo borrowers and developers, at C$32
billion, followed by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at C$18
billion, the analysts said. Royal Bank and  Bank of Nova Scotia 
each have C$15 billion.  “We recognize there remain significant risks to the condo
market and the Toronto condo market in particular, given the
amount of activity currently and in recent years,” the analysts
wrote.  Condo sales in Toronto are slowing, unsold inventory
continues to rise and there are potentially almost 30,000 units
a year that could be completed in 2013 and 2014, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
