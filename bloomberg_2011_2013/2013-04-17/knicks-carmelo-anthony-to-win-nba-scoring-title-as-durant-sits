New York  Knicks forward  Carmelo Anthony  will win his first National Basketball Association
scoring title as  Kevin Durant  said he will sit out the Oklahoma
City Thunder’s regular-season finale.  Anthony, who won’t play the Knicks’ finale tonight against
the  Atlanta Hawks  while recovering from a shoulder injury and
resting for the playoffs, has a 28.7 points-per-game scoring
average, the best in the NBA. Durant is averaging 28.1 points
and would have needed to score 70 tonight against the Milwaukee
Bucks to pass Anthony for his fourth straight scoring title.
Durant leads the league in points scored with 2,280, having
played all 81 of the Thunder’s games. Anthony, who’s played 67
contests this season, has scored 1,920.  “SITTING OUT TONIGHT’S GAME, if you disappointed I didn’t
try to go for the scoring title, oh well!!!” Durant said in an
Instagram post.  Anthony, 28, will become the second Knicks player to
capture a scoring title, after Bernard King won it in 1984-85,
averaging 32.9 points per game. King was elected to the
basketball hall of fame earlier this month.  He finished second in the race for the NBA scoring title
while with the Denver Nuggets in 2006-07, averaging 28.9 points
per game to trail the Los Angeles Lakers’  Kobe Bryant , who
averaged 31.6.  For his 10-year career, Anthony has a 25 points-per-game
scoring average. His 17,846 total points rank 65th all-time.  All 30 NBA teams will be in action tonight as the NBA
regular season comes to a close. The Knicks, seeded No. 2 in the
Eastern Conference, will take on the  Boston Celtics  in the first
round of the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
