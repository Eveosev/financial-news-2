A case of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
2009, a first-growth Bordeaux red wine from Pauillac, sold for
5,625 pounds ($8,590) on the London-based Liv-ex wine exchange
today, its lowest level since February, according to Liv-ex data
on its Cellar Watch website.  The vintage fetched as much as 7,650 pounds a case on Liv-
ex in June 2010 as it first went on sale, and fell as low as
4,800 pounds last September amid a broader decline in the market
for top Bordeaux. The 2009 wines are the estate’s most expensive
of the past decade after its 2010s, according to merchant prices
collated by Liv-ex, and carry a 99+ rating from U.S. wine critic
 Robert Parker ’s website, its highest since the 1986 vintage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
