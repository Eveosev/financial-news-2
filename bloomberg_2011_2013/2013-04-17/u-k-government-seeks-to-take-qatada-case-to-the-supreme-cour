The U.K. is seeking to have the
 Supreme Court  review a ruling blocking the deportation of Abu Qatada, an Islamic cleric accused of having links to al-Qaeda,
back to his home country of  Jordan .  The U.K. Home Office today said it asked the court of
appeal for permission to appeal the case to the nation’s highest
tribunal.  “The government remains committed to deporting this
dangerous man and we continue to work with the Jordanians to
address the outstanding legal issues preventing deportation,” a
Home Office spokesman said in an e-mailed statement.  Abu Qatada, who denies links to al-Qaeda, was granted a
reprieve in November and later released on bail after a special
immigration judge ruled he shouldn’t be extradited because it
wasn’t clear if Jordan obtained evidence through torture. He was
re-arrested in March for allegedly breaching bail conditions and
remains in custody.  The long running battle to remove the 52-year-old from the
U.K. to Jordan to face terror charges has seen  Abu Qatada  in
jail for much of the last seven years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
