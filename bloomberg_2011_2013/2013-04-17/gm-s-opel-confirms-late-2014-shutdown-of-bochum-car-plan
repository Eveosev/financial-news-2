General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel unit
solidified plans to close its car plant in Bochum,  Germany , at
the end of 2014 after workers rejected a wage freeze, the first
shutdown of an auto factory in the country since World War II.  The Opel supervisory board approved managers’ decision on
halting vehicle production at the site, the Ruesselsheim,
Germany-based division said today in a statement.  GM’s European operations, which also include Opel’s U.K.
sister brand Vauxhall, have accumulated $18 billion in losses
since 1999. The Detroit-based carmaker has vowed to break even
in  Europe  by 2015, including plans outlined on April 10 to
invest 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) mainly to bring out 23 new
models and 13 engines in three years.  The company is attempting a turnaround amid a European
market that’s shrinking for a sixth consecutive year. Combined
Opel and Vauxhall first-quarter sales in the region declined 7.9
percent to 208,994 vehicles, according to trade group figures
released today. European industrywide deliveries fell 9.7
percent.  Workers at Bochum voted in March against forgoing pay
raises in exchange for maintaining production until the end of
2016 of the Zafira minivan at the site. GM tied the agreement to
a plan to expand a logistics center at Bochum and replace
carmaking there with parts production after 2016 that would have
maintained 1,200 of the factory’s more than 3,000 jobs.  The employment-preservation plan is “off the table” after
the concessions were rejected, Ulrich Weber, an Opel spokesman,
said today by phone. The carmaker has no plans to wind down the
Bochum logistics center, he said.  Opel employees at the other four German plants agreed in
March to wage freezes in return for GM’s pledge to refrain from
mass firings until the end of 2016. The carmaker hasn’t
indicated that it plans to shut any other plant besides Bochum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
