Officials at  Chile ’s National
Statistics Institute questioned the agency’s methodology for
measuring consumer prices, after analysts said the organization
may be underestimating inflation by as much as half.  In a letter received by Bloomberg, division chiefs said the
institute’s director Francisco Labbe had dismissed
recommendations made to modernize the methodology. The letter
was addressed to Labbe and was signed by five division directors
including Cristian Copaja, who heads up the office that
researches prices.  Institute employees have been studying ways to improve the
inflation methodology and consulted an international expert
after they raised questions in 2010 about clothing prices, which
have fallen faster than any other item, according to the letter.
Labbe’s refusal to accept their recommendations hurts the
institute’s credibility as analysts question their reports, the
officials said.  “The constant public controversies unfairly call into
question the quality of the work and advances made so far, in
addition to generating uncertainty about the other statistical
products,” according to the letter. “It isn’t healthy for the
country’s statistical institutionalism.”  Labbe didn’t immediately return a call from Bloomberg
seeking comment on the allegations.  Analysts including Morgan Stanley’s Luis Arcentales and
Jorge Selaive, a chief economist at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA) , have questioned the institute’s methodology for
measuring prices, with the latter saying annual inflation would
be closer to 3 percent than the 1.5 percent reported in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
