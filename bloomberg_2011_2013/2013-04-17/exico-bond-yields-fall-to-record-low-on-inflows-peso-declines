Mexico ’s benchmark peso bond yields
fell to record lows as foreign investors poured into the
country’s higher-yielding assets to escape low rates at home.  Yields on securities maturing in 2024 declined four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.71 percent at 8:49 a.m.
in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is
the lowest level on a closing basis since the bonds began
trading in 2005.  “It’s part of this whole global search for yield,” said
Vivienne Taberer, who helps manage about $14.5 billion in
emerging-market debt and currencies at Investec Asset
Management. “It’s exaggerated by a relatively good Mexican
story. There’s a bet out there.”  Mexico bond yields are falling as the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s plans
for unprecedented monetary stimulus fuels some “speculative
positions,” according to Taberer. The BOJ said this month that
it will double the monetary base by the end of 2014 through
purchases of government bonds in what will be  Japan ’s biggest
round of asset purchases ever.  The percentage of Mexican fixed-rate bonds held by global
investors surged to a 13-year high of almost 57 percent this
month, according to data from the central bank.  The peso depreciated 0.6 percent to 12.2126 after rallying
on April 11 to 12.0441, the strongest level since August 2011.
Its 5.3 percent gain versus the dollar in 2013 is the best
performance among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
