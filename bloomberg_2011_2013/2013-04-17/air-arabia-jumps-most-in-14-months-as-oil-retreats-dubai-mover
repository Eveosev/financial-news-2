Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI)  climbed the most in
more than a year on investor bets a slump in  oil prices  will
boost earnings at the  Middle East ’s biggest no-frills airline.  The stock jumped 4.7 percent, the  biggest increase since
February 2012 , to 91.4 fils at the close in Dubai. About 36.6
million shares traded in Dubai today, or 2.7 times the three-

benchmark  DFM General Index. (DFMGI)  The gauge gained 0.1 percent.  Brent
crude  declined for the sixth day, retreating 0.6 percent to
$99.31 a barrel at 2:35 p.m. in Dubai, extending the slump this
month to 9.7 percent.  “With the drop of fuel prices, margins are expected to
improve,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al
Fajer Securities. “The company has a solid strategy in overseas
expansion and investors are expecting solid results for in first
quarter.”  Air Arabia last year started flights to nine additional
destinations from its hub in Sharjah,  United Arab Emirates . That
helped boost passenger numbers by 13 percent to 5.3 million in
2012 and profit by 56 percent. First-quarter net income may rise
9.5 percent to 52.2 million dirhams ($14.2 million), according
to Securities & Investments Co. estimates on Bloomberg.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its price estimate for the
airline in February to 1.14 dirhams. Six analysts recommend
investors buy the shares, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Five, including Goldman Sachs, have a hold rating on
the stock and one advises selling it, the data show.  Air Arabia shares have gained 9.5 percent this year,
