West Texas Intermediate oil fell to
a four-month low as equities declined and U.S. output rose to a
20-year high. Brent slid below a key technical level at $97.91.  WTI dropped for the fourth time in five days as U.S. stocks
tumbled on disappointing corporate earnings and after the dollar
strengthened against the euro. Output was 7.2 million barrels a
day, the most since July 1992, and fuel use slid, according to
the Energy Information Administration, the Department of
Energy’s statistical arm. Brent breached the 23.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement level from 2012’s low to the year’s high.  “It’s a big panic in the market,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .
“Equities are getting beat up and the DOE report is certainly
not helping. That $97.91 is a crucial number. Losses accelerated
as soon as we broke down that number.”  WTI for May delivery fell $2.04, or 2.3 percent, to $86.68
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Dec. 14. The volume of all futures traded was
44 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day at 3:16
p.m. in New York. Prices have tumbled 8.4 percent since April
10.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 28 percent, heading for the highest level this year. It
was up from 24.7 percent yesterday.  Brent for June settlement slipped $2.22, or 2.2 percent, to
end the session at $97.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the lowest level since July 2. Volume
was 21 percent above the 100-day average. Futures have dropped 8
percent in the past six days.  June Brent’s premium over the same-month WTI narrowed to
$10.72 from yesterday’s $10.88.  Equities Slump  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped as much as 2
percent as earnings from companies Bank of America Corp. to
 Textron Inc. (TXT)  missed analysts’ estimates. The S&P’s GSCI Index of
24 commodities dropped as much as 1.8 percent, with the biggest
declines in base metals and energy.  The dollar advanced as much as 1.3 percent to $1.3002 per
euro, the strongest level since February. A rising dollar and
weaker euro reduce dollar-denominated oil’s appeal as an
investment alternative.  “Equities continue to be weak and the dollar is strong,”
said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities research at IAF
Advisors in Houston. “They are the primary drivers of the oil
market now.”  U.S. Production  U.S. oil  output  gained 0.4 percent in the week ended April
12, the EIA reported. Gasoline consumption dropped for a second
week to 8.38 million barrels a day. Demand for distillate fuels,
including diesel and heating oil, tumbled 5.9 percent to 3.63
million barrels a day.  “Product demand shrank,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It’s
adding some selling pressure to oil. The report is bearish. With
the equity market down and the stronger dollar, the oil market
is under pressure today.”  U.S. stockpiles  decreased  1.23 million barrels to 387.6
million last week, the EIA said. They were at the highest level
since July 1990 in the prior week. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had expected a gain of 1.2 million.  Imports of crude oil slumped 3.7 percent to 7.43 million
barrels a day.  “The crude draw is primarily associated with lower
imports,” Cooper said. “Inventories are actually still pretty
high. Certainly the crude production number is bearish and
demand is poor.”  API Report  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said
yesterday that stockpiles slid 6.66 million barrels last week.
The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
while the government requires that reports be filed with the EIA
for its weekly survey.  “Even though the crude inventory was down, it was not
nearly as bad as what the API released yesterday,” said Jacob Correll, a Louisville, Kentucky-based analyst at Summit Energy
Inc., which manages more than $20 billion in companies’ annual
energy spending. The EIA “report gives no reason to stop the
downward trend.”  BNP Forecast  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  cut its 2013 forecasts for Brent and WTI to
reflect the price drop in the first quarter,  Harry Tchilinguirian , BNP’s head of commodity markets strategy in
 London , said in an e-mailed report. “Loose” global monetary
policy and political threats to supply will support prices in
the second half of the year, he said.  BNP trimmed its 2013 Brent estimate to $108 a barrel from
$115 and WTI to $95 from $100, while advising investors to bet
on a rebound in the second half of the year.  “Fundamentally, we should be at these prices or maybe even
a little bit lower,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based
commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “Prices
should be trading around $85. We are seeing the dollar up and
equities down, and that’s definitely putting some pressure on
crude.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 664,602
contracts as of 3:19 p.m. It totaled 733,796 contracts
yesterday, 25 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.76 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
