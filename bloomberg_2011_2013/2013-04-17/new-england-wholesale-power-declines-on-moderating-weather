Wholesale electricity from  Maine  to
Connecticut dropped for the second time in three days as mild
weather reduced demand.  New England prices slid 14 percent as the region’s grid
operator predicted peak demand today would decrease by 0.6
percent. The high in Boston today may be 66 degrees Fahrenheit
(19 Celsius), 10 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College , Pennsylvania.  Power on the six-state grid fell $6.92 to $39.72 a
megawatt-hour at 4:21 p.m. from yesterday’s on-peak average,
data from ISO New England Inc. show.  Electricity consumption will decline to 14,840 megawatts
during the hour ending at 9 p.m. from yesterday’s peak of 14,923
megawatts in the same hour, the grid operator said in its
 morning report . Available supply, based on regional generation
and imports from nearby areas, climbed to 18,911 megawatts today
from 18,653 megawatts  yesterday , ISO New England said.  Prices gained in  New York  and fell in the 13-state Eastern
grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC.  On-peak power  for  New York City  rose $16.4475, or 29
percent, to $72.76 a megawatt-hour from yesterday’s average,
according to the state grid operator. At PJM’s benchmark Western
hub, which includes prices at points from Erie, Pennsylvania, to
Washington, power slipped by $1.83, or 3.6 percent, to $49.20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
