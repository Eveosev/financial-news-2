German bunds rose, with two-year
yields dropping below zero, after Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann was reported by Dow Jones as saying the  European
Central Bank  may cut  interest rates  if data warrants.  The nation’s  10-year yield  dropped the most in three weeks
as European stocks extended this month’s slide, boosting demand
for safer assets. Italian bonds gained, with 10-year yields
falling to the lowest level in seven weeks, as investors
submitted orders for more than 17 billion euros ($22.2 billion)
at a retail debt sale. Slovenia’s bonds surged after it sold
more than double its target at an auction of 18-month bills.  “It’s a combination of the Weidmann comments and a general
risk-off move in equities,” said Owen Callan, an analyst at
Danske Bank A/S in Dublin. “There’s a lot of uncertainty and
bunds have got a boost. The demand for the Italian retail bonds
showed there is a large amount of private wealth in that
country, which can be harnessed. It’s a good sign they could
close the sale early.”  Germany ’s  two-year yield  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.007 percent at 4:46 p.m.  London  time
after falling to minus 0.001 percent, the lowest level since
April 5. The 0.25 percent note due in March 2015 rose 0.04, or
40 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.46.  The 10-year bund  yield  dropped five basis points to 1.23
percent, the biggest decline since March 27.  Bunds rallied as Weidmann’s comments suggested policy
makers may lower the ECB’s  main refinancing rate  from 0.75
percent as soon as its next meeting on May 2.  German Auction  German securities also gained as borrowing costs dropped to
a record when the nation auctioned an additional 3.35 billion
euros of 10-year debt. It sold the securities at an average
yield of 1.28 percent, below the previous record of 1.31 percent
set on July 11.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 (SXXP)  Index of shares dropped 1.5 percent,
extending this month’s slide to 3.4 percent.  Italy’s  benchmark bonds  advanced for a second day after the
demand from retail investors prompted the Treasury to close the
offering of inflation-linked notes two days early.  Investors ordered 8.07 billion euros of the four-year
Italian bonds being sold to individuals yesterday, after
requesting 8.98 billion euros on April 15. The two-day amount
was near the 18 billion-euro record gained over four days at the
previous sale in October.  ‘Good Demand’  “Italy got the size they needed,” said  Peter Chatwell , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “It increases the perception that
there’s good demand for Italian paper.”  The Italian  10-year yield  fell seven basis points to 4.25
percent after dropping to 4.21 percent, the lowest level since
Feb. 25.  The decline took yields to the lowest since the second day
of voting in the nation’s February elections, when inconclusive
results prompted an increase in borrowing costs. Italian
lawmakers will begin the election of a new president on April 18
as the legislature seeks to end a political impasse.  Spanish bonds also gained, with the  five-year yield 
dropping seven basis points to 3.33 percent after falling to
3.29 percent, the lowest level since November 2010.  Slovenia, the fourth-smallest economy in the euro area,
sold 1.1 billion euros of 18-month bills, compared with a target
of 500 million euros. The nation missed its goal at a bill
auction last week.  The yield on Slovenian bonds due in October 2022 fell 37
basis points to 5.94 percent.  Portugal ’s borrowing costs increased as it sold 1.5 billion
euros of 12-month bills. The securities due in April 2014 were
issued at an average yield of 1.394 percent, compared with 1.277
percent at a previous auction on Feb. 20. The debt agency also
sold 250 million euros of three-month bills.  German bonds returned 0.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds gained 2.1 percent and  Spain ’s rose 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
