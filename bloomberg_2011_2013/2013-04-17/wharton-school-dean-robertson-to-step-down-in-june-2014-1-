Thomas S. Robertson, dean of the
 University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School, will step down in
June 2014 after seven years in the position.  A search committee will be formed to find a replacement,
Malini Doddamani, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia-based
school, said today in an e-mail. Robertson will join the Wharton
marketing faculty and pursue research interests.  Robertson has been Wharton’s dean since 2007. He was a
faculty member at the school from 1971 to 1994, when he left to
become deputy dean of the London Business School. Robertson held
several jobs at Emory University from 1998 to 2007, including
dean of its Goizueta Business School, before returning to Penn.  About  5,000  students attend Wharton, including
undergraduates and those seeking master’s degrees in business
administration or doctorates, according to the school’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
