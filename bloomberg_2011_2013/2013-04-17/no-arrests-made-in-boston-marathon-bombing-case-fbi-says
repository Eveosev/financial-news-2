No arrests have been made in the Boston Marathon bombing case as investigators obtained video of a possible suspect in the attack, federal law enforcement officials said.  Federal Bureau of Investigation  spokesman Jason Pack said in an e-mail that no one has been arrested. Images from store security cameras near the April 15 bombings may lead to an arrest, according to one law enforcement official briefed on the matter who asked for anonymity to discuss the investigation.  Authorities combing the site of the Boston Marathon bombing have recovered key bomb parts that may provide clues in the case, including a piece of  circuit board  and the lid of a pressure cooker blown onto a rooftop.  The breakthroughs come less than 48 hours after the highest-profile act of terror in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks on  New York  City and Washington in 2001.  There were conflicting reports about whether someone was in custody. While saying that the investigation has been making progress, the officials cautioned that it is still too early to identify anyone as a suspect.  The Associated Press and  CNN , citing unnamed officials, reported that a suspect has been taken into custody. The Boston Globe, citing unidentified officials, reported that authorities have an image of a possible suspect carrying a black bag at one of the two places where the bombs were placed.  The clearest image of the suspected bomber was captured by a surveillance camera at a Lord & Taylor department store located directly across the street, the Globe reported.
