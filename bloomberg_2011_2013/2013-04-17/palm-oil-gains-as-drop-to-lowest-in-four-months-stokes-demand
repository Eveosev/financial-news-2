Palm oil  advanced on speculation
that prices near a four-month low will increase demand for the
tropical commodity used in food and fuel.  The contract for July delivery climbed as much as 0.4
percent to 2,310 ringgit ($763) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives and ended the morning session at 2,300
ringgit. Futures, which have fallen for three straight weeks,
closed at 2,293 ringgit on April 15, the lowest price this year.  Most commodities rebounded today with the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of 24 commodities climbing as much as 0.3 percent
after touching the lowest level since July yesterday. Brent
crude recovered after dropping below $100 a barrel for the first
time since July amid signs the global economy may slow, curbing
fuel demand.  “I see good demand from  India , a lot of buying is taking
place at these levels,” Vijay Mehta, a director at Commodity
Links Pte, said by phone from Singapore.  Exports from Malaysia fell 4 percent to 648,275 tons in the
first 15 days of April from the same period in March, Intertek
said April 15. Shipments declined 7.2 percent to 629,990 tons in
the same period, Societe Generale de Surveillance estimates.  Soybean oil for July delivery was little changed at 49.13
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade and soybeans were
also little changed at $13.7675 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery lost 0.2 percent to
6,138  yuan  ($994) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , while
soybean oil rose 0.2 percent to 7,672 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
