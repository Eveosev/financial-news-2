Fairway Group Holdings Corp. (FWM) , the
grocery-store chain focused on greater New York, surged 33
percent in its public debut after pricing its initial stock
offering above the proposed range.  The stock climbed to $17.35 at the close in New York after
advancing 42 percent to $18.41. Fairway and existing owners
raised $177.5 million selling 13.65 million shares for $13 each,
according to a statement, after offering them for $10 to $12.
The shares, which represent a 33 percent stake, are listed on
the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol FWM.  New York-based Fairway expects about $159 million of net
proceeds from the IPO and is valued at about $536 million at the
IPO price, according to the statement and data compiled by
Bloomberg. The grocer, which started as a small neighborhood
market in the 1930s, sold shares publicly after expansion in
suburban New York, New Jersey and  Connecticut  helped boost sales
for at least three years in a row.  The food seller, which has 12 locations, said in a
regulatory filing that it’s planning to add stores in
population-dense metropolitan areas and has the potential for
more than 300 new U.S. shops. Sales at Fairway rose 14 percent
to $554.9 million in the year ended April 1, 2012. The company
had a net loss of $11.9 million that year.  Sales at U.S. grocery stores may begin to increase after
falling 2.1 percent in 2012, according to a report from industry
researcher IBISWorld Inc. in Santa Monica,  California . Revenue
is projected to rise 0.4 percent a year, on average, and reach
$500.9 billion in 2017, the data show.  IPO Resurgence  Fairway joins companies in industries from technology to
energy that are taking advantage of greater investor appetite
for new equities as U.S. stocks  surge  to record highs this year.
U.S. IPOs raised 37 percent more last quarter than they did in
the year-earlier period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Fairway competes with Austin, Texas-based  Whole Foods
Market Inc. (WFM)  and closely held Trader Joe’s, as well as big-box
discounters  Target Corp. (TGT)  and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Fairway stores
sell organic milk and baby food, as well as gluten-free breads
and pancake mix.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp., Jefferies
Group Inc. and William Blair & Co. led the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
