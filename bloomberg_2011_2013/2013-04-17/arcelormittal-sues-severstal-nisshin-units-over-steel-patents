ArcelorMittal (MT)  USA LLC, part of the
world’s biggest steelmaker, sued units of  OAO Severstal (CHMF) ,
Russia’s second-largest steelmaker, and  Nisshin Steel Holdings
Co. (5413)  for allegedly infringing a patent for metal used in auto
parts.  Michigan-based Severstal Dearborn and West Virginia-based
Wheeling-Nisshin Inc. misappropriated technology for the high-
strength, aluminum-coated metal, the U.S. arm of Luxembourg-
based ArcelorMittal said in a complaint filed yesterday in U.S.
District Court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  ArcelorMittal “has the sole and exclusive right and
license” under the patent, and Severstal and Nisshin should pay
damages after a  jury trial , the company said in the complaint.  The lawsuit joins a similar action also filed yesterday in
the same court by ArcelorMittal against  AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS) 
over the same patent.  Nisshin President Toshinori Miki didn’t answer the phone at
the company’s offices in Tokyo before regular business hours.  “For the past three years, Severstal has successfully
defended itself” against ArcelorMittal claims, and “it will
continue to successfully defend itself against this most recent
complaint,” said Katya Pruett, a Severstal spokeswoman, in an
e-mailed message.  The case is ArcelorMittal v. Severstal Dearborn, 13-
cv-00686, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To see the patent in the lawsuit, click: RE44,153.  To contact the reporter on this story:
