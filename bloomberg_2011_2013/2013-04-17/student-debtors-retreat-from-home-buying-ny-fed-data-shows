Student-loan borrowers under 30 are
retreating from the housing and auto markets, an analysis of
data by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  shows.  Those with student debt show higher risk and have lower
credit scores compared with those without it, according to the
bank’s  Liberty Street Economics  blog today.  Outstanding educational debt is $966 billion, including
loans taken out by students and their parents, the bank reported
Feb. 28. More people taking loans for college and graduate
school are failing to pay off their debt, with almost a third of
borrowers in repayment delinquent at the end of last year,
according to the Fed. Student loan debt is dragging on the
economy, with young people less able to participate in buying
homes or cars.  “Now, for the first time in at least 10 years, 30-year-
olds with no history of  student loans  are more likely to have
home-secured debt than those with a history of student loans,”
wrote authors Meta Brown and Sydnee Caldwell.  The share of 25-year-olds with student debt has increased
to 43 percent last year from 25 percent in 2003. The average
student-loan balance among those 25-year-olds with student debt
grew by 91 percent over the period, to $20,326 from $10,649.  In its report on student loan data, the  New York  Fed
analyzes a sample of data provided by the  Equifax Inc. (EFX)  credit
bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
