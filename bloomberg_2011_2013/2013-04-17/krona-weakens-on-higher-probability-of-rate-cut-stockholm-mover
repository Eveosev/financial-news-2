Sweden’s krona weakened to its
lowest level against the euro in almost two months after the
central bank left its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for a
second meeting and delayed tightening to the second half of
2014.  The krona depreciated as much as 1.1 percent against the
euro to 8.4763, its weakest level since Feb. 25, and traded at
8.4685 as of 2:26 p.m. in Stockholm. It weakened as much as 1.5
percent against the dollar to 6.4615, its steepest daily
depreciation in 11 months. The krona slipped against all the
world’s 16 major currencies, including the British pound, the
Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.  While the Riksbank left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 1 percent, as expected by all 21 economists in a
Bloomberg survey, it reduced its forecast for the benchmark rate
to 0.9 percent for the first quarter next year from a previous
assessment of 1.2 percent.  “With the signs of renewed concerns over international
growth and more expansive monetary policy from international
central banks we see a large probability that the Riksbank will
cut rates again,” SEB AB said in a report today. “Even if it
is far from a certain call, we have revised our forecast
downwards and now predict a rate cut to 0.75 percent in July.”  SEB added that while the decision to keep the rate
unchanged was widely expected, the repo rate path “was
significantly more dovish than expected as it increased the
probability for a rate cut in April” to 6.5 basis points from 5
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
