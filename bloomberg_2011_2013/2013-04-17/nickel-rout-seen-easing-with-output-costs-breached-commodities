Nickel, the worst-performing
industrial metal in the past year, is bottoming as prices fall
below the costs of producing cheaper substitutes, curbing supply
as consumption rebounds.  Prices have fallen 13 percent in the past year and are now
below the cost for  China  to produce nickel pig iron, or NPI, a
substitute derived from lower-grade ores, at an average $15,700
a metric ton, Barclays Plc says. Nickel, which traded at $15,587
yesterday, will go as low as $14,500 this year, the median of 12
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The metal retreated in four of the past six years as China
responded to shortages by adding NPI output that now accounts
for 18 percent of world supply, from 3 percent in 2006. Slumping
prices may slow the expansion just as demand accelerates at the
fastest pace in three years and orders to withdraw record stocks
from warehouses reach more than six times the average over the
past decade. Nickel will trade at $18,100 in the fourth quarter,
or 16 percent more than now, the median of 25 estimates shows.  “You have less efficient producers in China, so they are
more prone to cut back on production if they see prices fall
much,” said Alexandra Knight at National Australia Bank Ltd. in
 Melbourne , the best forecaster for industrial metals tracked by
Bloomberg over the eight quarters. “We are still forecasting
growth of 8 percent for China in 2013. That should be supportive
of the base metals market over the year ahead.”  Trading Partners  Nickel fell 8.8 percent this year on the London Metal
Exchange as the LMEX index of six metals dropped 8.2 percent.
The decline compares with a 6.2 percent retreat in the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities and a 5.9 percent gain in
the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities. The U.S. Dollar
Index, a gauge against six major trading partners, rose 2.9
percent and Treasuries returned 0.6 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  Global output will exceed demand for a third year as China
makes the most ever nickel pig iron, or NPI, a substitute for
the purer metal traded in futures, Morgan Stanley estimates.
Production will outpace demand by 88,000 tons this year, or more
than seven months of U.S. consumption, Barclays estimates. While
that’s unchanged from last year, the projected surplus is almost
nine times more than the bank was forecasting as recently as
October. New projects from  Sherritt International Corp. (S)  in
Madagascar to  Vale SA (VALE5)  in  New Caledonia  are also adding supply as
Chinese NPI output expands for at least the eighth consecutive
year, Morgan Stanley says.  Stainless Steel  Both are the consequence of prices that reached a record
$51,800 in 2007, spurring new investments. Mining companies had
failed to keep pace with the 10-fold expansion in China’s
stainless-steel output from 2000 to 2006, Barclays says. The
alloy accounts for about 65 percent of global nickel demand,
according to the International Nickel Study Group in Lisbon.
China now consumes 40 percent of the base metal, more than
double the proportion seven years ago.  Annual gluts since 2011 caused inventories tracked by the
LME to double since November 2011 to a record 169,386 tons,
exchange data show. Morgan Stanley expects demand to expand 10
percent in 2013, the most since 2010. Global stainless steel
output will rise 4.9 percent to a record 36.3 million tons this
year, according to MEPS (International) Ltd., an industry
consultant in Sheffield,  England .  Orders to withdraw metal from warehouses, known as canceled
warrants, doubled to 24,528 tons this year, compared with an
average of 3,721 tons over the past decade, according to LME
data. Consumption, valued at $28.4 billion last year, is
expanding as the  International Monetary Fund  predicts global
economic growth will accelerate to 3.3 percent this year, from
3.2 percent in 2012.  Forward Sale  As much as 30 percent of inventories may be tied up in
financing deals and unavailable to consumers, according to
Societe Generale SA. The accords typically involve a
simultaneous purchase of metal for nearby delivery and a forward
sale to take advantage of a market in contango, when later-dated
contracts cost more than those with nearer dates. To be
profitable, the spread must exceed storage, financing and
insurance. The LME’s monthly contracts are in contango through
2018.  Some producers are still making money, with OAO GMK  Norilsk
Nickel (GMKN) , the largest, expected to report an increase of about 50
percent in its most widely tracked measure of profit to $3.25
billion this year, the mean of 17 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg shows. Shares of the Moscow-based company fell 17
percent to $15.36 in London trading this year and will rally to
$20.83 in 12 months, according to the average of 15 forecasts.  Acid Leaching  Sherritt International’s shares fell 21 percent to C$4.57
since the start of January and will reach C$7.23 in 12 months,
according to the average of 10 forecasts.  Mining companies are adding the most new supply through a
process known as high-pressure acid leaching, designed to handle
lower-grade laterite ores. Output from six of them will more
than double to 205,000 tons by 2018, Morgan Stanley estimates.  The surge in Chinese nickel  pig iron  is a growing threat
because producers have cut overhead through new technology.
Electric arc furnaces and rotary kiln electric furnaces with
costs as low as $14,400 are superseding blast furnaces that made
NPI at $23,000 a ton, according to Barclays, which cited data
from Brook Hunt, a research unit of Wood Mackenzie Ltd.  The new NPI technology is also improving the quality of
output, with nickel content as high as 15 percent, from 3
percent in 2006-2007, widening its uses across stainless steel
grades, according to Barclays. China’s NPI production will
advance 16 percent to 395,000 tons this year, Macquarie Group
Ltd. forecasts.  “We still have massive infrastructure that have to be put
in play in China and when you look at prices, they should be up
from here,” said  Jonathan Barratt , the chief executive officer
of Barratt’s Bulletin, a commodity newsletter in Sydney. “But
in the short term, you can’t get too excited.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
