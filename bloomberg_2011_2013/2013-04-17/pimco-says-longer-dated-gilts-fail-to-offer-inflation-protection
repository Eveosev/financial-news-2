U.K. government bonds maturing in
30 years are unattractive because they fail to offer adequate
protection against inflation, according to Michael Amey, a  money
manager  at Pacific Investment Management Co.  The company, which manages the world’s biggest bond fund,
holds fewer of the 30-year securities than are recommended in
the benchmark index it follows because any decline in yields
will be capped by the level of inflation, Amey said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with Francine Lacqua and Manus Cranny in  London .  The  30-year gilt yield  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.04 percent at 2:08 p.m. London time. The
yield dropped as low as 2.92 percent on April 8 before rising
back to 3.09 percent three days later.  “Every time we dip below 3 percent we don’t spend a lot of
time there, we go back up again,” Amey said. “If we know
there’s no demand at 3 percent then ultimately yields have to go
slightly higher. Flat real yields on a 30-year bond don’t look
like a great deal to me so I’m still underweight.”  U.K. consumer prices rose 2.8 percent in March from a year
earlier, the  Office for National Statistics  said yesterday in
London. The  inflation rate  has been above the Bank of England’s
target of 2 percent every month starting in December 2009.  The so-called  real yield  on 30-year gilts at 0.24 percent
today compares with as high as 1.02 percent on Oct. 17.  Inflation is likely to remain above 2 percent even as oil
prices trade near the lowest since July, Amey said.  Brent crude  dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time
since July yesterday. Oil for June settlement fell 1 percent
today to $98.90 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Gilts due in 25 years or longer returned 1.7 percent this
year through yesterday, compared to a 1.1 percent gain for all
maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
