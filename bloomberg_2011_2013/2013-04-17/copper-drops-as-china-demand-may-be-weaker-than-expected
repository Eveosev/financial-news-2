Copper declined on concern that
demand from  China , the biggest user, will weaken after the
International Monetary Fund cut its forecast.  Metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.6
percent to $7,260 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,263 at 10:36 a.m. in  Shanghai . Copper for delivery in
July on the Comex in New York lost 0.6 percent to $3.3025 a
pound.  The IMF trimmed its forecast for China’s 2013 growth to 8
percent from 8.2 percent after World Bank cut the forecast to
8.3 percent on April 15. New-home sales in Beijing fell 37
percent from March to a daily average volume of 406 units in
April 8-14, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the city’s
housing development commission.  “Economic uncertainties and expectations for a surplus in
the second half led to weaker restocking than usual,” Janet Kong, an analyst at China International Capital Corp., said in a
research report today. “It’s fairly difficult to see the price
rebounding to the high in February.”  CICC lowered its average copper price forecast this year to
$7,600 a ton from $7,910.  Copper for delivery in August on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 52,930  yuan  ($8,571) a ton. On
the LME, aluminum, lead, and nickel were little changed, while
tin gained.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
