Rates for tankers hauling oil-
product cargoes are expected to show a “gradual” improvement
as fleet growth is stabilizing, according to  D/S Norden A/S. (DNORD)   Following are comments by Lars Bagge Christensen, executive
vice-president and head of Norden’s tanker department, who spoke
at the third Scandinavian Shipping and Ship Finance Conference
in Copenhagen today.  On refined oil-product cargoes:  “About 45 percent of European refining capacity is
exported. There is a move to transport more refined products and
less crude.”  On U.S. imports and exports:  Gasoline shipments from  Europe  to the U.S. East Coast “are
declining in the longer term, over the next three to five years.
U.S. Gulf Coast shipments to Latin America are increasing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
