French President  Francois Hollande 
disregarded calls to ease austerity, sticking to a plan to trim
 government spending  this year and next in the face of a stalled
economy and slumping popularity.  French  gross domestic product  will expand 0.1 percent this
year and 1.2 percent in 2014, while the budget deficit will be
3.7 percent and 2.9 percent of GDP, according to projections
Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  presented to cabinet today.  Hitting the budget targets will require Hollande’s
Socialist government to trim public spending by 14 billion euros
($18.4 billion) next year, representing an unprecedented effort.
For Hollande, whose is less popular than any president since
1981 according to a CSA poll published April 5, the plan is in
keeping with a strategy of economic revival before the next
election in 2017.  “ France  is undergoing a recovery effort,” Prime Minister
Jean-Marc Ayrault said earlier today on France Inter radio.
“It’s a huge undertaking.”  The broad projections don’t constitute a formal budget,
although they will be considered by lawmakers over the coming
week before being sent to the European Commission as part of
France’s commitments under the euro area’s stability pact.  The finance ministry estimates the “structural”  budget
deficit , or the gap excluding the impact of the economic cycle,
at 2 percent of GDP this year and 1 percent next year. The
deficit reduction effort will amount to a 1.8 percent cut this
year and a 1 percent cut in 2014, under its projections.  Public spending is slated to peak at 56.9 percent of GDP
this year, falling to 56.4 percent next year and 53.9 percent in
2017.  Of spending cuts planned for 2014, 7.5 billion euros will
come from reducing state spending, 5 billion euros from the
social security budget and 1.5 billion euros from cuts by local
governments. In addition, new taxes will raise about 6 billion
euros, the  finance ministry  said.  A part of the savings is in the pipeline as part of the
overhaul of the pension system for executives agreed on March
14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
