The cost to insure the debt of
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  surged to the highest in four years after
Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade the company’s
bonds.  The review of Barrick’s Baa1 debt rating was prompted by a
legal challenge to its $8.5 billion project in the Andes,
Moody’s said in a statement. Toronto-based Barrick is the
biggest producer of the precious metal with $7.5 billion of
bonds.  Credit-default swaps to protect Barrick bonds from default
for five years jumped 11 basis points to 214, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. The
contracts last surpassed 214 basis points in March 2009.  A court victory by indigenous communities to halt
construction on the Chilean side of the Pascua-Lama project
poses “challenges” to Barrick and “uncertainty with respect
to the cost and timing” of the project, Moody’s said.  Credit swaps, which typically fall as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates, pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Gold futures in New York had a 9.3 percent drop April 15,
the biggest decline for a most-active contract since March 17,
1980. Bullion lost ground as the U.S. recovery gained momentum,
the dollar rose and Federal Reserve policy makers signaled they
may scale back on stimulus, curbing demand for gold as a haven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
