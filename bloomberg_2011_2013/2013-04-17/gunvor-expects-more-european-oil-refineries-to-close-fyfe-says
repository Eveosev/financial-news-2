Gunvor Group Ltd. expects more
European oil refineries to close in the next two to three years
amid declining profits, according to  David Fyfe , the company’s
head of market research and analysis.  “European refiners are going to continue to struggle,
particularly with new refining capacity in Asia and the  Middle
East  coming on stream,” Fyfe said today in an interview at the
Financial Times Global Commodities Summit in Lausanne,
Switzerland.  The energy trader purchased refineries last year in
Ingolstadt, Germany, and Antwerp,  Belgium , from insolvent
refiner Petroplus Holdings AG.  “We’re quite happy that the assets we have are resilient
to withstand those headwinds,” he said.  Producers of middle distillate fuels such as diesel, gasoil
and jet fuel will probably fare better because of rising demand
for those products compared to gasoline, Fyfe said.  “Gasoline in the Atlantic Basin remains troubled,” he
said. “The European arena looks the most challenged going
forward. It’s going to be tough.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
