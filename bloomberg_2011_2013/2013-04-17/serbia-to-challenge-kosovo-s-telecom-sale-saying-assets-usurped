Serbia said it will challenge
 Kosovo ’s attempt to sell Posta dhe Telekomunikacioni i Kosoves
Sh.A. phone company, claiming ownership over assets created
before Kosovo’s 2008 secession from the Balkan nation.  Serbia, which refuses to recognize the breakaway province
as a state, reacted to Kosovo’s  announcement  last week that it
got a 277 million-euro ($365 million) offer for a 75 percent
stake in the landline and mobile services provider known as PTK
from  ACP Axos Capital  GmbH from Germany and Phoenix, Arizona-
based Najafi Cos LLC allied with  BT Group Plc. (BT/A)   The sale is conducted by “illegal bodies, without
authorization or participation by the actual owner,” Serbia’s
Office for Kosovo and Metohija said on its  website . It said the
assets belong to Belgrade-based, state-owned Telekom Srbija AD,
the Serb monopoly until the 1998-99 war over Kosovo, and warned
about “legal consequences” if the assets are divested.  PTK has about 1 million mobile and 100,000 landline users
in the nation of 1.8 million people. It’s Kosovo’s second
attempt to sell the profitable Pristina-based company after a
tender failed in 2011 over a corruption investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
