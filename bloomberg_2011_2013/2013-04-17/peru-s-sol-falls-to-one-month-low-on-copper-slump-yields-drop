Peru’s sol fell to a one-month low
as a weaker outlook for global growth fueled a sell-off in
copper, the South American country’s top export.  The sol depreciated 0.2 percent at 2.5940 per  U.S. dollar 
at 1:58 p.m. in  Lima , the weakest level on a closing basis since
March 18, according to prices from Datatec.  Copper fell the most in a year after the  International
Monetary Fund  lowered its forecast yesterday for global growth
and predicted that China, the world’s biggest consumer of
industrial metals, would grow less than earlier expected. Peru
is the world’s third-largest copper and zinc producer, with
metals accounting for about two-thirds of exports.  “The sol has to lose some ground,”  Pedro Tuesta , a Latin
America economist at 4Cast Inc., said in a telephone interview
from Washington.  The yield on the 7.84 percent sol bond due in August 2020
dropped less than one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.73 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
increased 0.01 centimo to 125.97 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
