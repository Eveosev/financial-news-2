YPF SA (YPFD) ,  Argentina ’s largest oil
company, signed contracts to export crude as its  La Plata 
refinery operates at about half of normal output levels after a
fire earlier this month, a government official said.  YPF will export about 660,000 cubic meters (4.15 million
barrels) from the San Jorge gulf basin over the next two months,
said the official, who asked not to be named because the
arrangement hasn’t been made public.  The state-owned company will have to spend an additional
$400 million to import fuel to supply service stations after a
flood and fire at La Plata reduced output. The cost will be
mitigated by the crude exports that probably will start this
week at ports from the southern provinces of  Santa Cruz  and
Chubut, the official said.  YPF spokesman Alejandro Di Lazzaro and the Planning
Ministry’s Horacio Mizrahi declined to comment in e-mailed
responses to questions on crude exports arrangements.  YPF hasn’t exported crude in the last year, according to
Energy Department  data . Chubut and Santa Cruz will receive
royalties on sales at $110 per barrel rather than $70 paid by
the company when selling to the local market, the official said.  The refinery is producing about 14,000 cubic meters per day
compared with 28,000 before the April 2 fire, the government
official said. While output will ramp up in the coming days, the
plant probably won’t return to normal levels this year,
suggesting exports will continue beyond the two-month period,
the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
