The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development approved a 65 million-euro ($85
million) financing package to upgrade  Montenegro ’s power grid as
it plans an electricity link to  Italy  across the Adriatic.  The EBRD’s board of directors approved the syndicated loan
for grid operator  Crnogorski Elektroprenosni Sistem , or CGES,
the London-based lender said an e-mailed statement late
yesterday. CGES will develop a 400-kilovolt, 155 kilometer- (97
miles-) line from the northern Montenegrin town of Pljevlja to
Lastva on the coast and a substation that will link up with the
375-kilometer undersea cable it plans with Italy’s  Terna Rete
Elettrica Nazionale SpA. (TRN)   “The project will support the development of the regional
 electricity market  in southeastern Europe by creating the
required infrastructure for an exchange” between the region and
Italy,’’ the EBRD said in the statement. “This link will
increase cross-border trade, increase competition and stimulate
investment, particularly in renewable energy.”  The 1 gigawatt cable along the seabed will help power sales
from the Balkans, where energy investments include hydro plants,
wind and solar farms by Maccaferri Group’s Seci Energia SpA,
 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) , Spain’s  Fersa Energias
Renovables SA (FRS)  and  Securum Equity Partners & Associates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
