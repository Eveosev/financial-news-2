Infineon Technologies AG (IFX) , which
gets more than 40 percent of its revenue from chips for the
automotive industry, fell to the lowest level in five months
after European car sales slumped in March.  Infineon dropped as much as 3.8 percent to 5.49 euros. The
Neubiberg, Germany-based company says it’s the second-biggest
supplier of chips used in control functions from fuel injection
and interior lighting, behind Japan’s  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)   European car sales are sliding to a 20-year low after
registrations fell 10 percent to 1.35 million vehicles in March,
the 18th consecutive monthly drop, with Germany’s market
shrinking 17 percent, according to the European Automobile
Manufacturers’ Association.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG and  Daimler AG (DAI) , which last year shrugged off Europe’s
decline, are forecasting flat 2013 earnings as investor
confidence falls in Germany, the region’s biggest economy.  Infineon shares have fallen about 9 percent since April 12,
when Volkswagen reported slower deliveries. The stock has fallen
26 percent in the past 12 months, cutting the chipmaker’s market
value to 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion).  Dialog Semiconductor Plc (DLG) , another chipmaker that supplies
to the automotive industry, fell 6 percent to 9.82 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
