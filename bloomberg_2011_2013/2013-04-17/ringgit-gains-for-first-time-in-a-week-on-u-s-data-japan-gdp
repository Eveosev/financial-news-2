The ringgit climbed for the first
time in a week after signs of economic improvement in two of
Malaysia’s major export markets spurred demand for riskier
assets. Government bonds were little changed.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of stocks snapped a two-day
loss after housing starts in the U.S. jumped to the highest
level in almost five years in March and the International
Monetary Fund raise its gross domestic product forecast for
 Japan . The North Asian nation is Malaysia’s second-biggest
overseas market, while the U.S. is No. 4.  “The improvement in the U.S. data and the higher Japanese
GDP forecast are helping to attract funds to Asia,” said
 Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in  Singapore  at Westpac
Banking Corp. “The Malaysian currency will hover at current
levels in the short term.  The ringgit appreciated 0.4 percent to 3.0285 per dollar as
of 10:04 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in exchange-rates used to price options, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.12 percent.  New-home construction reached a higher-than-forecast

Department figures in  Washington  yesterday. The IMF increased
its growth estimates for Japan to 1.6 percent this year from 1.2
percent, and to 1.4 percent in 2014 from 0.7 percent.  Malaysian  inflation  accelerated to 1.6 percent in March
from 1.5 percent in February, according to the median forecast
of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before data due at 5 p.m.
local time today.  The ringgit could weaken to 3.12 by end of the year as fund
inflows into government bonds slow due to quickening consumer-
price gains,  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. in Singapore, said yesterday.  The yield on the 3.26 percent sovereign notes due March
2018 was steady at 3.16 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
