Liquefied natural gas for delivery
to Northeast Asia fell for a ninth straight week on sluggish
demand for short-term, or spot, cargoes, according to Energy
Intelligence.  Cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks cost $14.90 per
million British thermal units in Northeast Asia, the research
company said on the website for its World Gas Intelligence
publication. Thatâ€™s down from $15.15 per million Btu on April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
