Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
reached the narrowest level in four months after a government
report showed production slumped.  The spread, or price difference, tightened 8.69 cents to
29.09 cents a gallon at 10:59 a.m.  New York  time, the least
since Dec. 11, after an Energy Information Administration report
showed  output  fell 2.6 percent to 832,000 barrels a day, the
lowest for this time of year in records going back to June 2010
and 5.9 percent below year-earlier levels.  “Today’s EIA release was somewhat bullish, reporting lower
production and a small draw in inventories,” said Michael
Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC
in New York.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  rose 3.4 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.438 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery plunged 5.29 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.7289 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol production has struggled to rebound to levels
before last summer’s drought in the U.S. wilted corn crops and
eroded returns to manufacture the biofuel.  Corn for May delivery fell 1.25 cents to $6.62 a bushel in
Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable
fuel.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 3
cents a gallon, up from minus 1 cent yesterday. The amount
doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’
grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to
livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
