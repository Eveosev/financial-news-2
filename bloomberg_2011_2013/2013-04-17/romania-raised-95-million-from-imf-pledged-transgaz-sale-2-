Romania  raised 315 million lei ($95
million) by selling a minority stake in natural-gas utility
 Transgaz SA (TGN)  as it seeks to meet its international bailout terms.  The government sold 1.76 million shares, or 15 percent of
the company, at a price of 179 lei per share, according to
Constantin Nita, minister delegate for energy. The offer was
“significantly” oversubscribed, Nita said, without giving more
details. He also said the government will sell a minority stake
in Nuclearelectrica SA after May 15.  “The sale is an encouraging step for Romania’s future
state asset sales,” Nita said. “We are happy with the result
and with the price we obtained amid current market conditions.
The money from the sale will be directed to the state budget.”  Romania pledged to sell the Transgaz stake and start the
sale of its majority holding in unprofitable rail freight
company CFR Marfa SA to keep its  budget deficit  within agreed
limits to complete its second loan agreement with the
 International Monetary Fund  by the end of June.  The eastern  European country  received a three-month
extension of its 5 billion-euro ($6.6 billion) precautionary
credit to complete more reforms. It wants to negotiate a new
accord immediately after completing the current one, Prime
Minister Victor Ponta said Jan. 25.  Raiffeisen Capital & Investment, Wood & Co. and local
brokerage BT Securities SA managed the Transgaz sale.  Any future share sales in Transgaz will be done only to
capitalize the company and support its investment plans, Nita
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
