Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , which
reported its strongest profit growth in three years, was the
biggest loser in the benchmark index as investors bet the
company’s refining earnings will stagnate at current levels.  The  shares  fell as much as 2.9 percent to 781.35 rupees and
traded at 790.15 rupees as of 10:39 a.m. in Mumbai, poised for
their biggest decline since March 26. Billionaire Chairman
Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance had risen 4.4 percent in the
three days to April 16, when fourth-quarter earnings were
announced. The  S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX)  index gained 0.4 percent today.  Profit at the oil refiner and explorer climbed 32 percent
to 55.9 billion rupees, or 17.30 rupees a share, in the quarter
ended March 31 from a year earlier. Full-year  operating margins 
fell to 5.92 percent from 13.19 percent five years ago as
natural gas production slumped and earnings from petrochemicals
fell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The disappointment with petrochemicals continues and
there’re no significant triggers to refining from last year’s
levels,” said  Deepak Pareek , a Mumbai-based analyst at
Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt., who advises investors to reduce
Reliance shares from their holdings. “Fundamentals are still
pretty weak, so the shares are showing that. Some of the
increase from the last three days is coming off today.”  Operating income from  petrochemicals  fell 21 percent to
71.6 billion rupees from crude oil refining and natural gas
sales declined 34 percent in the year ended March 31, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Operating income from refining
crude oil into fuels rose 30 percent in the year.  Reliance, which announced a dividend of 9 rupees a share,
earned $10.10 for every barrel of crude it processed in the
quarter, compared with $7.60 a year earlier and $9.60 in the
previous three months.  The economic downturn in  Europe , slower growth in  China  and
new refining capacity will shrink margins globally, George
Nicolaides, president of refining technology at Reliance, said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
