Dangote Group, owner of the company
with  Nigeria ’s biggest market value, is seeking a $3.5 billion
loan to fund projects including an oil refinery  “We need constant funding from one successful project to
another, a very good funding mechanism,” Vice President Sani Dangote said today in an interview from the capital, Abuja.
“The loan will be for the refinery and other projects.”  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, relies on fuel imports
to meet more than 70 percent of domestic needs, according to the
Petroleum Ministry. Four state refineries with a combined daily
capacity of 445,000 barrels of oil are operating at a fraction
of that because of poor maintenance and aging equipment.  Dangote plans to build a refinery in Nigeria’s southwest
with a capacity of 400,000 barrels of crude oil a day, he said.  “It’s going to take a while,” the vice president said by
phone. “We’re still looking at the supply chain.”  The group owns  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) , the country’s biggest
company by market value,  Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (DANGSUGA) , Dangote
Industries Ltd. and Dangote Oil Services Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
