The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slipped 2 basis points to
112 basis points as of 10:31 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The measure is poised to
close at its lowest level since April 11, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 1.5 basis points to
91 as of 9:23 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The benchmark has ranged from 90.5 basis points to 148.1 basis
points since Dec. 31, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 114.5 as of 8:26
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
prices show. The gauge had dropped 6.9 basis points this month
through yesterday, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
