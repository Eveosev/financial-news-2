BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of
Latin America’s biggest securities exchange, started using
 Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  software to police trading of Brazil’s
stocks, commodities and futures.  Nasdaq’s Smarts surveillance platform, used to detect
 insider trading  and market manipulation, will sweep the
Brazilian exchange’s Puma trading system, the exchanges said in
a joint e-mailed statement today. BM&F has used Smarts for
equities since 2011.  “Since Brazilian trading activity has grown in importance
in the portfolio strategies of investors worldwide, it is
crucial to provide local and international players with market
surveillance tools,” Cicero Vieira, chief operating officer of
BM&FBovespa, said in the statement. “We aim to pro-actively
enforce regulation and safety addressed by our regulators and
rein in market-abuse activities.”  The Brazilian exchange was previously the nation’s only
equities bourse and is confronting increasing competition.
Americas Trading Group, a provider of financial technology,
plans to create a platform for buying and selling Brazilian
stocks with NYSE Euronext,  Nasdaq ’s rival. Direct Edge Inc. is
also seeking to enter Brazil.  Nasdaq, which owns the second-largest U.S. stock market and
runs seven Nordic and Baltic bourses, agreed to buy Smarts Group
in 2010 to diversify into market surveillance. Users of Smarts
include the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy
Regulators and the London Metal Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
