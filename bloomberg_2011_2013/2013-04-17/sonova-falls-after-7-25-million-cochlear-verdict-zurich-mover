Sonova Holding AG (SOON) , the world’s
largest hearing-aid maker, fell the most in 11 months after a
U.S. jury awarded $7.25 million in damages to a customer over a
faulty cochlear implant.  Sonova fell as much as 6 percent, the most since May 22
with trading volume 22 percent over the three-month daily
average. The stock was down 3.8 percent at 106 Swiss francs at
10:45 a.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 7.1
billion francs ($7.7 billion).  Sonova, which is considering an appeal, may have to adjust
its provisions for such claims, which could affect year-end
results to be reported May 21, the Staefa, Switzerland-based
company said today in a statement. The implant, which
malfunctioned due to moisture, was made by Advanced Bionics and
part of a voluntary recall in March 2006. Sonova purchased the
U.S.-based cochlear-implant maker in 2009 for $489 million.  The award wasn’t included in the company’s forecast for the
year ended March 31, which is for a 7 percent to 9 percent gain
in sales and a 15 percent to 20 percent increase in earnings
before interest, taxes and amortization, based on constant
currencies.  The 2006 recall of the HiRes 90K cochlear implants was
unrelated to a worldwide recall of the same hearing device in
November 2010 because of a malfunction that caused “severe
pain, overly loud sounds and/or shocking sensations,” according
to the company. Cochlear implants electrically stimulate the
hearing nerve in the inner ear which allow the user to perceive
sound.  The award from the District Court for the Western District
of  Kentucky  could have a “modestly negative impact” on profit
for the year and reduce earnings per share by 1.4 percent, Lisa Clive, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., said in a note
to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
