About $186.5 million in debt backed
by the Park Hyatt Aviara Resort, a former Four Seasons property
in Southern California, was sent to a special servicer today,
 Fitch Ratings  said.  The debt was sent to CWCapital Asset Management LLC because
the borrower is 60 days past due on payments, Mary MacNeill,
managing director at Fitch Ratings, said in an e-mail. The 329-
room property, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of San Diego
in Carlsbad, is owned by  Broadreach Capital Partners  and Maritz,
Wolff & Co., according to Fitch. Special servicers negotiate
with landlords on behalf of investors in commercial mortgage-
backed securities.  The loan backed by the high-end  hotel  -- which features an
18-hole golf course designed by  Arnold Palmer , two outdoor
swimming pools and a spa -- went into default in September 2010
after  cash flow  dried up, according to  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) ’s
Structured Credit Ratings unit. In January 2011, the owners
negotiated an extension to Feb. 11, 2017, Heather Turner, then a
Broadreach director, said at the time.  The property had an occupancy rate of about 54 percent for
the 12 months ended February 2012 and average nightly rates of
$242.70, according to Fitch. That compares with an occupancy of
70 percent and average room rates of $364.87 when the debt was
issued in early 2007, Fitch said. Rooms started at $295 for the
week of April 22, according to the hotel’s website.  The property’s owners replaced Four Seasons with Hyatt as
manager of the hotel in June 2010, Fitch said.  Lew Wolff , chairman of Maritz, Wolff & Co., and Kenneth
Reinke, chief financial officer at Broadreach, both declined
today to comment on the debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
