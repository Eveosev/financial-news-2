The Australian and New Zealand
dollars held gains from yesterday as rallies in stocks and
commodity prices boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  Australia ’s government bonds declined, with the three-year
yield rising from a 11-week low. New Zealand’s dollar climbed
against most major counterparts after Auckland-based Fonterra
Cooperative Group Ltd., the world’s largest dairy exporter, said
whole milk powder prices rose. The so-called kiwi briefly
declined after the annual inflation rate held below the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand’s target range for a third quarter.  “Commodity currencies in general have recovered since we
haven’t had further significant selling of gold, and commodity
prices have performed a little bit better,” said Ray Attrill,
Sydney based global co-head of currency strategy at National
Australia Bank Ltd. New Zealand’s consumer price data was
“pretty much bang in line with expectations. There was an
initial attempt to try and sell the New Zealand dollar but it
didn’t get very far.”  The Aussie traded at $1.0381 as of 10:15 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0390 yesterday, when it gained 0.8 percent. The currency
advanced to 101.47 yen from 101.34. The New Zealand dollar was
little changed at 84.90 U.S. cents after earlier falling as much
as 0.3 percent. It strengthened 1 percent yesterday. The so-
called kiwi gained 0.2 percent to 82.98 yen.  Australia’s government bonds fell, pushing three-year
yields up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point to 2.77
percent from yesterday, when they touched 2.68 percent, a level
unseen since Jan. 24. Ten-year yields rose one basis point to
3.27 percent.  The MSCI World Index gained 0.5 percent yesterday, while
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  index  of raw materials climbed 0.8
percent, its first advance in five days.  Milk Prices  Whole milk powder for June delivery rose 4.4 percent to a
record $6,283 a metric ton, according to Fonterra’s
GlobalDairyTrade website.  In New Zealand, consumer prices increased 0.9 percent from
a year earlier, Statistics New Zealand said in Wellington today,
matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey and the
forecast from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.  The central bank targets annual price gains of 1 percent to
3 percent. RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler last month said he
expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged at 2.5 percent this
year because of the effects of a drought and the strong currency
on growth.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a floating rate, was little changed at 2.87 percent. The
Reserve Bank of New Zealand will meet on April 24.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
