The Democratic Republic of Congo
banned exports of copper and cobalt concentrates to force mining
companies to add value to minerals before shipping them, Mines
Minster  Martin Kabwelulu  said.  The government gave companies 90 days to clear their
inventories of concentrated minerals, he said in a mobile-phone
message today.  “We want companies to export mineral products with great
added value,” Kabwelulu said.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX)  must prove the cobalt hydroxide produced by its Tenke
Fungurume Mining project is a “finished product” to avoid the
ban, he said.  Congo was the world’s eighth largest producer of copper and
the biggest producer of cobalt last year, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
