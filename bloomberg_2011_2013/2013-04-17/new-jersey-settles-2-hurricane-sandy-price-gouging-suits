New Jersey , which sued
24 businesses for price-gouging after  Hurricane Sandy , reached
its first two settlements of lawsuits, Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said in a statement.  C.S. George & Sons Inc., which runs George’s Gulf Station
in Clifton, and Shiv Shivam Inc., which does business as Lukoil
in Piscataway, will pay a total of $46,000 to resolve claims
that they excessively raised gas prices after Governor  Chris Christie  declared a state of emergency, Chiesa said.  Sandy crashed ashore in New Jersey on Oct. 29, leaving
2.7 million people in the state without power, severely damaging
some coastal towns and crippling mass transit. Christie has said
it will cost $36.9 billion to repair the damage and prevent
future devastation.  “These two settlements are the first of what I expect to
be a series of resolutions to the price-gouging lawsuits we have
filed to date,” Chiesa said in the statement.  The state Division of Consumer Affairs got 2,000  complaints 
about price-gouging for gasoline, generators, food and lodging,
according to Chiesa. About 83 percent involved gas stations, he
said in November. About 4 percent of the state’s 2,400 gasoline
retailers were subject to subpoenas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
