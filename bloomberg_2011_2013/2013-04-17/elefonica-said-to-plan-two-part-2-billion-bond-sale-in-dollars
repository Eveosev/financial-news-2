A financing arm of  Telefonica SA (TEF) ,
Spain’s biggest phone-services company, sold $2 billion of debt
yesterday in the unit’s first dollar-denominated sale in two
years.  Telefonica Emisiones SAU issued $750 million of 10-year,
4.57 percent bonds to yield 287.5 basis points more than
similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries and $1.25 billion of five-year,
3.192 percent notes with a relative yield of 250 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used
for general corporate purposes, according to a company filing.  The unit of Madrid-based Telefonica last sold dollar debt
in February 2011 in an offering that included $1.25 billion of
3.992 percent, five-year debentures yielding 173 basis points
more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show.  The notes traded at 105.5 cents on the dollar for a yield
of 1.98 percent on April 15, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  BNP Paribas SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings
Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale
SA managed the offering, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
