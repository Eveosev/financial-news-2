During the 2008 presidential
campaign,  Barack Obama ’s team became famous for submitting
almost everything they did to rigorous A/B testing. Staff
members would send different versions of a message to small
groups of randomly selected supporters, determine which produced
the best response and then disseminate the winning appeal to the
audience at large. The campaign made choices on the basis of
hard data -- even when the results violated the theories of
experienced political operatives.  This was something of a culture shock to the old-school
consultants who think politics is more art than science (and
fancy themselves modern-day Picassos). But the data won out. As
Dan Siroker, director of analytics for the Obama campaign, told
Wired, “Over time, people started to see the value in taking a
step back and saying, ‘Well, here’s three things we should try.
Let’s run an experiment and see what works.’”  It’s far easier to A/B test a campaign than a presidency.
It turns out to be hard to get a representative subset of
Congress members to act as a control group. Yet even if you
can’t do a rigorous test of how best to govern, you can still
experiment with different approaches. Right now, the Obama
administration is running one of the most consequential tests in
recent history. The early results will unnerve many who think
they know how  Washington  works.  Bully Pulpit  The core question of presidential politics is how to manage
a Congress paralyzed by the bitter disagreements between the two
parties. How does a president get anything through it? Right
now, the Obama administration is trying to pass  gun-control 
legislation, immigration reform and a new budget, and the White
House has opted for a very different leadership approach in each
case.  Perhaps the most common view of presidential power is that
it’s all about the bully pulpit. If the president just delivers
the right speeches, in the right places, to the right audiences,
he can mobilize the American public to break the gridlock in
Washington.  The gun bill is the purest test of this theory. Since the
massacre in December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,
 Connecticut , the president has crisscrossed the nation trying to
mobilize public opinion against intransigent members of
Congress. The public is with him. More than 80 percent of
Americans, for example,  support  expanded background checks for
gun purchases.  “There is only one thing that can stand in the way of
change that just about everybody agrees on, and that’s politics
in Washington,” he said this month in Hartford, Connecticut.
“You would think that with those numbers Congress would rush to
make this happen.”  To bolster the president’s vigorous effort, first lady
 Michelle Obama  hit the road, putting her wild popularity to use.
“Right now,” she said in  Chicago , “my husband is fighting as
hard as he can, and engaging as many people as he can, to pass
common-sense reforms to protect our children from gun violence.
And these reforms deserve a vote in Congress.”  The White House even had the mother of a Sandy Hook victim
deliver the president’s radio address last weekend. “We have to
convince the Senate to come together and pass common-sense gun
responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and
prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would
happen to us,” Francine Wheeler told the country.  Beer Diplomacy  Obama’s approach to the budget, meanwhile, illustrates
another model of presidential power. In his search for a “grand
bargain” with Republicans to shrink the deficit, Obama is
following the counsel (and kvetching) of those who think that
the only obstacle to a bipartisan budget deal is the president’s
tense personal relations with opposition legislators. You might
call this the  Tip O’Neill  and Ronald Reagan formula: If Obama
would just knock back a cocktail or two with Republican leaders
 Mitch McConnell  and  John Boehner , then, like the Democrat
O’Neill and the Republican Reagan in the 1980s, the amiable trio
could arrive at a budget deal.  So Obama has built a budget aimed directly at backroom
negotiations. He included policies such as chained CPI, a de
facto reduction in Social Security benefits that is broadly
unpopular but designed to appeal to Republican lawmakers. He
previewed his budget over lunch with House Budget Committee
Chairman  Paul Ryan . The night his budget was publicly released,
Obama hosted a White House dinner for a dozen Senate
Republicans. This week, he scheduled dinner with a similarly
sized group of Senate Democrats. If the problem in Washington is
that the president doesn’t spend enough time wooing fellow
politicians, we should have a deal any day now.  The White House is running an outside game on gun control
and an inside game on the budget. But there’s a third and more
provocative theory of presidential power. Widely  subscribed to
by political scientists , this theory makes people in Washington
very uncomfortable because it upends cherished assumptions about
how politics in general -- and the presidency in particular ---
functions.  Under this theory, and the data that supports it, the
president isn’t a unifying figure, or even a particularly
persuasive one, when government is divided. Decades of polls
show little evidence that presidential speeches move voters.
They can draw attention to issues, but they rarely change
attitudes -- and they occasionally backfire. Because the
president is an intrinsically polarizing figure, anything he
endorses becomes instantly less appealing to the minority party.
In eras of divided government, that can make it impossible to
pass legislation. If this theory of presidential power is
correct, the best thing a president can do is often nothing --
at least in public.  Backseat Leader  This is largely the approach the White House has taken to
immigration reform. Early in the process, Obama gave some
speeches and made his support clear. Since then, he has let the
Senate’s bipartisan “Gang of Eight” take the lead. As a result,
if an immigration bill is passed, much credit will go to Senator
 John McCain , who opposed Obama in 2008, Senator  Marco Rubio , who
appears likely to run for the Republican presidential nomination
in 2016, and Democratic Senator  Charles Schumer . Insofar as
Obama leads at all on the issue, he leads from behind. Yet
immigration reform keeps grinding forward.  Indeed, of these three issues, immigration is in the best
shape. The centerpiece of the gun-control bill, expanded
background checks, has  fallen apart  in the Senate. It’s too
early to say what the final outcome will be on a budget deal.
Obama’s efforts have led to encouraging comments from
Republicans who were happy to be invited to dinner and glad to
see entitlement cuts in the president’s budget, but who are
nowhere near proposing concessions of their own. Immigration,
meanwhile, is moving forward, and insiders are more optimistic
today than they were a month ago.  Of course, this isn’t a real A/B/C test. Immigration, gun
control and the budget are different issues subject to different
political dynamics. It’s certainly easier to lead from behind on
something like immigration reform, where crucial Republicans
have decided they have a strong incentive to step up.  But for those who confidently say that the president just
needs to get out front, the different prospects of these three
policy initiatives should give pause. Sometimes, the best thing
a president can do to advance his agenda is to let someone else
lead.  ( Ezra Klein  is a Bloomberg View columnist. The opinions
