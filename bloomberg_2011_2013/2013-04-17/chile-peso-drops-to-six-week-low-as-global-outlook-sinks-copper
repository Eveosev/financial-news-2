Chile’s peso fell to a six-week low
as the price of copper, the country’s biggest export, plunged on
a weaker outlook for global economic growth.  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 473.39 per U.S
dollar at 10:03 a.m. in Santiago, the weakest on a closing basis
since March 4. The peso has dropped 0.3 percent since the end of
January while copper has declined 14 percent.  “The gap with copper is too big and we have a selling
bias,”  Alejandro Cuadrado , a currency strategist at  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , said in a telephone interview from
New York. “This is one of our least favorite currencies in
 Latin America  at this juncture.”  The global economy will expand 3.3 percent this year,
slower than forecast in January, the  International Monetary Fund 
reported yesterday. The IMF cut the estimate for growth in
China, the biggest buyer of Chile’s copper, to 8 percent.  Copper futures dropped 2.9 percent to $3.2270 per pound
today. Copper, used in cars and new buildings, makes up almost
half of Chile’s exports.  The peso has declined 1.3 percent from a 19-month high
reached April 8. The sell-off may curb speculation that the
central bank will intervene to weaken the currency, Cuadrado
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
