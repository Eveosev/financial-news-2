Chinese stocks  in New York slid to
the lowest level since September, led by telecommunications
providers and industrial companies, on speculation slower
economic growth will erode company earnings.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. fell 2.4 percent to 86.44, the lowest
close since Sept. 5.  China Telecom Corp. (CHA) , the nation’s biggest
fixed-line carrier, and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. tumbled to
the lowest in at least nine months.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. 
sank to a four-year low, while casino operator  Melco Crown
Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) ’s American depositary receipts traded 3.2
percent below the company’s shares in Hong Kong.  The  International Monetary Fund  reduced China’s growth
forecast for this year April 16 after the government reported
economic expansion slowed in the first quarter and industrial
production grew less than analysts expected. The China-US gauge
has slumped 13 percent in 2013 to trade at 11.7 times estimated
earnings, about 50 percent below their  valuation  in March 2012.  “The growth environment is not necessarily supportive,”
 Michael Wang , an  emerging markets  strategist at Amiya Capital
LLP in London, said by e-mail. “The lower potential growth rate
going forward means you may not see the same valuation multiples
as before.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., dropped 2.1 percent to $34.83
in New York, also the lowest level since September. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index declined 1.4 percent to 1,552.01 as results
at companies from Bank of America Corp. to Textron Inc. came in
below analysts’ forecasts.  Yuan Band  The IMF lowered China’s growth forecast for this year to 8
percent from 8.2 percent this week. China’s economic growth
slowed to 7.7 percent in the first quarter, after accelerating
to 7.9 percent in the last three months of 2012, while
industrial-production growth fell to 9.5 percent from 10
percent.  The  yuan ’s floating trading band will be widened even
further “in the near future,”  Yi Gang , deputy governor of the
People’s Bank of China, said at an International Monetary Fund
conference in Washington yesterday. The China Daily yesterday
quoted Wang Yu, deputy director-general of the central bank’s
research bureau, as saying that the next step in China’s
 exchange-rate  reform will be further widening of the band.  “The exchange rate is going to be more market-oriented,”
Yi said. “Last year they increased the floating band from 0.5
percent to 1 percent. I think in the near future they’re going
to increase the floating band even further.”  Non-deliverable 12-month yuan forwards were little changed
at 6.2530 per dollar.  ‘Not Spooked’  China Telecom tumbled 3.8 percent to $45.73 in  New York ,
the lowest close since July 18. China Unicom, the nation’s
second-largest mobile-phone company, fell 3.6 percent to $12.21,
the lowest since June 11, 2010, and China Mobile Ltd., the
world’s largest phone company by users, lost 1.7 percent to
$51.76.  James Weir, who helps manage $260 million Asian stocks at
Guinness Atkinson Asset Management in London, said he still
favors China Mobile as the company dominates the wireless
market.  “We are not spooked by the recent decline,” said Weir.
“China Mobile is in a pretty good shape. These are good
consumption stories.”  All three Chinese telecommunications companies reported
higher earnings than were expected by analysts last month as
increasing use of smartphones boosted sales.  Melco Discounted  China  Mobile’s net income rose 6.1 percent to 36 billion
yuan ($5.8 billion) in the fourth quarter, from 33.9 billion
yuan a year earlier, according to figures derived from full-year
data the Beijing-based carrier reported March 14. Profit was
projected at 32.3 billion yuan, according to the average of five
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  China Mobile’s share of the nation’s total 1.12 billion
wireless users fell to 64 percent in January from 66 percent a
year earlier, according to data released February.  ADRs of Melco Crown, which operates casinos in Macau,
declined 3.7 percent to $22.14, the lowest close since April 5.
The slump left the ADRs trading 3.2 percent below equivalent
shares in  Hong Kong , reversing a 1.7 percent premium April 16.  Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) , owner of China’s most-used web
browser, gained 2.2 percent to $31.12. Barclays Plc started
coverage on the stock with an overweight recommendation and a
price target of $38.  Aluminum Corp. (ACH) , known as Chalco, fell 3.6 percent to $9 in
U.S. trading, the lowest level since November 2008. The ADRs
have slumped 8.4 percent over four days.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.1 percent to
2,193.80 yesterday as most domestic Chinese stocks on the
measure gained. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese
companies traded in Hong Kong retreated 1.2 percent to
10,300.93, the lowest close since Nov. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
