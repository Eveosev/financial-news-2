The California Public Employees’
Retirement System approved a proposal to change how it counts
investment losses and gains aimed at filling $87 billion in
unfunded obligations.  The fund will now base the contribution rates paid by state
and local government taxpayers on how much the system needs to
reach 100 percent funding within 30 years. The change is
projected to cause the rate those governments are charged to
finance public employee pensions to increase by as much 50
percent over six years beginning in 2015.  The $257 billion had spread out losses and gains over 15
years, a policy called smoothing, to ease the potential that
cities and other municipal governments would face sudden spikes
in rate increases when investment income fails to meet
projections.  The Sacramento-based pension, known as Calpers, currently
has about 74 percent of the money it needs to pay benefits over
30 years, after dropping to 61 percent in 2009 amid the global
financial crisis that wiped out more than a third of the fund’s
market value. Under the current rates and smoothing policy, the
fund would reach an 80 percent funded status within 30 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
