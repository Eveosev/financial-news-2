Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe ’s largest hotel
operator, said first-quarter revenue fell 1.2 percent because of
divestments and the euro’s strength.  Sales dropped to 1.23 billion euros ($1.6 billion), the
Paris-based owner of the Sofitel and Ibis brands said in a
statement today, without giving a year-earlier figure. Analysts
expected about 1.24 billion euros, the average of eight
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Accor sold its chain of more than 1,100 Motel 6 budget
hotels in North America to Blackstone Group LP for $1.9 billion
last year. The company used some of the proceeds to expand in
regions including Asia.  Accor said it opened 4,628 new rooms during the first three
months of the year.  The euro’s appreciation against currencies including the
Brazilian real and the Australian dollar knocked 16 million
euros off of Accor’s revenue, according to the statement. Like-
for-like sales, excluding divestments and currency fluctuations,
were little changed, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
