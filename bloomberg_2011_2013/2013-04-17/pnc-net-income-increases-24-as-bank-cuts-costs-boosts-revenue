PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the second-largest U.S. regional bank, reported a 24 percent
increase in first-quarter profit, beating analysts’ estimates,
as the lender cut costs and revenue climbed 6 percent.  Net income rose to $1 billion, or $1.76 a share, from $811
million, or $1.44, a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based lender
said today in a statement. The  average estimate  of 31 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.56 a share.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Rohr, 64, has targeted $700
million in cost reductions for this year, and CEO-elect Bill Demchak, who takes over for Rohr next week, has said he’ll close
branches and cut staff. PNC consolidated 30 branches and said
today it plans to shut 200 in 2013. The bank had 56,172
employees at the end of March, 433 fewer than a year earlier.  “PNC’s diversified businesses delivered solid revenue
despite weaker lending in the first quarter and, combined with
significantly reduced expenses, drove improved returns for our
shareholders,” Rohr said in the statement.  The lender cut non-interest expenses by 2.4 percent to $2.4
billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. Interest
expenses also declined, falling 27 percent to $222 million. PNC
said it expects to reduce full-year non-interest expenses from
2012.  Total revenue rose 6 percent to $3.96 billion, missing the
$3.98 billion average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Non-Interest Expenses  PNC said non-interest expenses may climb 2 percent to 3
percent in the second quarter from the first three months of
this year, according to a  slide presentation  posted today. Net
interest income could decline 2 percent to 3 percent, PNC said.  The bank set aside $236 million for soured loans in the
quarter, a 28 percent increase from the year-earlier period.
That provision may be $200 million to $300 million in the second
quarter, according to the presentation.  PNC said this month it would boost its quarterly dividend
10 percent to 44 cents, citing improved capital levels and its
financial results.  U.S. Bancorp, the nation’s largest regional lender, said
yesterday first-quarter earnings rose 6.7 percent as the company
set aside less for soured loans. Revenue, which declined 1.1
percent to $4.87 billion, missed the $5.03 billion average
estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
