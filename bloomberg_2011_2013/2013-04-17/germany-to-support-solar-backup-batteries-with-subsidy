Germany  will subsidize consumers’
purchases of battery systems to store power from solar panels
through a 25 million-euro ($32.6 million) program to promote
wider use of renewable energy, the German Solar Industry
Association.  The government will pay 660 euros a kilowatt of storage
capacity under a program that begins May 1, the trade group said
today in a  statement . The systems will also stabilize the flow
of electricity into the grid.  Storage is a policy-driven market, Brian Warshay, an
analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance in New York, said today
in an interview.  “I’d expect for the incentive, which is set at a pretty
healthy rate for most systems, to be used up quickly,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
