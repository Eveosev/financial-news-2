B456 Systems Inc., the bankrupt
electric-car battery maker formerly called  A123 Systems Inc. (AONEQ) ,
got approval of a settlement with Fisker Automotive Inc.
reducing its claims by 89 percent to $15 million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey approved the settlement
at a hearing today in Wilmington,  Delaware , after no objections
were filed.  The accord with B456’s unsecured-creditors’ committee will
substantially cut the luxury plug-in carmaker’s
$140 million in purported claims stemming from a rejection of
its supply agreement and alleged breach of warranty obligations,
according to court documents.  “This reduction will have a substantial positive effect on
the value of other unsecured claims,” the committee said in a
court filing when the settlement was reached.  Fisker’s $48.7 million breach-of-warranty claim will be
reduced to a $15 million unsecured claim, and its $91.2 million
claim for damages from the rejection of its supply agreement
will be disallowed, according to court documents.  A123, based in Waltham,  Massachusetts , filed for  bankruptcy 
in October after a previous deal with Wanxiang Group Co.,
 China ’s biggest auto-parts maker, was scuttled amid
congressional Republicans’ reluctance to allow its sale to a
Chinese company.  Federal Grant  The ex-battery maker, which was awarded a federal grant of
as much as $249.1 million and only used about $132 million to
build two plants in  Michigan , listed assets of $459.8 million
and debt of $376 million as of Aug. 31 in court documents.  The company got court approval Dec. 11 to sell the majority
of its assets to Wanxiang’s U.S. unit. Wanxiang America Corp.
acquired substantially all of A123’s automotive, grid and
commercial business assets for about $256.6 million. The deal
received approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the U.S. on Jan. 29.  As part of the settlement, Anaheim, California-based Fisker
agreed to support the former battery maker’s liquidation plan.
In March, Carey approved A123’s disclosure statement, a
description of the liquidation plan that can be used by
creditors to decide how to vote.  B456 pushed back its plan-approval hearing to May 20
because it’s determining “how best to monetize” its remaining
assets, if possible, which may result in changes to the plan,
company attorney Caroline Reckler told Carey at the hearing.  The case is In re B456 Systems Inc., 12-12859,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
