Rasheed Wallace retired again from
professional basketball, ending a 21-game comeback with the  New
York Knicks  that was interrupted by a foot injury.  Wallace’s decision was announced by the Knicks two days
after the forward/center played less than four minutes in his
first game since December. He missed 60 contests this season
because of a left foot injury, and had surgery on Feb. 28 to
repair a fractured fifth metatarsal in the foot.  “Rasheed has given this team everything he had,” Knicks
coach  Mike Woodson  said in a statement. Due to his injury he
will not be available to play for us during the playoffs. We owe
this season’s success to veterans like Rasheed.’’  The Knicks (53-28) host the Atlanta Hawks tonight in their
regular-season finale. The No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference
for the playoffs, New York will take on the seventh-seeded
 Boston Celtics .  Wallace, 38, averaged seven points and four rebounds per
game with the Knicks. A four-time National Basketball
Association All-Star, Wallace played 15 seasons with stints that
also included Washington, Portland, Atlanta, Detroit and the
Celtics. He averaged 14.4 points and 6.7 rebounds per game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
