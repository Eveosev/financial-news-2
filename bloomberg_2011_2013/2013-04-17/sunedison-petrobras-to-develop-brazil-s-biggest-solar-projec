MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-biggest U.S. supplier of polysilicon, is planning a solar
farm that will be tied for the largest in Brazil with the
country’s state-controlled oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)   MEMC’s SunEdison unit will build the 1.1-megawatt plant in
the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte next to a
thermoelectric plant controlled by Rio de Janeiro-based
Petrobras, the companies said in an e-mailed statement today.
It’s expected to begin producing power by year-end.  The plant will use 3,672 SunEdison solar panels and is
expected to generate 1.65 gigawatt hours of power a year for the
grid, according to the statement. MEMC is based in St. Peters,
Missouri.  The biggest solar farm in operation in  Brazil  has 1.1
megawatts of capacity and was developed by CPFL Energias
Renovaveis SA in the state of Sao Paulo, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. is the biggest U.S. supplier of
polysilicon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
