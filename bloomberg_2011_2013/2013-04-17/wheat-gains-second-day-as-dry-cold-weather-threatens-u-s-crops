Wheat advanced for a second day on
concern that persistent dryness and freezing temperatures will
further damage drought-hit crops in some of the biggest growing
regions in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  Wheat for delivery in July rose as much as 0.4 percent to
$7.1025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$7.0975 by 9:34 a.m. in Singapore on volume that was 33 percent
below the 100-day average for that time of day.  West  Kansas , southeast  Colorado  and parts of Oklahoma and
Texas will miss most of the showers and thunderstorms forecast
in the central and south plains, DTN said in a report yesterday.
Cold temperatures may hurt the crop in west Kansas and Texas
Panhandle, the forecaster said. Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and
Colorado planted the biggest acreage to winter-wheat this year,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said March 28.  “A number of unfavorable weather developments should
continue to provide price support,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in a report
today. “Ongoing frosts are contributing to ongoing yield
concerns for the U.S. HRW wheat crop,” he said, referring to
the hard-red winter variety by its initials.  About 31 percent of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was rated
poor to very poor as of April 14, up from 30 percent a week
earlier, the USDA said April 15.  Corn for July delivery lost 0.2 percent to $6.3925 a bushel,
while soybeans gained 0.2 percent to $13.785 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
