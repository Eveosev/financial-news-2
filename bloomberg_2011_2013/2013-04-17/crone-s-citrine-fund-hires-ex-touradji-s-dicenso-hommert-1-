Tony DiCenso and Andreas Hommert
joined Citrine Capital Management LLC, a metals hedge-fund
company, said founder and Chief Investment Officer Paul Crone.  DiCenso joined New York-based Citrine as an analyst and
trader and Hommert is an analyst, Crone said today in an
interview in Lausanne,  Switzerland . Both previously worked at
Touradji Capital Management LP, he said.  Crone started Citrine last year after seven years at
Touradji, where he was head trader. Touradji managed $890
million at the end of 2011. Citrine uses exchange-listed
derivatives to trade industrial metals, gold and platinum-group
metals.  Gold futures in  New York  slumped 17 percent this year, the
worst start since 1981, after a 9.3 percent drop on April 15
that capped the biggest two-day decline since January 1980.
Citrine was short during the plunge, or betting on lower bullion
prices, Crone said at the  FT Global Commodities Summit 2013  in
Lausanne, calling the slide a “big shock.”  “We saw a year’s move in 48 hours” that was “much too
quick” for investors to cope with, he said. Citrine is bearish
on gold and favors palladium, according to Crone.  Crone also said he’s “quite positive” on copper demand in
 China , the world’s biggest consumer. Bonded warehouses in the
country hold 600,000 metric tons of the metal used in pipes and
wiring and the market for copper scrap is “incredibly tight,”
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
