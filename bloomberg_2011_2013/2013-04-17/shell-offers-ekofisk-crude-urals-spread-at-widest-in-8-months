Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  offered  North
Sea  Ekofisk crude without finding a buyer. Eni SpA and Total SA
both failed to find a seller for Russian Urals grade even as
they bid at a higher price than the previous trade.  The price spread between Urals in northwest Europe and the
Mediterranean has widened to the most in more than eight years,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  North Sea  Shell failed to find a buyer for Ekofisk loading from May 8
to May 10 at $1.05 a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to
a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window.  There were no bids or offers for Forties, the survey
showed. The grade traded yesterday at a discount of $1.45 a
barrel to the cash cost of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk
crudes in June.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 10 cents to a discount of 57 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $98.07 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $99.19 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $98.07 at the same time today, at parity to May.  One Forties cargo for loading in May has been advanced, the
first for that month, according to two people with knowledge of
the loading plan.  Lot F0511 will now load on May 10 to May 12, two days
earlier than planned, the people said, asking not to be
identified as the information is confidential.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni bid for Urals at $1.55 a barrel less than Dated Brent
on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, according to the Platts
survey. That’s 40 cents more than the previous deal on April 9.  Total failed to buy the grade for a third day at minus
$1.65, bidding 30 cents more than yesterday, the survey showed.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 22 cents to 28 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the least since Jan. 31. In northwest
 Europe , the  discount  was at $1.80 a barrel compared with $1.87
at yesterday’s close. That’s the narrowest since Feb. 19.  Urals loading from the Mediterranean is $1.52 a barrel
higher than in northwest Europe, the data show. That’s the
biggest premium since Dec. 31, 2004.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 2 cents to $3.10
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chad plans to increase exports of its Doba crude in June to
three cargoes of 950,000 barrels each, one more than next month,
a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Equatorial Guinea  plans to keep exports of its Zafiro
