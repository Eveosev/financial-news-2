Construction output  in the euro
area declined for a fourth month in February led by slumping
activity in  Germany , adding to signs the 17-nation economy is
struggling to pull out of the recession.  Construction in the  euro zone  decreased 0.8 percent from
January, when it fell 2.1 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The January figure
was revised lower from an initial estimate of a 1.4 percent
drop. From a year earlier, February  construction  gained 0.8
percent.  With European leaders striving to tamp down the sovereign-
debt crisis, the euro-area economy is forecast to contract for a
sixth straight quarter in the first three months of 2013,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. That would
be the longest recession since the debut of the euro in 1999.  In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, construction declined
2.7 percent in February from the prior month, when it rose 3.1
percent, today’s report showed.  France , the second-largest
economy in the euro area, showed a 1 percent increase in the
latest month after a 4 percent drop in January.  Spain , struggling to recover from the demise of a decade-
long housing boom, reported flat construction output in February
after a 4 percent decrease in the prior month.  In the 27-nation EU, construction dropped 0.4 percent from
January, when it declined 1.7 percent, according to today’s
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
