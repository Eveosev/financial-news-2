The Canadian dollar touched its
lowest level in almost four weeks against its U.S. peer on
speculation the Bank of Canada may follow the  International
Monetary Fund  in cutting economic growth forecasts.  The currency fell against the majority of its 16 most-
traded peers before an  interest-rate  decision at 10 a.m. in
Ottawa, where the central bank is projected to keep the
benchmark interest rate at 1 percent, according to all 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The IMF cut its 2013 Canadian
growth forecast to 1.5 percent from 2 percent yesterday, and
traders are speculating bank governor  Mark Carney , whose latest
prediction from January was also 2 percent, will follow suit.  “If you look at the Bank of Canada, the odds are they will
be dovish, and maybe even more dovish than the market expects,”
said  Sebastien Galy , a foreign-exchange strategist at Societe
Generale SA, by phone from New York. “If you look at the
balance of risk, the odds are that they’re right in terms of
positioning, so the Bank of Canada will basically be dovish. The
risk is that they’re wrong, and because of the extent of
positioning they’ll get hammered more.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.5 percent to
C$1.0262 per  U.S. dollar  at 8:05 a.m. in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0265 per U.S. dollar, its lowest since March 21. One loonie
buys 97.45 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
