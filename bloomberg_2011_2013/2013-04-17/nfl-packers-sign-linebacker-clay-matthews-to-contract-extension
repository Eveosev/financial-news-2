Clay Matthews signed a contract
extension with the Green Bay Packers that makes him the highest-
paid linebacker in the National Football League, the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel said.  Matthews, 26, who joined the Packers in 2009, is the only
player in Green Bay history selected for the Pro Bowl in each of
his first four seasons in the league, the team said yesterday in
an e-mailed release.  Details of the extension were not released by the team. The
Journal Sentinel, quoting a person it did not identify, said
Matthews will receive $66 million over five years through the
2018 season.  “I’m going to continue to lead this defense,” Matthews
said in a news conference. “You’re going to continue to get the
same type of player that you have seen, if not better each
year.”  Matthews has 42 1/2 career sacks, ranking fifth in the NFL
during the past four seasons. He had 13 sacks in 2012.  “Clay has been a productive member of our team and we are
pleased to be able to come to an agreement that will extend his
Packers career,” General Manager Ted Thompson said in a
statement released by the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
