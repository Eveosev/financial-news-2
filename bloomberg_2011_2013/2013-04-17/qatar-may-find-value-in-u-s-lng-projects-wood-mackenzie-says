Qatar, the world’s largest producer
of liquefied natural gas, may get better value investing in U.S.
supply instead of expanding existing facilities, according to
 Wood Mackenzie  Ltd.  Qatar Petroleum  International and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  may
send LNG from their Golden Pass facility in Texas on the U.S.
Gulf Coast to the U.K., Wood Mackenzie said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. That would free up supplies from Qatar to
be directed to Asia, the Edinburgh-based consultant said.  Qatar Petroleum, the country’s state-owned oil company,
holds excess LNG shipping capacity and space at the U.K. South
Hook receiving terminal, said Wood Mackenzie. That may provide a
cost advantage of as much as $1.50 per million British thermal
units over other proposed U.S. export projects for European
supply, according to the report.  “A Golden Pass liquefaction project could offer advantages
over some other proposed U.S. LNG projects, including lower
development costs and less financing challenges,” Noel Tomnay,
a Wood Mackenzie gas consultant said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
