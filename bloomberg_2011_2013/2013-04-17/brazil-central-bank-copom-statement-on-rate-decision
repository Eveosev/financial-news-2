Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “The Copom decided to raise the Selic rate to 7.5 percent
a year, without bias, by six votes in favor and two for holding
the rate at 7.25 percent a year.  The committee considers that the high level of inflation
and the dispersion of price increases, among other factors,
contribute to the resilience of inflation and require a monetary
policy response. On the other hand, the Copom considers that
domestic and principally external uncertainties surrounds the
prospective inflation outlook and requires that monetary policy
be managed with caution.  The following board members voted for the increase of the
Selic rate to 7.5 percent a year: President Alexandre Antonio Tombini,  Altamir Lopes , Anthero de Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Hamilton Vasconcelos Araujo, Luiz Edson Feltrim and Sidnei Correa Marques. The following members voted for keeping the
Selic at 7.25 percent a year: Aldo Luiz Mendes and Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
