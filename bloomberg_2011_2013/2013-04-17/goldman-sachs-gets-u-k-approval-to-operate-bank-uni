Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the
fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, gained regulatory approval to
run a branch of its commercial bank in the U.K.  Goldman Sachs Bank USA received the license on March 21,
according to a filing with Britain’s Financial Conduct
Authority. The branch will be able to accept deposits, advise on
investments and arrange the safeguarding and administration of
assets, according to the filing.  “We are pleased that the request has been approved,”
Sophie Bullock, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London, said
today by e-mail. “The bank’s clients are global and it is
important for a number of them to be able to transact with the
bank in London.”  Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  were the largest U.S.
securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the  Federal Reserve 
and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks.
Goldman Sachs Bank USA was set up as a  New York  State-chartered
bank in 2008.  Goldman Sachs said yesterday that first-quarter net income
rose 7 percent to $2.26 billion, or $4.29 a share, from $2.11
billion, or $3.92, a year earlier. That was higher than all 24
analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Financial News reported the approval for a commercial-bank
branch earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
