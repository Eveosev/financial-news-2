New York  jet fuel slumped to the
 lowest level on record  versus futures as supplies rose to a
seasonal high on the U.S. East Coast.  Inventories of jet fuel on the coast, the PADD 1 region,
increased 803,000 barrels to 10.4 million barrels in the week
ended April 12, according to Energy Information Administration
data. Thatâ€™s the highest level for this time of year since 2010
and 3.7 percent lower than the  five-year  average.  No. 55 jet fuel in the New York harbor weakened 0.25 cents
to  7.13 cents  a gallon below futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 3:29 p.m., the lowest level since at least 1991,
according to Bloomberg data. Reformulated gasoline in the New
York Harbor gained .5 cent to a discount of 16.50 cents a gallon
versus futures.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in the region, a rough measure of
refining margins based on Brent oil in  Europe , gained 9 cents to
$13.03 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
