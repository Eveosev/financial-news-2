Europe  has long-term economic
growth challenges and needs expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies, Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said.  “Europe has actually grown very, very slowly; we’re
talking of below half a percentage point over the last six,
seven years,” Borg said during an macroeconomic policy
conference in Washington today. “Fundamentally, there is a
growth problem in Europe that is not short-term.”  Borg also said that  Sweden  needs expansionary fiscal policy
for reasons that include high unemployment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
