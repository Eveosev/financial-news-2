Chinese demand for dry bulk
imports, including iron ore and coal, is expected to lift
freight rates from July onwards, according to Pareto Securities
AS, an Oslo-based investment bank.  Following are comments by Nicolai Hansteen, chief economist
at Pareto Shipping, a unit of Pareto Securities AS, who spoke at
the third Scandinavian Shipping and Ship Finance Conference in
Copenhagen today.  “We are fundamentally optimistic on dry bulk, encouraged
by Chinese dry-bulk import growth,” Hansteen said. “The second
quarter is going to be a very weak quarter, but we expect to see
a recovery in freight rates in the second half of this year,
driven by Chinese imports.”  On dry-bulk imports into  China :  “China now accounts for 40 percent of dry-bulk imports.
Dry-bulk import volumes will increase by 500 million metric tons
by 2016. Chinese iron-ore imports will reach 1 billion tons by
2015. China will import more than 40 million tons of coking coal
in 2013. Steam coal imports will exceed 220 million tons this
year.”  On the dry-bulk market and fleet:  “The dry-bulk market will grow 6 percent annually between
2013 and 2016. The orderbook for new dry-bulk vessels stands at
20 percent of the fleet. Ten percent of the dry-bulk fleet is
older than 21 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
