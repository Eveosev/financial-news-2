China’s five-year  interest-rate
swaps  rebounded from the lowest level in almost five months
after better-than-forecast U.S. housing data suggested the
world’s largest economy is improving.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares snapped a two-day
loss after new-home construction climbed in March to the highest
level in almost five years, Commerce Department figures showed
yesterday. The five-year swap fell seven basis points in the
first two days of the week after China reported on April 15
that its  gross domestic product  increased 7.7 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier, less than 7.9 percent in the
previous period and the 8 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  “There’s better risk sentiment as U.S. data is better,”
said Ethan Mou, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bank of America
Corp.  China ’s interest-rate swap market is also experiencing “a
correction of the sharp drop” of the past few days, he said.  The five-year contract, the fixed cost needed to receive
the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.53 percent at 11:06 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.50 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since Nov. 21.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell one basis point to 3.02 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
