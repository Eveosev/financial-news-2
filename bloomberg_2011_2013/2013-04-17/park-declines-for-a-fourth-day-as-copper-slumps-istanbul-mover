Park Elektrik Uretim Madencilik
Sanayi ve Ticaret AS , the Turkish company which derives more
than three quarters of its revenue from copper sales, fell for a
fourth day on concern a decline in the base metal’s prices won’t
bode well for earnings.  The  shares  lost 1.5 percent to 6.6 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the lowest level since March 25 and extending a four-
day drop to 7 percent. Trading volume was about half the stock’s
three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
 Borsa Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  Index decreased 0.4 percent.  “Considering the company’s dependence on copper for
earnings, such short-term reaction could be expected,” Koray Pamir, an analyst at Finans Invest in Istanbul, said by phone.  Copper for delivery in three months dropped as much as 3.6
percent on the London Metal Exchange on concern that demand from
China, the biggest user, will weaken after the  International
Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecast for the nation. Park’s
2012  net income  rose 6 percent to 107.3 million liras ($59.6
million) as 87 percent of sales came from copper, according to
company data. Park has been operating a  copper mine  in Siirt,
southeast  Turkey , since 2006, according to its website.  Copper at present levels or lower would create a “downside
risk” for second-quarter earnings, Pamir said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
