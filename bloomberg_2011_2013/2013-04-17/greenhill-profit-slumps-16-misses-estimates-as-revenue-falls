Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the advisory firm
planning to add five to 10 managing directors this year,
reported first-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates as
revenue slumped.  Net income fell 16 percent to $13.6 million, or 45 cents a
share, from $16.1 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, the New
York-based firm said today in a statement. The  average estimate 
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 67 cents.  Greenhill, run by Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, 53,
has been adding managing directors in anticipation of a pickup
in global merger and acquisition activity, which declined last
year for the first time since 2009. The firm hired Citigroup
Inc.’s Anne Eastep this year to focus on the  insurance industry 
and Carl-Georg Bauer-Schlichtegroll to work with European
financial companies in  London .  “The data for M&A transactions globally shows a relatively
weak level of activity for the first quarter, which has
surprised many after a very strong quarter ending last year,”
Bok said in the statement.  Total revenue fell 3.7 percent to $79.6 million from a year
earlier. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for $98.3 million.  Greenhill fell 1.6 percent to close at $51.09 in  New York .
The shares have slid 1.7 percent this year, trailing the 11
percent  advance  of the 86-company Standard & Poor’s Midcap
Financials Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
