Chancellor  Angela Merkel  wants to
strengthen shareholder oversight of executive compensation at
listed companies before  Germany ’s Sept. 22 elections, according
to Ronald Pofalla, her chief of staff.  Merkel’s Christian Democrat-led coalition intends to pass
the legislation before parliament breaks for its summer recess
on June 28, Pofalla said in a speech in Berlin today. “We will
approve this bill in Cabinet within the next few weeks,” he
said. The proposal so far doesn’t include a pay cap.  Debate in Germany gathered pace after Swiss voters on March
4 backed pay limits including a binding annual shareholder vote
on executive compensation at listed companies and a ban on big
payouts for new hires and for managers when they leave. German
opposition parties hailed the Swiss referendum, increasing
pressure on Merkel to act.  Merkel’s  Christian Democrats  and the Free Democratic Party,
her junior coalition partner, agreed on March 21 to seek
legislation that would give shareholder meetings of listed
German companies the “mandatory task” of making binding pay
recommendations to the supervisory board, according to a
government statement at the time.  Pofalla didn’t provide more specifics on the proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
