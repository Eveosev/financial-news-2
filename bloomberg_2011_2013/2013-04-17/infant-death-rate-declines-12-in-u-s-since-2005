The number of U.S. children who
died in 2011 within a year of birth in 2011 declined 12 percent
from 2005, as fewer babies are born prematurely, health
authorities reported.  Six in 1,000 children died within their first year in 2011
compared with 6.9 per 1,000 in 2005, according to the  Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention .  The number of children who die in their first year is often
used as an indicator of health in a country. In 2008, the U.S.
infant mortality rate was ranked 27th globally in a report from
the Organization for Economic Cooperative Development. Even with
the improvement since 2005, the U.S. likely still ranks 27th,
according to today’s report from the Atlanta-based CDC.  “We should feel pretty proud about this, because it takes
a lot to change population statistics,” said  Carol Miller , a
clinical professor of pediatrics at the  University of
California , San Francisco. She wasn’t involved in the report.
“We’ve been struggling with this issue for quite some time.”  The highest estimated rate of infant mortality in 2012
worldwide was in  Afghanistan , at a rate of 121 children per
1,000 births; the lowest was Monaco, with 1.8 deaths occurring
per 1,000 births, according to the Central Intelligence Agency.
The CIA estimates that 6 children per 1,000 live births died in
the U.S. last year, a higher rate than Canada or the U.K.  The leading cause of infant death in the U.S. was  birth
defects , followed by premature births. Newborns are considered
to be full term after 40 weeks of gestation. Those health
issues, along with sudden infant death syndrome, maternal
complications and unintentional injuries accounted for more than
half of the infant deaths in 2011.  Early Births  “We’ve seen a recent decline in preterm births, which is
good because babies who are born too soon have much higher
infant mortality rates,” said Marian MacDorman, a senior
statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics in
Hyattsville,  Maryland , and a study author. “One thing we think
helped the preterm birth situation was trying to prevent medical
interventions such as early C-sections and inductions.”  The cut in the U.S. infant mortality rate was most rapid in
Southern states.  Georgia ,  Louisiana ,  North Carolina ,  South
Carolina  and the  District of Columbia  had a decline of 20
percent or more in their rates in 2010 compared with 2005, when
they had been “persistently high” for “many years,”
according to the report.  Higher Rates  While no states had a significant increase in infant
deaths, babies were more likely to die after birth in
Mississippi and  Alabama , which had mortality rates of 8 per
1,000 infant births or higher. Data for individual states in
2011 isn’t yet available.  Infant mortality rates declined most for babies born to
black women, dropping 16 percent. Historically, infants have
been  twice as likely  to die in their first year if their mothers
are black compared with those born to white mothers, according
to the CDC’s report.  The higher rates are likely tied to less access to quality
care, poor health, a lack of education about good health
practices, and discrimination, Miller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
