Ivor Dunbar, who oversaw  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ’s relationships with its largest corporate finance
clients, is leaving after 16 years at Germany’s biggest bank.  Dunbar, who joined Deutsche Bank in 1997 and has been based
in London, will leave at the end of this month to pursue outside
interests, spokeswoman Kathryn Hanes said by telephone today.

structured  capital markets  and head of global markets for
Europe.  The announcement was made to employees last month, Hanes
said. Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank declined to comment on
