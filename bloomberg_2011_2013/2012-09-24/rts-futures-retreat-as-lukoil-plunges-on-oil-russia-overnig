export earner, slumped.  Futures on Russian equities declined 0.2 percent to 150,930

Russia’s budget revenue in 2011, fell 6.2 percent last week, the
largest weekly slump since the five days to June 1. The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities retreated for the
first time in eight weeks, losing 4.4 percent. Global slowdown
concerns mounted last week after more Americans than forecast
filed unemployment claims and manufacturing in  China  and  Europe 
slowed. The European Union is Russia’s biggest trading partner.  “Oil is down on an ongoing concern over major consumer
economies, including China, Europe and the U.S.,” Ian Hague,
the founding partner at Firebird Management LLC, which manages
$1.3 billion in assets, said in a phone interview from New York
on Sept. 21. “Oil affects Russia through the mechanism of the
budget and a decline in Russian equities is a reflex of a drop
in  oil prices .”  ETF Declines  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, fell 0.2 percent
to $29.73 on Sept. 21. The RTS Volatility Index retreated 3.1

equals one ADR.  Oil futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  sank 1
percent to $91.97 a barrel in electronic trading as of 11:07
a.m. Hong Kong time today. Prices are down 6.9 percent this
year. Crude may decline this week after data from  Asia , Europe
and  North America  bolstered concern that global economic growth
is slowing, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Slowdown  Thirteen of 27 analysts, or 48 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through Sept. 28. Seven respondents, or 26 percent,
predicted that futures will gain and seven said there will be
little change in prices. The survey has correctly predicted the
direction of futures 50 percent of the time since its start in
April 2004.  A Chinese manufacturing survey on Sept. 20 pointed to an

by 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Brent oil for November settlement climbed 1.3 percent to

exchange, losing 4.5 percent from the previous week. Urals

a barrel on Sept. 21, reducing a drop last week to 4.2 percent.  ‘Commodities as Hedges’  The  Federal Reserve  announced on Sept. 13 that it would
make additional purchases of debt in a third round of so-called
quantitative easing. The move followed a European Central Bank
bond-buying announcement on Sept. 6.  “QE3 and the similar exercise in Europe caused investors
to look more closely at commodities as hedges against
inflation,” Hague said by phone on Sept. 21 “However, there is
no evidence of inflation yet.”  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s fourth-largest oil producer
after OAO Rosneft, OAO Lukoil and  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russian subsidiary
TNK-BP, rose 4.2 percent to $6.67 on Sept. 21, paring a second
