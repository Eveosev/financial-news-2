The Bundesbank said  Germany ’s
economy,  Europe ’s largest, will continue to grow even as the
sovereign debt crisis spreads uncertainty.  “The German economy made a very good start to the summer
quarter” and recent data “speak in favor of Germany continuing
its upward course for now,” the Frankfurt-based central bank
said in its monthly report today. “Still, the outlook for
future economic developments continues to be subject to great
uncertainty.”  German business confidence unexpectedly dropped to the
lowest level in more than two and a half years this month and
unemployment rose for a fifth month in August as companies feel
the strain of weaker euro-area demand and slower global trade.
At the same time, the  European Central Bank ’s new bond-purchase
program has boosted financial markets, helping German investor
confidence rise for the first time in five months in September.  “There are signs that investment spending isn’t declining
further,” the Bundesbank said. While “the labor market is
showing signs of a weaker economy,” growth “continues to be
supported by strong household willingness to spend and apartment
construction.”  The Bundesbank in June lifted its growth forecast for this
year to 1 percent from 0.6 percent. It predicts growth of 1.6
percent for 2013. By contrast, the ECB forecasts the 17-nation
euro region, Germany’s biggest export market, will contract 0.4
percent this year before growing 0.5 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
