Spain  is planning to sell bonds
through its state-run lottery operator to help fund the bailouts
of regional governments, according to two people familiar with
the matter.  The issue will be part of a 6 billion-euro ($7.8 billion)
financing through Sociedad Estatal Loterias & Apuestas del
Estado SA, which is also raising a syndicated loan, the people
said. The central government in  Madrid  is putting together an 18
billion-euro rescue fund for local authorities.  Catalonia, the country’s largest region, Valencia and
Andalusia are among semi-autonomous governments seeking bailouts
after being shut out of international  capital markets . Funds
will only be available in return for budget cuts, according to
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos.  “Loterias will be able to access cash at good rates, given
its stable revenues,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European
rates strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris. It will also
help “reduce pressure on banks already exposed to Spanish
credit.”  The new bonds will be used to refinance at least part of
the loan, the people said. The proceeds from the lottery
financing will be added to 8 billion euros of debt the
government is raising from the country’s banks, and 4 billion
euros from treasury cash.  Details of the financing haven’t been completed, according
to a Madrid-based Loterias official, who asked not to be named
citing company policy. Officials at Spain’s budget ministry
didn’t respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
