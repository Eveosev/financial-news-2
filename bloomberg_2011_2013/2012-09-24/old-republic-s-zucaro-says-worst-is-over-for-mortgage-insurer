Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) ,
the firm that stopped backing new home loans, said its mortgage
insurance unit may return to profit in 2014 as it collects
premiums and pays claims on policies sold in prior years.  “We’re reasonably confident that the worst is over and
that the MI segment in runoff will, more likely than not, turn
the corner into profitability sometime in 2014,” said Aldo Zucaro, chief executive officer of Chicago-based Old Republic,
in a conference call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
