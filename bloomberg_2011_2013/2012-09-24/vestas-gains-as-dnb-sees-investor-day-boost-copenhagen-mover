Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the
world’s biggest wind turbine maker, rose the most in a week in
Copenhagen after DNB Markets told shareholders to stop selling
because the stock may get a boost from next week’s investor day.  Vestas shares  jumped as much as  7.7 percent, the most since
Sept. 17. The stock rose 6.5 percent to 43.38 kroner at 11:01
a.m. in the Danish capital, making it today’s biggest gainer in
the OMX Copenhagen 20 Index.  Vestas, which is cutting jobs as it faces increased Chinese
competition and lower European green energy subsidies, may
present new cost reduction measures at its Oct. 3 capital
markets day, Haakon Levy, an analyst with DNB, said today in a
note. Levy raised his  recommendation  to hold from sell.  “Vestas has pushed ahead with aggressive capacity
expansion and been unable to control costs for new products,”
Oslo-based Levy said. “This means it now must take another hard
look at how much capacity is needed to serve the market and
whether it should be in-house or potentially outsourced.”  The company’s share price rose following its last three
investor days, with increases of 3 percent to 14 percent, Levy
said. Still, the number is too small to make the trend
statistically significant, he said.  The agenda for the capital markets day, to be held at the
turbine maker’s Aarhus, Denmark-based headquarters, includes
items titled ‘Product Cost Out’ and ‘How Vestas Works with
Quality,” according to the company’s  investor website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
