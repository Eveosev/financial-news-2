United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  raised
$1.75 billion in a three-part offering to refinance maturing
debt, the company’s first bond sale in almost two years.  The world’s largest package-delivery company sold $375
million of 1.125 percent, five-year securities that yield 50
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1 billion
of 2.45 percent, 10-year bonds with a 75 basis-point spread and
$375 million of 3.625 percent, 30-year debt with a spread of 80,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Proceeds will be used to repay
its 4.5 percent notes due in January and for general corporate
purposes, Atlanta-based UPS said today in a regulatory filing.  The shipper borrowed the money after yields on investment-
grade debt fell last week to an unprecedented 2.92 percent,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The
freight company, which last issued bonds in November 2010 with a
$2 billion sale, has a weighted average maturity of 13.2 years
on its $10 billion of bonds  outstanding , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Other borrowers that sold or planned to sell at least $10
billion of dollar-denominated debt today included Penske Truck
Leasing Co., which issued $1.5 billion of bonds in a two-part
sale, and lenders  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , which each
offered $1 billion.  Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG managed
the UPS sale, according to the filing. Moody’s Investors Service
said in a statement today it rated the bonds Aa3, its fourth-
highest grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
