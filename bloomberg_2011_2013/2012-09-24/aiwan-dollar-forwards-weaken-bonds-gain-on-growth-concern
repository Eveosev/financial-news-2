Taiwan dollar  forwards fell by the
most in 10 months and  government bonds  advanced as economic data
suggesting the island’s economy is deteriorating spurred
investors to favor safer assets.  The jobless rate rose to 4.29 percent, the highest since
November, the statistics bureau said today. Orders for overseas
sales dropped 1.5 percent in August from a year earlier, a sixth
month of decline, official data showed Sept. 20. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of  stocks  fell on concern talks to resolve
 Europe ’s debt crisis are deadlocked. The Taiwan dollar touched a
four-month high on Sept. 17.  “The currency is far too strong for what the fundamentals
suggest,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , a Hong Kong-based senior currency
strategist at Scotiabank. “Export orders continue to decline on
a year-on-year basis, implying shipments will deteriorate.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.6 percent to
NT$29.469 against the greenback as of 4:26 p.m. local time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the biggest
drop since Nov. 10, 2011 and the contracts are now almost in
line with the spot rate. The Taiwan dollar weakened 0.1 percent
to NT$29.479, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
reached NT$29.198 last week, the strongest level since May 3.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Francois Hollande  underlined Franco-German disagreement over how
to resolve the debt crisis over the weekend as they clashed on a
timetable to introduce joint oversight of the region’s banks.  The island’s industrial production rose 1.89 percent last
month from a year earlier, beating the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg for a 0.66 percent decline, an
official report released today showed. Factory output fell 0.02
percent in July.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent notes due September
2022 was 1.175 percent, compared with 1.179 percent on Sept. 21,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the lowest level
since Sept. 10. The  overnight money-market rate  was little
changed at 0.387 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
