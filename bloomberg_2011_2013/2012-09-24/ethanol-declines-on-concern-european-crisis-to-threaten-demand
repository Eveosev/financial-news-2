Ethanol declined in  Chicago ,
dropping along with other energy markets, on concern the
 European debt crisis  will curtail demand for fuel.  Prices slipped after the Ifo institute in Munich said
German business confidence tumbled to the lowest level in more
than two years and  Chancellor Angela Merkel  and French President
 Francois Hollande  disagreed at a Sept. 22 meeting on a timetable
to introduce joint oversight of Europe’s banks.  “Energy commodities keep trading lower because demand is
faltering,” said Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk
Management Inc. in  Dallas . “Germany is the European Union’s
gold-star economy.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 0.9 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.251 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 2.2 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York slumped 8
cents, or 3.4 percent, to $2.28 a gallon and in Chicago the
biofuel decreased 6.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.21, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 6.5 cents, or 2.8 percent, to
$2.275 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive lost 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.375.  Gasoline for October delivery tumbled 2.49 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.9176 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Gasoline narrowed its  premium  to ethanol to 66.66 cents,
from 68.25 Sept. 21.  Corn for December delivery dropped 3.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $7.4475 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, rose 2 percent to 2.6 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
