The awarding of a 70 million
Trinidad dollars ($10.9 million) contract with the Water and
Sewerage Authority was cancelled after bid selection
irregularities were discovered, the Trinidad & Tobago Guardian
reported, citing the WASA chairman.  The contract for the maintenance of water treatment plants
at Caroni, North Oropouche, Navet and the Arena pumping station
was scrapped and will be put back out for tender and the
evaluation process reviewed, the Port of Spain-based newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
