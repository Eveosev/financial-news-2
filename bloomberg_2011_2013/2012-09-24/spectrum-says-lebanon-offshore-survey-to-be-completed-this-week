(Corrects field’s location in third paragraph.)  Spectrum ASA (SPU) , an oil and gas
services provider, said it’s due to complete a three-dimensional
seismic survey this week of Lebanon’s offshore waters.  Initial results will be available in November, the company
said today in a statement handed to journalists aboard a vessel
off Beirut. The final version will be ready early next year, as
required by the Lebanese government and in time for the
country’s planned first licensing round, it said.  Lebanon is seeking to catch up with  Israel , which has
discovered enough fuel off its northern coast for itself and to
potentially start exports. One offshore field located about 124
kilometers (80 miles) southwest of the Lebanese capital  Beirut 
is estimated to contain as much as 12 trillion cubic feet of
gas, Energy Minister Gebran Bassil told reporters aboard the
vessel.  Surveys have been carried out on a 10,500 kilometer coastal
area, the minister said. Twenty-six companies have bought
surveys of Lebanon’s offshore area for a total of $90 million,
he said.  The Middle East waters are a “promising area” for
hydrocarbon exploration and may attract investments from
international companies when the licensing round starts, Bassil
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
