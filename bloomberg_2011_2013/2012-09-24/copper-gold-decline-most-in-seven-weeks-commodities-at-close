The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  fell 0.9 percent to settle at 657.68
at 4 p.m. in New York, led by metals.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  declined 1
percent to 1,609.96.  BASE METALS  Copper fell the most in seven weeks on concern that the
global economic slowdown is undermining prospects for demand in
 China , the world’s biggest consumer of the metal.  Chinese manufacturers are less optimistic about sales than
they were three months ago, according to a survey by researcher
CBB International LLC. Business confidence unexpectedly slid for
a fifth month in  Germany , which ranks third among copper users,
as  Europe ’s debt crisis clouded the economic outlook.  On the Comex in  New York , copper futures for December
delivery declined 1.5 percent to $3.7315 a pound, the biggest
drop for a most-active contract since Aug. 2.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slid 1.2 percent to $8,183 a metric ton ($3.71 a pound).
Aluminum, tin, lead, zinc and nickel also dropped.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined the most in more than seven weeks as the
dollar gained, eroding demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  On the Comex, gold futures for December delivery fell 0.8
percent to $1,764.60 an ounce, the biggest drop since Aug. 2.  Silver futures for December delivery slid 1.9 percent to

Palladium futures for December delivery retreated 3.9 percent to
$645.50 an ounce, the biggest slump since May 23.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil dropped for the fifth time in six sessions as
discord over the handling of Europe’s debt crisis and the
decline in German business sentiment renewed concern that the
European crisis will reduce energy demand.  On the Nymex, oil futures for November delivery fell 1
percent to $91.93 a barrel.  Brent oil for November settlement decreased 1.4 percent to

shipping schedules obtained by  Bloomberg News .  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline fell on concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
weaken the global economy.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for October delivery dropped
0.8 percent to $2.9176 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for October delivery slid 0.7 percent
to $3.0987 a gallon.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas dropped for the first time in three sessions on
forecasts of moderate weather that would limit demand for
electricity generation.  On the Nymex, gas futures for October delivery fell 1.7
percent to $2.837 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for within-day delivery dropped by the most since
May as the end of North Sea maintenance boosted imports from
 Norway  to the highest in more than two months.  Gas for today slid 2.8 pence, or 4.3 percent, to 61.6 pence
a therm at 4:41 p.m. London time. The month-ahead price fell 1.4
percent to 58.9 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $9.55 per
million Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee futures fell to a two-week low as European debt
concerns mounted, driving commodities and equities lower and

the price touched $1.6765, the lowest since Sept. 10.  Cocoa futures for December delivery declined 3 percent to
