Ireland was put in to bat and ended
on 129-6 against West Indies in the final Group B match in
cricket’s World Twenty20 competition in Colombo, Sri Lanka.  For the second straight match Ireland captain Will
Porterfield was out first ball, this time bowled by  Fidel
Edwards . Niall O’Brien made 25 and Gary Wilson 21.  The match was reduced to 19 overs a side after a rain
delay during the innings. It may be curtailed further after
more rain following Ireland's innings.  The winner will advance to the Super Eight along with group
leader Australia, the loser exiting the tournament.  India, England,  New Zealand ,  South Africa  and Sri Lanka
have already qualified for the next stage in the 12-nation
tournament. Pakistan and Bangladesh meet in Pallekele tomorrow
to decide the second team to qualify from Group D.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
