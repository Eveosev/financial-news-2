Estonia’s  budget surplus  was
revised higher to 1.1 percent of gross domestic product last
year, helped by European Union aid.  The surplus compares with the previous year’s 0.2 percent
and the preliminary figure of 1 percent, published in March, the
Tallinn-based statistics office said on its website today. EU
subsidies helped the central government, which accounts for a 75
percent share of the total budget, accumulate its first surplus
in three years. The social insurance funds contributed the
biggest part of the surplus, it added.  Public debt relative to economic output narrowed to 6.1
percent last year from 6.7 percent a year earlier, the office
said.  Estonia, the first former Soviet republic to adopt the euro
last year, is the only one among the 17 countries using the
common currency to have reported budget surpluses for the last
two years.  Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip ’s Cabinet last week agreed to
raise public wages 4.4 percent next year after the opposition
Social Democrats and the Center Party criticized the country’s
participation in bailouts for richer European countries while it
kept wages and child support frozen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
