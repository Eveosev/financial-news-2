Billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s
AFK Sistema said it plans to compete for state-run OAO Russian
Railways’ 25 percent stake in OAO Freight One in October.  Sistema considers the rail industry to be attractive for
investment and may become a financial investor, Julia Belous, a
spokeswoman for the company, said today by phone.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. sent out preliminary sale offers at
the beginning of the month on behalf of Russian Railways,
Kommersant  reported , citing unidentified people in the rail
transportation market.  Evtushenkov’s Sistema and  Vladimir Lisin ’s UCL Holdings
transportation company were the only companies that submitted
bids, Kommersant said. The minimum price will be 45 billion
rubles ($1.45 billion), the newspaper said.  UCL Holdings, which owns 75 percent of Freight One, wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
