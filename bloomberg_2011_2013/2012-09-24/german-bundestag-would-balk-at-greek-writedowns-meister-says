German lawmakers would refuse to
back a further writedown of Greek debt because such a move would
amount to a third aid program, a senior ally of Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  said.  “How could we possibly do that?” Michael Meister, the
parliamentary finance spokesman for Merkel’s Christian
Democratic Union party, said in an interview in Berlin today.
“Where would it stop? We’re talking about loans from as
recently as last year.”  Germany ’s lower house of parliament,
the Bundestag, which must approve aid, “would not go with it.”  Asked about a report in this week’s Spiegel magazine that
 Greece ’s budget gap may be almost twice as big as envisioned,
Meister said that even if it were true, “it’s up to the
Greeks” to address the problem. He reiterated that as long as
the nominal aid for Greece is not increased, “there are a
number of possibilities, including front-loading financial help
from the second packet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
