War, terrorism, disease, poverty, death. For most people, these concepts cause a great deal of angst. For Germans, it's inflation that's the most troubling. Rising consumer prices emerged as the biggest worry for 63 percent of Germans in  surveys cited  yesterday by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. Inflation beat out serious illness (53 percent), lower  living standards  in old age (40 percent) and terrorism (39 percent). There aren't many living Germans who remember the hyperinflation of the 1920s during the  Weimar Republic , so the fear is mostly a response to the recent acts of central bankers. The  European Central Bank  is now doing the job of politicians in order to save the euro. Its intention is only to buy some time for governments to implement the reforms needed to win the confidence of the  bond market  and of fellow euro-area members. But the printing press and asset-purchase programs are likely to remove the incentive for change and are causing the average citizen to take refuge in tangible assets as the currency loses purchasing power. The stock market, the gold price and real-estate values are showing signs of forthcoming bubbles. ECB President  Mario Draghi 's bond-purchase plan, unveiled on Sept. 6, comes with strict conditions for recipient states. It may now be bringing the euro crisis to a head as countries such as  Spain  balk at applying for bailouts, aware that such a move would involve surrendering partial  sovereignty . This may shield the euro area from an outbreak of inflation as nations snub further aid and ECB bond purchases in the name of economic self-determination. The ECB's new building in Frankfurt is now  under construction . The project's cost has grown to about 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) from the originally planned 850 million euros, mainly due to inflation. For an institution mandated to ensure  price stability , the ECB is giving Germans good reason to lose sleep. ( David Henry  is a Frankfurt-based editor for Bloomberg View.)
