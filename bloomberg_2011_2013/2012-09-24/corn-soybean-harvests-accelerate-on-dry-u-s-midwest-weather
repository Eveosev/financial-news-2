Warm, dry Midwest weather last week
helped U.S. farmers accelerate harvesting of corn and soybeans,
the two biggest U.S. crops.  About 39 percent of the corn was gathered as of yesterday,
up from 26 percent a week earlier and an average of 13 percent
for the previous five years, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a  report . About 22 percent of the soybeans were
collected, up from 10 percent a week earlier and 8 percent, on
average, from 2007 to 2011.  “The harvest is going very quickly with no major rain to
slow down farmers,” Joseph Vaclavik, the president of Standard
Grain Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview before the
report. “The vast majority of farmers are looking to sell
soybeans right out of the field to take advantage of record
prices at harvest.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.7 percent to
close at $16.10 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after
earlier touching $15.9025, the lowest since Aug. 14. December
corn futures fell 0.5 percent to $7.4475 a bushel in  Chicago .  About 88 percent of the corn crop was rated mature, up from
76 percent a week earlier and the prior five-year average of 57
percent. Approximately 51 percent of the corn was in poor or
very poor condition, up from 50 percent a week earlier, the USDA
said.  About 35 percent of the nation’s soybeans were rated good
or excellent as of yesterday, up from 33 percent a week earlier,
the USDA said. Approximately 73 percent of the crop was dropping
leaves ahead of harvesting, up from 57 percent a week earlier.  Crop ratings are the worst for this time of year since
1988, when corn production plunged 31 percent from a year
earlier and soybeans declined 20 percent. This year, output of
the grain will fall 13 percent to 10.727 billion bushels, the
smallest since 2006, the USDA said Sept. 12. The soybean harvest
may be 14 percent smaller at 2.634 billion bushels. The
government will update its forecasts on Oct. 11.  The winter-wheat crop, grown in the Midwest and Great
Plains, was 25 percent planted as of yesterday, up from 11
percent a week earlier and 27 percent, on average, from 2007 to
2011. The crop goes dormant over the winter until about March,
and is harvested starting in May.  “It’s just way too dry to plant wheat in parts of the
Plains,” Vaclavik said. “Growers are waiting for rain the next
two weeks before increasing wheat seeding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
