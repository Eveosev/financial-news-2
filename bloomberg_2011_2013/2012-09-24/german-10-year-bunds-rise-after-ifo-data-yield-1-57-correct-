(Corrects third paragraph to show index was last lower in
February 2010.)  German 10-year bunds advanced after
a report showed a gauge of business confidence unexpectedly fell
for a fifth straight month in September.  The 10-year rate fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage points, to 1.57 percent as of 9:04 a.m. London time.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to 101.4
from 102.3 in August. Thatâ€™s the lowest reading since February
2010. Economists predicted an increase to 102.5, according to
the median of 37 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
