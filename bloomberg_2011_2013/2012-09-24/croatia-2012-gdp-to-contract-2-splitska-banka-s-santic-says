Croatia ’s economy will contract 2
percent this year on a reduction in industrial production and
consumption, said Zdeslav Santic, the chief economist at  Soc-Gen
Splitska Banka d.d. .  The Adriatic Sea nation, which is set to become the
European Union’s 28th member in July 2013, is struggling to
revive its economy after two years of recession and a period of
stagnation in 2011. Economic output fell 2.2. percent in the
second quarter of the year, after dropping 1.3 percent from the
three months through March.  The  World Bank  estimated Croatia’s economy will shrink 1
percent in 2012, while the  central bank  on July 9 revised its
forecast to a 1.6 percent contraction from a 1 percent decline
forecast in May.  The country will have “modest growth” of 0.5 percent in
2013, Santic said, boosted by Croatia’s entry into the European
Union and a recovery in exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
