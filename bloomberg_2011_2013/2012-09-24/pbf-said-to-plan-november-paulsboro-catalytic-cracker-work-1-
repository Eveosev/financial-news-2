PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  plans to shut a
fluid catalytic cracker at the Paulsboro  refinery  New Jersey in
November for maintenance, according to a person familiar with
the project.  The work will probably last 20 to 30 days, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the information isn’t
public. The maintenance was moved to November after previously
being planned for October, according to the person.  Michael Karlovich, a spokesman at PBF’s headquarters in
Parsippany, New Jersey, declined to comment in an e-mail.  The refinery has a capacity of 185,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
