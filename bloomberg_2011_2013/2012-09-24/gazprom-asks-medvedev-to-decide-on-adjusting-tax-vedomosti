OAO Gazprom Chief Executive Officer
Alexey Miller asked Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  to decide by
the end of the year whether it’s possible to vary tax on
natural-gas extraction according to the characteristics of
particular gas fields,  Vedomosti  reported.  If the government doesn’t do that, Gazprom won’t be able to
invest in exploration of new fields, starting next year, the
newspaper cited Miller as saying. OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-
biggest natural-gas producer, supports Gazprom’s proposal,
Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
