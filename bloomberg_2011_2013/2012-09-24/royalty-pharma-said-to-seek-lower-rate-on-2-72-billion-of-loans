Royalty Pharma Finance Trust, a
company that acquires revenue-producing intellectual property in
biopharmaceutical products, is seeking to lower the rate it pays
on $2.72 billion of loans, according to a person with knowledge
of the transaction.  The  interest rate  on a $1.88 billion term loan due in May
2018 will be reduced to 2.75 percentage points to 3 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private. Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from
each other, will have a 75 basis-point floor. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Royalty Pharma is also seeking to reduce the rate it pays
on an $840.1 million term loan due November 2016 to 2.5
percentage points to 2.75 percentage points more than Libor,
with a 75 basis-point minimum on the lending benchmark, the
person said.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, according to the person, meaning the company would
have to pay 1 cent more than face value to refinance the debt
during the first year.  The company’s existing  term loan  due 2018 pays interest at
3 percentage points more than Libor, with a 1 percent floor and
was sold to investors at 99.5 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Commitment Deadlines  Royalty Pharma’s loan maturing in 2016 pays interest at a
2.75 percentage point margin, with a 1 percent Libor floor and
was sold to investors at 99.75 cents, the data show.  The loans are quoted at 101.125 cents and 101.25 cents
respectively, Bloomberg data show.  Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. are arranging the financing for the New York-
based company, the person said. Commitments from existing
lenders are due Sept. 27 by 5 p.m. while new lenders must let
the banks know by noon on Oct. 2 whether they will participate
in the deal.  Alexander von Perfall, vice president of  investor relations 
at Royalty Pharma, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
