The European Union said it hopes
the U.S. will focus its efforts on achieving a global agreement
on reducing  greenhouse gases  from airlines, said Isaac
Valero-Ladron, climate spokesman for the European Commission.  The EU won’t give up expansion of its emissions-trading
system into aviation, Valero-Ladron told a briefing in Brussels
today. Valero-Ladron’s comments follow the adoption by the  U.S.
Senate  on Sept. 22 of a bill that could bar U.S. airlines from
participating in the European carbon program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
