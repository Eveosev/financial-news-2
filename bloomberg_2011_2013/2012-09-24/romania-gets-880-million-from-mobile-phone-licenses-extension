Romania  raised 682 million euros
($880 million) from extending mobile phone licenses, the
country’s telecommunications market regulator, ANCOM, said.  France Telecom SA (FTE) , Vodafone Group Plc,  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO) ’s Cosmote mobile unit and two
Romanian companies bought the licenses, ANCOM said in a document
published on its website today.  The eastern European country was seeking to get about 700
million euros from extending the phone licenses, some of them
through 2029. It managed to sell about 85 percent of the
auctioned frequencies, the regulator said.  Vodafone paid 228.5 million euros for 11 frequencies,
Orange bought 12 frequencies for 227 million euros and Cosmote
paid about 180 million for eight frequencies.  Romania’s RCS&RDS SA paid 40 million euros for two
frequencies and 2K Telecom 6.6 million euros for one frequency,
ANCOM said.  The five companies will pay the amounts for the licenses in
two tranches, one by the end of November and the other by the
end of June 2013, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
