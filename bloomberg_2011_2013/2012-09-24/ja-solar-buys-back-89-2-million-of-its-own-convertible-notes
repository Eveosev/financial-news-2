JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) ,  China ’s
largest solar-cell maker, bought back $89.2 million of its debt,
cutting the value of its outstanding senior notes by 41 percent.  The company purchased its 4.5 percent convertible notes in
the current quarter, reducing the face value of the outstanding
notes to $130.5 million from $219.7 million on June 30,
according to a statement today.  The company is seeking to strengthen its balance sheet, in
part to avoid being dropped from the Nasdaq Stock Market after
the price of its American depositary receipts fell below $1,
said  Pavel Molchanov , an analyst at Raymond James & Associates
in Houston. JA Solar announced in June it would repurchase as
much as $100 million of its ADRs, a plan that may no longer be
possible.  “The reality is that this company has been burning cash,
and it’s certainly not in a position to do share repurchases,”
Molchanov said today in an interview.  JA Solar’s ADRs have closed below $1 for 18 consecutive
trading days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Suntech
Power Holdings Co., the world’s largest solar-panel
manufacturer, said Sept. 21 it received a delisting warning
after its average closing price was below $1 for 30 consecutive
days as of Sept. 10.  JA Solar, based in  Shanghai , fell 4.9 percent to 86 cents
at the close in  New York . The ADRs last closed above $1 on Aug.
