OAO Raspadskaya, a Russian producer
of coal for steelmaking, headed for the lowest level in almost
two weeks after cutting its production targets through 2013.  Raspadskaya fell as much as 2.9 percent today and traded
down 2.4 percent at 78.60 rubles by 1:46 p.m. in Moscow. A close
at that level would be the lowest since Sept. 13, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The company cut its coal production target for this year by
33 percent to 7 million metric tons and reduced 2013 guidance by
as much as 15 percent, Chief Executive Officer Gennady Kozovoy
said during a conference call Sept. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
