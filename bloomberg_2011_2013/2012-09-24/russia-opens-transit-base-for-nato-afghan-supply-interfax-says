Russia  opened an airbase as a
transit point for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to
transport supplies from  Afghanistan , Interfax reported.  The base is up and running and Russia is awaiting
confirmation from NATO of the date they wish to start using the
facility, the Russian president’s special envoy to Afghanistan,
Zamir Kabulov, was cited as saying by the Moscow-based news
service.  NATO won’t be permitted to station any personnel at the
airbase in Ulyanovsk, a city about 900 kilometers (560 miles)
east of Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
