Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  is
on track to beat Henrique Capriles Radonski in the Oct. 7
election even as the incumbent’s lead shows signs of narrowing,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, citing polls conducted by
other companies.  Chavez’s lead over Capriles narrowed to 10 percentage
points from 15 percentage points in the latest Datanalisis
survey taken between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5, bank economist
 Francisco Rodriguez  wrote in a report e-mailed to investors
today. He would have won 56.3 percent of the vote and Capriles
43.7 percent had the election been held this month, Rodriguez
said basing his estimates on seven surveys conducted in late
August and early September by polling companies including
Consultores 30.11 and Hinterlaces.  “This rate of decline appears insufficient to close the
remaining gap between the candidates by election day,”
Rodriguez wrote. “These results suggest the most likely
scenario would be a Chavez re-election, with a high likelihood
of a double-digit advantage.”  Chavez, who is seeking to extend nearly 14 years in power
with another six-year term, is facing his closest electoral
fight yet after his opponents unified behind a single candidate.
Chavez’s lead in the polls has fallen by 3.3 percentage points
from August and 9.8 percentage points in the past four months,
according to Rodriguez.  Diverging Results  Polling company Consultores 30.11 in a Sept. 14-18 survey
shows Chavez with 57.2 percent support and Capriles with 35.7
percent, while Hinterlaces in an Aug. 14 to Aug. 24 poll has the
incumbent at 50 percent compared to his opponent’s 32 percent,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.  Varianzas in a Aug. 2 to Aug. 15 poll has Chavez at 49.3
percent and Capriles with 47.2 percent, while IVAD in a Sept. 2
to Sept. 10 survey shows Chavez ahead by 18.1 percentage points
with 50.3 percent support, according to the report.  In the Datanalisis poll, Chavez had 47.3 percent against
37.2 percent for Capriles, according to the report that didn’t
give a sample size or margin of error. Luis Vicente Leon,
president of Datanalisis will present the firm’s latest survey
at an event in Caracas tomorrow.  ‘Totally Impossible’  Chavez said Sept. 5 that it’s “totally impossible” for
him to lose the election and that the only issue to resolve is
how wide of a margin of victory he’ll obtain. Chavez, 58, says
that he’s cured from an undisclosed form of cancer that saw him
fly to Cuba for a third operation to remove a tumor in February.  Capriles, a 40-year-old former governor of Miranda state,
has visited more than 250 towns across the country and is
promising to maintain some of Chavez’s popular social programs
while dismantling economic policies such as currency and price
controls in his bid to unseat the self-declared socialist.  The yield on the benchmark 9.25 percent bonds due in 2027
fell 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 10.96 percent
at 4:40 p.m. Caracas time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.54 cents to 87.56 cents on
the dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
