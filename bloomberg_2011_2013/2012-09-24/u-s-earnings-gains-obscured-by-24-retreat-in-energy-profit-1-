The unbroken streak of Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index profit growth that spurred a three-year  bull
market  would last another quarter if not for energy companies,
whose profits are poised to slump the most since 2009.  Income at oil and gas producers  will fall 24 percent in the
three months ending in September, the largest decline in three
years, according to more than 1,200 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Excluding the retreat, earnings in the benchmark
gauge for U.S. stocks would climb 2.5 percent, the 12th straight
increase, amid gains for banks and computer makers, data show.  Lower earnings from  Apache Corp. (APA)  to  Occidental Petroleum
Corp. (OXY)  reflect the drop in oil and gas prices in May and don’t
signal lasting weakness in U.S. profits after they doubled since
2009, according to BB&T Wealth Management’s Walter “Bucky” Hellwig. Bears say investors should heed the decline because
 energy (S5ENRS)  suppliers are the fourth-biggest industry in the S&P 500
and their income reflects economic momentum.  “Over the past three years, companies have done well in
growing earnings in a very challenging revenue environment,”
Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion at BB&T in Birmingham,
 Alabama , said in a Sept. 18 telephone interview. “For stocks as
a whole, the earnings growth rate slowdown’s already been
discounted. Companies will continue to generate favorable
earnings and favorable earnings growth.”  Shares Drop  The S&P 500  fell  0.4 percent to 1,460.15 last week, the
first drop since August, after European Union finance ministers
failed to calm concern about the region’s debt crisis.  Energy
shares (SPXL1)  lost 1.8 percent, the biggest drop after banks, as oil
slumped 6.2 percent in  New York , the most since June. The U.S.
equity benchmark slipped 0.2 percent to 1,456.89 at 4 p.m.
today.  The index has advanced 16 percent  this year , extending the
bull market rally since March 2009 to 116 percent. Better-than-
estimated earnings, rising  consumer confidence  and home sales,
and Federal Reserve stimulus in the form of record low interest
rates and bond-buying programs have boosted stock prices.  Eleven straight quarters of income growth will help push
U.S. earnings to $1.13 trillion in 2012, according to data on
stocks with market values of at least $1 billion compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with $784 billion in 2007. Per-share
profits climbed 15 percent in 2011 and 36 percent last year.  Profit Outlook  Even as earnings for the benchmark gauge fall 2 percent
this quarter,  financial firms  are forecast to post an 18 percent
increase, the most since 2010, and technology profits will rise
3.1 percent, estimates show.  S&P 500  earnings may surpass  $100 a
share  for the first time ever this year and growth will average
12 percent annually through 2014, according to analysts.  The 24 percent earnings slump for oil and gas companies,
which  account  for 11 percent of the $13.2 trillion S&P 500
market value, would be the biggest decrease since they fell 24
percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Energy earnings fell 17 percent between April
and June after dropping 3.8 percent in the first three months of
2012.  Crude slipped to $77.69 a barrel in June and gas is more
than 70 percent below the high reached in 2008. The commodities
slumped as supply increases outpaced consumption and new
technology made it easier to find them. The  International
Monetary Fund  forecasts the world economy will  expand  3.5
percent this year, down from the 3.9 percent rate in 2011.  ‘Slowed Down’  “Certainly, we’ve slowed down as the world has slowed
down,” Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at the
private-banking unit of KeyCorp in  Cleveland , said in a Sept. 18
phone interview. His firm oversees $20 billion. “Earnings
growth does matter over the intermediate term. By and large, you
need a stronger growth rate to be able to propel stocks
dramatically higher.”  Weakening energy profits have coincided with economic
slumps in the past. The industry posted five straight quarters
of shrinking earnings from the end of 2008 through 2009 as U.S.
GDP contracted. Profit fell in the last three months of 2006
before economic growth slowed to 0.5 percent the next quarter
from 2.7 percent in the previous one.  Crude has surged 20 percent to $92.89 a barrel since
reaching a nine-month low in June. Oil will reach $99.21 in 2013
and surpass $100 in 2014, according to the average of 29
economist projections compiled by Bloomberg. After a 0.3 percent
increase in profits for the fourth quarter, energy producers
will post an 8.8 percent profit gain in 2013 and 9.6 percent in
2014, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Invest Now  “By the time oil companies report earnings, they’re
talking about  oil prices  that were in the past,” Wasif Latif,
vice president of equity investments at USAA Investments in  San
Antonio , which oversees $50 billion, said in an interview at
Bloomberg in New York. “Do you want to be investing at where
the price was then or now? I would argue it’s now. Based on the
price now, the next quarter’s going to be pretty good.”  Apache, the third-largest U.S. independent oil and natural-
gas producer by market value, cited a decline in energy prices
when reporting a  36 percent drop  in second-quarter income.
Earnings at the Houston-based company are projected to contract
25 percent in the current period before climbing in 2013 and
2014, estimates show.  Oil Prices  Occidental Petroleum’s quarterly profit also fell because
of lower oil prices. Earnings at the largest onshore crude
producer in the continental U.S. slipped 26 percent last quarter
and will drop another 25 percent for the three months ending
this week. A rise in oil prices since June has led  analysts  to
boost the third-quarter average projection by 5 cents to $1.63
since Aug. 7, and the company is forecast to increase earnings
10 percent next year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  For industries that count energy prices in their expenses,
the slowdown has meant lower costs and higher earnings. U.S.
Airways Group Inc. exceeded analyst projections last quarter
because it paid less for  jet fuel  and collected higher fares.
Fuel, its largest cost, fell 4.4 percent.  The oil-price slump that began in May sent energy earnings
falling and helped drag down the S&P 500 as investors speculated
the world economy was slowing.  China ’s declining production and
the euro zone’s drop in manufacturing fueled speculation the
U.S. and world would fall into a recession.  Global Growth  Economists cut forecasts for world economic growth to 2.2
percent from 2.6 percent in June, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In the U.S., 2012 gross domestic product projections fell
to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent this year. They now predict 2012
American GDP will expand 2.2 percent as the housing market
recovers and consumer confidence improves. Crude and natural gas
rose 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively, from 2012 lows.  “You’re in the energy price sweet spot right here where
companies can make money but it’s not enough to crimp global
demand,” John Canally, an economist and investment strategist
at LPL Financial Corp. in  Boston , said in a Sept. 19 telephone
interview. The firm oversees about $350 billion. “The overall
global backdrop for stocks is better than it was a couple of
weeks ago.”  Wall Street strategists estimate the index will surpass its
all-time record of 1,565.15 next year, as earnings continue to
rise, according to Bloomberg data. The highest is 1,615 from
Citigroup Inc.’s Tobias Levkovich.  Stocks Valuation  The growth in earnings has kept the S&P 500’s valuation
below the historical average. The index trades at 14.9 times
reported profits and 14.1 times estimated earnings, 14 percent
below the five-decade average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “When energy prices are going up and when commodity prices
are going up, it’s usually a good thing for earnings and it’s a
good thing for the market because it’s reflecting strong
economic growth,”  James McDonald , chief investment strategist
at Northern Trust Corp. in  Chicago , said in a Sept. 19 telephone
interview. His firm manages $704.3 billion. “The earnings
picture tends to be a lagging reflection of what’s going on in
the global economy and so investors are relatively nervous about
the pace of growth and I think that probably sets us up for some
modest upside.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
