Daniel Cohn-Bendit, co-head of the
 Green Party  in the European Parliament, quit France’s Europe
Ecology party after it decided to vote against the ratification
of the euro area budget treaty.  The decision “is irresponsible and incoherent,” Cohn-
Bendit said today in  Liberation  newspaper. This is “in total
contradiction with what we’ve defended for years in the
ecological movement.”  French President  Francois Hollande ’s cabinet, which
includes two ministers from Europe Ecology, agreed to ratify the
treaty last week. Lawmakers in France’s National Assembly will
consider the text starting on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
