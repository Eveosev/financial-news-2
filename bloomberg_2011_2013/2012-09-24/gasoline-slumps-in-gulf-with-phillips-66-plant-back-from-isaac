Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened to the
lowest level in a month after Phillips 66 restarted its Alliance
refinery, which was shut for Hurricane Isaac.  The 247,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Belle Chasse,
 Louisiana , shut Aug. 28 in preparation for Isaac, the company
said in a statement on its website. Alliance is one of the last
refineries to restart in the wake of Isaac, a Category 1
hurricane that closed seven refineries representing 13 percent
of Gulf Coast capacity.  The premium for  reformulated , 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
on the Gulf Coast slid 5.13 cents to 2.50 cents a gallon versus
futures traded traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
1:50 p.m. That’s the smallest premium since Aug. 23, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slid 8.28 cents
to $2.9425 a gallon.  New York  Harbor reformulated gasoline’s premium slid 1.25
cents to 15.75 cents a gallon.  Valero Corp.’s Meraux refinery continues to operate at
reduced rates because the sole crude unit remains disabled from
a July 22 fire. Restart of the unit was delayed when Meraux was
shut for Isaac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
