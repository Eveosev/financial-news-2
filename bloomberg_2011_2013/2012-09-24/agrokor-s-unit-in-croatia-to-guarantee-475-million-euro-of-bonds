Konzum d.d ., a retail unit of
 Croatia ’s biggest private company Agrokor d.d., said it will
provide guarantees for seven-year bonds worth the equivalent of
at least 475 million euros ($614 million).  The bonds, planned by Agrokor, will be denominated in euros
or U.S. dollars, or in a combination of both currencies, Konzum
said in a  statement  to the  Zagreb stock exchange . Konzum is the
biggest unit among other Agrokor subsidiaries, which will also
provide guarantees for the bond sale.  Agrokor in April issued a 300-million euro bond, also
guaranteed by Konzum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
