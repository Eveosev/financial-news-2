Gold declined after a rally to the
highest price in more than six months and best run of weekly
gains in more than a year prompted some investors to sell the
metal. Silver, platinum and palladium dropped.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.9 percent to $1,757.70 an ounce
and was at $1,762.85 at 12:10 p.m. in  Singapore . The price
touched $1,787.52 on Sept. 21, the costliest since the year’s
high of $1,790.75 on Feb. 29. Last week’s 0.2 percent rise was
the fifth weekly climb, the best advance since August 2011.  Gold advanced 11 percent this quarter to last week’s close
after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Sept. 13 a third
round of debt-buying to bolster the economy, boosting concern
the dollar may weaken while inflation accelerates. The  European
Central Bank  said on Sept. 6 it planned a bond-purchase program
to fight the debt crisis, while the  Bank of Japan  boosted
stimulus and  China  approved additional infrastructure spending.  “Double-digit gains for the quarter are going to be
attractive for people to book their gains,” said Nick Trevethan,
senior commodities strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. “With prices up near the highs for the year on Sept.
21, and the market seemingly not able to push through $1,800,
it’s fair to say some people are cashing in.”  December-delivery bullion fell as much as 1.1 percent to
$1,759.20 an ounce on the Comex, and traded at $1,765.20.
Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products climbed 0.5
percent to a record 2,535.55 metric tons on Sept. 21, according
to data tracked by Bloomberg. ETP assets have risen for 14
straight sessions. The  Dollar Index  gained 0.3 percent today.  Silver dropped as much as 2 percent to $33.8462 an ounce,
the lowest level since Sept. 17, and traded at $34.015. Platinum
declined as much as much as 1.6 percent to $1,610 an ounce, and
was at $1,620. Palladium fell as much as 2.1 percent to $658 an
ounce and traded at $661.50.  To contact the reporter for this story:
