Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU) , a Nigerian
producer, rose to the highest in more than a year after gaining
for a third day, as investors speculated it could be among the
next set of stocks to be included for market-making activities.  The stock gained 4.8 percent to 8.08 naira at the close in
Lagos, its highest since Sept. 6, 2011.  The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  chose 16 stocks as trial
securities and 10 primary market-makers on Sept. 18 for a
program designed to improve liquidity. It raised daily trading
limits on the selected stocks from 5 percent, which still
applies to other equities, to 10 percent. The next set of stocks
for market making will be announced within a month, Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Kundila Finance Ltd., said
by phone today.  “Investors are speculating that Dangote Flour will be
among them and that’s why they are taking position on the stock
now,” he said. Dangote Flour is “one of the most liquid”
stocks on the Nigerian bourse, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
