The  United Nations  confirmed its
troops spotted a white plane dropping packages in an area where
 South Sudan  said a Sudanese aircraft supplied weapons to rebels,
a day before the countries’ presidents were to meet.  A Sudanese Antonov plane air-dropped weapons and ammunition
to the militia led by David Yau Yau, which is fighting South
Sudanese troops in Jonglei state, South  Sudan  said on Sept. 22.  “There was a white fixed-wing aircraft that was observed
by Unmiss troops dropping packages,” UN Mission in South Sudan
spokesman Kouider Zerrouk said today by telephone from Juba,
South Sudan’s capital. “But Unmiss is not in a position to
confirm what was in them and who dropped them.”  Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir and South Sudanese
President  Salva Kiir  met for African Union-brokered talks in the
Ethiopian capital,  Addis Ababa , yesterday, AFP reported. The two
leaders are expected to sign pacts to help end a dispute over
oil fees and border security that brought the countries to the
brink of war in April, and prompted the UN Security Council to
threaten sanctions.  South Sudan became the world’s newest country on July 9,
2011, and upon secession took about 75 percent of the previously
united country’s oil production. The conflict over crude, which
prompted South Sudan to halt 350,000 barrels a day of oil
shipments via a pipeline to a Sudanese port, threatened both
nations’ economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
