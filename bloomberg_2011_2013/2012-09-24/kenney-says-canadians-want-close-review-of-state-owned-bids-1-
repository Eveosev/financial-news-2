Canadians want a “rigorous”
review of acquisitions of domestic assets by foreign state-owned
firms, Immigration Minister  Jason Kenney  said today.  The Canadian government is reviewing Beijing-based  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) ’s $15.1 billion bid for Calgary-based  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  under the
country’s foreign-takeover law. The government will examine the
offer in an “impartial” way under the criteria set out in the
 Investment Canada Act , Kenney told reporters today in Ottawa.  “Most Canadians want to ensure that the government applies
a rigorous lens to acquisitions of large Canadian resource
companies, particularly by state-owned enterprises, but we do so
in a lawful way,” he said.  Kenney, the former chairman of the House of Commons
subcommittee on international human rights, said the government
takes a “balanced approach” toward its relations with China,
“one that advances both our interests, such as trade and
commerce, and our values, such as the importance of human
rights.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
