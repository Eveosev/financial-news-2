Housing Finance Ltd. (HFCL) ,  Kenya ’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, jumped the most in more than
three weeks after saying it would begin selling 3 billion
shillings ($35.3 million) of bonds on Oct. 1 to build new homes.  The stock advanced 1.9 percent to 13.65 shillings by the
close in the capital, Nairobi, the biggest gain since Aug. 31.  The bond sale will close Oct. 12, Housing Finance said in
an e-mailed statement today. The company raised 7 billion
shillings from a 2010  bond issue , and this is the second portion
of the 10 billion shillings it has regulatory approval to sell.  About 200,000 housing units are required annually in
Kenya’s urban areas and only about 50,000 units are developed
every year, Managing Director Frank Ireri said in the statement,
citing Finance Ministry data.  “These bonds could be a huge step from the company because
they are coming into a segment which no one is touching, the
middle- and low-income housing segment,” Rufus Mwanyasi, head
trader at Nairobi-based Canaan Capital, said in a phone
interview today.  In April, the  European Investment Bank  agreed to loan
Housing Finance 2.2 billion shillings and London-based Ghana
International Bank loaned it $10 million in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
