The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development approved a 5.2 million-euro ($6.7
million) loan to help build two hydropower plants in Albania.  Hydro Power Plant of Korca sh.p.k will build the plants
with an annual output of 23 gigawatt-hours in the eastern part
of the country, the London-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The plants are set to start operating in 2013.  “This project will help improve the security of  energy
supply  and clearly demonstrates the sector has the potential to
become a key driver in the development of the Albanian
economy,” Fabio Serri, head of the EBRD’s office in Albania
said in the statement.  Albania, whose economy expanded 3 percent last year,
according to the  International Monetary Fund , generates almost
all of its electricity from hydropower plants.  Since the beginning of its operations in Albania, the EBRD
has invested over 700 million euros in the country. Hydro Power
Plant’s owners are  Italy ’s Fidia Ambiente and EdilEurope srl as
well as Albania’s Xhemi sh.p.k., according to the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
