German water consumption has
dropped to its lowest value in more than two decades even as
investments from utilities increase, the BDEW utility lobby
said.  Private consumers and companies consumed 4.45 billion cubic
meters of water in 2011, a 26 percent drop compared with 1990,
the lobby said today in an e-mailed statement. Each German
consumes about 121 liters (32 gallons) of water a day, down from
147 liters in 1990, BDEW said.  Investments from water utilities are expected to reach 2.5
billion euros ($3.2 billion) in 2012 from 2.3 billion euros last
year, BDEW said. Theyâ€™ll be about 2.4 billion euros in 2013 and
2014, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
