Aircraft maker Airbus SAS and  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , the company known as Sinopec that’s
the country’s largest fuel supplier, agreed to work together to
develop cleaner  jet fuel  in  China .  The companies are helping China to establish airworthiness
certification for renewable jet fuels made from locally grown
plants, Airbus said today in an e-mailed statement. The process
may take one to two years, Frederic Eychenne, Airbus New
Energies Program Manager, said by phone.  Sinopec has developed its own technology for making jet
fuel from biomass and waste oil at a new refinery near Shanghai,
according to the statement. It’s one of the only facilities
capable of making  aviation fuel  from biomass in large
quantities, it said.  The companies are also working to set up an alternative
fuel “value chain” in China, which would bring together
growers, distributors and government agencies to help accelerate
its commercialization.  China Eastern (670)  Airlines Corp. last month
said it’s joining Airbus’ network.  Airbus and  Boeing Co. (BA)  are among airplane producers building
supply networks for alternative fuel in an aviation industry
that makes up 2 percent of world carbon-dioxide output. Airbus
in March joined a group including  Virgin Australia (VAH)  to study use
of eucalyptus mallee trees for fuel, and has an agreement with
Brazil’s  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  to collaborate on aviation biofuels.  The aviation industry aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions
in half by 2050 compared with 2005 levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
