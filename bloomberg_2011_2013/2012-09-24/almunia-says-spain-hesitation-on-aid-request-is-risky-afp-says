Spain’s reluctance to ask for a
full international bailout is “very risky” and could prove
costly, Agence France-Presse reported, citing European Union
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia .  “The Spanish authorities should make a decision on a
possible rescue,” Almunia said told AFP in an interview
published today. “This decision isn’t entirely black or white,
but what’s really risky is continuing the uncertainty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
