Itron Inc. (ITRI) , which makes energy-
saving meters for utilities, said it was selected to provide
smart meters to Melbourne and regional companies in Australia’s
Victoria state so they can better manage water consumption.  The contract to help City West Water, South East Water,
Yarra Valley Water and Barwon Water optimize usage, modernize
their water networks and conserve resources follows a 3-year
water-meter contract with the utilities, the Liberty Lake,
Washington-based company said today in a statement.  Itron competes with Switzerland’s Landis + Gyr AG, acquired
by  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  last year for $2.3 billion, and  Elster Group
SE (ELTTY) , acquired in June by Melrose Plc.  No terms for the agreement were given by Itron, whose
shares have risen 22 percent this year in  New York  trading
compared with a 13 percent gain by the 18-member Bloomberg World
Water Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
