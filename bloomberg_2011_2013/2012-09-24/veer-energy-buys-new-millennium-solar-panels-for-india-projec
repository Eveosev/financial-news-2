Veer Energy & Infrastructure Ltd. (JHI) ,
a Mumbai-based wind-power developer, bought solar panels for its
first project in  India  from U.S.-based New Millennium Solar
Equipment Corp.  Veer plans to install 400 thin-film panels of 58.5 watts
each for a rooftop project in the Sanand district of the western
Indian state of Gujarat, the company said in a filing today.  It will be Veer Energyâ€™s first solar installation. The
company, which plans to pursue larger megawatt-sized projects
after this pilot, expects to earn an additional 20 million
rupees ($374,111) profit in the year to March 31, 2014, from its
solar business, it said.  New Millennium Solar was acquired in September 2011 by
Sunlogics Inc., a Rochester Hills, Michigan-based company backed
by  General Motors Co. (GM)  Sunlogics has changed its name to ViSole
Energy Inc., according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
