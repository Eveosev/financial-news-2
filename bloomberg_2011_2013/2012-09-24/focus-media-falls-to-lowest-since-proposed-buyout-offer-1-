Focus Media Holding Ltd. (FMCN)  dropped to
the lowest level in six weeks in  New York  on speculation a $3.5
billion buyout offer by a group of private equity firms
including  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  won’t be completed.  American depositary receipts of Focus Media sank 3.6
percent to $22.91 at the close of trading in New York, the
lowest closing level since Aug. 9. The advertising company’s
board received a “going private” proposal on Aug. 13 at $27
per share from Chief Executive Officer Jason Nanchun Jiang,
Washington-based Carlyle and Hong Kong-based FountainVest.  Shares of Shanghai-based Focus Media have fallen 10 percent
since the bid was proposed. The acquisition would mark China’s
largest leveraged buyout.  “Investors appear to be saying that they’re not going to
wait around for this deal to close,” David Riedel, president of
Riedel Research Group Inc., said in a phone interview from  San
Francisco . “There’s limited upside from here so the thinking
is, investors can get better returns employing their money
elsewhere. This is dead money until the deal is completed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
