The  European Central Bank ’s
decision to buy bonds in support of European Union efforts to
bring down borrowing costs is not a defeat for Germany, which
opposed the program, former ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  wrote in a letter in la Repubblica.  “Members of the governing council make their decisions
based on the interest of the euro zone as a whole,” he wrote in
the Rome-based paper. “Decisions don’t represent the opinions
of a country, of a government or of national central banks.”  For members to act independently of national interest is
“essential to guarantee the independence of the central bank,”
Bini Smaghi said.  Bini Smaghi also said that ECB President  Mario Draghi 
wasn’t wading into the political realm when he declared the euro
irreversible. Under the Maastricht Treaty that established the
single currency, there is no mechanism for a country to abandon
the euro, he wrote. The ECB ability to carry out monetary policy
is also based on the premise that the euro is irreversible
because “any doubt that the euro could break up or that a
country could leave would generate immediate financial
instability,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
