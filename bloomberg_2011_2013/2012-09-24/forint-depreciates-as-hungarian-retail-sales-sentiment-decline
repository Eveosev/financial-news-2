The forint weakened for the first
time in four days as  Hungary ’s economic sentiment fell to an
eight-month low and retail sales dropped, adding to speculation
the central bank will cut rates to help the economic recovery.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 282.88 per
euro by 4:36 p.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s
benchmark bonds due in 2022 fell four basis point, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.297 percent.  The sentiment index fell to minus 25 in September from
minus 24.7 in August, the lowest since January, the GKI research
institute in Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. Retail
sales slid 2.6 percent in July from a year ago, the statistics
office in Budapest said in a report today. The Magyar Nemzeti
Bank, which last month reduced its  base rate  by 25 basis points
to 6.75 percent, will cut by the same amount tomorrow, according
to 14 of 26 analysts polled by Bloomberg, with 12 expecting no
change.  “The motives for easing remain in place and so see the
balance of risks as just favoring another cut,” Christian Lawrence, a London-based strategist at Rabobank International,
wrote in a research report today, citing Hungary’s “weak”
economic data.  European stocks dropped as Germany and  France  struggled to
overcome a stalemate on the timing for banking union and as data
added to concern about the strength of  China’s economy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
