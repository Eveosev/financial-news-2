U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  said that euro-area leaders’ job is “far from done” and
that the region’s banks need to share liabilities to find a
solution to the debt crisis.  “No one should fall into a false sense of complacency that
the job is done,” Clegg said in a Bloomberg Television
interview at his Liberal Democrat party’s annual conference in
Brighton, southern  England , last night. “What we’ve got to stop
is this pendulum swing of bank crisis to sovereign debt crisis
and back again. You need some kind of mutualization of bank
liabilities, and that’s particularly important for the southern
countries.”  A deepening crisis in the euro region is threatening global
growth and has helped plunge  Britain’s economy  into its first
double-dip recession since the 1970s.  While bond purchases by the  European Central Bank  have
calmed markets, the 17 nations that share the single currency
still need to make “painful” decisions to balance risks
between cash-strapped southern nations and their northern
partners, Clegg said.  The euro region needs “a new north-south deal, where the
south accepts a degree of fiscal discipline from the north, and
the north in effect accepts that the shares some of the
liabilities of the south,” Clegg said. “That’s a very painful
thing to accept politically.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
