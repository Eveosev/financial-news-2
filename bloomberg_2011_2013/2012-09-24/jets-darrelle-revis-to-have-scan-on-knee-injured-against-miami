New York Jets All-Pro cornerback
 Darrelle Revis  will have a scan on his left knee today after
suffering a non-contact injury that could leave the National
Football League team without its best defensive player.  Revis appeared to be hurt when he tried to change direction
and make a tackle with 3:54 left in the third quarter of
yesterday’s 23-20 overtime win against the  Miami Dolphins . After
immediately grabbing his knee, Revis was examined on the
sideline and then taken to the locker room on a cart.  “Clearly with Darrelle, your best player, of course you’re
going to be concerned,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said in his post-
game news conference. “I don’t know anything about it right
now. We’ll find out with the MRI.”  Revis was back in the Jets’ lineup yesterday after sitting
out a week because of a concussion.  The Jets’ defense, which relies on Revis’s one-on-one
coverage skills against opponents’ top receivers, could move
former first-round draft pick Kyle Wilson into the starting
lineup if Revis is out for an extended time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
