The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission approved regulations that will prevent banks from
keeping secret the yields on certain state and local government
bonds during the first trading day.  The SEC on Sept. 21 approved rules that require
underwriters to disclose yields on bonds that arenâ€™t immediately
offered for resale to investors, the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board said today. The board proposed the change in
March, which will require more rapid dissemination of
information that previously may not have been available to the
public until the end of the trading day.  The rules are aimed at injecting more transparency into the
$3.7 trillion municipal  bond market , which is used by states,
cities and school districts to finance public projects.  The change will make it easier for public officials and
investors to compare yields on newly issued bonds during the
first trading day. It takes effect on Nov. 1.  The SEC approves and enforces rules proposed by the
Alexandria, Virginia-based Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board, which crafts regulations for the public finance industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
