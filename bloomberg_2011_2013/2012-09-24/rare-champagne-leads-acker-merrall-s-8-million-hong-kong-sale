Acker Merrall & Condit said it sold
HK$61.8 million ($7.97 million) of wine at its two-day auction
ending Sept. 22, with 98 percent of lots finding buyers.  About 36 percent of lots sold above their high estimates,
showing demand has remained resilient despite uncertainty in the
global economy.  “We nearly had all lots sold,” Acker Chief Executive
Officer  John Kapon  said after the sale. “Things certainly felt
pretty good.”  The auction was boosted by almost HK$8 million worth of
champagne sold, including a rare bottle of 1966 Blanc de Blanc
and a bottle of 1947 Krug Collection, both of which went for
HK$108,240, fetching the highest price per bottle at the sale,
according to a company release.  Hong Kong continues to dominate the wine auction market
with newly minted Chinese millionaires helping drive sales. On
Sept. 10 Acker sold $3.2 million of wine in a one-day  New York 
sale.  The next major Hong Kong wine sale will be held by
 Sotheby’s (BID)  on Oct. 5 and 6 at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Centre.  (Frederik Balfour is a reporter-at-large for Muse, the arts
