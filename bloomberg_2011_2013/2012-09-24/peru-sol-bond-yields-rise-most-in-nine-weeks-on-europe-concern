Peruvian bonds fell, pushing up
yields the most in nine weeks, as concern Europe’s debt crisis
will damp global growth curbed demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.23 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the steepest rise since July 24. The price
declined 0.31 centimo to 123.80 centimos per sol.  Emerging-market debt yields rose and most currencies from
developing nations fell against the dollar after German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Francois Hollande 
clashed over the weekend on a timetable for starting joint
oversight of banks in the European Union. Data from China and
 Germany  signaled the global economic slump is deepening.  “What’s happening in Europe could put more pressure on
Peruvian bonds,” said Hedmond Rios, an economist at Celfin
Capital in Santiago. “It could be a transitory pause. A lot
more liquidity is expected to enter the market” because of the
bond-buying plan unveiled by the  European Central Bank  this
month, Rios said.  The sol was little changed at 2.5980 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peru’s central bank bought $100 million in the spot
currency market today to stem gains in the sol. The bank said on
its website it paid an average 2.5967 soles per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
