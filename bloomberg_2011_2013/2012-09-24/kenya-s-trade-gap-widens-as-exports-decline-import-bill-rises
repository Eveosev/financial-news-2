The trade deficit in  Kenya ,  East
Africa ’s largest economy, widened in July as imports surged and
shipments of tea, the country’s biggest export, declined.  The  gap  grew to 80.5 billion shillings ($948.2 million)
from 58.2 billion shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based
Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in a report on its
website, the capital. Exports declined 4 percent to 42.9 billion
shillings, while imports jumped 20 percent to 123.4 billion
shillings.  Frost and poor weather has hit tea-producing areas in
Kenya, which is the world’s largest exporter of the black
variety of the leaves, causing output to drop 11 percent to
182,480 metric tons in the seven months through July.  The volume of tea exports fell to 28,054 tons in July from
33,629 tons, earning 7.8 billion shillings, compared with 9.3
million shillings previously. Coffee shipments doubled to 5,727
tons, while horticulture sales including fresh-cut flowers such
as roses increased by 21 percent to 18,655 tons, the agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
