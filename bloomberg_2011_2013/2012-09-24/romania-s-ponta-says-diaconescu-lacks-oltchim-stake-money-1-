Romanian media entrepreneur Dan Diaconescu lacks the money to buy a majority stake in  Oltchim
SA (OLT) , Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta said, three days after
winning an auction for the Romanian chemical company.  Diaconescu, 44, a politician and owner of broadcaster OTV,
doesn’t have the 45 million euros ($58 million) he pledged for
the 54.8 percent Oltchim stake or the 100 million euros to buy
the Arpechim refinery, Ponta told reporters in Bucharest today.
The Cabinet will now present a plan to manage the company for
the next six months, he said.  The government is struggling to keep its pledge to sell its
holding in Oltchim and a minority stake in  Transgaz SA (TGN) , the
country’s natural-gas grid operator, by the end of this month.
The sales would help unlock the next tranche of a precautionary
accord with the  International Monetary Fund .  “We committed to have a privatization in September, but
the fact that it failed is not our fault,” he said.  Diaconescu said earlier today at the Economy Ministry that
he didn’t sign a purchase contract for Oltchim because the
document “was incomplete and lacks certain clauses and
addenda.” Under Romanian regulations, a contract must be signed
within 10 days from the time of the auction.  “The privatization will fail in case Mr. Diaconescu
doesn’t pay the amount in 10 days,” Economy Minister Daniel Chitoiu said.  Oltchim’s buyer will also have the option to purchase  OMV
Petrom SA (SNP) ’s Arpechim refinery after negotiating terms with
Romania’s biggest oil company, according to a share sale
announcement.  OMV AG (OMV) , Petrom’s majority owner, signed an accord
to sell the Arpechim refinery to Oltchim’s buyer, Prime Minister
Victor Ponta said on Sept. 18.
