(Corrects spelling of Matthieu in headline.)  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the largest
independent merger adviser, established an Africa business to
expand its financial-advisory services to the region.  The unit, which will advise African companies and sovereign
entities, will be based in Paris and led by Matthieu Pigasse,
Hamilton, Bermuda-based Lazard said today in a statement.
Michele Lamarche will oversee government advisory, and Julien
Riant will head mergers and acquisitions, according to the
statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth Jacobs  said in July that
clients are showing increased interest in regions including
Africa and Latin America. The firm’s sovereign-advisory business
has typically focused on developing markets such as Africa and
Asia, he said.  “This initiative complements the worldwide organization of
Lazard that has recently expanded its presence in China and
Brazil, both of which are strategically focused on Africa,”
Lazard said today in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
