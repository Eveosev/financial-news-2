Crude oil options volatility rose
as futures slid a fifth time in sixth days as concern mounted
that  Europe  wonâ€™t be able to contain its debt crisis.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 30.43 percent as of 4:15 p.m. in  New York ,
up from 29.31 on Sept. 21.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 96 cents to settle at
$91.93 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
November $110 calls, which fell 1 cents to 12 cents a barrel at
4:17 p.m. with 2,584 lots trading. November $80 puts were the
second-most active, with 1,146 lots changing hands as they rose
5 cents to 24 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would rise accounted for 63 percent of the
31,407 contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of crude oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish beats made up 58 percent
of the 97,867 contracts traded.  November $110 calls were the most actively traded options
with 4,560 lots changing hands. They fell 2 cents to 13 cents a
