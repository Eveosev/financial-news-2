Anadolu Efes Biracilik & Malt
Sanayii AS (AEFES) , Turkey’s biggest brewer, carmakers  Tofas Turk
Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO) ,  Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO)  and distributor
 Dogus Otomotiv Servis & Ticaret AS (DOAS)  fell after the government
increased taxes on alcoholic beverages and cars.  Anadolu Efes dropped 3 percent to 25.8 liras at 4:40 p.m.
in Istanbul, the biggest loss since Sept. 3. Tofas,  Fiat SpA (F) ’s
joint-venture with  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , slumped 4.9 percent to 8.92
liras, sliding the most since May 24.  Turkey’s Finance Ministry raised special consumption taxes
on beer by 0.09 liras a liter and on cars with engines smaller
than 1,600 cubic centimeters to 40 percent from 37 percent,
according to a decision published in the Official Gazette in
Ankara on Sept. 22. Taxes on gasoline, diesel, liquid petroleum
gas used in cars, lubricants, solvents and charges on real
estate transactions were also increased.  “We calculate that Efes should increase beer shelf price
by around 8 percent to cover this tax hike,” Oyak Securities
said in an e-mailed report in Istanbul today. “Higher prices
take toll on consumption, which have reflected as flat beer
volumes in Turkey in the last four years.”  Anadolu Efes raised beer prices by about 14 percent in late
2011 and 3 percent in April due to previous tax increases, Oyak
said.  Ford Otosan,  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s partnership with Koc, slid
2.9 percent to 18.2 liras, its steepest decline since May 31.
Dogus Oto, the distributor of  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  cars in Turkey,
retreated 2.7 percent to 6.4 liras, slipping the most since July
24.  “About 90 percent of passenger cars sold in the domestic
market have engine sizes lower than 1.6 liters,” Erkan Savran,
head of research at Istanbul-based Ak Invest, said in an e-
mailed report today. “Industry officials anticipate the tax
rise might result in a volume loss” of 40,000 to 50,0000 cars
per annum in the domestic market, Savran said.  Car companies won’t let the higher tax reflect in their
price tags this year, “to not adversely affect the seasonally
high demand between September-December,” Savran said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
