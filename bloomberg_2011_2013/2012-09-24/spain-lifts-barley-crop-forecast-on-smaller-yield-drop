Spain  raised its estimate for
barley production this year as yields dropped less than expected
previously, and lifted the forecast for corn.  The barley harvest probably fell 27 percent to 6.04 million
metric tons from 8.33 million tons in 2011, based on the
situation at the end of July, the  Agriculture Ministry   reported 
on its website today. That’s better than a previous forecast for
a barley crop of 5.79 million tons.  Spain had its second-driest summer in 60 years, the
ministry’s weather service said in a separate report today. The
period from June through to August was the fourth-warmest since
1961, according to the report.  Corn production is forecast to climb 3.3 percent to 4.29
million tons, more than the 2.5 percent increase predicted in a
previous report.  Spain’s soft-wheat harvest is estimated at 4.64 million
tons, falling 22 percent from last year, while durum wheat
production plunged an estimated 50 percent to 472,800 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
