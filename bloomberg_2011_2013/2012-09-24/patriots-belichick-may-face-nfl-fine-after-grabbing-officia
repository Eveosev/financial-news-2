The  National Football League  will
review the case of New England Patriots coach  Bill Belichick 
grabbing an official by the arm following his team’s 31-30 loss
to the Baltimore Ravens.  NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  said in an e-mail that the league
will examine the incident, which occurred as officials were
running off the field after the Ravens won on Justin Tucker’s
27-yard field goal as time expired. The kick appeared to go
directly over one of the uprights.  Belichick shouted at the officials and grabbed one by the
arm, then declined to talk about the confrontation with
reporters. The league’s replacement officials called 24
penalties in the contest, for a combined 218 yards.  The NFL has used replacements for the first three weeks of
the season after locking out its regular officials when their
labor agreement expired, with the substitutes criticized by
players and coaches for missed calls and a lack of knowledge on
the rules. The league warned teams last week to stop confronting
officials.  The NFL and the NFL Referees Association are at odds over
pay, pensions and operational issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
