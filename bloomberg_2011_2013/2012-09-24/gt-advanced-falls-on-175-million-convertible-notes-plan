GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (GTAT) , a
U.S. supplier to solar manufacturers and energy-efficient
lighting companies, fell the most in four months after
announcing a plan to issue as much as $175 million in
convertible notes.  GT Advanced, based in Merrimack,  New Hampshire , fell 8.6
percent to $5.93 at the close in New York, the most since May
17. The shares have declined 18 percent this year. The company
makes systems that produce polysilicon for photovoltaic cells as
well as tools to grow sapphires.  The notes will mature on Oct. 1, 2017, and underwriters
have the option to purchase as much as an additional $26.3
million, GT said today in a statement. The funds will be used
for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and
refinancing debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
