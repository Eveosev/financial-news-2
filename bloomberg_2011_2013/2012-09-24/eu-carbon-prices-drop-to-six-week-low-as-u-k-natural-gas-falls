European Union carbon-dioxide
permits dropped to a more than six-week low as  oil prices  and
U.K. natural gas declined, curbing demand for pollution rights.  EU permits for delivery in December fell 2.6 percent to
7.27 euros a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.
That’s the lowest closing price since Aug. 10.  U.K. natural gas for next month dropped 2.1 percent to
58.85 pence a therm. Carbon permits in the world’s biggest cap-
and-trade program sometimes track gas because power utilities
burning the fuel need half the permits compared with when they
use more-polluting coal.  Brent crude  for November delivery lost 1.9 percent to
$109.32 a barrel on discord over Europe’s debt crisis and
weaker-than-expected German business sentiment. Oil can affect
carbon prices because it’s linked to economic output and to
cleaner-burning natural gas costs in Europe.  The EU has yet to decide what procedural steps to take next
in talks about a draft change to the bloc’s carbon law that
would enable curbing the oversupply of permits after some
governments voiced uncertainty about the plan, an EU presidency
official said today.  A number of nations expressed reservations about the
proposed law change during initial discussions in the past two
weeks, according to the official, who declined to be identified,
citing department policy. Those  member states  are still
scrutinizing the proposal, the official said.  United Nations credits for December rose 4.8 percent to
1.97 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
