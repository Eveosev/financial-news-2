Gasoline fell on concern that
Europe’s debt crisis will weaken the global economy and fuel
demand and as German business confidence slid.  Futures declined as European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  warned today against “a tendency of losing the sense of
urgency.” German business confidence sank in September, the Ifo
institute in Munich said.  “There’s more bearish economic news and discord among
European leaders about integration of the banking system and
Spanish needs for a bailout,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for October delivery fell 1.19 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.9306 a gallon at 9:43 a.m. on New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices sank 2.4 percent last week.  The Ifo institute said its  business climate index  for
Europe’s biggest economy, based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
dropped for a fifth straight month to 101.4 from 102.3 in
August. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and President  Francois
Hollande  disagreed on a timetable for starting joint oversight
of Europe’s banking sector.  The euro slid 0.5 percent against the dollar at 9:42 a.m.
in New York. A stronger dollar reduces the investment appeal of
commodities. In the U.S., the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
retreated 0.4 percent.  “The economic uncertainty that seems to be our strongest
driver appears to be rising again and now the dollar is up
pretty strongly and equities are down,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Regular gasoline at the pump slipped for a 10th consecutive
day, dropping 0.6 cent to $3.808 a gallon yesterday, AAA  data 
show. Prices reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  October-delivery heating oil declined 1.66 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.1041 a gallon on the exchange, the first loss in
three days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
