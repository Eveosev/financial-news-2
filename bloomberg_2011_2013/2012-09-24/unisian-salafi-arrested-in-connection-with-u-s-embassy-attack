Tunisian authorities arrested a
Salafi member of an al-Qaeda-linked group, citing his possible
links to attacks on the U.S. Embassy and an American school
earlier this month.  Hassan Brik, who is believed to be the second-in-command of
the Ansar al-Shariah group, was arrested as he left a mosque in
Tunis, the capital, Interior Ministry spokesman Khaled Tarouch
said in a phone interview today. He said Brik was arrested on
“suspicion” of involvement in the attacks, declining to
elaborate.  Ansar al-Sharia is headed by Abu Ayyad, who is wanted for
the attacks that were largely sparked by an anti-Islam film made
in the U.S. He managed to escape twice from police earlier this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
