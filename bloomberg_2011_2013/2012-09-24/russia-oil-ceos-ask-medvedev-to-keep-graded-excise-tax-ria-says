Executives at four Russian  oil
companies  asked Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  to maintain
differentiated excise taxes for various qualities of motor fuel,
RIA Novosti said today, citing a letter from the executives.  Proposed increases in the excise tax on gasoline and diesel
that contain less sulfur may hurt revenue, increase prices at
refineries and lead to cuts in investment plans, the state-run
Russian news service said, citing the letter signed by OAO
Lukoil Chief Executive Officer  Vagit Alekperov , TNK-BP Executive
Director  German Khan , OAO Gazprom Neft CEO Alexander Dyukov and
OAO Bashneft CEO Alexander Korsik.  The executives were responding to a proposal from Finance
Minister Anton Siluanov to increase excise taxes on fuels with a
lower environmental impact in 2013, RIA Novosti said.  Excise duties for domestic sales of high-quality gasoline
and diesel were lowered in July as an incentive for refiners to
manufacture cleaner oil products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
