Russia ’s  Interior Ministry  started
a criminal inquiry into Uzbek competitors of OAO Mobile
TeleSystems, Russia’s biggest mobile phone company, after
Uzbekistan seized MTS’s local assets,  Kommersant  reported.  MTS submitted a request for an inquiry to the ministry, to
Russia’s general prosecutor’s office and to the Federal
Antimonopoly Service, the newspaper said, adding that Uzbekistan
will have to respond to the results of the investigation.  MTS’s Uzbek unit, Uzdunrobita, had its license withdrawn by
authorities last month and faces $1.2 billion of tax, licensing
and antitrust claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
