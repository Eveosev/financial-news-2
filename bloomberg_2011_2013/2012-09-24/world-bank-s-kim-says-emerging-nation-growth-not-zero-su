World Bank  President Jim Yong Kim
said global economic growth isn’t a “zero-sum game” pitting
nations against each other and the world has a “huge stake” in
ensuring that developing countries succeed.  “Having fragile states, having conflict-affected states,
this is not good for the entire world economy,” Kim said in an
interview airing this afternoon on Bloomberg Television’s
“Street Smart” with Trish Regan. Developing economies “have
been the drivers of growth that we have seen in the last five or
six years.”  Kim, 52, the former president of Dartmouth College,
succeeded  Robert Zoellick  as chief of the Washington-based
development bank in July. He leads a poverty-fighting
institution that distributed about $53 billion worth of loans
last year.  “We should never, ever call any country a basket case,”
Kim said. “The possibilities for growth and development in
every country in the world I think are there.”  On Europe, Kim said “the world needs the Eurozone
countries to find a path toward solidarity.”  The World Bank was created at the end of World War II to
help rebuild ravaged Europe. Now focused on developing
countries, it targets lending for projects from road-building to
education programs. The bank has also expanded its scope to
include taking stakes in companies and guaranteeing investments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
