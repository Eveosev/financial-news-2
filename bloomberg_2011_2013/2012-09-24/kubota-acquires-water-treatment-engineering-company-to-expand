Kubota Corp. (6326) , the Japanese tractor
maker whose products range from excavators to water pumps, said
today that it agreed to acquire a water treatment engineering
company to expand in Asia.  Kubota said it entered into an agreement with  Toda Kogyo
Corp. (4100)  and Fujikasui Engineering Co. of Tokyo to purchase all the
shares of a new company in which Fujikasui will transfer its
ongoing business except for those related to  China .  The Osaka-based company, which specializes in tractors and
farm equipment for wet paddy fields, gave no terms for the deal,
which it said helps expand its industrial water treatment
business.  Kubota has been developing a platform for its water
treatment operations in  Asia  and contribute to developing a
sustainable recycling society, according to the statement.
Fujikasui has long been involved in environmental engineering,
including industrial wastewater treatment, in Asia, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
