Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH
and I2BF Global Ventures invested in Utilight Ltd., an Israeli
producer of technology to cut the cost of making solar cells.  Waarde Capital BV, based in the Netherlands, also added to
the $4.5 million financing, New York-based clean technology
investor I2BF said today in an e-mailed statement.  Utilight, founded in 2009, is developing a cheaper way to
apply a conducting metal layer to photovoltaic cells. Producers
are trying to reduce costs after a price war between Chinese
companies and European rivals cut panel prices in half in 2011.
Bosch, a unit of the biggest car-parts supplier, has solar
assets since buying Ersol Solarstrom GmbH & Co. KG in 2008.  “Utilight’s innovation comes at a crucial time for the
industry,” Alexey Belyakov, partner and head of research at
I2BF, said in the statement. “It brings solar PV cell
manufacturers exactly what they need -- manufacturing efficiency
and higher performance of their products.”  Utilight’s method of wafer-metallization, known as pattern
transfer printing, avoids excessive use of materials including
silver paste and allows cells to generate more power, I2BF said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
