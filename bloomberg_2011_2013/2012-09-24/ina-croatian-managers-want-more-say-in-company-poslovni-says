The three Croatian management board
members of  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , the Croatian unit of
 Hungary ’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , requested a board meeting tomorrow to
discuss access to information,  Poslovni Dnevnik  said.  Niko Galic, Ivan Kresic and Davor Mayer asked that the
management board meet weekly and that business information be
shared among all board members, Poslovni reported, citing
supervisory board member Davor Stern.  Mol holds 49.1 percent of the Zagreb-based company, while
the government owns 44.84 percent. In the six-member management
board, Zoltan Aldott, the president, has a swaying vote.
Croatian Finance Minister Slavko Linic on Aug. 3 said Mol
stopped investing in the company and called the Hungarian
company “an irresponsible partner.”  Should there be no resolution at tomorrow’s meeting, the
shareholders will have to weigh in, Stern said, according to
Poslovni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
