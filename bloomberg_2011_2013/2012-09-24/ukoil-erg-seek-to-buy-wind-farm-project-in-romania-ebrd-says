LUKErg Renew, a joint venture of
Russia’s  OAO Lukoil (LKOH)  and Italy’s  ERG SpA (ERG) , may buy an 84-megawatt
wind farm project in  Romania , the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development  said on its website .  The project is located in the southeastern county of Tulcea
and the purchase will likely be completed by October, according
to the London-based bank. The EBRD may help finance the project
through a loan to LUKErg, it said.  The cost of the project is about 130 million euros ($168
million),  Ziarul Financial  reported today, citing its own
calculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
