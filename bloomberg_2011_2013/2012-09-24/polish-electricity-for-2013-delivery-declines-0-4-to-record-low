Polish baseload 2013 power, for
supplies delivered around the clock, fell to a record, tracking
a similar price decline in  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest market.  Power for 2013 delivery lost as much as 0.4 percent to
188.40 zloty ($58.68) a megawatt-hour, the lowest level since
Bloomberg started tracking the data in January 2011, and traded
at 188.50 zloty at 4:45 p.m. Warsaw time. German power for 2013
fell as much as 0.9 percent to 47.40 euros ($61.20), its lowest
price since the contract started trading in 2008.  Poland was a net exporter of power in the first eight
months of the year, thanks to flows to Germany, the Czech
Republic and Slovakia. The country was set to import no
electricity from Sweden and Ukraine tomorrow, data from the grid
manager PSE Operator SA showed. That compares with imports of as
much as 780 megawatts on Sept. 21.  Power for tomorrow  increased 6.3 percent to 191.01 zloty a
megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg
as cross-border inflows were set to stop. Next-day contracts on
the Czech and Slovak markets settled 15 percent lower from a
week ago at 45.31 euros a megawatt-hour in a daily auction,
according to the countries’ market operators. Electricity for
the next day in  Hungary  jumped 38 percent to 62.44 euros a
megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
