Kenya ’s shilling headed for a
three-month low against the dollar on demand for the U.S.
currency from  oil companies  settling month-end obligations.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy declined 0.1
percent to 84.97 a dollar by 12:02 p.m. in Nairobi, heading for
its weakest level on a closing basis since June 13, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost all of the oil and gas
products consumed in Kenya are imported.  “We are seeing dollar demand from the energy sector,
mainly from oil marketers as we reach the end of the month,”
Francis Macharia, a currency dealer with Equity Bank Ltd. based
in Nairobi, said by phone.  Uganda ’s shilling fell 0.1 percent to 2,522.50 a dollar,
heading for its lowest level on a closing basis in a month. The
Tanzanian currency traded unchanged for a second consecutive
session at 1,577 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
