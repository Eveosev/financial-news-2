Gulf agricultural products traders
will ask  Saudi Arabia  to lift an export ban on fruit and
vegetables grown in open fields,  al-Watan  reported, citing
Abdulhakeem al-Shammari, a member of the Bahraini Chamber of
Commerce.  Saudi Arabia, which faces depletion of underground water
resources, halted on Sept. 17 the export of produce grown in
open fields as the government seeks to conserve water, the Saudi
Press Agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
