Axa SA, France’s largest insurer,
had its outlook lowered by  Fitch Ratings  to negative as bond
yields near record lows pressure profits.  The outlook for the Paris-based company was cut from stable
on “concerns about the group’s ability to improve
profitability, notably in the context of low interest rates,”
the ratings firm said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
