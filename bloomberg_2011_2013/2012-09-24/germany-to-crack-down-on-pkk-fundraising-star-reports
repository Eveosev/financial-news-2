Germany will sign an agreement with
 Turkey  pledging to crack down on fundraising by Kurdish
militants in Germany,  Star said .  The two countries will sign a deal by the end of this year
to cooperate against  money laundering  and financing terrorism,
in a move aimed at the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said.  The PKK is believed to be raising around 200 million euros
($259 million), Star said, citing Turkish intelligence reports.
Turkey has long accused Germany of turning a blind eye to
activities of the militants, who are fighting for autonomy in
Turkey’s southeast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
