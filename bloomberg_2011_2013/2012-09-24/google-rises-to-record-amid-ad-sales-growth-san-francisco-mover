Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
largest search engine, rose to a record amid optimism about its
growth prospects from online advertising revenue.  The shares  increased  2.1 percent to $749.38 at the close in
New York, the highest since its initial public offering in
August 2004. Google has advanced 16 percent this year.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, is benefiting
from rising demand for its advertising products, including
search, display and mobile. The company is expected to become
the leader in the U.S. for display advertising this year,
including banner ads, replacing  Facebook Inc. (FB) , according to
EMarketer Inc.  Google’s U.S.-display ad revenue will jump 39 percent to
$2.31 billion this year, New York-based EMarketer estimates.  “The stock has performed very well in recent months,
suggesting that the market is coming around to seeing how
durable the company’s cash flow generation will be,”  Brian Wieser , an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, wrote in a
research note today. “That secular expansion appears likely to
overcome any macro-economic headwinds may also be a contribution
factor to investors’ positive views towards Google.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
