Germany’s Bundesbank said the
 International Monetary Fund  has weakened its standards for loans
and taken on more risk since the start of the financial crisis.  “Since the beginning of the global financial crisis in
2008 and the  European debt crisis  in 2010, the IMF has been more
active than ever before,” the Bundesbank said in its monthly
report published today in Frankfurt. “Risks associated with
financial aid by the IMF have substantially increased.”  The Bundesbank said 20 percent of current IMF loans are for
one country, while five countries account for 74 percent of
outstanding loans. A worsening risk profile may eventually draw
into question the treatment of countries’ contributions to the
IMF as currency reserves, it said.  “Given the tendency toward ever larger engagements and a
higher regional concentration as well as the more frequent use
of long-term IMF programs, the concentration risks have risen
noticeably in the recent past,” the Bundesbank said. “Should
the IMF’s policy lead to higher risks, the financial
contributions by its member countries would no longer be
considered highly liquid and risk free. This would jeopardize
their character as currency reserves.”  The IMF and the  World Bank  will hold their annual meetings
in  Tokyo  Oct. 9-14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
