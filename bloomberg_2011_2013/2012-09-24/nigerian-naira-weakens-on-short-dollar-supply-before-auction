Nigeria ’s naira depreciated on
short dollar supply before a currency auction today after the
central bank sold the lowest amount of the U.S. currency last
week in four.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.1
percent to 157.78 per dollar on the interbank market as of 12:15
p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold a total of  $309.42 million 
at its two regular foreign-currency auctions last week, the
lowest amount since it held a single sale in the week ended Aug.
24. The regulator, which sells foreign exchange to lenders at an
auction and directly through the  interbank market  to stabilise
the naira will sell the U.S. currency at an auction today. The
Abuja-based bank aims to keep the naira within a 3 percent band
around 155 per dollar.  “Dollar supply is below what the market needs but that is
expected to rise with the auction, given the central bank’s aim
to stabilise the currency,” Sewa Wusu, a currency analyst at
Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a telephone interview
today.  The central bank kept its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged
at a record 12 percent on Sept. 18 to control inflation and
bolster the naira, Governor Lamido Sanusi said. The  inflation 
rate slowed to 11.7 percent in August from 12.8 percent the
previous month, the lowest this year, the statistics agency said
Sept. 16.  The yield on Nigeria’s 16 percent domestic bonds due June
2019 rose 2 basis points to 12.98 percent, according to Sept. 21
data on the  Financial Markets Dealers Association  website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 rose two basis points to 4.799 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.92 a dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
