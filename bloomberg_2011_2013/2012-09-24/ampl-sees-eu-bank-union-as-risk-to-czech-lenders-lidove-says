A European banking union would be a
risk for the Czech financial industry as it might result in an
uncontrollable outflow of liquidity from the country, according
to Mojmir Hampl, the central bank vice governor,   Lidove Noviny 
reported.  Many countries outside the euro area are against proposals
to assess banks from a pan-European perspective, which would
limit domestic regulatory powers over financial institutions,
the newspaper cited Hampl as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
