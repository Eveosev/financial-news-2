Arsenal Capital has agreed to
acquire Dutch specialty chemical-intermediates maker IGM Resins,
which is forecast to generate about 100 million euros ($129
million) in sales this year.  IGM, based in Waalwijk, the Netherlands, manufactures
monomers, oligomers and additives for the global ultraviolet
inks and coatings industries from sites in  Europe , the U.S.,
 South America  and  China , the New York-based private equity firm
said in a release. Bloomberg earlier reported the purchase.  The Dutch company, founded in 1999, built its business with
the acquisition of an ultraviolet acrylates business from
Cognis, a German cosmetics ingredient maker now owned by  BASF
SE. (BAS)  Arsenal is backing IGM’s strategy to pursue further
“identified” opportunities in the high-growth UV radiation
cure market, Arsenal said in a release.  “The acquisition of IGM Resins further builds on Arsenal’s
broad portfolio and established expertise in the specialty
chemicals and materials sectors,” said John Televantos, a
partner at Arsenal who co-heads the firm’s
Specialty Industrials practice.  Valence Group acted as a financial adviser to IGM. Terms of
the deal weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
