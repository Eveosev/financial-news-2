Vietnam’s bonds fell, driving the
five-year yield to the highest level in more than two months, as
a government report showed inflation quickened for the first
time in more than a year.  Consumer prices  climbed 6.48 percent in September from a
year earlier, after rising 5.04 percent in August, the General
Statistics Office said in Hanoi today. The median estimate of
six economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 5.15 percent
increase. Prices gained 2.2 percent from last month, the most
since May 2011. Faster inflation erodes returns from fixed-
income securities.  The yield on the five-year notes climbed five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.03 percent, the highest level
since July 19, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The three-year yield rose six basis points to 9.79
percent.  “Increases in the inflation rate prompted investors to
seek higher bond yields and will probably keep yields in an
uptrend for a while,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based bond
trader at Bank for Investment & Development of  Vietnam . “There
isn’t much trading in the market these days though.”  The dong traded at 20,868 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in
Hanoi, from 20,870 at the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the daily reference
rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
