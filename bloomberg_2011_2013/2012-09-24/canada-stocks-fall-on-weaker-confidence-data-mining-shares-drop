Canadian  stocks  fell for a third
day as commodities slumped after data showed business confidence
slipping in Germany and China.  Alacer Gold Corp. (ASR)  and  Novagold Resources Inc. (NG)  retreated at
least 2.9 percent.  Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. (FVI)  plunged 5.4
percent.  Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. (AAV)  fell 2.6 percent as crude fell
for the fifth time in six days.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  dropped 33.66
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,349.94 at 9:47 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge is up 3.3 percent this year.  German business confidence unexpectedly fell to the lowest
in more than two and a half years in September as the sovereign
debt crisis clouded the economic outlook. China’s  manufacturers 
and retailers are less optimistic about sales than they were
three months ago and more companies are cutting jobs, according
to the  China  Beige Book, a survey modeled on the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s Beige Book.  To contact the reporter on this story:
