Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc. (QCOR)  fell
37 percent after disclosing the company’s marketing practices
are being investigated by the U.S. government.  Questcor dropped to $19.08 at 4 p.m. New York time, its
lowest closing value since April 2011. The shares of the
Anaheim, California-based company have declined 54 percent so
far this year.  Questcor plunged the most in 20 years last week after
insurer Aetna Inc. said it would limit coverage of Questcor’s
top-selling drug, H.P. Acthar, a treatment for multiple
sclerosis and infant seizures. The drug accounts for most of
Questcor’s sales. Marko Kozul, an analyst at Leerink Swann in
 San Francisco , downgraded the stock to market perform today.  “Due to a multitude of factors, we believe Acthar may
increasingly show up on insurers’ radars and undergo
reimbursement reviews,” Kozul wrote in a note to investors.  In today’s filing, Questcor said it intends to cooperate
with the investigation and that the company doesn’t plan further
comment except for regulatory-compliant disclosures.  The company was also cut to hold at ThinkEquity LLC by
James Molloy, an analyst. His 12-month target price is $26 a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
