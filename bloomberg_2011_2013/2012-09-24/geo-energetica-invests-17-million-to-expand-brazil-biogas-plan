Geo Energetica SA , a Brazilian
developer of biogas power plants, will invest 35 million reais
($17.3 million) to quadruple the capacity of a project at a
sugar-cane mill in the southern state of Parana.  The plant will have 16 megawatts of capacity and produce
12,000 cubic meters of biomethane a day once the expansion is
complete in 2014, Alessandro Gardemann, director for Londrina,
Brazil-based Geo Energetica, said today in a telephone
interview. It runs on vinasse and other byproducts of cane
processing from the Cooperativa Agricola Regional de Produtores
de Cana mill.  GEO Energetica expects to sign its second contract next
month to build a similar plant at a mill in Brazilsâ€™s center
west region, and to complete another deal by year-end, worth a
combined total 200 million reais, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
