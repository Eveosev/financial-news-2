Cairn U.K. Holdings is selling a
$940 million stake in  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , according to terms of
the sale obtained by Bloomberg.  Citigroup Inc. is offering 153 million  Cairn India  shares,
representing about 8 percent of the company, to investors at a
range of 317.90 rupees to 328.30 rupees apiece, the terms
showed. Cairn India shares closed at 345.55 rupees today.  Cairn has pledged to sell down its remaining stake in Cairn
India to free up cash for new projects after spending $1 billion
on a two-year exploration campaign in Greenland that failed to
find oil and gas. The company still owns about 18 percent of
Cairn India after selling a 40 percent stake last year to
 Vedanta Resources Plc. (VED)   Cairn, based in Edinburgh, gained 0.4 percent in  London  to
285 pence. The company bought North Sea explorers Agora Oil &
Gas AS and Nautical Petroleum Plc this year. Last month it said
it will buy exploration acreage in Morocco.  “Cairn has bought into a strong development program in the
North Sea that will require a substantial amount of capital
expenditure,” said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec
Securities Ltd. in London. “Cairn India is no longer strategic
and the shareholding is a source of funds for future
development.”  Cairn raised about $365 million from selling a stake in
Cairn India in June at 308.73 rupees a share. The shares fell
after the price was at the lower end of the target range.  To contact the reporters on this story:
