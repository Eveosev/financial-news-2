UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, cut Bulgaria’s growth forecast for this year on concern
the euro-area crisis reduced investment and demand for the
country’s exports in the European Union.  Bulgaria’s gross domestic product will probably expand 0.5
percent in 2012, down from a previous forecast of 1.5 percent on
Dec. 15, UniCredit said in an e-mailed statement today. The
economy will expand 1.5 percent next year, as the effect of
 Europe ’s debt crisis diminishes, the bank said.  Bulgaria ships 60 percent of its exports to the EU. The
bloc’s poorest country in terms of economic output per capita
withstood the global financial crisis without a bailout. Its
economic growth slowed to 0.5 percent from a year earlier in the
second quarter, same as in the first three months.  “Individual consumption will rise next year after the
government raises minimum wages and pensions,” UniCredit said
in the statement. “As the impact of the debt crisis fades away,
investor confidence will improve and there will be more
incentives to increase investment and growth.”  Bulgaria ’s economy grew 1.7 percent last year, after a
revised 0.4 percent in 2010. The European Commission forecasts
the economy to expand 0.5 percent this year and 1.9 percent in
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
