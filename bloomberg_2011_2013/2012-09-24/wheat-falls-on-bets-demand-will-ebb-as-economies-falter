Wheat futures fell for the second
time in three sessions on speculation that commodity demand will
ebb amid mounting concerns on the European and Chinese
economies.  Germany and France disagreed on a timetable for starting
joint oversight of  Europe ’s banking sector, signaling the
European fiscal crisis will persist.  Chinese companies  are less
optimistic about sales than they were three months ago and are
cutting jobs, according to a survey by CBB International LLC.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
dropped as much as 1.3 percent, and global equities dropped.  “When the outside markets are on the defensive the grains
are going to have a hard time improving,”  Jason Britt , the
president of Central States Commodities Inc., a brokerage in
 Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in a telephone interview. “The
funds are liquidating their positions.”  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to
$8.8825 a bushel at 10:24 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price slumped 2.9 percent last week, partly on speculation
that global demand will fall.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
