President  Eric Rosengren  said mid-size cities in the region will
be a key source of economic growth and deserve more attention
from policy makers.  Cities with populations between 75,000 and 200,000 should
get increased attention because they haven’t experienced “the
same degree of economic vibrancy” as the Boston area, Rosengren
said today in remarks prepared for delivery in Lawrence,
Massachusetts. Mid-size cities often serve as entry points for
immigrants and the average age of their population is younger
than other areas of  New England , he said.  “Their manufacturing base has shrunk, and many have yet to
replace lost jobs with new and innovative sectors,” Rosengren
said. “As more middle-class families have moved away, these
cities face greater challenges in helping their residents
acquire the skills and job market opportunities they need to
escape from poverty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
