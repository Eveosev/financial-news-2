Lithuania’s opposition Social
Democrat Party is leading opinion polls before an Oct. 14
parliamentary election, a Vilmorus poll for the  Lietuvos Rytas 
newspaper showed.  Support among decided voters for the  Social Democrats ,
which was ousted from power four years ago, surged to 23.4
percent, compared with 12.3 percent for Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’ Homeland Union, Lietuvos Rytas said, citing a Sept.
7-16 survey.  The  Labor party , which promises to cut unemployment to zero
in three years, was favored by 21.1 percent of decided voters,
while Order & Justice had 13.9 percent backing.  The Way of Courage party, formed six months ago, had 6.5
percent support, while the Liberal Movement, a partner in the
current ruling coalition, was the last party to receive backing
that would exceed the 5 percent threshold to enter parliament,
getting 5.3 percent, according to the survey.  Twenty-six percent said they were still undecided, while
another 11.6 percent said they don’t plan to vote. The poll of
1,004 eligible voters didn’t give a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
