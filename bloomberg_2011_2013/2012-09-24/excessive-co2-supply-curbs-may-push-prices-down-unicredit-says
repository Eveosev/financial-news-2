A decision by the European Union to
delay auctions of too many carbon permits under a plan to curb
oversupply could lead to a decline in emission prices when those
allowances return to the market, according to  UniCredit SpA. (UCG)   The EU is considering a proposal to postpone sales of an
as-yet unspecified number of carbon permits when the bloc moves
to auctioning a bigger share of allowances in the next phase of
its cap-and-trade system as of 2013. The supply of permits in
the current 2008-2012 trading period will exceed estimated
emissions by 1.6 billion metric tons, UniCredit said in a
research note.  While the delay in proposed auctions, also known as
backloading, can be a way of “buying time” it won’t create a
long-term shortage of permits in the EU emissions trading
system, UniCredit said.  “If the backloading volumes are too low or too high,
enormous downside price pressure will materialize,” according
to the note e-mailed today. “We consider a moderate backloading
volume to be the most effective measure to temporarily reduce
supply in the EU ETS.”  Should the EU decide to postpone 800 million permits at
auctions starting in March 2013, carbon permits would trade at 9
euros a ton on average in the first half of next year and 11
euros in the second half, according to the research note.  EU permits for delivery in December fell 2.6 percent to
7.27 euros a ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London 
today. That’s the lowest closing price since Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
