Hungarian  retail sales  dropped more
than economists forecast in July as food and tobacco purchases
slumped.  Retail sales fell 2.6 percent from a year ago, the second-
biggest drop this year, after a 1.7 percent decrease in June,
the  statistics office  in Budapest said today in an e-mailed
report. The median estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for a decline of 1.8 percent.  Sales of food, drinks and tobacco products plunged 2.4
percent in July from a year ago after rising 0.9 percent in
June. Sales of furniture and electronic goods slumped 8.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
