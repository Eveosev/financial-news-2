Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the world’s largest
agrochemical company, raised its 2020 target for sales by $3
billion as it accelerates the introduction of new technology and
benefits from a reorganization.  Revenue is forecast to reach $25 billion by the end of the
decade, up from a prior goal of $22 billion, Basel, Switzerland-
based Syngenta said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Mike Mack has reorganized Syngenta
along eight main types of crops, supplying products ranging from
the seeds to the herbicides and other agrochemicals needed. Last
week, it announced the 403 million-euro ($522 million) purchase
of Devgen to extend a move into seeds based on biotechnology.
Syngenta expects its rice and vegetables segment to report $5
billion in sales by 2020.  “Since we announced our new strategy in February 2011 we
have focused on the rapid integration of our commercial teams
and on broad-based innovation,” said Mack, who will present his
vision for the company at a meeting for investors in Pune,
 India , this week.  Syngenta climbed 0.9 percent to 347.10 Swiss francs in
Zurich trading as of 10:11 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
