Rising Mexican crude oil exports to
Asia are helping to boost demand for  oil tankers  because of the
distances involved in the deliveries, according to Poten &
Partners, a New York-based shipping consultant.  A measure of ship demand called ton-miles, multiplying
cargoes by voyage lengths, expanded 8 percent this year for
shipments from  Mexico , Poten said in a  report  sent by e-mail
Sept. 22. Demand for its crude from refineries in China, India
and Spain is adding to tanker use, Poten said. Mexico
normally sends more crude to U.S. refineries when its oil
production strengthens, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
