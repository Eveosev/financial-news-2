Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts
an 18.2 percent return from commodities in the next 12 months,
with energy and industrial metals leading the way.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index gain
will include 26.5 percent for energy, 10 percent for industrial
metals and 6 percent for precious metals,  Jeffrey Currie , an
analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a Sept. 21 report. In three
months, the gauge will be up 8.6 percent, beating equities, 10-
year government and five-year corporate bonds, cash and the euro
and yen against the dollar, according to the report.  “Apart from being attractive in its own right, we also
continue to see an overweight in commodities as a hedge against
the risk of the impact of sharply higher commodity prices on
economic growth and other asset classes, if oil supplies were to
disappoint against a backdrop of very limited spare capacity,”
Currie said.  The S&P GSCI Enhanced gauge advanced 19 percent since June
21 on speculation that  China  will act to bolster its economy
after the U.S.,  Japan  and the  European Central Bank  took steps
to boost growth. Copper prices will be higher in the first half
of 2013 on growth in China’s construction and the third round of
quantitative easing by the  Federal Reserve , Currie said.  Iran Sanction  Sanctions against  Iran  have limited oil supplies and global
economic growth is strong enough that overall output may stay
short of demand in the second half this year, according to
Goldman. Oil in  New York  climbed 14 percent in the past year.  The 18.2 percent return for the GSCI in 12 months would lag
behind a 32.8 percent jump forecast for the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Topix and 25.5 percent jump in Stoxx equity index, according to
the report. The S&P 500 Index of shares will be down 10.4
percent in three months and 5.4 percent lower in a year, Goldman
Sachs said.  In commodities, agriculture will be down 5 percent in 12
months and livestock up 4.5 percent, Goldman Sachs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
