Egypt â€™s Ministry of Water and
Sanitation may ask the government to permit an increase in water
prices and to boost its budget, the independent Al-Masry Al-Youm
reported today, quoting the minister.  State Minister Abdel-Qawi Khalifa said the ministry is
seeking a 9 billion-Egyptian pound ($1.48 billion) budget
increase, according to the newspaper.  Raising water prices is necessary to cope with a deficit
with which the state-run Holding Company for Potable Water and
Sanitation is grappling after it failed to secure 18 million
pounds a day in support pledged by the government, Khalifa was
cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
