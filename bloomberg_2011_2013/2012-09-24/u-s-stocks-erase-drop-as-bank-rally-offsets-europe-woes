U.S. stocks erased declines as a
rebound in financial shares overshadowed earlier concern over
European leaders’ efforts to stem the debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,460.39 at 2:52 p.m. in New York, after dropping as much as
0.6 percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained
18.64 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,598.11. Financial shares
rallied 0.4 percent as a group, reversing a drop of 0.4 percent.  Stocks fell earlier as European leaders clashed on ways to
stem the debt crisis and data from China and Germany signaled
the slowdown is deepening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
