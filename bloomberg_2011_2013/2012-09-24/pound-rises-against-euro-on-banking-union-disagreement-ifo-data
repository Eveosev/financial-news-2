The pound rose to a two-week high
against the euro as European leaders clashed on banking plans
and a report showed German business confidence declined,
boosting demand for the relative safety of the U.K. currency.  U.K. government bonds gained after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Francois Hollande  disagreed at a
meeting on the weekend on a timetable to introduce joint
oversight of the region’s banks. Sterling fell versus the dollar
before a government report this week forecast to confirm that
Britain’s gross domestic product shrank in the second quarter.  While “the U.K. economy has clear problems ahead of it,
sterling still naturally reacts as a safe haven” from the euro
region, said  Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist at  Bank of
New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  in London. “The move to a swift
resolution of the euro-zone crisis isn’t taking place and from
that perspective it is fairly clear to me that you’re going to
see sterling continue to benefit against the euro.”  The pound advanced 0.4 percent to 79.68 pence per euro as
of 5 p.m.  London  time after climbing to 79.55 pence, the
strongest level since Sept. 7. The U.K. currency weakened 0.2
percent to $1.6198.  Sterling will appreciate through 78 pence per euro by year-
end, a level last seen on July 31, Derrick said. The median of
40 estimates in a Bloomberg survey is for the pound to advance
to 79 pence.  Merkel, Hollande  Merkel and Hollande, meeting on Sept. 22 to mark Franco-
German reconciliation after World War II, failed to mask their
differences on a planned banking union meant to contain the debt
crisis. “The earlier, the better,” Hollande told reporters
near Ludwigsburg,  Germany . Merkel said there’s no point doing
something fast if it then doesn’t work.  The Ifo Institute in Munich said its business climate index
dropped for a fifth month, to 101.4 for September from 102.3 in
August. That’s the lowest reading since February 2010.  Sterling was also supported against the euro as  Greece  and
the representatives of the country’s international lenders
agreed to take a week-long break from inconclusive talks to
craft an 11.5 billion-euro ($14.8 billion) budget-cut package
that’s key to receiving aid funds.  The pound has strengthened 2 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro tumbled 3 percent and the
dollar weakened 2.6 percent.  Economy Shrinks  The U.K. economy shrank 0.5 percent in the three months
ended June 30, the  Office for National Statistics  will say on
Sept. 27, according to a Bloomberg News survey. That would match
the initial estimate released Aug. 24.  The pound earlier dropped to $1.6182, below its 10-day
moving average for the first time since Sept. 5.  The  10-year gilt  yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.81 percent after dropping 13 basis points
last week. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 gained
0.185, or 1.85 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.42.  Gilts returned 2.4 percent this year through Sept. 21,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds also
gained 2.4 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 1.7 percent.  The U.K. five-year  break-even rate , a gauge of investor
expectations for the annual rate of inflation, dropped five
basis points to 2.22 percentage points. U.K. index-linked
securities have made a 3.5 percent loss this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
