Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) ’s U.K.
mobile-phone unit will start a faster fourth-generation network
next year using spectrum from rival EE, reducing the need for
the company to buy expensive frequencies in an upcoming auction.  Hutchison’s Three division last month reached an agreement
to buy the necessary spectrum from EE, the U.K. mobile-phone
venture of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  France Telecom SA (FTE) , which is
rolling out the country’s first 4G network. Hutchison Managing
Director Canning Fok told journalists in Vienna today that Three
will start its 4G offering next year.  EE, the U.K.’s largest wireless operator, got regulatory
approval this year to use licenses in the 1,800 megahertz
spectrum to deliver the faster connections, giving it a head
start on  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Telefonica SA (TEF) , which are waiting
for more frequencies to become available at an auction before
starting their own similar services. The deal with EE lessens
the pressure on Hutchison, the smallest British operator, to buy
expensive frequencies at that auction.  The auction of 800 MHz and 2,600 MHz frequencies is set to
begin later this year. Regulator Ofcom has said the earliest the
new spectrum will be available for use is November 2013.  EE divested some of its 1,800 MHz spectrum to Hutchison to
fulfill commitments given when the European Commission approved
the merger of  France Telecom  and Deutsche Telekom’s U.K. units
in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
