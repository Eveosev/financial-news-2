Nuplex Industries Ltd. (NPX) , a New
Zealand maker of resins used in paint and printing, fell the
most this year after saying plant closures, job cuts and write-
downs will reduce full-year earnings.  Net income will be reduced by NZ$17 million ($14 million)
in the year ending June 30, 2013, the Auckland-based company
said in a statement, without providing a forecast. Profit was
NZ$62.5 million in the last fiscal year. The stock fell 6.6
percent, its biggest decline since Dec. 16.  Nuplex said it will close three sites in  Australia  and New
Zealand, and part of a fourth site because of declining demand.
The closures will incur costs of NZ$16.4 million from write-
downs, redundancies and site remediation, it said.  “Manufacturing customers and their customers continue to
move offshore due to the impact of the ongoing strength of the
Australian and  New Zealand  currencies,” Chief Executive Officer
Emery Severin said in the statement. “In construction, while
activity will recover at some point, demand conditions remain
subdued.”  Nuplex will spend NZ$13 million over two years at two
Australian sites and expects the restructuring program will
boost earnings in 2014.  The  stock  fell 21 cents to NZ$2.97 at the close of
Wellington trading. It earlier fell as low as NZ$2.94.  To contact the reporter on this story:
