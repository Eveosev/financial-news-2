Iran  has detained the son of former
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani upon his return
to the country after three years in the U.K., the state-run  Mehr 
news agency reported.  Mehdi Hashemi attended a court today to answer charges
against him and was then led to Tehran’s Evin prison, according
to two separate Mehr reports.  Hashemi, who arrived in the capital yesterday, is charged
with inciting unrest after the 2009 disputed re-election of
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , which led to street protests,
Mehr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
