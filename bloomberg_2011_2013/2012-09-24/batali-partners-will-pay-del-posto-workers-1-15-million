Celebrity chef and restaurateur
Mario Batali today agreed with his partners to pay $1.15 million
to 31 workers at  Del Posto , settling a 2010 labor dispute at his
most expensive New York restaurant.  The agreement resolves claims alleging misappropriation of
tips, racial discrimination, spread of hours pay, lost minimum
wage and overtime, according to a joint statement from Del
Posto’s owners and Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York
(ROC-NY), a nonprofit advocacy group for the workers.  The statement also denies “all of the workers’
allegations.”  Del Posto charges $115 for its five-course dinner menu, and
$145 for its tasting menu.  The owners, B&B Hospitality Group, agreed to institute
sensitivity training for management and an “expansion” of paid
sick days and paid vacation.  In an e-mail statement, Batali said he looks “forward to
working with ROC-NY to continue to foster and improve a mutually
beneficial relationship with our team.”  The joint statement also said the restaurant will work with
ROC-NY to become a “High Road Employer” in the industry.  “We’re very excited for the workers,” Daisy Chung,
executive director of ROC-NY, said in a telephone interview.
“Del Posto will continue working with us in our High Road
Program. They took a really great step in saying that they want
to work with us.”  Earlier this year Batali settled another tips-related
lawsuit for $5.25 million.  Muse highlights include  Elin McCoy  on wine and  Greg Evans 
on television.  To contact the writer of this column:
