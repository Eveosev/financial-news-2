European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another fell to the lowest in more than 18 months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight indexed swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was 14
basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, at 8:25 a.m. in  London ,
from 15.3 basis points on Sept. 21, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The gap is the smallest since March 3, 2011.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars was little
changed. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 21 basis
points below Euribor. The one-year basis swap was little changed
at 24 basis points below Euribor.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.095
percent on Sept. 21 from 0.097 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was 7.8 basis points from 7.5 on Sept. 21.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank  on Sept. 21, placing 306 billion euros ($397
billion) with the Frankfurt-based central bank from 302 billion
euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
