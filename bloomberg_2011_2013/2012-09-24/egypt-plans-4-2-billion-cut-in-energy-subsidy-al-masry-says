Egypt â€™s government drafted a plan
to reduce energy subsidies by 25.5 billion pounds ($4.2
billion), al-Masry al-Youm newspaper reported, citing an
unidentified official.  Prime Minister Hisham Qandil submitted the proposal to
President Mohamed Mursi, and talks between the two leaders
yesterday focused on whether to implement the subsidy cut next
month or wait until after parliamentary elections, the official
said, according to the newspaper.  Egypt is seeking a $4.8 billion loan from the  International
Monetary Fund . The government needs to start cutting subsidies
because the IMF is waiting for tangible steps amid negotiations
for the loan, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
