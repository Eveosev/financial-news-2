A city in northern Indiana has won
state funding for water filtration system improvements instead
of selling the plant to Indiana-American Water Co., a unit of
the utility American Water Works Co.  Mayor Keith Soderquist said the state approved the Lake
Station application for the Indiana Drinking Water State
Revolving Fund loan, according to a nwitimes.com report. Lake
Station was approved for an $11 million grant from the state,
with bids expected later next month, contracts awarded in
December, a project completion date of 2014 and a fee increase
for water customers, the mayor told the site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
