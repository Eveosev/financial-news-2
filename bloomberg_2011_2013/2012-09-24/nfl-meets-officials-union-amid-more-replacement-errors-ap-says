The  National Football League  met
with union representatives for its locked out officials
yesterday, the  Associated Press  reported, citing two
unidentified people familiar with the talks.  It’s not known whether progress was made on a new labor
contract or when further negotiations might be held, AP said.  The NFL Players Association yesterday  published an open
letter  its executive committee sent to team owners Sept. 20
asking for the lockout to end, saying the use of inexperienced
replacement officials has led to the deterioration of order,
safety and integrity. Replacement officials faced more criticism
from players and media in Week 3 for mistakes that included a
lack of knowledge of rules.  “This affirmative decision has not only resulted in poor
calls, missed calls and bad game management, but the combination
of those deficiencies will only continue to jeopardize player
health and safety and the integrity of the game that has taken
decades to build,” the NFLPA said.  The NFL and the NFL Referees Association are at odds over
pay, pensions and operational issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
