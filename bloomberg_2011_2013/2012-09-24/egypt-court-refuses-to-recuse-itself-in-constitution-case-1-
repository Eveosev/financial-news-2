An Egyptian administrative court
rejected a request filed by lawyers with the Muslim
Brotherhood’s political arm seeking the court’s recusal in a
case dealing with the legitimacy of a panel drafting the
country’s constitution.  In a decision read out in court, Judge Karam Abdel-Latif
said the court would not recuse itself, and ordered nine lawyers
for the Freedom and Justice Party to each pay 32,000 Egyptian
pounds ($5,253) in fines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
