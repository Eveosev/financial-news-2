Portuguese salaries are falling for
the first time since at least 1998 as companies replace more
expensive workers with cheaper ones, according to consulting
firm Mercer.  Total compensation fell as much as 1.8 percent this year
for so-called less qualified positions, while managers and board
members lost 0.37 percent, Mercer said in a statement today,
based on a survey carried out by its unit in  Portugal .  “The substitution of workers for those with lower salary
levels for the same functions has led to a reduction of wages in
practically all job groups,” it said.
It was the first drop since the survey began 14 years ago.  Portugal’s government is cutting spending and raising taxes
to meet the terms of the 78 billion-euro ($101 billion) aid plan
from the euro area and the  International Monetary Fund . A surge
in borrowing costs led Portugal last year to follow Greece and
Ireland in needing a bailout.  The government forecasts the  unemployment rate  will rise to
about 16 percent in 2013 from 15.5 percent this year. Economic
growth has averaged less than 1 percent a year for the past
decade, making Portugal among  Europe ’s weakest performers.  Twenty-six percent of companies that took part in the
survey did not increase wages this year. The study analyzed
108,837 job positions in 296 companies in Portugal, Mercer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
