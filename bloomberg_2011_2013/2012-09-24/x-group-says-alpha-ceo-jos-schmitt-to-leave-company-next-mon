TMX Group Ltd. (X)  said the chief
executive officer of its Alpha Group unit is leaving next month,
as the exchange owner works to integrate its former competitor
after a takeover.  Jos Schmitt, who started the rival platform almost four
years ago, will leave by Oct. 31, Toronto-based TMX said today
in a statement. Randee Pavalow, Alpha’s chief listings officer
and general counsel, will also leave.  TMX and Alpha have been “actively engaged” in integration
planning since Aug. 1, when a group led by banks and pension
funds bought Alpha and Canadian Depository for Securities Ltd.
to combine with its C$3.73 billion ($3.8 billion) takeover of
TMX, according to the statement.  Alpha began in November 2008 as an alternative trading
platform and evolved to become a full-fledged stock exchange
earlier this year, with about 17 percent of the Canadian market
for trading. TMX CEO  Thomas Kloet  said in a Sept. 12 interview
that Alpha has a future under the Toronto Stock Exchange owner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
