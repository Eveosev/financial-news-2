The euro touched its lowest level
in almost two weeks versus the yen as German consumer sentiment
stagnated and Spanish borrowing costs rose at a bill auction
amid concern the region’s debt crisis is deepening.  The 17-nation euro erased losses against the dollar before
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  meets European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  in Berlin today. Data showed German and
French business confidence remained static as Italian sentiment
stayed near a 15-year low. Australia’s dollar pared a decline as
a leading indicator for  China’s economy  rose in August,
supporting trade prospects.  “The euro has responded negatively to disappointing euro-
zone data,” said  Valentin Marinov , head of European Group of 10
foreign-exchange strategy at  Citigroup Inc. (C)  in London. “This
shows investors are aware of deteriorating fundamentals for the
euro and the potential further need for policy accommodation
from the ECB.”  The euro was little changed at 100.68 yen at 7:42 a.m.  New
York  time. It reached 100.16, the least since Sept. 13. The
shared currency was little changed at $1.2936 after declining to
$1.2887, also the lowest since Sept. 13. The yen traded at 77.83
per dollar after earlier touching 77.66, the strongest level
since Sept. 14.  The euro will find so-called support at 100.15 yen, the
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its July-September
advance, technical analysts at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , including
 David Sneddon , wrote in an e-mailed note.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  Citigroup has a three-month euro-dollar forecast of $1.32,
Marinov said. The euro will slide to $1.27 by year-end,
according to the median of bank forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Italian, Spanish Sales  The euro declined versus most its 16 major peers tracked by
Bloomberg after Spain’s borrowing costs rose at a sale of 4
billion euros ($5.2 billion) of bills in Madrid and demand fell
at a sale of Italian zero-coupon two-year notes.  The yield on three-month Spanish debt auctioned today was
1.203 percent compared with 0.946 percent at a previous sale on
Aug. 28. Italy sold 3.94 billion euros of securities, compared
with a maximum target of 4 billion euros. Investors bid for 1.65
times the amount sold, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover
ratio of 1.95 at a sale on Aug. 28.  Nobel Prize-winning economist  Joseph Stiglitz  said euro
members will have to share debts and speed the creation of a
banking union to prevent a situation in which “the whole system
falls apart.” Spain has yet to indicate whether it needs a full
rescue, and discussions between Greece and its lenders on how to
meet bailout commitments remain inconclusive.  Losing Urgency  The euro has dropped 3.4 percent in the past six months,
the worst performance after the Swiss franc among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The yen was the biggest gainer, rising 5.9
percent. The dollar lost 0.6 percent.  German  consumer confidence  will hold steady in October,  GfK
SE (GFK)  said. The market-research company in Nuremberg forecast today
that its consumer-sentiment index, based on a survey of about
2,000 people, will remain at 5.9 for a second-straight month,
matching the median of 25 economist estimates in a  Bloomberg
News  survey. The index was last higher in March 2011.  French industrial confidence was unchanged at 90 this
month, near a two-year low, in the face of stalled growth and
looming tax increases, according to Insee, the national
statistics office in Paris.  An index of Italian consumer  confidence  in September rose
to 86.2 from a revised 86.1 a month earlier, according to Istat,
the national statistics office in  Rome . The reading was more
than the median forecast of 86 in a survey of 11 economists by
Bloomberg News.  The Australian dollar pared losses after the Conference
Board said its leading economic index for China rose 1.7 percent
to 240.4 in August from the previous month. The so-called Aussie
was little changed at $1.0432 after weakening as much as 0.2
percent to $1.0406.  To contact the reporter on this story:
