Kuwait will close a request for
qualifications to bid for a solar-plant project in Abdaleyah, in
the west of the country, on Oct. 7, the director of studies and
research at the Kuwait Ministry of Electricity and Water said.  Toyota Tsusho Corp. (8015)  conducted a feasibility study for the
280-megawatt power station, of which 60 megawatts will be solar
power, Suhaila Marafi said at a conference in Dubai today. A
tender to build the facility will be issued in April, she said.  The country also plans a 70-megawatt solar and wind plant.
The project will be a joint venture between the ministry and
 Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research  and will be tendered
next year as well, Marafi said.  In addition, solar panels have been placed on top of the
ministry that will generate 1 megawatt of electricity soon, she
said. Kuwait aims to generate 10 percent of its electricity from
sustainable sources by 2020, Eyad Ali al-Falah, assistant
undersecretary for technical services at the ministry, said last
year. The country’s total power-generation capacity is 11,300
megawatts, according to a 2011 analysis by the U.S.  Energy
Information Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
