The United Arab Emirates sheikhdom
of Fujairah, an oil storage and trading hub on the  Indian Ocean ,
is exploring for crude and may seek investors for a
petrochemicals plant, an official with the government said.  Fujairah is conducting seismic surveys to find potential
deposits at both on and offshore locations, Salem Kelil,
technical adviser to the local government, said at a conference
in Dubai today. The emirate has drilled three wells and hasn’t
found any oil yet, he said.  One of the U.A.E.’s seven sheikhdoms, Fujairah is nestled
between the Persian Gulf state’s Indian Ocean coast and the
Hajar Mountains, the source of stones used to create the
artificial islands off the coast of richer neighbor Dubai.
Fujairah’s location outside the Strait of Hormuz energy-shipment
chokepoint has helped it attract international oil traders and
fuel-storage tank operators to the emirate.  Abu Dhabi ’s government-owned International Petroleum
Investment Co. plans to build an oil refinery in the emirate.
That facility will produce about 70,000 barrels a day of
naphtha, a refined product that may be used as feedstock in a
future petrochemical plant, Kelil said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
