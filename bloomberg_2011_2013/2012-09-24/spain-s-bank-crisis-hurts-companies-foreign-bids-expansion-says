Spain’s banking crisis is hurting
companies bidding for international contracts as foreign
governments don’t accept guarantees by local lenders,  Expansion 
reported, without citing anyone.  Even guarantees made by  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  weren’t enough for companies bidding for
infrastructure projects in Asia and Africa, the newspaper said.  Some overseas administrations are forcing Spanish companies
to use foreign banks’ guarantees to present bids for projects as
they don’t trust the solvency of Spanish lenders, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
