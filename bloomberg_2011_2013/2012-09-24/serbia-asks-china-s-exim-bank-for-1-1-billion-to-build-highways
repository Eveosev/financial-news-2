Serbia  asked the Export-Import Bank
of  China , or Exim, for an 850 million euro ($1.1 billion) loan
to improve its road infrastructure with new highways.  Agreements with the bank and a contractor may be signed by
the end of the year, allowing construction to begin in early
2013, the government said in an e-mailed statement after Finance
and Economy Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  met with Liu Liangge, Exim’s
vice president in Belgrade today.  The credit would support construction of a 25 kilometer (16
mile) stretch between the capital Belgrade and Obrenovac, part
of a future highway to neighboring Montenegro, and a 110-
kilometer Pojate-Preljina section across central Serbia that
would link two north-south highways, the statement said.  China and the Balkan country signed a 15-year agreement in
2009 envisaging $1.25 billion Chinese investment in Serbia’s
infrastructure and energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
