Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s new mapping software
for its mobile devices is “short on options” and needs to
mature before it can rival paid map applications,  Consumer
Reports  said after testing the navigation feature.  “Maps does not have route preference settings, choices for
avoidance preferences, exit guides, and lane assistance,”
Consumer Reports said in a preliminary  review  posted on its
website. “The information provided to the driver is sparse.”  Still, Consumer Reports said the free mapping software is
“a welcomed addition to the iPhone universe,” and it expects
developers to quickly correct omissions in the initial release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
