An early sale of the U.K.
government’s stake in  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  would put
lending to companies and households at risk, Deputy Prime
Minister  Nick Clegg  said.  “You need to put pressure on the banking system to ensure
that they sort out their own balance sheet,” Clegg said in a
Bloomberg Television interview yesterday in Brighton, on
England’s South Coast, where his Liberal Democrat party is
holding its annual conference. “However, if you put too much
pressure on the banks to do it too quickly, in a rush, the
effect is that banks hoard cash. If we put too much pressure on
too quickly to withdraw our stakes, we will only exacerbate the
problems of credit in the real economy.”  Britain’s largest state-owned lender has reduced assets by
more than 800 billion pounds ($1.3 trillion), eliminated 36,000
jobs and scaled back securities and Irish units since it was
rescued in 2008. The bank’s shares are still trading at less
than half the level at which the government bought its 82
percent stake for about 45.5 billion pounds.  Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable yesterday
announced plans for a “business bank” aimed at spurring
lending to companies and helping the economy grow. Cable said
that reluctance by banks to lend was a key obstacle to recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
