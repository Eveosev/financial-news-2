Soybeans fell to a five-week low on
speculation that demand for U.S. crops will ease after prices
this month surged to a record. Corn dropped to the cheapest in
two months as an accelerating Midwest harvest boosts supplies.  Demand will ebb for cooking oil and biofuel made from
soybeans after prices surged since mid-June because of a U.S.
drought, Thomas Mielke, the executive director of Oil World,
said yesterday. In  China , the world’s biggest oilseed importer,
soybean-oil prices fell the most in three months amid economic
concerns.  “Soybeans are falling on fears of less Chinese demand for
U.S. supplies,” said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago . “Economic growth is
slowing more than expected in China.”  Soybean futures for November delivery slid 0.7 percent to
close at $16.10 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $15.9025, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Aug. 14. The oilseed has dropped 10
percent from a record $17.89 on Sept. 4.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$7.4475 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $7.3625, the lowest
since July 13. The grain has dropped 12 percent since touching a
record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Dry weather this week will allow farmers to accelerate
collection of this year’s crops. The corn harvest probably was
45 percent completed as of yesterday, along with 20 percent for
soybeans, Grow said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
