Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
visiting  New York  to address the  United Nations General
Assembly , will use an appearance on CBS’s Late Show with David Letterman to promote British businesses in the U.S.  Cameron will appear on tomorrow’s late-night talk show to
encourage more Americans to visit the U.K. or set up a business
in Britain, according to his office in London. He is due to
address the UN General Assembly tomorrow.  Cameron has pledged to put business and growth at the heart
of his foreign policy as Britain recovers from a recession. The
prime minister will also today defend the decision to maintain
spending on foreign aid at a time when budgets elsewhere are
being slashed to tackle the  budget deficit , saying more needs to
be done to meet 2015 poverty-reduction targets.  “When we make a promise to the poorest people in the world
we should keep it not turn our back on people who are trusting
us to help them,” Cameron will say as he chairs the first
meeting of the UN High Level Panel on the post Millennium
Development Goals, according to extracts of his speech released
in advance. “More than 5,000 infants die every day from
preventable diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea. So to those
who say we can’t afford to act, I say we can’t afford to wait.”  On arrival in New York today, Cameron will meet some
of the city’s technology startups that are set to invest more
than 30 million pounds ($49 million) in the U.K., creating more
than 100 new jobs in a tech hub in east  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
