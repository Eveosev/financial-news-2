The U.S. needs a policy to address
climate change and a plan to reduce emissions that may include a
carbon tax and bonds, Columbia University Professor  Jeffrey Sachs  said.  “We have to make a technological transition that’s quite
deep to new energy systems, new transport systems, more
efficient buildings and that can be back loaded,” Sachs said to
reporters today at Climate Week NYC in New York.  The public needs a plan that isn’t just about electricity
prices rising, said Sachs. “You can’t tell the public that our
plan is cap-and-trade,” he said. “That’s not a plan, that’s
frightening, that just means: our electricity prices are going
up.”  Sachs suggested that bonds could be used to finance
investments to be paid back over their lifetimes. “You could
promise today significant feed-in tariffs totally paid for by a
backloaded carbon tax.” Not leveling with the public is “the
biggest missing thing,” he said.  “I’m happy to have the future pay for a lot of this,”
Sachs said. “It can be bond financed --it doesn’t have to be
current financed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
