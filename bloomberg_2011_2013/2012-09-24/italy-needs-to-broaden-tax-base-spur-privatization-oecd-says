Italy should broaden its tax base,
enhance its privatization program and open up parts of its
economy to more competition to help deficit-reduction goals, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Efforts by Prime Minister  Mario Monti  to boost productivity
and slash the deficit are “courageous” and “ambitious,”
though they need to be bolstered amid a recession, OECD
Secretary General Angel Gurria said in a report today.  “The resolute implementation and continuation of these
reforms, as well as continued fiscal consolidation efforts, will
be essential,” Gurria wrote in the introduction to 33 pages of
recommendations. Italy needs to “not only avoid the unraveling
of already approved reforms but also ensure continuity in the
reform agenda going forward,” he said.  The extension of Monti’s effort could add an additional 4
percentage points to  gross domestic product  over a decade, the
OECD estimates. The Paris-based OECD advises its 34 member
governments on economic policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
