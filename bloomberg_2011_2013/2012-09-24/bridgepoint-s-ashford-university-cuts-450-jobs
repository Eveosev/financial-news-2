Ashford University, a for-profit
college owned by  Bridgepoint Education Inc. (BPI) , eliminated 450
admissions jobs to focus on student support after heightened
scrutiny by accreditors.  In July, the Higher Learning Commission of the North
Central Association of Schools and Colleges put the Clinton,
Iowa-based school on “special monitoring” status and another
denied its application for accreditation. Ashford is appealing
the decision.  Congress and state attorneys general are investigating the
marketing and job-placement claims of for-profit colleges, which
can receive as much as 90 percent of their revenue from federal
grants and loans that students use to pay tuition. Such schools
have higher student-loan default rates than traditional
institutions. For-profit colleges got almost $32 billion in U.S.
student aid in the 2009-2010 school year.  “The reorganization allows us to align our services with
our continued dedication to student success,” Elizabeth Tice,
president of Ashford, said in a statement.  Ashford also said it reassigned 200 admissions personnel to
its student-services department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
