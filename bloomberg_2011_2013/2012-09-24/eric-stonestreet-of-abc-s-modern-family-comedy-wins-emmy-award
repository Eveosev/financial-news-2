“Homeland,” Showtime’s drama about an American military officer turned terrorist, won the Emmy award for top dramatic series and three other honors, ending the four-year streak for AMC’s “Mad Men.”  Damian Lewis and  Claire Danes , stars of the show on  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s pay-TV network, took home Emmys for their performances in the series, which returns next week. The 64th prime-time Emmy awards were broadcast live last night on  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC network from the Nokia Theatre in  Los Angeles . ABC late night personality Jimmy Kimmel hosted the telecast.  The award for “Homeland” marked the first best drama Emmy won by Showtime, producer of shows including “Dexter,” “Weeds” and “Nurse Jackie.” Cable TV has come to dominate the Emmys for drama, with no competing nominations from broadcast networks this year.  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s  HBO  won the most, six, including four for “Game Change,” the movie about former U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  “It’s been a long time coming and ‘Homeland’ stands on a lot of great shoulders over there,” Alex Gansa, executive producer of the series, said from the stage. “You guys have been so great to us, we are so glad to return the favor.”  In “Homeland,” Lewis plays Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody, who returns home eight years after disappearing in  Iraq . Danes portrays Carrie Mathison, a CIA officer coping with mental illness who suspects Brody might be plotting an attack.  ABC’s “Modern Family” cornered the comedy Emmys with four awards, including best series for a third time. Eric Stonestreet and Julie Bowen garnered best-supporting comedy actor Emmys for their roles in the series about the complicated nature of today’s family life, and Steve Levitan, a co-creator, won the directing Emmy award for the episode “Baby on Board.”  Most Humorous  “I love that both  Ann Romney  and  Michelle Obama  have said ‘Modern Family’ is their favorite show,” Bowen said to reporters backstage. “That says to me that there is a place where America can come together.”  Jon Cryer, of CBS’s “Two and a Half Men,” won the Emmy award for best comedy actor and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, former star of “Seinfeld,” won best comedy actress for her role as vice president in HBO’s “Veep.”  The win for Cryer was his second, while Louis-Dreyfus’s Emmy marked her third. Stonestreet and Bowen have both won twice. Comedian Louis C.K. won the comedy writing award for his show ‘Louie’ on  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s FX network.  Without Sheen  Cryer won for his portrayal of Alan Harper in “Two and a Half Men.” He won for the first season without former star  Charlie Sheen . Stonestreet plays Cameron Tucker in the top-rated ABC comedy. Bowen’s character is Claire Dunphy.  Last night’s telecast, airing at the start of the TV season, was a showcase for programs most admired by the industry and a chance to promote returning hits.  The program attracted an audience of 13.2 million viewers, up 6 percent from the year-ago telecast on Fox, ABC said today in an e-mailed statement, citing data from Nielsen.  The program came in second for the night in total viewers, trailing the most-watched weekly program: NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” and the  match-up  in which the  Baltimore Ravens  defeated the  New England Patriots  in the last few seconds. Last year’s Emmy telecast, also up against a game, drew 12.4 million viewers, to come in second.  ‘Game Change’  “Game Change,” produced by  Tom Hanks ’ Playtone, starred  Julianne Moore  as Palin, the former Alaska governor thrust into the national spotlight as  John McCain ’s pick for his Republican vice presidential candidate. The series won awards for writing, directing and best actress for Moore.  “I feel so vindicated because Sarah Palin gave me a big thumbs down,” Moore said in her acceptance speech.  Kevin Costner  and Tom Berenger won Emmys for roles in History’s “Hatfields & McCoys.” Costner won best actor in a miniseries or movie and Berenger won best supporting actor.  “Mad Men,”  AMC Networks (AMCX) ’ look at advertising in the 1960s, lost its bid for an unprecedented fifth-straight Emmy.  Jon Hamm  and  Elisabeth Moss , stars of the program, were nominated for top actor awards.  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s broadcast network, the most-watched, was top among over-the-air programmers with 60 nominations, according to the academy. HBO led the cable programmers with a total of 81 nominations.  The Emmys are organized by The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in Los Angeles. This year’s executive producer was Don Mischer, who has won 13 Emmys for producing live events including Olympics opening ceremonies, the Kennedy Center Honors and Broadway’s Tony Awards.
