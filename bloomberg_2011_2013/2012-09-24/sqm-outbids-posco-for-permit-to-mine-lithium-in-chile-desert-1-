Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA ,
the world’s largest lithium producer, won a license to tap a new
deposit of the light metal in  Chile , outbidding South Korea’s
 Posco (005490)  and local rival Grupo Errazuriz.  SQM, as the company is known, was granted a license to
extract as much as 100,000 metric tons after bidding 19.3
billion pesos ($40.6 million), Chile’s mining deputy minister
Pablo Wagner said at a Santiago event today.  Lithium demand may triple in the next 8 years on wider use
of electric vehicles powered by  lithium batteries , Wagner said.
Santiago-based SQM supplies about 31 percent of the world’s
lithium from the Atacama Salt Lake in northern Chile.  Lithium is considered a “strategic” resource under
Chilean laws, which limit new companies seeking permission to
extract it. Princeton, New Jersey-based  Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC) 
also mines lithium in Chile under license.  To contact the reporter on this story:
