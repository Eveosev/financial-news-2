Federated Investors Inc. (FII) , the
second-biggest U.S. money-market mutual fund firm, said it
reorganized about $929 million in assets from Trustmark Corp.’s
Performance Funds Trust into similar funds it manages.  Eight offerings from Performance Funds, including four
equity, two fixed-income and two money-market funds, were
shifted into seven Federated products, the Pittsburgh-based
money manager said today in a statement. The changes were
approved by Performance Funds’ shareholders on Sept. 19,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
