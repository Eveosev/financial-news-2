Peregrine Pharmaceuticals Inc. (PPHM) 
plunged the most ever after the biotechnology company said the
survival rates from its lung cancer study reported earlier this
month were unreliable.  Peregrine declined 78 percent to $1.16 at the close in  New
York , the biggest drop since April 1994. The shares of the
Tustin, California-based company had more than quadrupled in the
past 12 months through Sept. 21.  Peregrine soared 47 percent on Sept. 7 after the company
said non-small cell lung cancer patients who took the
drugmaker’s experimental bavituximab lived twice as long as
those on placebo. Peregrine said in a statement today that it
“discovered major discrepancies” between patient test results
and treatment code assignments by the independent contractor
responsible for the distribution of the medicine in the study.  “Today’s news comes as a shock and we believe represents a
major blow to confidence in the bavituximab program,”  Joseph Pantginis , a New York-based analyst for  Roth Capital Partners ,
wrote in a note to investors. “The level of uncertainty
surrounding the stock at this point is a major hurdle needing to
be addressed.”  Pantginis downgraded the stock to neutral, and lowered his
price target to 70 cents from $9.  “Investors should not rely on previously reported clinical
data,” Peregrine said in the statement. Christopher Keenan, a
company spokesman, declined to comment beyond the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
