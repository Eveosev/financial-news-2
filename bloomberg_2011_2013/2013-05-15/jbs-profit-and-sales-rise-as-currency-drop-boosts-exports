JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said  first-quarter  profit almost doubled after a
weakening Brazilian currency helped it boost exports. The shares
jumped.  Net income climbed to 227.9 million reais ($113 million),
or 8 centavos a share in the quarter, from 116.1 million reais,
or 4 centavos, a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said
yesterday. Profit excluding a one-time tax charge was 374.5
million reais, JBS said. The average of five analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was for profit excluding some items of 231
million reais.  Sales increased 22 percent to 19.5 billion reais as a 9.6
percent decline of the Brazilian real against the  U.S. dollar  in
the year through March made its exports more competitive. JBS
soared 6 percent to 6.55 reais at 12:37 p.m. in  Sao Paulo ,
heading to the highest close since April 10.  JBS expects profit margins to increase at its beef units in
 Brazil , Argentina and the U.S., Chief Executive Officer Wesley
Batista said on an earnings call today.  The company’s 879.4 million reais of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda,
missed the 1.05 billion-real average of eight estimates. Net
debt was 3.4 times Ebitda, unchanged from the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
