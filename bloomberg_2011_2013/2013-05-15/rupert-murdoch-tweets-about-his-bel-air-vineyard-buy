Rupert Murdoch has given mixed signals about wanting to own the Los Angeles Times, but he's made it clear how he feels about his latest real estate purchase. The media mogul is closing the deal on a Bel Air property, last listed for $29.5 million. While the sale is pending on the MLS, Murdoch decided to share the news on Twitter. While the vineyard might be small by wine-making standards, it’s a large parcel for Los Angeles measuring 13 acres. The land includes Moraga Vineyards and Winery, which Tom and Ruth Jones have owned since 1959. A 7,500-square-foot home built in 1940 by “Gone With the Wind” and “The Wizard of Oz” director Victor Fleming — as well as a wine cave, guest house and 4,400-square-foot office — come with the property. According to  Business Insider , Murdoch first checked out the listing after reading about it in  The Wall Street Journal . Mr. and Mrs. Jones reportedly said they were “ready to pass on the vineyard to ‘someone who will carry on their story.’” Moraga is the first commercial winery to be bonded in the city of Los Angeles since the Prohibition ended in 1933. “We are proud to be the ‘Vino Locale’ for Los Angeles as well as preservationists for our piece of rural California,” Tom Jones said in a quote on the  company’s website . While Murdoch doesn’t have experience owning a vineyard and is currently  facing demands to step down as chairman of News Corp. , he knows how to juggle multiple homes. He owns an 11-bedroom in Beverly Hills, as well as two New York City properties. Related:
