French rider  Sylvain Georges  tested
positive for a banned stimulant at the Giro d’Italia, cycling’s
ruling body said.  The 29-year-old, who is on the AG2R-La Mondiale team,
tested for the drug heptaminol -- which widens blood vessels --
in a urine sample on May 10, the  Union Cycliste Internationale 
said in a statement.  Georges isn’t automatically suspended given the nature of
the substance and can request analysis of a back-up sample, the
UCI said. He was 109th of 193 riders in the  race classification 
before today’s 11th stage.  He didn’t start the stage, Gazzetta dello Sport’s website
reported. The Giro is the most prestigious stage race in cycling
after the Tour de France.  Georges is in his third year as a professional and won a
Tour of California stage last year.  Separately, the UCI said it suspended  Miguel Ubeto  after he
tested positive for metabolic modulator GW1516 in an out-of-competition test last month.  Venezuela ’s Ubeto, 36, races for the Lampre-Merida team.  To contact the reporters on this story:
