Regina Finn, chief executive of the
U.K. water regulator Ofwat, resigned effective November, Ofwat
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The search for a successor for the regulator of water and
sewer companies in  England  and  Wales  has begun, Ofwat said.
After leading Ofwat for six years, “this is the right time for
me to move on,” she said in the statement.  “Regina wishes to take her career forward in a different
direction, and we look forward to working with her over the
coming months in a smooth transition process,” Ofwat Chairman
Jonson Cox said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
