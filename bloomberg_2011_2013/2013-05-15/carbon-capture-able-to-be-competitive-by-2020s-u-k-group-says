Technology to trap carbon emissions
from coal- and gas-fired power plants and store it underground
has the potential to be cost-competitive with other green energy
in the U.K. by the early 2020s, a government adviser said.  The government needs to set out policies and financing to
push down costs in the industry to achieve that goal, the  Carbon
Capture and Storage Cost Reduction Taskforce  said in a report.
It should spur use of captured carbon dioxide to increase oil
extraction, find sites to store and ways to transport the gas.  By the early 2020’s CCS has the potential to cost about 100
pounds ($152) a megawatt-hour, and less soon after, according to
the report. Coal-fired power now costs about $83.4 a megawatt-hour, according to researcher Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The report identifies a gap in policy and funding for CCS
in industry, Jeff Chapman, chairman of the taskforce, said in an
e-mailed statement. The group will work with the business and
energy ministries to “fill this gap,” said Chapman, also chief
executive officer of the Carbon Capture & Storage Association.  The U.K. in March selected two projects led by companies
including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Drax Group Plc as preferred
bidders for 1 billion pounds of funding for CCS.  The Department of Energy and Climate Change will make an
 investment decision  to build one or two projects in early 2015,
with facilities slated to begin operating from 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
