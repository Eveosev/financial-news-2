Kenyan coffee prices climbed for a
second straight week at an auction yesterday as buyers
replenished their inventories.  The average price for all coffee sold was $155.36 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, up from from $152.66 a week earlier,
the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said by e-mail from Nairobi, the
capital, where auctions are held. The average for the benchmark
AA grade was $285.04 a bag from $285.15, it said.  “There was increased demand as buyers were active building
up their stocks,” Kizito Keya, a coffee trader at Mumba Coffee
Ltd. said by phone from Nakuru, in the Rift Valley province.  Kenya produces arabica coffee, favored by coffee shops such
as  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  Export destinations for the African nation’s
beans include  Germany , the U.S. and  Sweden , according to the
Kenya Coffee Producers and Traders Association, which owns the
exchange.  Sales climbed to 9,783 bags worth $1.85 million from 7,437
bags valued at $1.38 million a week earlier, the exchange said.
Supplies rose 13 percent to 18,931 bags, it said.  Kenya harvests its early crop May through July, while the
