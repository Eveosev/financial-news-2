Indian stock-index futures gained
after the central bank signaled slowing inflation may increase
the authority’s scope to ease monetary policy.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for May delivery rose 0.5
percent to 6,035.5 at 10:18 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying
CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index climbed 0.3 percent to 5,995.40 yesterday. The
S&P BSE Sensex index advanced 0.2 percent to 19,722.29. The Bank
of  New York  Mellon  India  ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares
increased 0.3 percent.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
yesterday that he would “take note” of softening inflation at
next month’s monetary policy review after data showed yesterday
that wholesale  prices  grew in April at the slowest rate since
November 2009. Subbarao lowered the benchmark  interest rate  for
the third time this year on May 3 and said there was little
space for further easing because of the possibility of price
pressures returning.  “The drop in inflation will give the RBI more room to cut
rates,” Suniil Pachisia, vice president at Pratibhuti Viniyog
Ltd., said in an interview.  Wholesale-price inflation climbed 4.89 percent in April
from a year earlier, after rising 5.96 percent in March,
government data showed. That was less than the median estimate
of 5.45 percent in a Bloomberg survey of 29 economists.  ‘Strong Interest’  Overseas investors  bought a net $87.8 million of  Indian (SENSEX) 
stocks on May 13, taking this year’s net inflows to a net $12.7
billion, data from the market regulator show. That’s a record
for the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is still very strong interest by foreign
institutional investors to be investing in India and I think
that this trend will continue,” Tai Hui, chief market
strategist for  Asia  at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV India yesterday.  The Sensex has rallied 8 percent since slumping to a seven-month low on April 9 as foreign funds extended  purchases  amid
monetary easing by global central banks. The index has added 1.5
percent this year and is valued at 13.6 times  forecast 12-month
profits , compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.5
times.  Profits at just two of the 15 Sensex companies that have
reported March-quarter earnings have  trailed  estimates, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with about 43 percent
that missed forecasts in the three months ended Dec. 31, and 40
percent in the previous two quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
