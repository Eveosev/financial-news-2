Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the world’s largest
supplier of clothes and toys to retailers, climbed the most in
17 months in  Hong Kong  trading after UBS AG upgraded the stock
to Neutral from Sell.  Li & Fung advanced as much as 7.8 percent to HK$11.10,
headed for the biggest gain since Nov. 28, 2011, before trading
at HK$11.04 as of 10:18 a.m. in Hong Kong.  The  stock  has lost more than 50 percent of its value since
January 2011, as a sluggish  U.S. economy  hurt orders from the
outsourcer’s biggest market. Li & Fung in March said it will
miss its three-year target of $1.5 billion operating income by
2013, and  Standard & Poor’s  in April lowered its  credit rating .  “We upgrade Li & Fung to Neutral due to a lack of near-term catalysts and lower settlement on previous acquisitions,”
UBS analysts led by Spencer Leung wrote in a note to clients.  Morgan Stanley and Macquarie Securities in March upgraded
Li & Fung, citing its  balance sheet  and  dividends . The Morgan
Stanley analysts said the stock’s “negativity is mostly priced
in.”  “Our long-term de-rating thesis remains intact,” the UBS
analysts wrote. “The golden decade of  China  sourcing has passed
as the wage advantage diminishes.”  Li & Fung’s “slowdown in acquisitions and the decline in
dividends” will probably continue, said the Hong Kong-based
analysts, who included Erica Poon Werkun and Siguo Chen.  Li & Fung’s profit last year fell 9.4 percent to $617
million, missing the average of 17 analysts’  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. It was the first profit decline in four years for
the company, which traces its beginnings to 1906 when parent Li
& Fung Group was founded.  The supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and  Target Corp. (TGT)  had
$680 million in cash at the end of last year, compared with $426
million in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
