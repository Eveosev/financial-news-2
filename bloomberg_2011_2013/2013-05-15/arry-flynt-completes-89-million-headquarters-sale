Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler
magazine, completed the sale of his company’s 10-story
headquarters building in Beverly Hills, California, to  Douglas
Emmett (DEI)  Inc. for $89 million.  Flynt signed a lease with the real estate investment trust
to remain the anchor tenant at the 220,000-square-foot (20,000-square-meter) building, Flynt Management Group LLC said today in
a statement. With the acquisition, Douglas Emmett has eight
Beverly Hills office properties, the Santa Monica, California-based company said in a separate statement.  Flynt bought the property “for less than $19 million, so
we’ve been able to unlock significant equity which we can now
put to much better use in other ventures and achieve greater
returns,” he said in his statement.  The building, at the intersection of Wilshire and La
Cienega boulevards, was built in 1972 for a bank, Great Western
Savings. The black, oval-shaped tower has a bronze sculpture of
actor  John Wayne  riding a horse in front and “Flynt
Productions” in white lettering on the roof.  To contact the reporter on this story:
