Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., a
Japanese developer of renewable energy projects, plans to build
a 115-megawatt solar power station in northern  Japan .  The company aims to begin construction in July and start
running the station in Rokkasho village, Aomori prefecture, in
November 2015, Mitsue Usami, a spokeswoman for Eurus, said in a
telephone interview today.  The project is expected to cost about 49 billion yen ($480
million), Usami said. She declined to comment on who will
provide solar panels, citing ongoing negotiations.  Tokyo-based Eurus is a venture between  Toyota Tsusho Corp. (8015) 
and  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)   To contact the reporter on this story:
