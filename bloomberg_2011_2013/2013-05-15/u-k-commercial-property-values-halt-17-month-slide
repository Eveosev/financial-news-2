U.K. commercial real estate values in
April halted their slide after falling for 17 straight months,
Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses were
unchanged from March, London-based IPD said in a statement
today. Total return, which combines changes in real estate
values and rental income, was 0.5 percent in April.  “There are positive signs emerging in the U.K. property
market, which sit alongside more optimistic reports about the
U.K. economy,” Phil Tily, a managing director at IPD, said in
the statement. “In the first quarter, we saw a growing
percentage of assets outside of  London  delivering flat or
positive capital growth, and that trend has continued in
April.”  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said today that a U.K.
economic recovery is now “in sight,” the first improvement on
both growth and inflation he has been able to forecast since the
financial crisis struck. Businesses, however, are still delaying
decisions on moving to new offices and warehouses outside London
and consumers are spending less, hurting retail results.  Retail values declined by 0.1 percent in April, compared
with 0.1 percent gain for office properties and a 0.1 drop for
warehouses.  The IPD index was compiled from appraisals of 3,355
properties valued at 31.4 billion pounds ($48 billion) at the
end of April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
