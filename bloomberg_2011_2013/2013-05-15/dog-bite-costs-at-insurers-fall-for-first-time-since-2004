U.S. insurers’ costs tied to dog
bites fell for the first time since 2004 as a decline in the
number of claims cushioned another increase in the average
expense per attack.  Bites cost the industry $489.7 million in 2012, compared
with a record $490.8 million a year earlier, the  Insurance
Information Institute  said today in a  statement . The number of
claims slipped about 1.4 percent to 16,459.  The population of dogs has been on the decline in the U.S.
according to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the
biggest provider of residential coverage. Bloomington, Illinois-based State Farm is among insurers urging policyholders to use
leashes in public, make sure pets are socialized as puppies and
increase supervision of the animals around young children.  “A dog’s tendency to bite depends on such factors as
heredity, obedience training, socialization, health, and the
victim’s behavior,” State Farm said today in a separate statement.
“There are good dogs and bad dogs within every breed, just as
there can be responsible and irresponsible owners of each breed.”  The number of dog-bite claims at State Farm fell to 3,670 in
2012 from 3,750 a year earlier, the insurer said. The U.S. dog
population was about 70 million at the end of 2011, down from 72
million in 2006, State Farm said, citing data from The American
Veterinary Medical Association.  The growth in the average cost per bite slowed last year,
according to the institute. The expense tied to the typical attack
climbed 1.2 percent to $29,752. That compares with a 12 percent
increase in 2011.  Jury Awards  “While a decrease in dog bite claims is good news, the
rise in claims costs by even a small amount suggests that
medical costs as well as the size of settlements, judgments and
jury awards given to plaintiffs are still on the upswing,” the
institute said.  Residential policies typically cover liability from dog bites,
according to the institute. The industry group said last year that
bites account for more than a third of liability payouts from home
insurers and that a lawsuit can cost more than $100,000 in fees and
lost wages, even if won by the dog owner. National Dog Bite
 Prevention Week  begins May 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
