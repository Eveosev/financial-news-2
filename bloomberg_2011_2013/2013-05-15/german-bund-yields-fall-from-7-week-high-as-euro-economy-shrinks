German 10-year  bund yields  fell from
the highest level in seven weeks after a report showed the euro-area economy contracted more in the first quarter than analysts
forecast, spurring demand for safer assets.  Greek bonds gained, sending 10-year yields below 9 percent
for the first time since October 2010, after  Fitch Ratings 
raised the nation’s credit rating yesterday by one level.
Italian bonds were little changed as the nation said it will
sell government debt maturing in 2044 through banks.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.38 percent
at 10:48 a.m. London time after rising to 1.41 percent, the
highest level since March 25. The price of the 1.5 percent bond
due in February 2023 was 101.125.  Gross domestic product in the  euro zone  fell 0.2 percent
after a 0.6 percent decline in the previous three months, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was for a contraction
of 0.1 percent.  Greece ’s 10-year yield fell 91 basis points, or 0.91
percentage point, to 8.41 percent. Italy’s 10-year yield fell
one basis point to 4.01 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
