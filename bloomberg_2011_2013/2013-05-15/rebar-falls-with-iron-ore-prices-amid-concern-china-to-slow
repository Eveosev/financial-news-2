Steel reinforcement-bar futures
declined a second day on concern that  China ’s growth is slowing
and as iron-ore prices dropped.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.7 percent to 3,607  yuan  ($587) a
metric ton and was at 3,617 at 10:15 a.m. local time. The most-active contract has retreated 9.3 percent this year.  Bank of America Corp. reduced its estimate on China’s 2014
gross domestic product growth to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent,
citing sluggish external demand, economists led by Ting Lu wrote
in a note today. China won’t introduce any significant stimulus
measures and a rate cut in the near term is unlikely, according
to the bank. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port fell 1 percent to
$128.10 a ton yesterday, the lowest level since May 6.  “The market in the short-term is under pressure amid macro
worries and sluggish demand,” Wang Yongliang, an analyst at
Beijing Cifco Futures Co., said by phone from Tianjin today.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. also cut its growth outlook for
 China’s economy  yesterday. There’s concern that the government
is introducing more property restrictions to limit gains in
housing prices, Wang said.  The average  spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,579 yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
