The shekel slid to a two-month low
after  Israel ’s central bank pledged this week to buy foreign
currency to arrest appreciation and as optimism the  U.S. economy 
is improving fueled gains in the dollar.  The shekel weakened 0.8 percent to 3.6681 per dollar by
9:47 a.m. in  New York , the lowest intraday level since March 22.
The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to
track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, touched 84.094, the highest level since July.
Israeli markets are closed for a holiday.  The shekel depreciated for a fifth straight trading day,
the longest stretch of declines since October. The Bank of
Israel, run by Governor  Stanley Fischer , vowed May 13 to
purchase $2.1 billion by the end of the year to stem strength in
the shekel, which has rallied 1.9 percent in 2013. About 90
percent of the currency’s drop can be put down to the central
bank’s action and 10 percent to the stronger dollar, according
to Barclays Plc.  “There is a small percentage of the recent shekel weakness
that can be attributed to the increasing confidence that
investors have over the dollar,” Koon Man Chow, head of
emerging-market strategy at Barclays in  London , said by phone.
“That has a little bit of bearing over every currency including
the shekel, including currencies where central bank actions are
right at the forefront.”  The shekel reached 3.5520 per dollar May 8, the strongest
level based on closing prices since August 2011, on prospects
production of natural gas off the Israeli coast will lure
investment, stoking gains in the currency.  While the  Bank of Israel  unexpectedly reduced its lending
rate May 13 by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, the
country’s 1.5 percent rate remains higher than the euro region’s
record-low 0.5 percent, Japan’s 0.1 percent and the zero to 0.25
percent range for the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
