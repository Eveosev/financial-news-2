The actions of Internal Revenue
Service employees in targeting small-government groups for extra
scrutiny was “intolerable,” President  Barack Obama  said in a
statement released by the White House.  Obama issued the statement hours after an inspector
general’s report was released that criticized management at the
agency as ineffective.  “The federal government must conduct itself in a way
that’s worthy of the public’s trust, and that’s especially true
for the IRS,” the president said. “The IRS must apply the law
in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with
utmost integrity. This report shows that some of its employees
failed that test.”  Obama has directed Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew to
“hold those responsible for these failures” accountable, the
statement said.  The IRS has admitted that it singled out groups for extra
scrutiny based solely on whether their names included words such
as “tea party” and “patriot,” raising questions about
whether partisan motivation drove the agency’s actions.  The practices, which the agency first acknowledged May 10,
are the subject of four separate congressional investigations
and a  Department of Justice  criminal probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
