 CMEA Capital, a San Francisco-based
venture capital firm that helped finance CNano Technology Ltd.
and Ambrx Inc., lost a bid to force three former executive
assistants to move their harassment claims to arbitration.  State court Judge Marla Miller in San Francisco on May 9
denied the company’s request to compel arbitration and put the
case on hold, according to electronic court records. She granted
the plaintiff’s request to seal their compensation history.  The assistants, Dawn-Shemain Weeks, Margaret Hines and
Shannon Schlagenhauf, alleged in a March lawsuit that they were
subjected to inappropriate sexual and racial comments. The
comments were a “common and tolerated part of the work
environment” at CMEA, according to the complaint.  CMEA denied the allegations, the company’s lawyer said in a
statement in March.  “CMEA has conducted itself with the utmost
integrity and has made every effort to treat plaintiffs with
respect and professionalism,” said Lara Villarreal Hutner.  “We are disappointed by the result, but the reality is
CMEA pursued arbitration in order to expedite the litigation
process, as given how impacted our courts are, we are not likely
to receive a trial date until 2014,” Hutner said today in an e-mail. “It is just incredibly difficult to have such hotly
contested allegations levied against you and to have to accept
that it will be at least a year before the truth is told.”  The case is Weeks v. CMEA Development Company LLC,,
CGC-13-528602, California Superior Court (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
