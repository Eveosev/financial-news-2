Tiger Woods  will host a 50-player
poker tournament with a $10,000 buy-in this weekend in  Las
Vegas , with some of the action set to be filmed for a future
 World Poker Tour  television episode.  Woods, the world’s No. 1 ranked golfer, is hosting the two-day charity event, known as “Tiger Jam,” May 17-18 at the
Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino to benefit the college-access
programs of the Tiger Woods Foundation. The  annual  tournament
has raised about $14 million over the past 15 years.  Participants will join Woods, poker professional and emcee
Phil Hellmuth, and poker Hall of Fame members Doyle Brunson and
Mike Sexton in the competition.  Prizes include a round of golf with Woods, a 14-time major
champion who’s won four of his seven U.S. PGA Tour starts this
season; pro-am playing spots in PGA Tour events; and autographed
memorabilia.  Woods, who last week won the Players Championship by two
strokes, is next scheduled to play at the Memorial Tournament in
Dublin, Ohio, from May 30 to June 2. It will be his final event
before the  U.S. Open , which is scheduled for June 13-16 at
Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
