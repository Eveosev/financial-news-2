Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  has no plans to
cut more jobs at its German unit, it said, denying a German
press report that the company may trim an additional 500
positions on top of those already announced.  “A reduction of an additional 500 jobs as speculated by
Manager Magazin is not true,” Vodafone said in an e-mailed
statement.  The Newbury, England-based company previously said its
German operations will lose 500 jobs total, outsourcing some
work to Romania and India and trimming support functions. It’s
part of a plan to cut almost 2,000 jobs in  Italy , Spain and
Germany this year. Vodafone is reducing costs across Europe as
an economic decline and high mobile penetration hurt sales of
phone service.  European carriers will probably cut the number of
telecommunications workers by 30 percent, or more than 300,000,
in the next five years, according to the UNI Europa ICTS union.  Vodafone rose 1.7 pence to 195.2 pence in London trading
today. The stock has gained 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
