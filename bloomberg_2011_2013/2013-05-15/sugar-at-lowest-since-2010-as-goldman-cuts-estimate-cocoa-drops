Sugar fell to the lowest level since
2010 in  New York  after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price
forecasts, citing improved weather in leading producer Brazil in
the second half of last month. Cocoa retreated.  Raw sugar will be 17.5 cents a pound on the ICE Futures
U.S. exchange in three and six months, the bank said in a report
e-mailed today. That’s down from a previous forecast of 18.5
cents. Sugar may fall to 15 cents to 16.5 cents, Omar al-Dahhan,
a senior trader at Louis Dreyfus Commodities, said at a
conference in Geneva on April 18. Kona Haque, an analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd., said at the same event it could decline to
as low as 16.5 cents by the third quarter.  Sugar production in  Brazil ’s center south, the main growing
region, surged to 1.45 million metric tons in the second half of
April from 393,200 tons a year earlier, according to data from
industry group Unica. Dry weather allowed harvesting to advance
after rains delayed the start of the season. Production for the
whole season will be a record 35.5 million tons, Unica said.  “While wet weather in April delayed the beginning of the
Brazilian center south harvest, the sugar cane crush is
expected” to be a record, Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin wrote in the report. “With weather improving in the
second half of April, we are lowering our three- and six-months
price forecast.”  Raw sugar for delivery in July fell as much as 0.5 percent
to 16.94 cents a pound on ICE, the lowest for a most-active
contract since July 2010. The price was down 0.1 percent at
17.01 cents a pound at 6:21 a.m. Futures trading volumes were 10
percent higher than the average for the past 100 days for this
time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. White, or
refined, sugar for delivery in August was down 0.3 percent to
$476.60 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Brazil Production  Sugar prices fell 13 percent in New York this year as
supplies are set to outpace demand. Record production in Brazil
will probably mean a third year of surplus in the 2013-14
season, Goldman Sachs said. The  International Sugar Organization 
estimates a surplus of 8.5 million tons in 2012-13.  Thailand , the second-biggest sugar shipper, rejected 20
bids to sell 72,000 tons of sugar at an auction today. All bids
were rejected as the premium buyers were willing to pay were
below expectations, Surat Thadachawasakul, general manager of
state-owned Thai Cane & Sugar Corp., said by phone today.  Cocoa for July delivery slid 0.6 percent to $2,339 a ton in
New York. Cocoa for delivery in July fell 0.6 percent to 1,558
pounds ($2,370) a ton in London.  Arabica coffee futures for July delivery were little
changed at $1.4405 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee futures for
July delivery gained 0.2 percent to $2,054 a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
