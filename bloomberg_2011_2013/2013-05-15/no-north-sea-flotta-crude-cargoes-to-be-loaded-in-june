No cargoes of North Sea Flotta crude
will be exported in June, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  This compares with one shipment of 650,000 barrels for May.  Talisman Sinopec Energy U.K. Ltd. operates the field.
Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
