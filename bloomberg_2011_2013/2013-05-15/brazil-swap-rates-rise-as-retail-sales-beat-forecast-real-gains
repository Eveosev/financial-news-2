Brazil ’s swap rates rose to a four-week high as retail sales increased more than analysts forecast,
spurring speculation the central bank will step up the pace of
increases in borrowing costs to contain inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 climbed two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.43 percent at 9:44
a.m. in Sao Paulo, the highest level on a closing basis since
April 17. The real gained 0.2 percent to 2.0169 per U.S. dollar.  Retail sales rose 4.5 percent in March from a year earlier
after a 0.3 percent drop in the prior month, the national
statistics agency reported. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 3.6 percent increase. Annual
inflation in Brazil has remained above the 4.5 percent midpoint
of the central bank’s target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent
since central bank President Alexandre Tombini took office in
January 2011.  “Inflation remains high and demand is not falling,”
Ronaldo Patah, the head of fixed income at Itau Asset Management
in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview. “Everything the
government has done has stimulated consumption.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
