Liquefied natural  gas prices  for
delivery to Northeast Asia were little changed this month amid
more supply and weak demand for short-term cargoes, according to
Energy Intelligence.  The value of spot cargoes for delivery during the next four
to eight weeks was unchanged at $14.30 per million British
thermal units from May 6, the research company said on the
website of its World Gas Intelligence publication. The price in
Southwest Europe was $11.55 per million Btu, down 20 cents from
last week, according to WGI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
