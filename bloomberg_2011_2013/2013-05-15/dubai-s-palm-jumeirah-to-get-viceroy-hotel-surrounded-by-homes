The Viceroy Hotel Group plans to open
its first Dubai property on the man-made island known as the
Palm Jumeirah in a $1 billion project that will include 250
serviced apartments.  The Viceroy Dubai Palm Jumeirah is due to open in 2017, the
 hotel operator  said in a statement today. About 96 percent of
the homes have been sold a week after they went on the market,
said Patrick Hayden, a sales consultant at Allsopp & Allsopp,
the broker for the properties. The hotel’s developer will be
Zaya Dubai and the owner is SKAI Holdings, according to
Viceroy’s statement.  The homebuyers paid a deposit of 10 percent, Hayden said,
and will be asked to pay the same again in about a month. The
developer is selling the furnished properties for an average of
2,200 dirhams ($599) a square foot.  The project will include a 400-room hotel on the beach
surrounded by homes on the trunk of the palm-tree-shaped island,
Hayden said. It will be located near the Fairmont hotel, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
