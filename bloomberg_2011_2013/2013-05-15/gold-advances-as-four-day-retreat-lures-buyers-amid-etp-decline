of major currencies. The euro fell to the lowest in almost six
weeks against the dollar as the euro-area’s recession extended

metal by 5.7 percent from a two-year low on April 16, gold is

do well in a deflationary environment,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The dollar has emerged
as the preferred flight-to-quality instrument, and lots of money
has also moved to equities.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell 2 percent to settle at

probably mean more price declines, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

high. India’s bullion imports may surge 47 percent to 225 tons
