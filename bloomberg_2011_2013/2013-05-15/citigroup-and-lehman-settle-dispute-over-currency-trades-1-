Citigroup Inc. (C)  can be granted a $1.2
billion claim against Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s defunct
brokerage and will pay an affiliate of the Lehman parent $167
million to settle a dispute over amounts owed on foreign-exchange transactions, a judge ruled.  The disputes arose from Citigroup’s role in clearing and
settling foreign exchange transactions for Lehman and its
affiliates before and during the week of Lehman’s September 2008
bankruptcy. Larger sums than those settled remain in dispute,
the parties said in the document, published in an order signed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan.  Overseen by a new board since its emergence from bankruptcy
in March 2012, Lehman is resolving disputes and cutting claims
to continue paying approved creditors. The brokerage, being
separately liquidated, is planning its first payment to its
former clients.  The dispute with Citigroup is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
