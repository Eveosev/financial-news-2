China’s stocks  swung between gains
and losses. Technology companies advanced, while energy and
material shares declined.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.1 percent to
2,215.98 at 9:43 a.m. local time. Trading volumes on the index
were 28 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The CSI 300 Index was little changed at
2,493.30. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 0.4
percent.  The Shanghai Composite has dropped 8.9 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 6 amid concern a slowing economy will curb
profit growth. The index  trades  at 9.6 times estimated earnings,
compared with the three-year average of 11.9 and the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s current multiple of 11, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  China’s stocks fell the most in three weeks yesterday after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its growth outlook for the nation’s
economy and concern grew the government is introducing
more property restrictions to limit gains in housing prices.  Bank of America Corp. reduced its estimate on  China ’s 2014
gross domestic product growth to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent,
citing sluggish external demand, economists led by Ting Lu wrote
in a note today. China won’t introduce any significant stimulus
measures and a rate cut in the near term is unlikely, according
to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
