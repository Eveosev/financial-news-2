The U.S. Senate will vote next week
on whether to advance Richard Cordray’s confirmation to lead the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  Cordray, the former Ohio attorney general who has run the
consumer bureau since January 2012, will face a vote from the
full Senate amid opposition from Republicans seeking changes to
the agency’s structure and funding. The Republicans, who hold 45
seats in the 100-member Senate, can deny Democrats the 60 votes
needed to set the stage for simple majority approval.  President  Barack Obama  nominated Cordray, 53, for a five-year term on Jan. 24, more than a year after installing him in
the position using a so-called recess appointment to sidestep
Republican opposition. The Senate Banking Committee approved
Cordray’s nomination on a party line vote of 12-10 on March 19.  More than 40 Republican senators have pledged to block a
floor vote on any nominee to run the consumer bureau until
Democrats agree to make changes including restructuring the
agency to be run by a commission rather than a director and
subjecting its budget to the congressional appropriations
process. Democrats including Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren
of  Massachusetts , who set up the agency while serving as an aide
to the president, have said the Republican effort is designed to
undermine the bureau, which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Republicans blocked Democrats’ push for a confirmation by
simple majority once before, on Dec. 8, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
