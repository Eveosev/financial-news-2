Treasuries  snapped  their longest
losing streak in two months on speculation the economy may be
slowing after reports showed manufacturing in the New York
region shrank this month and producer prices dropped the most in
three years in April.  The rally pulled yields on 10-year notes down from the
highest in two months, and followed four straight days of
declines in the price of the debt, which serves as a benchmark
for everything from corporate borrowing costs to mortgages. The
slump was the longest since it fell for six trading days ending
March 11.  “We got numbers that suggest the economy is not on as
strong a footing as we thought,” said  David Coard , head of
fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “Inflation is really not
a big deal.”  U.S. 10-year  yields  dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.94 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.75
percent security due in May 2023 gained 11/32, or $3.44 per
$1,000 face amount, to 98 10/32. Earlier yields climbed to 1.98
percent, the highest level since March 15.  Thirty-year bond yields declined four basis points to 3.16
percent, after touching a seven-week high yesterday. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks added 0.5 percent, after
reaching an all-time high.  Market Measure  The 14-day relative strength  index  for the 10-year note
reached 70.1. A value above 70 indicates the yield may be poised
to change direction. It was at 53 a week earlier.  Trading volume closed at $414.9 billion after reaching $451
billion on May 10, the highest level since Feb. 1, according to
ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government
debt. The average daily volume for this year is $283 billion.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index measuring price
swings in Treasuries rose to 58.28 basis points, the highest
level since March 27. It dropped May 9 to an all-time low of
48.87 basis points. The measure averaged 62.6 basis points
during the past 12 months.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index declined to minus 1.4 in May from 3.1 in April. Readings
less than zero signal contraction in New York, northern New
Jersey and southern  Connecticut . The median projection in a
Bloomberg survey called for an increase to 4.  Economic Data  Output at factories, mines and utilities fell a more-than-forecast 0.5 percent after a revised 0.3 percent gain in the
prior month that was weaker than previously reported, a report
from the Fed showed today in  Washington . The median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.2 percent decline.
Manufacturing, which makes up 75 percent of total production,
decreased 0.4 percent, the third drop in the last four months.  “Data reminds the market that the path to a recovery will
be a choppy one,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist
at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford , Connecticut. “It brings
into question the idea we would see 2 percent 10-year yields
this week.”  The producer price index dropped by 0.7 percent last month,
the biggest decrease since February 2010. It was forecast to
drop 0.6 percent in April, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before the report.  The yield gap between 10-year notes and Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities, called the 10-year break-even rate, was at
2.29 percentage points, close to the 2013 low of 2.24 percentage
points reached on May 9. It is down from this year’s high of 2.6
percentage points reached Feb. 4.  Central Banking  Central banks around the world have been buying bonds and
cutting interest rates in a bid to boost growth and stave off
the risk of deflation.  The Fed said after a policy meeting on May 1 it will keep
buying bonds as long as the outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed
2.5 percent and as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent.  The central bank is buying $85 billion of government and
mortgage debt a month to support the economy by holding
borrowing costs down. The Fed bought $916 million in notes
maturing between August 2023 and February 2031 today. Fed policy
makers meet on June 18-19.  Foreign holdings  of Treasuries rose to $5.76 trillion in
March, a 0.7 percent increase from the previous month, the
smallest since December. Foreign investors held 50.5 percent of
the $11.4 trillion in U.S. debt outstanding in March, the
smallest since December.  China’s Treasuries  China , the  largest foreign lender  to the U.S., decreased
its holdings in Treasuries in March by $1.4 billion or 0.1
percent to $1.25 trillion.  Japan , the second largest foreign
lender to the U.S., reduced its holdings of U.S. government debt
$0.5 billion to $1.105 trillion.  The Treasury is revising holdings data on a monthly basis
rather than annually based on the nationality of the beneficial
holder of the debt, while the initial data will still count the
location of the purchase.  Treasuries have dropped 1.1 percent this month as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
The debt has lost 0.3 percent this year after gaining 2.2
percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
