OAO MegaFon (MFON) , Russia’s second-largest
mobile operator by revenue, overtook bigger rival  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MBT)  by market value after pledging to pay $1.3 billion
in dividends and beating analysts’ earnings estimates.  MegaFon, controlled by Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov 
and part-owned by Sweden’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , rose 1 percent at
2:06 p.m. in  London , extending gains since its November initial
public offering to 69 percent. That valued the company at $20.9
billion, while MTS is worth $20.7 billion in  New York .  A focus on its network’s data speeds has allowed MegaFon to
outpace MTS in attracting Russians increasingly surfing the Web
and watching video on their wireless devices. Moscow-based
MegaFon boosted data revenue 23 percent in the first quarter,
expanding its profit margins.  “MegaFon has reported excellent first-quarter results,
which substantially beat expectations on profitability,”
Konstantin Chernyshev, an analyst at UralSib Capital, said today
in a note.  Investors will get 64.51 rubles ($2.05) per ordinary share
as a payout for 2012 and the first quarter of this year, MegaFon
said today. Net income rose to 12.6 billion rubles in the
quarter ending March 31 from 9.3 billion a year earlier. That
exceeded the average analyst estimate by 19 percent, Chernyshev
said.  Forecast Raised  Operating income before depreciation and amortization rose
27 percent to 32.4 billion rubles as the company cut subscriber-acquisition costs by switching its dealer compensation
arrangements to revenue-sharing. The margin on that measure of
profit expanded to 47.8 percent from 40.6 percent a year
earlier.  MegaFon raised its forecast for 2013 Oibda margin, saying
it will be as wide as 44 percent compared with a previous
projection for up to 43 percent, Chief Financial Officer Gevork Vermishyan told reporters today. MegaFon expects “high single-digit” revenue growth this year, it said in the statement.  MegaFon’s share price reflects enterprise value of 6.1
times 2013 forecast Oibda, while the ratio for MTS is 4.4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company cut net debt 16 percent during the quarter to
100.8 billion rubles. MegaFon registered a program to sell as
much as 60 billion rubles of bonds, though it doesn’t have
immediate plans to sell them, Vermishyan said on a conference
call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
