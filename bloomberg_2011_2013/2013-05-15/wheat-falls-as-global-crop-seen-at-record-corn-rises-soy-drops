Wheat futures fell for the first time
this week on speculation that global production will surge to a
record in the year that starts on June 1. Corn rallied and
soybeans declined.  The world will harvest 701.1 million metric tons of wheat
next year, the most-ever, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said in a report on May 10. Russian will expand output by 48
percent to 56 million tons, while Ukraine’s crop surges 40
percent, USDA data show. The agency predicts the U.S. will be
the biggest exporter next year, followed by  Canada ,  Russia ,
Australia and Ukraine. Prices are down 9.6 percent this year.  “If you look at most of the key growing regions, we’re
looking at a large wheat crop worldwide,” Jonathon Driedger, a
senior market analyst at FarmLink Marketing Solutions, said in a
telephone interview from Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 1.1 percent to $7.03 a
bushel at 10:33 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
slipped into a bear market in January and are down 26 percent
since reaching a four-year closing high on July 20.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to $6.545 a
bushel in Chicago. Soybean futures for delivery in July slid 0.1
percent to $14.1275 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
