Austria ’s economy stagnated in the
first quarter as manufacturers spent less on equipment and
export growth was muted, the government-backed Wifo economic
research institute said.  Gross investments by companies fell 0.5 percent in the
three months through March after a 0.3 percent decline in the
fourth quarter, the Vienna-based Wifo said today in an e-mailed
statement. Household consumption was unchanged. Compared with
the first quarter of last year, the economy shrank 0.6 percent
if adjusted for inflation, according to the institute.  Businesses exported 0.3 percent more in the period, a slight
acceleration from the previous quarter’s 0.2 percent expansion.
About a third of Austria’s exports go to northern neighbor
 Germany .  Government spending  accelerated, expanding by 0.5
percent in the three months, compared with 0.2 percent in the
three months to December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
