Iron ore  prices will remain strong
into 2014 on sustained demand in  China , the largest producer of
steel, and as an increase in global supply takes longer than
expected, according to Morgan Stanley.  While the price has averaged $135 a ton this quarter from
$148 in the first three months, that’s more than the bank’s
estimate of $130 for the April to June period, analysts Joel Crane and  Peter Richardson  wrote in a report dated yesterday.
The bank maintained its forecasts of $120 in the first quarter
of 2014 and $118 in the second.  Iron ore dropped 12 percent this year, nearing a bear
market, on signs that economic growth in China is slowing and on
expectations of increasing global supply led by  Australia , the
world’s biggest exporter. Morgan Stanley said April 23 that the
global seaborne market will shift into surplus from 2015, after
a run of deficits stretching back to at least 2005. Iron ore
will be well- supported  at more than $100 a ton this year on
sustained demand from China, CLSA Ltd. said May 9.  “It is increasingly clear that steel consumption in China
remains strong,” Morgan Stanley’s Melbourne-based analysts
wrote. “Our assessment of the global seaborne iron ore market
is that price strength could continue well into next year.”  Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin lost 1 percent to $128.10 a dry ton yesterday,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices dropped 19 percent from
$158.90 on Feb. 20, nearing the definition of a  bear market .  Excess Supply  “Market concerns over the sustainability of strong iron
ore prices are focused on the prospect of an excess of supply
coming to market in 2013 and 2014,” they said, referring to
expansions such as Rio Tinto Group’s Pilbara operations. “While
an increase in mine capacity is well understood in the market,
the timetable of ramp-up into that capacity is not.”  Inventory of steel reinforcement-bar, or rebar, in China
tracked by Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. fell to
8.95 million tons on May 10, the lowest since Feb. 8. China’s
iron ore  imports  rose 4 percent to 67.15 million tons in April
after climbing 14 percent in March, according to customs data.  Another major cycle of stockpiles drawdown is unlikely in
the second half of 2013 because inventory levels across the
value chain are too low, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a
report dated yesterday. The bank estimated stockpiles of iron
ore at Chinese ports at 69 million tons, down 29 percent from a
year earlier.  “Availability of material has remained tight amid low iron
ore stocks at the  ports , traders and  steel mills ,” the Morgan
Stanley report said. “On the demand side, we believe the
combination of a recent sharp drop from record-high steel
inventories and a high level of steel output in China suggest
strong iron ore consumption in the country.”  India ’s role as major supplier in the seaborne market is in
“terminal decline” after mining was suspended in the states of
Karnataka and Goa and exports were capped, the report said.  Iron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin, the iron ore moisture can account for 8
percent to 10 percent of the weight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
