Merck & Co. (MRK) , which yesterday had its
unsecured  debt rating  cut one level by Moody’s Investors
Service, plans to sell $6.5 billion of bonds in a six-part
offering to fund share repurchases.  The drugmaker intends to issue $1.25 billion of 30-year
notes that may pay 102 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $1.75 billion of 10-year bonds with a spread of
87 basis points, according to a person familiar with the
offering who asked not to be identified, citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  The deal also includes $1 billion portions of five-year
debt yielding an extra 52 basis points, similar-maturity notes
paying 36 basis points more than the London interbank offered
rate, three-year securities with a spread of 32 basis points
more than Treasuries and $500 million of similar-maturity
floating debt paying 19 more than Libor, the person said.  A “substantial portion” of the proceeds will fund share
repurchases that will reach about $7.5 billion over the next 12
months,  Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-based Merck said today in
a regulatory filing.  The company’s $1 billion of 2.4 percent bonds due September
2022 traded May 13 at 98.63 cents on the dollar to yield 2.57
percent, or 64.4 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  “Merck’s credit ratios will steadily weaken but remain
solid as the company executes a $15 billion share repurchase
program over the next several years,” Michael Levesque, an
analyst at Moody’s, wrote yesterday in a report that lowered
Merck’s debt that isn’t guaranteed by its Merck Sharp & Dohme
unit to A2 from A1.  Shares of Merck, which has a market value of more than $140
billion,  traded at  $46.89 at 1:53 p.m. in  New York .  Libor (US0003M) , the
rate at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other, was set at 0.274 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
