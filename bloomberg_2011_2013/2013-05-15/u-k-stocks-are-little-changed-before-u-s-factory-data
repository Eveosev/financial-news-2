U.K. stocks  were little changed,
after the benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index rose to the highest level in
5 1/2 years, as investors awaited a report on industrial
production in the world’s biggest economy.  Severn Trent Plc (SVT)  declined 1.3 percent after rejecting a
takeover offer.  Easyjet Plc (EZJ)  climbed 5.9 percent after saying it
expects an improvement in full-year profitability.  London Stock
Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  advanced 2.6 percent after reporting annual
profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The FTSE 100 lost 3.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,682.11
at 9:04 a.m. in London. The gauge rose yesterday to the highest
level since October 2007. It has  surged 13 percent  this year as
central banks maintained stimulus measures. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index was little changed today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index gained 0.5 percent.  In the U.S., a report at 9:15 a.m. in  Washington  may show
industrial production fell in April for the first time in three
months. Output at factories, mines and utilities decreased 0.2
percent, after gaining 0.4 percent in March, economists forecast
in a Bloomberg survey.  The German economy expanded less than forecast in the first
quarter and France’s slipped into recession, data showed today.
 Gross domestic product  in Europe’s largest economy rose 0.1
percent from the fourth quarter, when it fell a downwardly
revised 0.7 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said. Economists had forecast a 0.3 percent gain.  The French economy contracted 0.2 percent in the three
months through March after shrinking the same amount in the
final quarter of last year.  The number of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 was 5.4 percent greater than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
