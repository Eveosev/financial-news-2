Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  said it
expects to save more than $500 million in capital spending on
new jetliners through 2018 by pushing back delivery of some
Boeing Co. planes as it curbs growth in its fleet.  The world’s largest discount carrier will receive 23 jets
in 2018 instead of 40 under the previous schedule, and 25 in
2019 rather than a projected 33, according to a statement today.
The shift includes converting some orders for current Boeing
737-700s to the new 737-7 Max, Dallas-based Southwest said.  “Our restructured aircraft delivery schedule will reduce
our capital spending for firm orders through 2018 by more than
$500 million,” Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said in the
statement. He said Southwest’s all-Boeing fleet would be little
changed in 2013 and 2014 compared with 2010.  Ordering the 737-7 Max makes Southwest the first customer
for the smallest version of Boeing’s upgraded 737. That’s a
boost for Chicago-based Boeing, which had gone without a buyer
for the 737-7 variant since unveiling the Max program almost two
years ago to counter Airbus SAS’s A320neo model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
