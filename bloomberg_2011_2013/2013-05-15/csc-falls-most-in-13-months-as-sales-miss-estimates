Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) , a technology
consultant for governments and companies, fell the most since
2011 after reporting sales that missed analysts’ estimates.  The shares  tumbled  9.7 percent to $44.71 at the close in
New York, the most since Nov. 9, 2011. The  Falls Church ,
Virginia-based company has gained 12 percent this year, compared
with a 16 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Chief Executive Officer Mike Lawrie, more than one year
into the job, has been moving away from traditional
infrastructure sales and focusing on industry software and
services. He has said that revenue might suffer as the company
transforms itself. During the quarter the business-solutions
unit reported a 12 percent decline in sales after selling an
Australian IT staffing company and the North American public-sector unit posted a 6.8 percent drop.  “We are making significant investments in our business --
employees, offerings, systems, and partnerships -- designed to
enhance our competitive position and long-term earnings
growth,” Lawrie said in a statement today.  Fourth-quarter revenue for the period ended March 29 fell
7.3 percent to $3.7 billion. That trailed the $3.8 billion
analysts had estimated.  Earnings excluding a 24-cent gain on the sale of the
Australian business and other items was $1.27, compared with the
$1 analyst estimate. The company also said it now sees full-year
per share earnings of $3.30 to $3.50 a share, compared with a
February  forecast  of $3.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
