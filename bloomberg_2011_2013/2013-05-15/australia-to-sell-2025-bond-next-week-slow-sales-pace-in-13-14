Australia  will sell a new 2025 bond
next week and slow the pace of gross debt offerings in the
fiscal year starting July 1 as the government seeks to rein in
budget deficits.  Notes maturing April 21, 2025, will be offered through
syndication, the Australian Office of Financial Management said
today in an e-mailed statement. The funding arm said it expects
to sell about A$50 billion ($49.5 billion) in the coming fiscal
year. That compares with the A$53.6 billion of sales indicated
for the 12 months ending June 30 in the  federal budget  presented
by Treasurer Wayne Swan in Canberra yesterday.  The amount of outstanding  government bonds  maturing in a
year or more will rise to A$260 billion by June 30, 2014, from
an estimated A$233 billion a year earlier, the budget shows.  Julia Gillard , Australia’s first female prime minister,
trails in opinion polls with an election due Sept. 14, after a
blown pledge to return the budget to surplus and mining taxes
that failed to reap promised revenue. Swan forecast the deficit
will be A$19.4 billion this fiscal year, after projecting a
surplus in October forecasts, as revenue dropped A$16.6 billion
from previous estimates. The budget shortfall is projected to
shrink to A$18 billion in the 12 months ending June 30, 2014.  Next week’s sale of a new bond line will be managed by
Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG and Westpac Banking
Corp., the AOFM said in its statement. The funding arm expects
to sell A$700 million of bonds on most Wednesdays and Fridays
from the week starting May 27 until the end of the financial
year, it said.  Linker Sales  The AOFM will offer A$150 million to A$250 million of 2022
indexed notes this month and a similar amount of 2025 inflation-linked debt in June. The government will double sales of linkers
to A$4 billion in the coming fiscal year, increasing the amount
of such notes to A$22 billion.  That will swell the nation’s outstanding securities to at
least A$282 billion by June 30, 2014, 6 percent shy of the A$300
billion legal borrowing limit. Swan raised the limit on
borrowings this fiscal year from A$250 billion.  Australia’s sovereign debt market has more than quadrupled
since the end of 2008 as the government borrowed to fund
stimulus programs during the global financial crisis.  Yields Declined  Over that time, the nation’s benchmark 10-year bond yield
dropped to 3.30 percent as of 11:18 a.m. in Sydney from 3.99
percent on Dec. 31, 2008. It climbed to as high as 5.88 percent
in April 2010 and reached a record low 2.698 percent on June 4,
2012. The premium over similar-maturity U.S. notes was at 133
basis points, down 19 basis points this year.  Average yields at bond auctions fell to 3.23 percent in
2012, the lowest annual average in Australian Office of
Financial Management data going back to 1982. The average this
year is 3.29 percent, after the AOFM sold A$600 million of notes
maturing in 2027 at an average yield of 3.6289 percent at
auction today.  Net debt will peak at A$191.6 billion in 2014-15, or 11.4
percent of gross domestic product, up from A$161.6 billion, or
10.6 percent, in the current fiscal year, according to the
budget. U.S. net debt is expected to peak next year at 89.7
percent of GDP, when the average for advanced nations will be
79.1 percent, the  International Monetary Fund  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
