Chinese banks’ bad loans increased
for a sixth straight quarter, the longest deterioration streak
in at least nine years, as economic growth slowed.  Non-performing loans climbed by 33.6 billion  yuan  ($5.5
billion) in the three months ended March 31, to 526.5 billion
yuan, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said in a
 statement  on its website today. Soured debt rose across all
lender categories, including state-owned and regional banks.  China’s banking system is grappling with higher defaults
and slowing profit growth as regulators ease control over banks’
loan pricing and deposits to spur competition. Net interest
margin at the nation’s 3,800 lenders contracted to 2.57 percent
in the first quarter from 2.75 percent in preceding period, the
regulator said.  Economic growth has also moderated, with expansion at 7.7
percent in the first quarter, trailing the median forecast for 8
percent in a Bloomberg News survey and slower than the fourth-quarter expansion of 7.9 percent. The government in March set a
2013 economic growth goal of 7.5 percent, the same target as
last year.  The non-performing loans ratio for Chinese banks rose to
0.96 percent at the end of March from 0.95 percent at the end of
last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
