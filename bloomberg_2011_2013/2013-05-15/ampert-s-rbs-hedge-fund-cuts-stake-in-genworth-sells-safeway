Edward Lampert, the billionaire
chairman and chief executive officer of  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) ,
reported that he and his hedge fund cut a stake in  Genworth
Financial Inc. (GNW)  by almost a third and sold its holdings in  Big
Lots Inc. (BIG)  and grocer  Safeway Inc. (SWY)   RBS Partners LP reduced its stake in Genworth to 8.4
million shares as of March 31, according to a filing today with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, down from 12.1
million at the end of last year. The fund, based in Bay Harbor,
Florida, also sold its 1.4-million-share stake in Big Lots and
its 845,000-share stake in Safeway.  Lampert is trying to revive  sales  at the Sears and Kmart
chains, which have declined since he merged the brands eight
years ago. He’s pinned the success of the company on its shopper
rewards program, which now produces more than half of its
revenues. He took on the CEO role in February after Lou
D’Ambrosio stepped down after less than two years for a family
health matter.  As of March 31, RBS held 33.9 million Sears shares, valued
at about $1.7 billion. The fund also had about 9.1 million
shares of  Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores Inc. (SHOS) , which spun off
from Sears Holdings in October. That stake was valued at about
$367 million.  Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, rose 1.8 percent
to $58.17 at the close in New York. The shares have risen 41
percent this year, compared with 16 percent for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
