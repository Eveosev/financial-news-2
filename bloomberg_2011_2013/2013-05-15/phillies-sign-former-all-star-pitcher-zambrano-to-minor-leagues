The Philadelphia Phillies signed
former All-Star pitcher Carlos Zambrano to a minor-league
contract, one week after placing eight-time All-Star Roy Halladay on the disabled list.  Zambrano, a three-time All-Star with the  Chicago Cubs , will
report to Clearwater, Florida, for extended spring training, the
Phillies announced today on their Twitter account. He has not
pitched in a Major League Baseball game since last season with
the  Miami Marlins .  The 31-year-old right-hander, who averaged 15 wins a season
for the Cubs from 2003-2008, once got in a fight with a teammate
during a game, and was suspended for six games in 2009 for a
tantrum after disagreeing with an umpire’s call.  Zambrano was 7-10 in 2012 with a 4.49 ERA and 95 strikeouts
in 132 1/3 innings. He has 132 wins in his 12-year career.  Philadelphia is 19-21, 3 1/2 games behind the National
League East division-leading  Atlanta Braves . The Phillies have a
team ERA of 4.05, their highest in four seasons. Jonathan
Pettibone and Tyler Cloyd, two of the team’s five most recent
starters, are rookies who began the year in the minor leagues.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Rob Gloster  To contact the reporters on this story:
