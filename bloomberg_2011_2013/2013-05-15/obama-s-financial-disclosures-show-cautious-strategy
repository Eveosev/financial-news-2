President  Barack Obama  and first lady
Michelle Obama held total assets between $1.9 million and $6.9
million last year, with as much as $515,000 of it in JPMorgan
Chase & Co checking accounts.  The disclosure shows their wealth invested in a financially
and politically cautious portfolio, concentrated in U.S.
Treasury debt, with other assets in bank deposits and index
funds.  The Obamas hold between $1 million and $5 million in
Treasury notes and between $10,000 and $251,000 in Treasury
bills. Treasury notes have maturities of between one and 10
years; Treasury bills have maturities of one year or less.  The Obamas’ assets, and those of Vice President Joe Biden
and his wife,  Jill Biden , were disclosed in ethics forms
released today that cover the period ending Dec. 31. The
disclosures, required of all senior executive branch officials
and members of Congress, list assets and income in value ranges
rather than specific amounts, making year-to-year comparisons
difficult.  Last year, the Obamas disclosed assets valued between $2.6
million and $8.3 million. The form indicated no sale or purchase
of assets during the past year.  Mortgage Debt  Despite the president’s frequent public comments on the
benefits of declining mortgage rates for homeowners, the Obamas
have not taken advantage of lower rates. The Obamas still hold a
30-year mortgage on their Chicago home that they obtained in
2005, with a balance between $500,000 and $1 million and an
interest rate of 5.625 percent. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 3.67 percent during 2012, according to
Bankrate.com.  The Obamas already have set aside money for college costs
for their two daughters, Malia, 14 and Sasha, 11. They reported
having between $200,000 and $400,000 in tax-advantaged 529
college savings accounts.  In addition to the two JP Morgan checking accounts, a joint
asset management account with between $250,000 and $500,000, and
a checking account in the first lady’s name with between $1,000
and $15,000, they also have a joint checking account with
Northern Trust Co., also with no more than $15,000.  The couple listed three retirement accounts invested in the
 Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX)  in addition to Obama’s pension from the
Illinois state legislature. Their mortgage is the only debt they
listed.  The Bidens reported assets of between $239,000 and
$867,000, not including the value of their residence.  The Bidens reported debts between $740,000 and $1.6
million, including a mortgage and home equity loans totaling
between $700,000 and $1.5 million. Other debts include a loan
taken against the cash value of life insurance policies with a
balance between $15,000 and $50,000 and a line of credit for an
unnamed son that Biden co-signed, also listed at between $15,000
and $50,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
