Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , pumped less crude in the
first four months as production continued to decline from the
country’s largest deposit led by  BP Plc. (BP/)   The Caspian Sea nation produced 14.3 million metric tons of
oil in January through April, a decline of 3.4 percent from a
year earlier, according to  data  published today on the website
of the State Statistics Committee, based in Baku, the capital.
Production of natural gas fell 1.7 percent to 5.9 billion cubic
meters, the data show.  The offshore Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field, known as ACG, cut
production 8.4 percent in the first quarter to 8.06 million tons
(662,000 barrels a day), BP said on May 7. ACG, where partners
include State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar,  Statoil ASA (STL) ,
Exxon Mobil Corp., and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , produced 32.9 million tons
of oil last year, or 77 percent of the country’s total output.  Azerbaijan increased production of marketable natural gas
5.4 percent to 17.2 billion cubic meters last year. The country
exports the fuel to Russia, Georgia and Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
