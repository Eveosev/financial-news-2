The forint strengthened the most in a
week after  Hungary ’s economy recorded its first quarterly growth
in more than a  year , beating estimates.  The currency had the biggest advance among 31 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the statistics office in
Budapest said gross domestic product expanded 0.7 percent
compared with the last three months of 2012. That exceeded the
0.1 percent median estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg
survey and was the first quarter of growth since the end of
2011.  The forint appreciated 0.7 percent to 292.10 per euro by
10:44 a.m. in Budapest, within 1 forint of the strongest since
February. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
slid 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 5.047
percent. Today’s figures signaled the economy exited recession,
the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement.  The GDP data helped the forint strengthen beyond the 293
level against the euro, Imre Kerekgyarto and Karoly Bamli,
Budapest-based traders at Commerzbank AG, wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  sacrificed growth in 2012 to
reduce the budget gap and remove the threat of cuts in European
Union funding less than a year before parliamentary elections.
The government boosted revenue from  Europe ’s highest bank levy
and taxes on energy, retail and telecommunication industries,
which damaged lending and investments.  The nation’s economy shrank 0.9 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, less than the 1.4 percent
contraction that was the median estimate of 19 economists on
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
