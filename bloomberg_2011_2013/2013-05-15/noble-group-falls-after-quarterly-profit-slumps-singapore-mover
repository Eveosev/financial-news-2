Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) , Asia’s largest
publicly traded commodity trader by sales, dropped by the most
in six months in Singapore after reporting a 62 percent slump in
first-quarter profit.  Noble fell 4.5 percent to S$1.065 as of 10:41 a.m. local
time, the biggest decline since Nov. 14, after saying yesterday
earnings were dragged down by a loss at its agricultural unit.
The stock’s decline compared with the 0.2 percent gain in the
benchmark Straits Times index.  The Hong Kong-based company said yesterday net income was
$41.3 million in the three months ended March 31, down from
$110.1 million a year earlier. The results were weighed down by
a $66.6 million operating loss at its agricultural unit, Noble
said yesterday.  “Problems in its agricultural segment persist,” James Koh, an analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore ,
said in a note today. “While we expect this segment to improve
as the year goes on, earnings expectations now look too
optimistic and structural issues of low sugar prices will
continue to hurt.”  He cut his  recommendation  for the stock from to hold from
buy.  “Noble continues to build out its sugar milling capacity
in line with earlier guidance, while we expect our agricultural
segment to gain momentum as we move into the main harvest
periods,” Chief Executive Officer Yusuf Alireza said in a
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
