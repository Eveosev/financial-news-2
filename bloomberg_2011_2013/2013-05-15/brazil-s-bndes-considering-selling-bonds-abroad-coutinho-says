Brazil’s state development bank,
known as BNDES, is considering selling bonds abroad for the
first time since 2011 to help finance its international lending
program, President  Luciano Coutinho  said.  The Rio de Janeiro-based bank will make a decision on its
sale plans this month, Coutinho said in an interview at
Bloomberg headquarters in New York yesterday.  The lender is studying tapping international  capital
markets  after Petroleo Brasileiro SA, also controlled by
Brazil’s government, sold $11 billion of bonds earlier this
week, a record for an emerging-market company. Yields on BNDES’s
$1 billion of 5.5 percent securities due 2020 have fallen to
3.24 percent after reaching a nine-month high of 3.5 percent
last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are considering it because we need extra funding for
some projects that may take foreign exchange,” Coutinho said.  BNDES, founded six decades ago to finance Brazilian
industry and infrastructure, disbursed 156 billion reais in
loans last year, twice as much as the  World Bank . The total
credit portfolio of the bank expanded to 492 billion reais ($243
billion) in 2012. The bank has 716 billion reais in total
assets.  Emerging market  corporate bond yields  have fallen an
average 0.07 percentage point since the end of March to 4.87
percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co. index data show. BNDES last sold
debt abroad in June 2011, when it issued 200 million Swiss
francs ($207 million) of senior unsecured bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
