George Soros’s Soros Fund Management
LLC added to its stake in  Google Inc. (GOOG)  in the first quarter while
cutting its holding of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   The fund added 148,531 shares of Google in the quarter,
bringing its total to 337,271 shares, according to a filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
firm’s stake in the Mountain View, California-based company was
valued at $267.9 million at the end of March.  The firm, a family office for the billionaire, sold its
position in  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , valued at $113 million at the
end of last year, according to the filing with the SEC.  Soros Fund Management reduced its stake in Apple by 157,176
shares to 26,800 shares valued at $11.9 million, according to
the filing. Apple declined 17 percent in the first three months
of the year, even as U.S. stocks added 10 percent, on signs that
sales growth for the iPhone is slowing.  Soros also cut its holding in American International Group
Inc. by two-thirds in the quarter amid a share rally. The firm
still owns 2.89 million shares of the company, worth $112
million at the end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
