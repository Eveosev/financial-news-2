Ryland Group Inc. (RYL)  sold $250 million
of debt in the third U.S. convertible note offering from a
homebuilder this year.  Ryland, which builds homes in cities from Baltimore to  Las
Vegas , issued 0.25 percent convertible securities that can be
swapped for shares at $75.01 each before June 2019, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock closed yesterday at
$50.01, its highest price since February 2007.  The offering will be used for general corporate purposes,
including land and other acquisitions, according to a regulatory
filing yesterday. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells
Fargo & Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc managed the offering,
the filing said.  The last homebuilder to sell convertible debt was Columbus,
Ohio-based M/I Homes Inc., which in March offered $86.3 million
of 3 percent, five-year notes that can be swapped for shares at
$32.31 each, Bloomberg data show. KB Home sold $230 million of
the securities in January.  Low mortgage rates, a strengthening job market and limited
inventories are contributing to the recovery in the housing
market. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
 index  of builder confidence rose to 44 from a revised 41 in
April, the Washington-based group reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
