(Corrects headline, first paragraph to remove reference to
bid failing.)  Diageo Plc (DGE)  fell short of gaining a
majority holding in  United Spirits Ltd. (UNSP)  after an open bid for as
much as 26 percent of the Indian distiller’s stock attracted
submissions from investors owning a combined 0.4 percent stake.  Diageo, which was seeking almost 37.8 million shares in
Bangalore-based United Spirits, won valid acceptances from
owners of 58,668 shares, the companies said today in a stock
exchange filing. London-based Diageo, the world’s largest
distiller, was targeting a 53.4 percent total stake in United
Spirits after agreeing to buy 27.4 percent from Indian tycoon
Vijay Mallya and some other investors.  The bid, which began April 10 and closed April 26, had been
expected to attract little interest, investors said at the time,
as Diageo had offered to buy shares at 1,440 rupees each. United
Spirits was trading at 25 percent above the bid price at the
start of the offer, and now  costs  60 percent more at about 2,300
rupees in Mumbai trading today.  Even with the low acceptance rate by investors holding
freely traded stock, Diageo’s takeover agreement with the
largest United Spirits shareholders “give us effective control
at a minimum 25.1 percent share ownership,” Rowan Pearman, a
spokeswoman for the U.K. company, said today in an e-mail. The
purchase of stock from Mallya and partners, as well as from a
preferential share allotment, has yet to be completed.  Stock Declines  Diageo  fell  as much as 1.4 percent to 2,039 pence, receding
from a six-week high reached yesterday, and traded down 1
percent at 11:23 a.m. in  London . The stock has gained 15 percent
this year, valuing the distiller at 51.4 billion pounds ($78.3
billion).  The U.K. company is seeking to expand in  India , the world’s
largest whiskey market, through an acquisition of the country’s
biggest distiller to take advantage of booming demand for
alcohol as consumers earn and spend more. Diageo’s assets
include Johnnie Walker whisky. Local brands owned by United
Spirits include Bagpiper and McDowell’s.  Diageo paid 84.5 million rupees ($1.54 million) to
shareholders in the open offer. A total 64,169 shares were
tendered, but some stock was rejected because of signature
mismatches and other technical issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
