Quebec  Environment Minister Yves-Francois Blanchet introduced legislation that would ban
hydraulic fracturing, drilling and testing for natural gas in
the St. Lawrence River valley for as long as five years.  The moratorium will be in place until a new law governing
the exploration and production of hydrocarbons takes effect, or
for a maximum of five years, according to a copy of the bill
posted today on the government’s  website . The bill would suspend
all existing licenses to drill for shale gas without
compensation, according to the document.  Quebec’s Parti Quebecois government holds a minority of
seats in the provincial legislature, meaning it needs support
from at least one of the two largest opposition parties to pass
laws.  Francois Legault, head of Coalition Avenir Quebec, the
province’s second-largest opposition party, told reporters today
in televised comments that the proposed legislation is
“unacceptable.” Liberal Party leader Philippe Couillard also
opposes a moratorium, Radio-Canada reported.  Natural Resources Minister Martine Ouellet ruled out all
shale gas exploration and production after the Parti Quebecois
won the Sept. 4 election, saying the technology is unsafe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
