Manchester United defender  Rio Ferdinand  retired from international soccer after 81 appearances
for  England  in a 14-year career with the national team.  Ferdinand, 34, said in a statement on the Football
Association’s website that he’s quitting to concentrate on his
club career and make way for younger players. He made his
England debut in 1997 and played at three World Cups.  “The team looks in great shape and there is an influx of
young, talented players coming through the ranks which bodes
well for the future,” Ferdinand said in the statement.  Ferdinand, who helped United win a record-extending 20th
English league championship this season, last played for the
national team in June 2011 against Switzerland.  “I appreciated the call from Rio to inform me of his
decision, which clearly he had spent much time considering
before reaching this point,” England manager  Roy Hodgson  said
in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
