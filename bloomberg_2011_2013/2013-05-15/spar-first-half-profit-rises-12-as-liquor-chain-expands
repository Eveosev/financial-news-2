Spar Group Ltd. (SPP) , a South African food
and liquor retailer, said first-half profit climbed 12 percent
as higher prices countered slower  consumer spending .  Net income in the six months through March rose to 589.2
million rand ($64 million) from 523.8 million rand a year
earlier, the Pinetown-based company said in statement today.
Sales increased 9.5 percent to 24 billion rand. The company
declared an interim dividend of 1.79 rand a share, 16 percent
more than a year earlier.  Tops, Spar’s liquor unit, “continued to be the stand-out
performer,” the company said. Spar added 25 Tops stores to
bring the chain’s total to 561 outlets.  The central bank has kept the  benchmark repurchase rate  at
5 percent since a surprise cut in July, concerned that a weaker
rand and rising gasoline prices will push inflation above its 3
percent to 6 percent target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
