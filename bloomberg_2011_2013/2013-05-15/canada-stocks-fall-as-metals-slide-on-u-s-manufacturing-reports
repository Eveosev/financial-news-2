Canadian  stocks  fell as banks and
raw-material shares slumped after the price of gold dropped
below $1,400 on disappointing U.S. manufacturing data.  Detour Gold Corp. and Dundee Precious Metals Inc. slumped
at least 8.5 percent as gold extended the longest losing streak
in almost three months. First Majestic Silver Corp. and
Endeavour Silver Corp. dropped more than 7.4 percent as the
price of silver fell.  Aurizon Mines (ARZ)  Ltd. retreated 2.3 percent
after reporting an unexpected loss and decreasing production.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 103.40
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,473.65 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark equity gauge trimmed its gain for the year to 0.3
percent. Trading volume was 13 percent lower than the 30-day
average.  “It’s another day where the bears are having their way,”
 John Kinsey , a  fund manager  with Caldwell Securities Ltd., said
from Toronto. He helps manage about C$1 billion at the firm.
“There are a lot of numbers this week and it’s a bit of a
roller coaster ride. Earlier in the year the economy seemed to
have been gaining traction but lately numbers have been soft.
That’s discouraging.”  U.S. industrial production declined in April by the most in
eight months, reflecting broad-based cutbacks in U.S.
manufacturing that show factories will provide little support
for the economy. New York area manufacturing unexpectedly
contracted in May, according to a separate report.  Metals Slump  The  S&P GSCI Index (SPGSCI) , which tracks prices for a basket of
commodities including metals, crude and grain, fell 0.1 percent
for a fourth day of losses, the longest losing streak in a
month.  Iron ore  slumped, pushing the price down 20 percent since
Feb. 20, meeting the common definition of a  bear market .  Raw-materials producers fell 2.7 percent as a group as all
10 industries retreated. The S&P/TSX Gold Index retreated 5
percent as all 30 members in the group declined.  Detour Gold Corp. (DGC)  slumped 8.5 percent to C$9.85 and Dundee
Precious Metals Inc. tumbled 15 percent to C$4.36 as gold for
June delivery plunged 2 percent to settle at $1,396.20 for a
three-week low. The price of gold has retreated for five days,
the longest since Feb. 20.  Aurizon Mines dropped 2.3 percent to C$3.89 after reporting
a first-quarter loss of 2 Canadian cents a share. Analysts had
expected a profit of 1 cent a share. First-quarter production at
the company’s Casa Berardi mine in Quebec fell to 24,444 ounces
from 33,488 ounces a year ago due to major shutdowns to
incorporate a deeper mine shaft, the company said in a
statement.  Silver Drops  First Majestic Silver plunged 9 percent to C$10.42 and
Endeavour Silver retreated 7.4 percent to C$4.13. Silver for
July delivery tumbled 3.1 percent to settle at $22.658 an ounce
in New York, its biggest decline since May 1.  Manulife Financial Corp. dropped 1.5 percent to C$15.75 and
Royal Bank of Canada lost 1 percent to C$60.94 to pace declines
among financial stocks. The S&P/TSX Financials Index retreated
0.7 percent, the lowest in two weeks.  BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd., lost
1.7 percent to C$15.26.  Pierre Ferragu , equity analyst with
 Sanford Bernstein , lowered his rating for the stock to market
perform, the equivalent of a hold, from outperform, the
equivalent of a buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
