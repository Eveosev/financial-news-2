North Dakota ’s Bakken, one of the
shale formations boosting U.S. oil production to 20-year highs,
saw output rise to a record in March.  Crude production increased 0.5 percent to 718,791 barrels a
day, the North Dakota Industrial Commission said today. It grew
6.1 percent in February from the previous month to 715,037
barrels a day.  Increased output from the Bakken, the Eagle Ford formation
in southern  Texas  and the Permian Basin in western Texas helped
 U.S. oil production  reach 7.37 million barrels a day in the week
ended May 3, the most since February 1992, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration. The figure slipped by 48,000
barrels a day to 7.32 million last week.  Bakken oil  priced on the  spot market  in in Clearbrook,
 Minnesota , strengthened by 25 cents yesterday to $3.25 a barrel
below West Texas Intermediate crude in Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total crude production in North Dakota rose to 782,812
barrels a day in March, a record based on the preliminary
number.  North Dakota’s rig count as of today is 191, up from 186 in
March and April, Lynn Helms, director of North Dakota’s Mineral
Resources Department, said in a monthly report.  “Operators are gradually picking up the pace as summer
weather begins while continuing to push higher efficiency and
cost-cutting measures,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
