Tropical Storm Alvin, the first of
the eastern Pacific season, developed off the southwestern coast
of  Mexico , the U.S.  National Hurricane Center  said.  The storm, with sustained winds of 40 miles (64 kilometers)
per hour, was 665 miles south-southwest of  Acapulco , Mexico, and
moving west-northwest at 13 mph, according to an advisory issued
at about 2 p.m. West Coast time. The storm will probably drift
further into the Pacific, according to the center’s track
projection.  “Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48
hours and Alvin could become a hurricane in a couple of days,”
the Miami-based center said.  Today marked the start of the eastern Pacific season, which
usually produces 15 tropical storms. Eight of those systems
normally become hurricanes, four of them major storms with winds
of 111 mph or more, according to the center.  The six-month  Atlantic hurricane season  begins June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
