European Union regulators opened an
in-depth probe into whether Spanish subsidies for a unit of  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  break the bloc’s competition rules.  The European Commission said the support for a project in
the Valencia region “might exceed” limits on use of public
money to boost production capacity in declining markets.  “We firmly believe that our state aid request for the Ford
Transit Connect is line with EU law,” Adrian Schmitz, a
spokesman for Ford of  Europe , said in e-mail. “We will work
with the Spanish government and the EU Commission to clarify the
situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
