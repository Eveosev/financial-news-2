Scott Cohen won’t return as assistant
general manager of the  New York  Jets, John Idzik’s most
significant change to the National Football League team’s front
office since taking over in January.  Cohen, whose contract wasn’t renewed, spent the past five
seasons with the Jets, assisting former general manager Mike Tannenbaum on the day-to-day operations of the team with a
primary focus on player personnel.  After Tannenbaum was fired, Cohen interviewed for the
vacancy before Idzik was hired by owner Woody Johnson. Cohen has
evaluated and scouted players in the NFL for 20 seasons, working
with the Philadelphia Eagles, Jacksonville Jaguars and
Washington Redskins before joining the Jets.  Cohen’s departure comes just over a week after JoJo Wooden
left as the Jets’ assistant director of player personnel to take
a similar front-office job with the San Diego Chargers. The Jets
also recently opted not to retain two scouts, including
assistant director of college scouting Marc Davis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
