RP Martin Holdings Ltd. suspended its
chief executive officer and a senior director almost six months
after two employees were arrested as part of the probe into
Libor, two people with knowledge of the matter said  CEO David Caplin, 52, commonly known as “Mustard,”
according to the U.K’s Financial Services Register, and Alan Farnan, a director at the firm, have been placed on leave, said
the people who asked not to be identified. They declined to give
details of what triggered the suspensions.  Calls to Caplin’s home telephone number weren’t answered,
while Farnan, 50, couldn’t be reached through directory
assistance. Officials at the London-based interdealer broker
declined to comment.  Two brokers who worked at RP Martin were arrested in
December by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office as regulators probed
allegations that firms rigged the London interbank offered rate,
the benchmark for more than $300 trillion of securities
worldwide. Interdealer brokers like RP Martin line up buyers and
sellers of securities for banks in exchange for a fee.  Employees at RP Martin and ICAP Plc, the world’s biggest
interdealer broker, passed on requests from derivatives traders
asking rate-setters at others banks to make favorable
submissions, e-mails released as part of the global probe of
interest rate-rigging show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
