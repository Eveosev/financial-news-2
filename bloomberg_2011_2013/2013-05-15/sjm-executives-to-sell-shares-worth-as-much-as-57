Two senior executives of  SJM Holdings
Ltd. (880) , Asia’s biggest casino company by revenue, are seeking to
raise as much as HK$440 million ($57 million) in a share sale
after the stock surged to a record.  Chief Executive Officer Ambrose So and Chief Operating
Officer Ng Chi Sing are offering 20 million shares at HK$21.50
to HK$22 each, a discount of 2.2 percent to 4.4 percent to
yesterday’s close, terms for the deal show.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  is
joint book runner, according to the term sheet.  SJM surged 4.9 percent yesterday to close at HK$22.50, the
 highest level  since the 2008 initial public offering, after
receiving the Macau government’s final approval to develop its
first casino in the Chinese city’s Cotai area, the Asian
equivalent of the  Las Vegas Strip .  The casino company got official approval for a resort on
the 70,468-square-meter site, according to a gazette published
by the Macau government yesterday. It has agreed to pay the
government 2.15 billion patacas ($269 million).  SJM, which currently runs 20 out of 35 casinos in Macau and
has none on the Cotai strip, first won preliminary approval for
the land grant in October. It has said it plans to develop as
much as 521,435 square meters of total floor area on the site,
including a five-star hotel and a casino resort. Macau is
granting the land on a renewable 25-year lease, according to
yesterday’s gazette.  SJM has informed Macau that it intends to build and operate
a gambling resort containing about 700 gaming tables, 1,000  slot
machines  and about 2,000 hotel rooms on the land, the company
said in a stock exchange statement yesterday.  SJM is the last company among Macau’s six casino operators
to receive an approval to develop a casino resort in the Cotai
area.  MGM China (2282) ’s $2.6 billion Cotai resort broke ground in
February and is set to open by mid-2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
