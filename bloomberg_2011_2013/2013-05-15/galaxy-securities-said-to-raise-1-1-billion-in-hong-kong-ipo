China  Galaxy Securities Co., a
brokerage controlled by the country’s sovereign wealth fund,
raised about $1.1 billion in an initial public offering in Hong
Kong, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The company, based in Beijing, sold 1.57 billion shares at
HK$5.30 apiece, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. The final price values
Galaxy Securities at about 1.3 times estimated end-2013 book
value, one of the people said.  The value of IPOs in Hong Kong is recovering from a four-year low in the first quarter, when companies raised $1.1
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Sinopec Engineering
Group Co.  is scheduled to price an IPO tomorrow that may raise
as much as $1.9 billion.  Shares of Galaxy Securities were originally offered at
HK$4.99 to HK$6.77 apiece, according to the IPO prospectus. The
company yesterday narrowed the offering range to HK$5.28 to
HK$5.43 a share, people with knowledge of the matter said. The
company plans to start trading on May 22.  Citic Securities Co. (6030) , China’s biggest publicly listed
brokerage, trades at 1.68 times estimated 2013 book value in
Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Haitong

share sale in April last year, carries a multiple of 1.32, the
data show.  An external spokeswoman for Galaxy Securities declined to
comment on the final price.  Sinopec Engineering, a unit of China’s biggest refiner,
narrowed the price range for its IPO to HK$10.50 to HK$11.00 a
share, two people with knowledge of the matter said today. The
company had sought as much as $2.2 billion in the sale,
according to a prospectus for the offering.  Galaxy Securities hired 21 investment banks for its share
sale, a record for a Hong Kong IPO, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Founded in January 2007, Galaxy Securities is
controlled by Central Huijin Investment Ltd., a unit of China
Investment Corp., according to the brokerage’s  website .  Cornerstone investors for Galaxy Securities include insurer
 AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  with an investment of $50 million and Khazanah
