     May 15 (Bloomberg) --  U.K. unemployment  rose in the first
quarter and the number of people in work fell the most in 1 1/2
years as the pressure on wages intensified, adding to signs that
the labor market is slowing.  Joblessness as measured by International Labour
Organisation methods rose 15,000 in the three months through
March to 2.52 million, a rate of 7.8 percent, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in London. Employment fell by
43,000. Average earnings grew 0.4 percent, the least since 2009.  While  the economy  returned to growth in the first quarter,
the recovery may be restrained by the government’s fiscal
squeeze and weak demand in the  euro area . The labor market,
which proved resilient during the financial crisis, may be slow
to pick up as companies meet demand from existing workers. The
 Bank of England  is due to publish new growth forecasts today.  “What you are seeing is a slight deterioration in the
employment data,” saidRoss Walker, chief U.K. economist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “It’s not
collapsing, but the underlying picture is weak.”  The pound stayed higher after the data and was trading at
$1.5227 as of 10:04 a.m. in  London , up 0.1 percent on the day.  Bonus Delays  A narrower measure of unemployment,  jobless claims , fell
7,300 in April from March to 1.52 million, taking the rate to
4.5 percent, the least since April 2011. In March, claims
dropped 9,900 instead of the 7,000 previously estimated. The ILO
jobless rate of 7.8 percent compared with 7.9 percent in the
three months through February. The number of unemployed has
posted an increase for three consecutive quarters.  Underlining the pressure on household incomes, pay growth
slowed to 0.4 percent in the first quarter, the least since
September to November 2009, from 1 percent between December and
February. In March alone, earnings fell 0.7 percent, the first
monthly decline for four years.  Some of the slowdown is explained by delays to bonus
payments as highly paid workers sought to take advantage of a
cut in the top income-tax rate to 45 percent from 50 percent
that took effect in April. Basic pay growth slowed to 0.8
percent from 1 percent.  Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  will present the
central bank’s quarterly Inflation Report, incorporating new
projections for the economy, at a press conference at 10:30 a.m.  The challenges facing the British economy were underlined
by separate statistics published today. The German economy
expanded less than forecast in the first quarter and  France 
slipped into recession.  IMF Forecasts  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecasts for the
U.K. economy last month and said the government and the central
bank should consider increasing stimulus to boost the recovery.  The IMF sees gross domestic product rising 0.7 percent this
year before expanding 1.5 percent in 2014, according to its
World Economic Outlook. It previously projected growth of 1
percent and 1.8 percent.  The fall in employment in the first quarter, the largest
since July-September 2011, was driven by a 53,000 decline in
part-time work with the number of people working full time
rising 10,000, today’s report showed. Youth unemployment fell,
while there was an increase in those out of work for more than a
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
