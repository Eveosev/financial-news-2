President Jeffrey Lacker said additional stimulus won’t
necessarily spur economic growth while increasing the challenges
for the Fed when it begins to withdraw the record accommodation.  “The Fed seems to be unable to improve real growth,
despite striving mightily over the last few years,” Lacker said
today in comments prepared for delivery at the Richmond Fed’s
Baltimore office, repeating a May 3 speech.     “Further increases
in the size of our  balance sheet  raise the risks associated with
the ‘exit process’ when it’s time to withdraw stimulus.”  Lacker, who doesn’t vote this year on the Federal Open
Market Committee, has criticized the committee’s decision to
press on with monthly purchases of $40 billion a month in
mortgage securities and $45 billion of Treasuries that have
expanded the Fed balance sheet to a record  $3.32 trillion .  The FOMC said May 1 that it may accelerate or slow bond
buying in response to changes in the labor market and inflation.
It left unchanged its plan to hold the main interest rate near
zero as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and the
outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
