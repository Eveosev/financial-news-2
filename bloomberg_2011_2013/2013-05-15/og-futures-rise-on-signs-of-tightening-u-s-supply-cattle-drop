Hog futures rose to the highest in
almost two weeks on signs of shrinking U.S. supplies of animals
and increasing demand for pork. Cattle prices dropped.  Wholesale- pork  prices are up 18 percent since the end of
March after yesterday reaching 90.91 cents a pound, the highest
since Aug. 20, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. There
were fewer so-called farrowings, or litters produced, last fall,
which means there are fewer hogs ready for slaughter at this
time of year, said Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services
in Waucoma,  Iowa .  “You’ve got less hogs coming to market,” Arens said in a
telephone interview. “You’re finally into that marketing hole
where there aren’t as many hogs available.”  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.2 percent to 92.775
cents a pound at 9:56 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after touching 93.025 cents, the highest for the most-active
contract since May 2.  Cattle futures for August delivery were down 0.1 percent at
$1.2025 a pound in  Chicago .  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.5
percent to $1.457 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
