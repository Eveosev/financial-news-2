Jerome Booth  has retired as head of
research at Ashmore Group, the emerging-market fund that
oversees $77.7 billion.  Jan Dehn, former co-head of research at London-based
Ashmore, said today in an e-mail message that he is replacing
Booth as head of research and spokesman.  Booth was part of the group of ANZ Investment Bank managers
that started Ashmore in 1999, buying ANZ’s stake in an emerging-market fund with $500 million in assets. He sits on the board of
Anglia Ruskin University in the U.K.  “Jerome feels it is the right time to devote more time to
other interests, both charitable and personal,” Dehn said.  Efforts to contact Booth for comment were unsuccessful.  LatinFinance reported Dehn’s appointment earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
