Hapag-Lloyd AG, Europe’s fourth-largest container-shipping line, said its first-quarter loss
almost halved as freight rates rose slightly and it reiterated
its forecast of a 2013 operating profit.  The adjusted loss before interest and tax was 53.2 million
euros ($68.8 million), compared with 99.5 million euros a year
earlier, the Hamburg-based company said in a statement today.
The average freight rate increased 4.2 percent to $1,546 per
standard container, or TEU, in the quarter.  “Liner shipping started 2013 on a higher level than in
2012,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Behrendt said in the
statement. The first quarter is traditionally the weakest of the
year for the liner shipping sector, the company said. “The
competition remains extremely challenging.”  The world’s biggest container lines, including A.P.
Moeller-Maersk A/S’s Maersk Line and Hapag-Lloyd, are struggling
as the euro region’s debt crisis saps demand for seaborne goods
and an overcapacity of ships has weighed on rates.  Revenue rose 3.1 percent to 1.65 billion euros on the back
of a small rise in transport volumes to about 1.33 million TEU.  Freight rates have come under “tangible” pressure since
April, especially on the important east-west routes, Behrendt
said. “It is important that rates soon return to a sensible,
profitable level.”.  Hapag-Lloyd said it’s “striving” for a profit at the
level of adjusted earnings before interest and taxes this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
