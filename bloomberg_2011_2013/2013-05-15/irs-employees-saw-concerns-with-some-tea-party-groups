The  Internal Revenue Service  said it
started using “tea party” as a shorthand in examining non-profit groups because employees had specific concerns about some
groups with that name.  “IRS employees had seen cases of organizations with the
name Tea Party in which political activity was an issue that
needed to be reviewed for compliance with legal requirements,”
the agency said in a question-and-answer document sent to
reporters today. “Because of the increased inventory of
applications, this inappropriate criterion was used as a
shortcut to centralize similar cases.”  The IRS’s use of tea party to screen applications for tax-exempt status is the subject of four congressional
investigations and a criminal probe.  Advocacy and lobbying groups can receive exemptions under
section 501(c)(4) of the U.S. tax code as long as their primary
purpose isn’t to engage in politics. Groups receiving that
status don’t have to disclose donors.  The IRS has acknowledged and apologized for using
ideologically slanted criteria as it decided which groups should
get tougher scrutiny. The agency said today that most of the
groups identified because they included the name “ tea party ”
would have received closer examination under politically neutral
criteria.  The IRS said it has approved 175 of about 470 applications
that were centralized under its process. It released a list of
those groups today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
