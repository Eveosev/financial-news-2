Sojaprotein AD, the biggest soy bean
processor in the Balkans, returned to profit in the first three
months as the stronger dinar outweighed plummeting sales.  The company, located 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of
Belgrade, reported a net income of 14.27 million dinars ($11.6
million) after a 181 million-dinar loss a year earlier,
according to its regulatory filing to the Belgrade Stock
Exchange. Sales fell 45 percent to 1.58 billion dinars, causing
an operating loss of 168.6 million dinars, compared with a 118.8
million dinar operating profit a year earlier.  “Sales are surprisingly low, particularly because they
increased production of higher-value products for human
consumption,” said Milos Bijanic, a financial analyst at
Belgrade-based brokerage Sinteza Invest Group.  Sojaprotein, majority owned by Victoria Group AD, moved
toward higher-value products last year with a new factory to
produce an annual 70,000 tons of soy protein concentrates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
