European stocks rose, extending their
highest level since June 2008, after the  Bank of England  raised
its growth forecast for Europe’s third-biggest economy.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  led a gauge of travel companies higher after
the low-cost airline said it will deliver improved returns and
profitability for the full year. TUI AG added 4 percent after
announcing plans to generate 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of
profit by 2015. Commerzbank AG surged 12 percent on the first
day that it offered new shares to investors.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.8 percent to 308.06 at
the close in London. The equity benchmark has  rallied 10 percent 
so far in 2013, its best start to a year since 1998, as central
banks around the world maintained their stimulus measures.  “Quantitative easing globally is driving the market,”
said  Andrea Williams , who helps oversee $76 billion as head of
European equities at Royal London Asset Management. “Generally,
valuations still look reasonable and the corporate results
season has also been OK.”  Stocks climbed as BOE Governor Mervyn King said that an
economic  recovery  in the U.K. is now “in sight”. In the
central bank’s quarterly Inflation Report, which is King’s last
before he retires in July, officials predicted that growth will
accelerate to 0.5 percent in the second quarter from 0.3 percent
in the first three months of the year.  Euro-Area Growth  A report from Eurostat showed the combined economy of the
euro area shrank more than economists had forecast. That
extended the currency bloc’s recession to a record sixth
quarter.  Gross domestic product  fell 0.2 percent in the first
quarter, the European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg
said. GDP slid 0.6 percent in the final three months of 2012.  “It’s surprising and a little bit alarming that the market
is shrugging off the bad news,” Williams said in a telephone
interview today. “There does seem to be a disconnect between
economic conditions, particularly in  Europe .”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 16 of the 18
western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index added 0.1
percent, while  Germany ’s DAX Index rose 0.3 percent.  France ’s
CAC 40 Index gained 0.4 percent.  EasyJet jumped 8.3 percent to 1,224 pence after Europe’s
second-largest discount carrier said revenue per seat for the
second half will probably climb 4 percent. The company also
narrowed its  first-half pretax loss  to 61 million pounds ($93
million) from 112 million pounds a year earlier, as more
business travelers booked its flights.  Ryanair Holdings Plc, the biggest low-cost carrier,
advanced 3.7 percent to 6.37 euros in Dublin trading.  TUI Gains  TUI climbed 4 percent to 9.41 euros after Europe’s largest
tour operator said it intends to resume its dividend payment.
New Chief Executive Officer Friedrich Joussen said he plans to
cut administrative costs and jobs, reduce interest costs to
about one third of the current 160 million euros each year,
lower the number of hotel brands, and restructure the Hapag
Lloyd cruise business.  The company will also streamline operations with its
largest unit,  TUI Travel Plc (TT/) , of which it owns 54.5 percent. TUI
Travel gained 2.4 percent to 355.4 pence in London.  Commerzbank surged 12 percent to 7.79 euros on the first
day of its 2.5 billion-euro capital increase. Germany’s second-biggest lender has offered its investors 20 shares for every 21
they hold at 4.50 euros apiece. Bank of America Corp. upgraded
 the lender  to buy, saying that the company has become too cheap.  Carmakers Climb  Fiat SpA posted the biggest rally on a gauge of  carmakers 
as investors sought to reduce their bearish bets on the
industry. The Italian carmaker jumped 7.6 percent to 5.36 euros
in Milan. Peugeot SA climbed 4.5 percent to 6.56 euros and
Renault SA increased 4.5 percent to 58.50 euros.  “Renault and Fiat are breaking out on the beta chase and
short squeeze,” said Nick Xanders, an equity strategist at BTIG
Ltd. in  London . “Even Peugeot has started to move higher in
sympathy. Renault has the added benefit of being aided by the
move in Nissan.”  The number of Renault shares out on loan, an indication of
short sellers’ interest, is 31 percent of the free float,
according to data compiled by Markit. The short interest in
Peugeot is 21 percent and Fiat 17 percent, the data shows.  Short sellers borrow equities to sell them, hoping to buy
them back at a lower price and pocket the difference.  ITV Plc slid 1.9 percent to 129.2 pence after the
commercial broadcaster forecast that revenue from its network of
television channels will fall 3 percent in its first half. Chief
Executive Officer Adam Crozier said in a statement that the
company was cautious about  TV advertising  in 2013.  Vivendi, Iliad  Vivendi SA (VIV)  lost 1.7 percent to 15.72 euros in Paris after
the owner of SFR, France’s second-biggest mobile-phone operator,
reported a 21 percent drop in first-quarter Ebit to 1.18 billion
euros. That missed  analyst estimates .  SFR reported that revenue declined 11 percent to 2.6
billion euros in the first quarter. Iliad SA, which entered
France’s mobile-phone market with budget monthly tariffs last
year, also posted quarterly revenue. The company said that
mobile-phone revenue tripled to 294.5 million euros.  Iliad’s shares still slipped 2.3 percent to 175.50 euros,
their first retreat in four days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
