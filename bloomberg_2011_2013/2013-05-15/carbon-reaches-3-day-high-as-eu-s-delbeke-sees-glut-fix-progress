Carbon permits advanced to the
highest in three days after  Jos Delbeke , director general for
climate at the European Commission, said a decision on a supply
fix could be possible in the second half of the year.  The December benchmark futures contract closed 3.4 percent
higher at 3.64 euros ($4.68) a metric ton on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The contract earlier rose to 3.67
euros, the highest since May 10, after Delbeke said lawmakers
may favor a proposal to enable the delay of some new permits
when the bloc’s Parliament votes on the matter in July after
rejecting it last month.  December futures are set to rise toward a so-called
resistance level at 3.80 euros, according to technical analysis
by Mark Owen-Lloyd, a trading director at Clean Energy Group
Ltd. in  London . In technical analysis, investors and analysts
study charts of trading patterns and prices to predict changes.  “We are up because the 3.28 euros level held and we are
still in our little uptrend from 2.46 euros,” Owen-Lloyd said
today by e-mail. “3.80 euros is a resistance level, and I think
we will have a go at that again.”  United Nations carbon offsets for December advanced 1 cent,
or 2.6 percent, to close at 40 euro cents a ton on ICE Futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
