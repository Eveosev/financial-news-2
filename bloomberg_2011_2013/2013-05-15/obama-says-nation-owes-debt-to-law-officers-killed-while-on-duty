President  Barack Obama  paid tribute
to law-enforcement officers who have been killed in the line of
duty, saying the nation can never fully repay its debt of
gratitude for their service.  At the National Peace Officers Memorial in Washington,
Obama said members of the law-enforcement community “exemplify
the very idea of citizenship.”  There were 143 officers who died last year and were honored
in the annual ceremony. Obama singled out some of them,
including a motorcycle officer in Jupiter, Florida, who died
with he was hit by a car while escorting a presidential
motorcade.  “We can never repay the debt to these officers and their
families,” Obama said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
