Corn declined on the South African
Futures Exchange by the midday close, tracking prices of the
grain in the U.S., which fell on speculation that plantings will
increase with drier weather.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
dropped 0.3 percent to 2,164 rand ($233) a metric ton, while the
yellow variety for delivery in the same month decreased 0.5
percent to 2,141 rand a ton.  The western U.S. Midwest may be mostly dry until May 17 as
eastern areas see light to moderate rain starting tomorrow, DTN
said. Wet, cold weather cut corn sowing to 28 percent of the
intended crop in the first 19 weeks of 2013, lagging behind the
average pace of 65 percent in the previous five years and the
slowest since at least 1980, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said May 13.  “There are now expectations that farmers will make a more
significant progress in their plantings in the U.S. because it
is drier,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader at Trademar Futures
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone in Johannesburg. “The rain was not as
bad as expected and this means they will plant better.”  Corn for delivery in July fell 0.8 percent to $6.4725 a
bushel by 9:16 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The U.S. is
the largest producer of the grain.  South Africa is the continent’s biggest producer of corn.
The white grain is a staple food in the country, while the
yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in July gained 0.1 percent to 3,500 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
