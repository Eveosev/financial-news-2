Confidence (USHBMIDX)  among U.S. homebuilders
improved in May for the first time in five months as buyers rush
to take advantage of near record-low mortgage rates.  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index
of builder confidence rose to 44 from a revised 41 in April, the
Washington-based group reported today. The  median  forecast in a
Bloomberg survey called for an increase to 43. Readings below 50
mean more respondents said conditions were poor.  “Builders are noting an increased sense of urgency among
potential buyers as a result of thinning inventories of homes
for sale, continuing affordable mortgage rates and strengthening
local economies,” said Rick Judson, chairman of the trade group
and a builder from  Charlotte ,  North Carolina . “This is
definitely an encouraging sign.”  Low  mortgage rates , a strengthening job market and limited
inventories are benefiting builders including PulteGroup Inc.
and Lennar Corp. as the housing market contributes to growth
this year after emerging as a bright spot in 2012. Gains in
housing will help the world’s largest economy move through a
global slowdown that is hurting manufacturing.  Another report today showed  industrial production  declined
in April by the most in eight months, reflecting broad-based
cutbacks manufacturing that show factories will provide little
support for the economy.  Stocks trimmed earlier losses after the builder confidence
report. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell less than 0.1
percent to 1,649.52 at 10:02 a.m. in  New York . It closed at a
record 1,650.34 yesterday.  Industrial Production  Output at factories, mines and utilities fell a more-than-forecast 0.5 percent after a revised 0.3 percent gain in the
prior month that was weaker than previously reported, a report
from the  Federal Reserve  showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.2 percent decline.
Manufacturing, which makes up 75 percent of total production,
unexpectedly fell 0.4 percent, the third drop in four months.  All three components of the homebuilder survey showed
improvement. The group’s gauge of the sales outlook for the next
six months rose a point to 53, the highest reading since
February 2007, from a revised 52.  Prospective buyer traffic also improved, to 33 in May from
30 in April. An index of  current  single-family home sales posted
a four-point gain to 48 in May.  Survey Results  Estimates of the 51 economists in the Bloomberg survey
ranged from 40 to 45. The index, first published in January
1985, averaged 54 in the five years leading to the recession
that began in December 2007. It reached a record low of 8 in
January 2009.  The confidence survey asks builders to characterize sales
as good, fair or poor and to gauge prospective buyers’ traffic.
It also asks participants to assess the six-month outlook.  Builder confidence improved in three of the four U.S.
regions. Companies in the Northeast had a 10-point jump, from 31
to 41 in May. Confidence improved in the Midwest from 40 to 45
and in the South, rising from 40 to 44. Sentiment fell in the
West, from 52 to 41.  Builders started work on 780,000 homes last year, a 28
percent increase from 2011 and the most in four years.
Nonetheless, construction of new homes remains below the 2.07
million reached in 2005, the peak of the housing boom.  Inexpensive borrowing costs are helping to attract would-be
homebuyers. The  average rate  on a 30-year, fixed-rate purchase
loan was 3.42 percent for the week ending May 9, down from 3.83
percent a year ago, according to McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie
Mac . The 30-year rate reached a record low of 3.31 percent in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
