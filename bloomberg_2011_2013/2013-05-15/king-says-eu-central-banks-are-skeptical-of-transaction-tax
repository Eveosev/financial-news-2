Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
said Europe’s planned financial transactions tax is regarded
with “enormous” skepticism by central banks in the region.  King, speaking in his final Inflation Report press
conference before he retires in July, said the levy means “very
different things to different people,” and more time would be
needed before any measure is designed.  “I don’t think it’s likely to help very much and indeed
the thing I find most striking is that within Europe I can’t
find anyone within the central banking community who thinks it’s
a good idea,” he said today. “I don’t think we’re remotely
close to getting a clear view on any of this.”  At least eleven EU nations plan to introduce the levy,
which was criticized by Prime Minister  David Cameron  last week
as a “mistake for Europe.” German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told reporters in London then that there was still a
“long way to go” before a decision was made.  “I can understand why at least some politicians feel
reluctant to express their true skepticism about the merits of
this idea in public,” King said. “But I can assure you, I hear
an enormous amount of skepticism even from quarters that are
alleged to be behind it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
