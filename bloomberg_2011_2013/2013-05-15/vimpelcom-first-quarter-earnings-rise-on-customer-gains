VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the wireless carrier
owned by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman and Norway’s
 Telenor ASA (TEL) , improved first-quarter profitability after adding
users in former Soviet republics and  Italy  and cutting costs.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization increased to $2.35 billion from $2.31 billion a
year earlier, the Amsterdam-based company said today in a
statement. Profit was in line with analyst estimates. The Ebitda
margin widened to 42 percent of sales from 41.1 percent.  VimpelCom is working to reduce spending and improve
operations to help cut $28.6 billion in debt resulting from the
acquisition of telecommunications assets, including in Italy and
Algeria, from Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris in 2011.  Mobile subscriber numbers rose 4 percent from a year
earlier to 215 million users, boosted in part by a competitor’s
shutdown in Uzbekistan. VimpelCom cut commercial costs in  Russia 
by shifting to a revenue-sharing model with distributors and
reduced human-resources costs.  Net debt on March 31 widened 4 percent from the end of
December to $22.9 billion, while the ratio of net debt to Ebitda
narrowed to 2.3 from 2.6 in the fourth quarter. First-quarter
net income rose 28 percent to $408 million from $318 million a
year earlier.  American depositary receipts of VimpelCom rose 0.5 percent
to $11.31 yesterday in New York, valuing the company at $19.9
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
