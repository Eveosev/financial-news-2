Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s TBS and TNT
channels will begin streaming their content online 24 hours a
day this summer, letting pay-TV subscribers watch the networks
using the Web or a mobile-device application.  To watch the streams, users will have to log in with their
account information from their cable or satellite service, Time
Warner’s Turner Broadcasting System said today in a statement.
The company made the announcement at this week’s annual upfront
event, where networks show their new schedules to advertisers.  The channels are making the move as part of an industry
shift toward “TV everywhere,” which lets viewers see the same
content online that they typically get from their cable box.
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  unveiled a similar service this week called
Watch ABC, which allows pay-TV viewers to get live access to
shows on the network via computers and mobile devices.  “Tablets and smartphones become television sets, bringing
new opportunities for us and for advertisers,” Steve Koonin, a
Turner executive, said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
