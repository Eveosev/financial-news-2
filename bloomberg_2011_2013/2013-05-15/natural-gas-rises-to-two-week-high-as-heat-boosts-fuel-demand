Natural gas futures rose to a two-week high in New York on forecasts for a heat wave to spread
across the U.S., boosting cooling demand.  Temperatures in central and mid-Atlantic states will be
higher than average through May 20, Commodity Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda,  Maryland , said today in a note to clients.
 Cincinnati  will reach 93 degrees Fahrenheit (34 degrees Celsius)
today, 18 degrees higher than usual, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “It’s summer here today,” said  Phil Flynn , senior analyst
at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We’re going from turning on
the heaters to turning on the air conditioners in 24 hours, and
that’s giving the market some support.”  Futures for June delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $4.059 per million British thermal units at 9:21 a.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading at that time was 0.6
percent above the 100-day average. Prices reached $4.078 in
earlier trading, the highest intraday price since May 2.  The fuel has advanced 21 percent this year as the coldest
March since 2002 eliminated a supply  glut  that had persisted
since September 2011. Inventories expanded to 60.5 percent above
the five-year average in March 2012 until above-normal demand
pushed stockpiles to 5 percent below the average last week.  The Energy Information Administration may report tomorrow
that natural gas in storage increased by 95 billion cubic feet
in the seven days ended May 10, according to the median of 14
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five year average
gain for the week is 83 billion, and last year’s injection was
56 billion, according to the EIA, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
