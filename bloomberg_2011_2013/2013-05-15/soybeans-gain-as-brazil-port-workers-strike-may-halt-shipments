Soybeans gained on speculation
deliveries from  Brazil , poised to be the world’s largest shipper
this year, may be disrupted as port workers plan a strike. Wheat
declined and corn was little changed.  The oilseed for delivery in July advanced as much as 0.6
percent to $14.2275 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
after losing 0.3 percent yesterday. It last traded at $14.1750
at 10:15 a.m. in Singapore on volume that was 45 percent less
than the 100-day average for that time of day.  Workers in Brazil’s ports of Santos, Parangua and  Rio de
Janeiro  plan a stoppage, Forca Sindical, an umbrella group for
Brazilian trade unions, said by e-mail yesterday. Workers are
protesting a government proposal to change port regulations to
lure investments, Sindical said. Brazil is expected to ship a
record 7.6 million tons of the oilseed in May after permitting
ports to operate 24 hours a day, from a previous 8-hour limit,
Oil World said yesterday.  “It’s possible that soybean prices are rising because dock
workers are planning another strike, delaying shipments from
Brazil,” Joyce Liu, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said by
phone from  Singapore . “Just like in the past, they may call off
the strike and say they will talk to the government instead. If
that happens, we may see more volatility.”  Corn for July delivery lost as much as 0.2 percent to $6.51
a bushel in Chicago, before trading little changed at $6.52.
Wheat declined 0.2 percent to $7.0925 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
