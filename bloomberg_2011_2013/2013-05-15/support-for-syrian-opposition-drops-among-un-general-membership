A symbolic vote at the United Nations
General Assembly today reflected a decline in support for the
Syrian opposition as the two-year conflict drags on.  The assembly voted 107-12 for a Qatar-drafted text that
designated a disorganized political grouping of rebels, the
Syrian National Coalition, as “effective representative
interlocutors needed for a political transition.” Fifty-nine
countries abstained.  A comparable resolution last August garnered 133 votes,
more than two-thirds of the General Assembly, where each of the
193 UN member nations is entitled to one vote.  The measure was promoted primarily by Sunni Muslim
monarchies and blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for most
of the bloodshed, accusing his regime of threatening to use
chemical weapons against his own people.  The failure to attract more votes highlights a drop in
support for the opposition, which has faced questions about the
influence of al-Qaeda militants. The Syrian regime has routinely
labeled the rebels as “terrorists” since the beginning of the
crisis. Reports from  Syria  cite alleged abuses by both sides of
the conflict. There are differing accounts on the possible use
of sarin gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
