Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , Italy’s biggest
phone company, is offering to buy back as much as $750 million
of bonds issued by its finance unit, Telecom Italia Capital SA.  The tender offer, expiring at midnight  New York  time on
June 12, will help Telecom Italia manage its upcoming debt
maturities, the Milan-based company said in a statement.  The former Italian monopoly is seeking to reduce debt by
selling assets and cutting jobs as a recession in its home
market curbs sales. It posted first-quarter earnings last week
that missed analysts’ estimates, as operating income in Italy
fell 10 percent.  Telecom Italia is offering to buy back 5.25 percent notes
due 2015, 4.95 percent notes maturing in 2014, and 6.175 percent
notes also due next year, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
