Asian shares rose as stocks in  Japan 
climbed to their highest level since December 2007 and yields on
the nation’s 10-year bond advanced to the most in more than a
year. South Korea’s won declined and palladium retreated.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.8 percent at 1:12 p.m.
in Tokyo as Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average jumped 1.9 percent,
breaching 15,000 for the first time since January 2008. Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index futures were down 0.1 percent after the
equity gauge advanced to a record yesterday. The yen rebounded
from a 4 1/2-year low, while the won retreated 0.7 percent. The
dollar traded near the strongest in five weeks against the euro
as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields headed toward 2 percent for the
first time since March. Japan’s 10-year rate climbed as high as
0.92 percent.  Sony Corp. surged as much as 14 percent as billionaire
Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC hedge fund pushes for the Xperia
smartphones and Bravia televisions maker’s breakup. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, rose to pace gains among
Japanese exporters, boosted by signs of recovery in the U.S.
economy and a falling yen. Data on U.S. April producer prices
and first-quarter euro zone GDP are due later today with the
former expected to show declines from March, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “Momentum is building for a global stock rally,” said
 Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc., a unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,
Japan’s second-biggest lender. “Downward pressure on the yen
against the dollar is strengthening, boosting earnings outlooks,
especially for exporters.”  Toyota, Yamaha  About two stocks rose for every one that fell in the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index. Toyota increased 2.4 percent while
motorcycles maker Yamaha Motor Co. advanced 8.4 percent. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index has gained 11 percent this year versus a
16 percent rally by the S&P 500 and a 9.3 percent advance by the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 0.5 percent,
rebounding from its biggest two-day drop in a month. Li & Fung
Ltd. jumped 7.4 percent after UBS AG raised its investment
rating on the maker of toys and clothing. Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. gained 1 percent after the city said it will
offer two residential sites for development.  Yen, Won  The U.S. dollar traded at $1.2934 per euro from $1.2920
yesterday when it touched $1.2912, the strongest since April 5.
The currency has gained as improving sentiment toward the U.S.
economy spurred speculation the Federal Reserve will reduce
stimulus.  The yen gained 0.3 percent to 102.16 against the greenback
after sliding to 102.43, matching the weakest since October
2008. The yen’s 14-day relative strength index versus the dollar
was at 29.8603, below the 30 level which indicates an asset’s
price has fallen too rapidly and may be poised to reverse
course.  The won dropped 0.7 percent to 1,113.95 against the dollar
on speculation South Korean policy makers will weaken the
currency to protect the nation’s exports against the yen’s
slump. Yields on Japan’s 10-year bond rose 1.8 basis points to
0.88 percent. The last time yields touched 1 percent was in
April 2012.  Palladium for immediate delivery declined 1 percent to
$723.30 an ounce, dropping for the first time in three days. The
price rallied to $732.40 yesterday, the highest level since
April 12. The metal is up 3.5 percent this month, beating losses
in gold and silver, as strike action in South African mines
curbed supply and demand expanded.  Copper was little changed at $7,248 a ton, while zinc rose
0.2 percent and nickel climbed 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
