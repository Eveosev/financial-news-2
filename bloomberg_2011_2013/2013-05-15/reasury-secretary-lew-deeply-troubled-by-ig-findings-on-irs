U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said today that he “was deeply troubled to learn of the
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration’s finding that
IRS personnel used unacceptable terms and criteria to determine
if certain groups should receive additional scrutiny when
applying for tax-exempt status.”   “Although the Inspector General found that the IRS put a
stop to this type of screening as of May 2012, it should never
have happened and must not happen again,” Lew said in a
statement issued in  Washington . “I strongly agree with the
President about the need for accountability at the IRS, and I
expect the IRS to implement the Inspector General’s
recommendations without delay.”  The IRS is the U.S.  Internal Revenue Service , a bureau of
the Treasury Department.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
