Third Point LLC, the hedge-fund firm
run by  Daniel Loeb , exited its stake in  Herbalife Ltd. (HLF)  in the
first quarter, according to a regulatory filing.  The fund sold 3.1 million shares of the Cayman Islands-based company valued at about $102.1 million at the end of
March, according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  In January, Third Point disclosed in a regulatory filing
that it took an 8.2 percent stake, or 8.9 million shares, in
Herbalife amid allegations from Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square
Capital Management LP that the direct seller of nutrition shakes
was a pyramid scheme.  Third Point, which has $12.9 billion in assets, sold 11
million shares of  Yahoo (YHOO) ! Inc., bringing its stake to 62 million
shares valued at $1.46 billion as of the end of March. Yahoo is
still the hedge-fund firm’s largest position by market value.
The hedge-fund firm disclosed a new stake in  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) 
of 11 million shares valued at $538.7 million and 2.7 million
shares of  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  valued at $187.8 million.  Elissa Doyle, a spokeswoman for New York-based Third Point,
declined to comment on the filing in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
