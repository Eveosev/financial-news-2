A surge in dengue fever cases among
people returning to the U.K. spurred  Public Health England  to
urge travelers to better protect themselves from insect bites
while abroad.  Confirmed and probable dengue cases among those returning
to  England ,  Wales  and  Northern Ireland  almost tripled to 141 in
the first four months of the year from 51 a year earlier, the
government agency said today in an e-mailed statement. In 2012,
dengue cases reported to the agency rose 54 percent to 343,
Public Health England said.  “The increase in the numbers of people returning with
dengue fever is concerning, so we want to remind people of the
need to practice strict mosquito bite avoidance at all times,”
Jane Jones, a travel-associated infection expert at the agency,
said in the statement. Applying insect repellent and wearing
long-sleeve tops and trousers can reduce the risk of bites.  Dengue is transmitted by a type of mosquito found in
tropical and sub-tropical areas, according to the  World Health
Organization ’s  website . Dengue symptoms include high fever,
headaches, joint pains and rash, the WHO said. It may lead to
complications and dengue hemorrhagic fever, a life-threatening
form of the disease with symptoms that include abdominal pain,
vomiting and bleeding. About half the world’s population is at
risk of infection, according to the Geneva-based WHO.  Medical Advice  There is no specific treatment for the disease, with most
patients taking paracetamol, drinking plenty of fluids and
resting, Public Health England said. Anyone developing a fever
or flu-like symptoms within two weeks of returning from a trip
to an area affected by dengue should seek medical advice, the
agency said.  Of the cases reported in England this year, 37 people had
traveled to  Thailand , 13 had been to  Sri Lanka , 11 to Barbados,
nine to  Brazil  and six to  Jamaica , the agency said.  Singapore’s dengue cases are set to surge to a record
23,000 this year, prompting the government to break into homes
that could be breeding grounds for mosquitoes that transmit the
disease.  The European Union experienced its first sustained outbreak
of dengue since the 1920s last year, on the Portuguese resort
island of Madeira. At least 2,000 people were sickened as a
result, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
