(Corrects BlackRock shares sold in second paragraph of
story originally published May 15, 2013.)  Highfields Capital Management LP, the
hedge fund run by Jonathon Jacobson, bought stakes in  Dell Inc. (DELL) 
and McGraw Hill Financial Inc. in the first quarter, while
exiting  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)   Highfields added 22.9 million shares of Dell, the Round
Rock, Texas-based computer maker, valued at $327.7 million as of
March 31, the Boston-based firm said today in a filing. It
bought 7.58 million shares of New York-based McGraw Hill, while
exiting its stake of 414,625 shares of money manager BlackRock,
according to the Form 13F filing.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission within 45 days of each quarter’s end to list
their U.S.-traded stocks, options and convertible bonds. The
filings don’t show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the
firms hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
