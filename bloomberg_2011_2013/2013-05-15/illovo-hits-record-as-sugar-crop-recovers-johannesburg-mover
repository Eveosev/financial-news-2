Illovo Sugar Ltd. (ILV) ,  Africa ’s largest
sugar producer, rose to a record as investors anticipate a
recovery in output after a drought.  The shares  jumped  as much as 5.4 percent, the most since
April 23 on an intraday basis, traded 2.9 percent higher at
38.60 rand by the close in Johannesburg. About 1.2 million
shares were traded, or 2.5 times the daily average over the last
three months. Illovo, which has units in Malawi and Zambia, has
gained 11 percent over the last five trading days, making it the
second best-performer on the FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index.  “You’re paying up for African exposure, plus a recovery
story where earnings will see 30 percent growth as well as
strong exposure to a depreciating rand,” Brendan Grundlingh, an
analyst at Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s SBG Securities (Pty) Ltd.
unit, said by phone from Johannesburg today. “There are not
many food companies or industrials that can give you that.”  Profit for the year through March 31 at Illovo’s Malawian
unit jumped to 20.9 billion kwacha ($58 million) from 8 billion
kwacha a year earlier, the company said on May 10. The Zambian
division saw an 8.5 percent increase in profit to 141 million
kwacha ($26 million) in the same period. The rand has weakened
8.6 percent since the start of the year, the worst-performer
among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  A 10 percent weakening of the rand against the dollar
relates to a gain in net income of about 5 percent for Illovo,
Grundlingh said. The company said in its annual report for the
year ending March 2012 that 88 percent of operating profit is
“derived from non-rand-based countries.”  Sugar production at Illovo, 51 percent-owned by London-based  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF) , is rising after drought in
Malawi and Zambia eased, Grundlingh said.  The company’s 14-day  relative strength index  is above 70
for a 14th day. A reading above 70 signals that a stock may be
overvalued and poised to decline. Illovo is expected to release
results for fiscal year through March on May 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
