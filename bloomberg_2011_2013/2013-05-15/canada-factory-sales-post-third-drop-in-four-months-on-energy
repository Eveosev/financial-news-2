Canadian  factory sales  fell for the
third time in four months in March, an unexpected decline led by
lower energy prices and chemical orders.  Sales dropped 0.3 percent to C$49.5 billion ($48.4
billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, following the
revised February gain of 2.8 percent that was the biggest rise
since July 2011. Economists forecast a 0.5 percent increase
according to the median in a Bloomberg  survey  with 19 responses.  Pressures on manufacturers and exporters have contributed
to the Bank of Canada keeping its policy rate at 1 percent since
September 2010, the longest pause since the 1950s. Foreign
orders have been curbed by a currency trading at about parity
with the U.S. dollar and tepid demand that’s lowered  prices  for
commodities  Canada  exports such as oil and gold.  “Manufacturing can continue to grow but there are still
headwinds there,” said Nathan Janzen, an economist at Royal
Bank of Canada in Toronto.  Petroleum and coal sales dropped 2.6 percent to C$6.95
billion, the lowest since July, led by a decline in prices.
Chemical sales fell 2 percent to C$3.88 billion, which
Statistics Canada said may be linked to colder-than-normal
weather in March that delayed fertilizer purchases.  Excluding those two categories, factory sales advanced 0.3
percent in March. Sales rose in 11 of 21  categories  tracked by
Statistics Canada, accounting for about two-thirds of output.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.1 percent to C$1.0190 per U.S.
dollar at 9:33 a.m. One loonie buys 98.14 U.S. cents.  Sales Volumes  Removing the impact of price changes, which gives a better
indicator of the industry’s contribution to economic growth,
factory sales rose 0.2 percent, Statistics Canada said.  Motor vehicle sales increased 1.5 percent to C$4.25
billion. Sales excluding motor vehicles and parts decreased 0.5
percent to C$43.2 billion, Statistics Canada said.  Unfilled orders declined 1.1 percent to C$71.1 billion from
February’s record level.  Inventories fell 0.1 percent to C$68.8 billion, with the
ratio of factory stockpiles to sales unchanged at 1.39. New
orders fell 2.2 percent to C$48.7 billion.  Today’s report incorporated revisions back to January 2007,
including changes in the roster of survey participants and how
statistics agencies in North America classify businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
