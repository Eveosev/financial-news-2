Growth in the U.S. remains too
sluggish to cut the jobless rate quickly, leaving it a “long
way” from satisfactory levels, according to former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.  The unemployment rate may remain above 6 percent for at
least another two years, Volcker said at a Brazilian-American
Chamber of Commerce event in New York.  The economy “is growing, but not fast enough to reduce the
unemployment rate in the way we would like to see,” Volcker
said. “It’s declining because the labor force is not rising,
and we’re getting a little more employment, but it’s a long way
from being satisfactory.”  The U.S.  unemployment rate  dropped to 7.5 percent in April
from 7.6 percent in March and 8.1 percent a year earlier. The
rate was last below 6 percent in July 2008.  The Fed called the current jobless rate “elevated” in a
May 1 statement. “Labor market conditions have shown some
improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment
rate remains elevated,” the Fed said.  Volcker helped cut the unemployment rate to an eight-year
low of 5.7 percent in 1987, his last year as Fed chairman, after
reversing interest-rate increases that brought inflation down
from as high as 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
