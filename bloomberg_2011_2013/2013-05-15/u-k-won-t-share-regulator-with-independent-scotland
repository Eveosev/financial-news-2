U.K. Treasury ministers said that
Scotland would need to establish its own financial regulator if
it voted for independence in 2014.  Chief Secretary to the Treasury  Danny Alexander  and
Scottish Secretary  Michael Moore  told lawmakers the idea,
proposed by the pro-independence Scottish National Party, of
Scotland continuing to use the Bank of England as a regulator
wouldn’t work under EU law.  “Every independent sovereign state in the EU is required
to have its own separate system of financial regulation,”
Alexander told the Scottish Affairs Committee.  The government will publish a paper on the impact of
independence on financial services on May 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
