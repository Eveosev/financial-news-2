Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Officer
Dick Costolo said the online service for 140-character messages
is increasingly being used to track personal health with
wearable computing gadgets such as  Nike Inc. (NKE) ’s fitness devices.  “People are readily tweeting things out from wearable
devices” Costolo said today at the National Venture Capital
Association’s annual conference in San Francisco. “There’s a
huge opportunity in the health-care space.”  Twitter is expanding into smartphones and other wireless
products, seeking to boost the number of users and advertisers.
In addition to transmitting exercise data via Twitter posts,
Costolo sees other applications in health care, such as scales
that can automatically post a user’s weight to a website.  Engineers at the social website are also looking at ways to
adapt the service for use with  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Glass, the wearable
mobile-computing device resembling spectacles, John Doerr,
general partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a Twitter
investor, said last month.  San Francisco-based Twitter, founded in 2006, has nearly
2,000 employees, Costolo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
