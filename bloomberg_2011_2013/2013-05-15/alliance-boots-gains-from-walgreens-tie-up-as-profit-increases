Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd., owner
of the U.K.’s largest drugstore chain, said annual earnings rose
6.1 percent helped by gains from a tie-up with  Walgreen Co. (WAG)   The company’s share of cost and revenue benefits resulting
from last year’s alliance with the biggest U.S. drugstore
operator was 14 million pounds ($21 million) in the year ended
March 31, Alliance Boots said today in a statement.  Since allying in August 2012, the U.K. and U.S. companies
have seconded staff to a joint venture based in Bern,
 Switzerland  to help deliver so-called synergies from the tie-up,
Alliance Boots said. The retailers have forecast $1 billion of
benefits by 2016 from sharing best practices in store design,
customer loyalty programs and selling online.  Alliance Boots, in which Walgreens acquired a 45 percent
stake last year, said so-called trading profit climbed to 1.27
billion pounds ($1.9 billion) in the year ended March 31.
Sales declined 2.6 percent to 22.4 billion pounds because of
sterling’s strength against currencies such as the euro.  The retailer said it is focusing on entering new markets
and expanding its presence in existing territories.  “We continue to be confident about our prospects and
ability to pursue profitable growth, organically, from our
synergy programmes and through international expansion,”
Executive Chairman Stefano Pessina said in the statement.  The retailer reduced its net borrowings to 5.89 billion
pounds from 7.02 billion pounds a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
