Mercator Poslovni Sistem d.d. 
reported a net loss in the first quarter, saying the economic
crisis in Slovenia and the region continues to hurt sales of the
largest supermarket chain in the Balkans.  Revenue fell 2.6 percent to 658.4 million euros ($850
million), while the net loss was 8.6 million euros from a year-ago period, Mercator said in a  statement  to the Ljubljana stock
exchange.  “Economic contraction and continued economic downturn, in
addition to falling consumption and difficulties in obtaining
financing have affected Mercator’s results,” the company said
in a statement.  Mercator’s shares yesterday plunged to the lowest level in
a decade after a report on May 13 that shareholders received
only two bids for the company’s majority stake. Shares opened at
90.10 euros today at 9:34 a.m. in Ljubljana after closing at 95
euros yesterday.  Mercator’s  owners , including Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.,
formed a consortium in December to try and sell a majority of
the company again after Croatian rival Agrokor d.d. pulled out
of the bidding process a year ago.  Agrokor renewed its offer earlier this year, according to
two people familiar with the bid, who declined to be identified
as the transaction is not public. The bid is fifth attempt by
Zagreb-based Agrokor to buy its biggest competitor in the
Balkans.  Mercator in 2012 had its first full-year loss in 15 years,
posting a net loss of 104 million euros, compared with net
income of 21 million euros in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
