The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in  Asia  including  Japan 
dropped, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1.5 basis points to
77 basis points as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The gauge, which fell to a five-year low on May 13,
has ranged from 74.3 to 148.1 basis points this year, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 1 basis point to 102 basis
point as of 8:50 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc prices show. The benchmark is headed for its first decline
in three days, after reaching the highest since May 3 yesterday,
CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 102
basis points as of 10:01 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The measure has ranged from 96.1
basis points to 127.5 this year, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the private market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
