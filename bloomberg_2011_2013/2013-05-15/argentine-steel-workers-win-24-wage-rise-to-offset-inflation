Argentina ’s Labor Ministry, steel
workers union and companies agreed to a wage rise of 24 percent,
an increase in line with economists’ estimates of  inflation  over
the past year.  About 250,000 workers will get a 17 percent increase from
April 1 and an additional 7 percent from July 1, according to
the presidential  website . A one-time bonus of 1,400 pesos ($267)
will be paid in two installments in November and January.  Private economists calculate inflation was 23.7 percent in
the 12 months to the end of April. The official statistics
agency, which will publish its April consumer price report at 4
p.m. in Buenos Aires, says annual inflation was 10.6 percent to
March 30. The gap between private estimates and official data
has expanded since early 2007, when then-President  Nestor
Kirchner  changed personnel at the statistics agency, raising
doubts among economists, politicians and the  International
Monetary Fund  about the accuracy of the data.  Consumer prices rose 1.52 percent in April and 23.67
percent from a year earlier, according to a survey of private
economists released yesterday by opposition lawmaker Patricia
Bullrich.  Members of Congress began to report the private inflation
estimates in May 2011, after President Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner’s government fined economists for releasing price data
that differed from official statistics. Opposition lawmakers
release the estimates without naming the analysts who
participate in the survey. On May 13, appeals courts dismissed
the fines, saying that the economists didn’t violate any laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
