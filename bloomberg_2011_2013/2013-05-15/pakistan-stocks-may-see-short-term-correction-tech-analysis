The Pakistan  stock market  is
“extremely overbought” and may drop before resuming this
year’s rally after the benchmark gauge’s relative strength index
rose to the highest in the world, according to JS Global Capital
Ltd. The index dropped for the first time in 11 days.  The measure may decline as much as 4.7 percent from
yesterday’s close to 19,500-19,950, JS Global Capital technical
analyst Raheel Ashraf said by phone from Karachi today. The
index closed at a record yesterday, pushing valuations to 7.3
times forecast 12-month earnings, the highest level since June
2011. The measure’s 14-day  relative strength index , a gauge of
price momentum, climbed as high as 89.4 earlier today, the
highest among 72 equity gauges tracked by Bloomberg worldwide.  “The market should correct 500 to 1,000 points so that
indicators normalize before rallying again,” Ashraf said.
“Momentum is very positive and volumes are high as well. The
next target is 21,000 points.”  The index lost 0.6 percent to 20,350.31 at 1:36 p.m. local
time, reversing a 0.8 percent advance. It has jumped 20 percent
this year, heading for a second annual gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
