Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) ,  Italy ’s
biggest insurer, is seeking to sell a portfolio of private-equity fund stakes valued at almost 500 million euros ($648.3
million), according to three people familiar with the matter.  Generali, based in Trieste, Italy, is talking to buyers
itself rather than using an agent, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because the process is private. Generali’s
portfolio is mostly made up of stakes funds that invest in
leveraged buyouts, according to the people.  Insurance companies and financial institutions have been
selling stakes in private-equity funds on the secondary market
as new regulations make it more costly to hold illiquid assets.
Generali sold about $400 million in private-equity fund stakes
in June to New York-based firm Lexington Partners Inc., said a
person familiar with the matter.  A Generali spokesman declined to comment.  Financial institutions including insurance companies made
up 24 percent of sellers in the secondary market last year and
29 percent of the transaction value, according to a report by
Cogent Partners, an advisory firm based in  New York . In March,
French insurer  AXA SA (CS)  agreed to sell its private-equity unit AXA
Private Equity to senior management, AXA Group and outside
investors. French insurer Groupama SA agreed to sell Groupama
Private Equity to ACG Group in January as part of an effort to
get rid of assets that are not central to its business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
