Baltimore Ravens linebacker Rolando McClain is planning to retire from the  National Football League 
after a three-year career marked by off-field trouble.  McClain, 23, has informed Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome of his intentions, the team said in an e-mailed
statement. No reason for the decision was provided.  A former first-round draft pick of the  Oakland Raiders ,
McClain signed a one-year, $700,000 contract with Baltimore on
April 12, and was arrested 10 days later in Decatur,  Alabama . He
was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest,
according to the Baltimore Sun, and released from jail after
posting a $1,000 bond.  It was the most recent arrest during his three-year NFL
career. McClain was arrested in 2011 following a shooting in
Alabama, and in May 2012 was convicted of four misdemeanors. He
appealed the charges, which were dropped when the accuser told
prosecutors he did not want to pursue the case, according to
ESPN.  McClain was also suspended two games last season for what
Oakland Raiders coach Dennis Allen called a “team-related
issue.” He was released by the team in the offseason.  Patrick Dye, McClain’s agent, did not immediately respond
to message left at his Georgia office.  The eighth pick in the 2010  NFL Draft , McClain had 246
tackles, 6 1/2 sacks and one interception in three seasons with
Oakland.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
