The Philippine peso weakened for the
first time this week as the yield premium on local debt fell to
a record low and on concern declines in the yen will hurt
export-driven Asian economies.  The Philippine currency declined as 10-year U.S. Treasury
yields rose for a fifth day, narrowing the rate  advantage  on
peso-denominated bonds to 123 basis points, the least in data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1998. The yen reached 102.43
per dollar today, the lowest level since October 2008, prompting
a drop of as much as 0.8 percent in  South Korea ’s won.  “The Japanese yen’s weakness will affect other Asian
economies, where the  Philippines  also trades,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist in Manila at ING Groep NV. “We’ve got
rising U.S. interest rates. The gains in Philippine financial
assets are not as attractive.”  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 41.125 per dollar as of
10:17 a.m. in Manila, according to prices from Tullett Prebon
Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, declined seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.21 percent.  The yield on the 4 percent government bonds due September
2022 was unchanged at 2.8 percent, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
