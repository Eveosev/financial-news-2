Andy Murray  retired from his second-round match at the Italian Open with a lower-back injury that
may keep him out of the  French Open .  Murray left the court after winning the second set from
Marcel Granollers of  Spain  to tie the match. The British player,
who’s celebrating his 26th birthday today, required medical
treatment on his back midway through the set.  “I’d be very surprised if I were playing in Paris,” he
told reporters after the match. “I’ll speak with the boys
tonight and come up for the next few days, then make a decision
on Paris after the next five days.”  Murray, who’s won two tournaments this season and reached
No. 2 in the world rankings, said his back has been an issue for
some time. He experienced the pain in his lower left back last
year as well.  “I’ll need to take some days off and see how it settles
down, but a few days can make a difference,” the reigning U.S.
Open champion said on the ATP World Tour’s  website . “So I want
to make sure it’s something that I can sort out. It’s not
enjoyable to play now.”  The French Open, the year’s second Grand Slam tournament,
begins May 26 in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
