Palm oil  tumbled the most in almost
two weeks on speculation that exports may decline from Malaysia
after the world’s second-largest producer left a tax on
shipments unchanged for a fourth month.  The contract for July delivery slid as much as 1.1 percent
to 2,277 ringgit ($759) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the biggest decline for the most-active futures
since May 2, and was at 2,280 ringgit at 12:22 p.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures have lost 6 percent this year.  Crude palm oil exports will be taxed at 4.5 percent in June
as the reference price was set at 2,332.02 ringgit, within the
minimum band for a levy to be applied, according to a statement
from  Malaysia ’s Customs Department. Shipments from Malaysia fell
7.6 percent to 599,300 tons in the first 15 days of this month
from a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said today.  “The tax won’t give any edge to Malaysian sellers as
prices are still higher than Indonesian shipments,” Vijay Mehta, a director of Commodity Links Pte., said by phone from
Singapore. “Exports could recover a bit in the second half of
this month as Ramadan demand will pick up from early June.”  Consumption usually increases during the Muslim fasting
month of Ramadan, boosting purchases from the Middle East to
South Asia including India, the world’s biggest buyer.  Refined palm oil for September delivery fell 2 percent to
5,990  yuan  ($975) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , while
 soybean oil  dropped 1.6 percent to 7,378 yuan. On the Chicago
Board of Trade, soybeans for July delivery was little changed at
$14.1375 a bushel and soybean oil for same month declined 0.5
percent to 49.49 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
