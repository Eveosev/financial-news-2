Developer Larry Silverstein said he
plans to start building an 82-story hotel-and-condominium tower
a block north of the World Trade Center site in lower  Manhattan 
late this year, after getting a $660 million loan.  The 926-foot (282-meter) tower, to be the tallest
residential structure downtown, will house a 185-room Four
Seasons hotel and 157 Four Seasons-branded luxury residences,
Silverstein Properties Inc. said today in an e-mailed statement.
London-based Children’s Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP is
providing the loan for the $950 million project.  “The Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown will be the top
hotel and apartment building in lower Manhattan,” Silverstein
said in the statement. “Downtown is fast becoming a vibrant,
integrated, mixed-use destination on a scale not seen in New
York City since Rockefeller Center in 1939.”  The financing agreement revives a project Silverstein had
to put on hold after the 2008 financial crisis froze credit
worldwide. He acquired the property at 99 Church St. in
partnership with California State Teachers’ Retirement System in
2007 from Moody’s Corp. for $170 million, and later tore down a
building that had been the Moody’s headquarters. Silverstein is
now calling the site 30 Park Place.  Many of New York’s tallest new skyscrapers are condo
towers. Extell Development Co. expects to open its 1,004-foot
One57 condo project on West 57th Street, across from Carnegie
Hall, later this year. Plans for 432 Park Ave., which  Harry Macklowe  and CIM Group are building, call for it to top out at
1,397 feet.  ‘Perfectly Fits’  Children’s Investment Fund also helped finance 432 Park,
fund partner Martin Frass-Ehrfeld said in today’s statement. He
called Silverstein and his co-investors “a pristine group of
partners” and said 30 Park Place “perfectly fits our
investment strategy,” which also includes financing 737 Park
Ave., which Macklowe bought in 2011 and is converting to condos.  The 30 Park Place property is on the same city block as the
Cass Gilbert-designed Woolworth Building, which was the world’s
tallest skyscraper when completed in 1913. Silverstein is
planning a  limestone tower  with setback terraces, designed by
the firm of Robert A.M. Stern, dean of the Yale School of
Architecture.  Silverstein is close to completing 4 World Trade Center,
one of three towers he has the right to build on the 16-acre
(6.5-hectare) site to the south. He leased the twin towers for
99 years six weeks before they were destroyed in the 2001
terrorist attacks.  One World Trade Center -- being built by the Port Authority
of New York & New Jersey, the site’s owner, in partnership with
developer Douglas Durst -- topped out last week at 1,776 feet,
making it the tallest building in the western hemisphere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
