Internal Revenue Service Chief
Counsel William Wilkins didn’t attend an August 2011 meeting on
the agency’s treatment of political nonprofit groups and didn’t
learn about the selective scrutiny of small-government groups
until this year, the IRS said in a statement today.  The timeline in an inspector general’s report released
yesterday said that “Chief Counsel” was involved in an Aug. 4,
2011, meeting. Wilkins, one of two presidential appointees at
the IRS, is the agency’s top lawyer.  The IRS statement said that “chief counsel” is standard
language for referring to any of the 1,600 attorneys who work
for him.  Wilkins “is not involved” in the issue involving
nonprofit groups and didn’t discuss the applications with the
Treasury Department’s general counsel, the IRS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
