Copper gained in  London  after falling
the most in two weeks as investors weighed weak growth in China
and improving U.S. data. Lead, aluminum, nickel and zinc also
advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 0.7
percent to $7,295 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,278.50 at 9:53 a.m. in Shanghai. The metal declined
2.3 percent yesterday, the most since May 1.  Confidence among U.S. small businesses rose in April to a
six-month high as the outlook for the economy and sales
brightened. Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its estimate on
China’s growth this year to 7.6 percent from 8 percent, and
lowered the forecast for next year to 7.6 percent from 7.7
percent, economists including Ting Lu said in a note.  China 
won’t introduce any significant stimulus measures, and a rate
cut in the near term isn’t very likely, the bank said.  “Optimism about the U.S. is offering support to copper,”
said Xiao Jing, an analyst at Beijing Capital Futures Co. “The
metal still seems to be stuck between $7,200 and $7,450.”  Copper for delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell
0.3 percent to 52,540  yuan  ($8,553) a ton, while July futures on
the Comex in  New York  rose 0.4 percent to $3.3015 per pound.  On the LME, tin fell 1.8 percent, the most in two weeks, to
$20,610 a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
