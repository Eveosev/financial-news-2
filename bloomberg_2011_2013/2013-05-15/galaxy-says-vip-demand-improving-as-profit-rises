Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) , the
Macau casino operator founded by billionaire Lui Che Woo, posted
a 29 percent increase in first-quarter earnings and said it is
seeing signs of improved demand from high-stake gamblers.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation, or Ebitda, for the quarter ended March rose to
HK$2.8 billion ($357 million) from HK$2.15 billion a year ago,
Hong Kong-based Galaxy said in a statement. That compares with a
median estimate of HK$2.79 billion from six analysts compiled by
 Bloomberg News .  An increase in new attractions, hotel supply as well as an
improved rail connection are drawing more mainland Chinese
visitors to Macau, the world’s biggest gambling hub. Galaxy is
expanding in the city’s Cotai area, the Asia’s equivalent of Las
Vegas strip, to compete with rivals including  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,
whose first quarter profit jumped 63 percent.  “There have been positive signs that demand in the VIP
segment is regaining momentum,” Galaxy said in today’s
statement, referring to the high-stake gamblers who provide most
of Macau’s revenue. VIP gamblers curbed spending last year as
 China’s economy  weakened.  Revenue climbed 15 percent to HK$15.2 billion.     Turnover
for VIP gambling during the first quarter fell 2 percent at the
Galaxy Macau and 15 percent at its Starworld Hotel & Casino.  Galaxy said last week that it will pay HK$3.25 billion for
Grand Waldo which includes a spa, casino and hotel, to increase
its footprint on Cotai. It’s also investing as much as HK$66
billion to build the second and third phases of its Galaxy
Macau, its flagship casino resort in Cotai that opened in May
2011.  Gross gaming revenue  in Macau, the only place in China
where casino gambling is legal, is expected to grow 17 percent
to $44.5 billion from $38 billion last year, according to
Deutsche Bank AG estimates.  Galaxy gained 0.5 percent to HK$38.50 in  Hong Kong  trading
today. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  added 0.5 percent.  Galaxy Macau  Galaxy is investing about HK$16 billion in the second phase
to almost double the current size of its Cotai resort as it
competes with Sands and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  The
phase-two expansion, which the company has started, will add as
many as 500 gaming tables and 1,300 rooms from the JW Marriott
and Ritz-Carlton hotels by 2015.  Galaxy is also planning to spend up to HK$50 billion to
begin phase-three expansion of the project at the end of 2013 or
the beginning of 2014.  The company has received approval from the government to
add 50 tables this year, deputy chairman Francis Lui said in
March.  Galaxy faces competition from Sands China Ltd. and  Melco
Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  as it expands in Macau’s Cotai area,
the Asia’s equivalent of Las Vegas strip. All three companies as
well as  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  and  MGM China Holdings (2282)  are building new
resorts in the Cotai area. Sands China earlier reported a 63
percent jump in first quarter profit.  Sands China, the Macau casino controlled by billionaire
 Sheldon Adelson , received approval in January to add 200
additional gambling tables. Its latest resort, Sands Cotai
Central, was opened in April last year. Sands is investing $2.8
billion in the world’s largest gambling hub to build its fifth
on Cotai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
