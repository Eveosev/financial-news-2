Pacific Investment Management Co. is
shunning long-dated European government securities because of
the region’s growth outlook, according to Andrew Balls, head of
European portfolio management at the firm.  “We would steer clear of the long end of European
curves,” London-based Balls said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television withFrancine Lacqua. “What you see is very little
growth, very little progress in terms of strengthening the
institutions in Europe and the ECB which is reluctant to use its
balance sheet, so it doesn’t look like a great environment for
investing. In terms of European sovereign exposures, we think
stick to the short-end of the curves because we can have some
greater visibility.”  Pimco prefers to invest in  emerging markets , he said.
“There are better alternatives outside of the euro-zone,”
Balls said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
