The top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins
beat the Ottawa Senators 4-1 and the Los Angeles Kings defeated
the San Jose Sharks 2-0 in the opening games of the National
Hockey League’s conference semifinal playoff series.  In tonight’s game, the Detroit Red Wings travel to the
Chicago Blackhawks in the first game of their best-of-seven
Western Conference series.  Paul Martin got the opening goal for the Penguins on a
power play at Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh. Colin Greening
tied it for Ottawa and Evgeni Malkin also scored in the first
period for the home team.  Chris Kunitz added a third goal for Pittsburgh on a power
play near the end of the second period and Pascal Dupuis scored
a shorthanded goal in the third.  “We know it’s a good start, but it’s just like the rest of
the playoffs, we know it’s just the start,” Pittsburgh forward
Jarome Iginla told reporters.  Pittsburgh hosts Game 2 on May 17.  At the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Jonathan Quick
stopped 35 shots for his sixth career postseason shutout. Slava
Voynov scored in the first period and Mike Richards added one in
the second for the Kings.  The Kings host Game 2 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
