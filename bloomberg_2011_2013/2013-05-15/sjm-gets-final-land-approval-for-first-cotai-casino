SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , Asia’s biggest
casino company by revenue, received final government approval to
develop its first casino resort in Macau’s Cotai area, the Asian
equivalent of the Las Vegas strip.  The casino company got official approval for a resort on
the 70,468-square-meter site, according to a gazette published
by the Macau government today. It has agreed to pay the
government 2.15 billion patacas ($269 million).  SJM’s shares rose as much as 3.5 percent to HK$22.20 in
Hong Kong trading today, headed for the highest close since its
2008 initial public offering. The approval allows it to join
competitors including  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and  Galaxy Entertainment
Group Ltd. (27)  in expanding on Cotai, an increasingly popular part
of the world’s largest gambling hub.  SJM, which currently runs 20 out of 35 casinos in  Macau  and
has none on the Cotai strip, first won preliminary approval for
the land grant in October. It has said it plans to develop as
much as 521,435 square meters of total floor area on the site,
including a five-star hotel and a casino resort. Macau is
granting on the land on a renewable 25-year lease, according to
today’s gazette.  “SJM is now formally entitled to develop that land,”
Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based analyst at Union Gaming Group LLC
said by phone, referring to today’s gazette announcement. “Its
next step is getting the construction approval.”  SJM traded at HK$22 at 10:33 a.m in Hong Kong trading
today. The benchmark Hang Seng index rose 0.5 percent.  SJM is the last company among Macau’s six casino operators
to receive an approval to develop a casino resort in the Cotai
area.   MGM China (2282) ’s $2.6 billion Cotai resort broke ground in
February and is set to open by mid-2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
