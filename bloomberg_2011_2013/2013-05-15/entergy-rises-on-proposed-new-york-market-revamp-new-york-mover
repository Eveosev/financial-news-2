Entergy Corp. (ETR) , which operates the
nuclear plant closest to  New York City , rose after telling
investors that a proposed restructuring of New York’s
electricity market may boost power sales.  Entergy, based in New Orleans, increased 2.2 percent to
$69.61 at the close in New York. The shares have climbed 9.2
percent this year.  Entergy said in slides posted on its website today that a
new Lower Hudson Valley zone that is being created by New York’s
grid operator is on schedule to hold its first capacity auction
in April 2014, providing new revenue to power generators serving
the region. So-called capacity payments, which are in addition
to the price of electricity, are paid by utility customers to
generators to assure a sufficient supply of power.  The new zone must still be approved by federal regulators.
A simulated auction conducted by the  New York  Independent System
Operator yielded capacity prices that are about double those
paid in northern New York, according to the Entergy slides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
