Britain’s spending watchdog called on
the government to explain how it will fill a 3.3 billion pound
($5 billion) shortfall to pay for a new high-speed rail line.  The Department of Transport has “poorly articulated” the
need to expand rail capacity and explain how the new lines will
help regional economic development, the National Audit Office
said in a report in  London  today. It also found errors in the
ministry’s cost-benefit analysis of the project.  “Our concern at this point is the lack of clarity around
the department’s objectives,” Amyas Morse, head of the audit
body, said in a statement accompanying the report.  The government in January said it will go ahead with plans
to build the second phase of a high-speed rail line that will
run from London through Birmingham in central  England  to cities
including Manchester and Leeds. The line, known as High Speed 2,
will be integrated with the existing rail network and will cut
journey times and expand capacity.  The first part of the project costing 17 billion pounds
aims to run trains to Birmingham from London by 2026. The NAO
said the government hasn’t explained how it will plug the 3.3
billion pound funding gap in the four years to 2021.  The “black hole in the government’s plans for funding the
project needs urgently to be addressed,” Maria Eagle, who
speaks for the opposition  Labour Party  on transport, said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
