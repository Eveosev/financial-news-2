Skanska AB (SKAB)  in a venture with MWH
Global Inc. and  Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY)  has been awarded a contract
valued at as much as 1.5 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) from
Thames Water Utilities Ltd., Britain’s largest supplier, to
upgrade the U.K.’s water and wastewater infrastructure.  The companies through their SMB venture join  Costain Group
Plc (COST)  and its CVA venture with a  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  unit and
 WS Atkins Plc (ATK)  that have been hired by Thames Water for 2 billion
pounds to 3 billion pounds of works improving the utility’s
assets, the groups said today in e-mailed statements.  The SMB contract will begin this month for a 23-month early
contract involvement phase in preparation for the start of
Thames Water’s 2015-2020 investment program to upgrade assets,
according to the venture.  “We have a significant amount of work to do upgrading our
deteriorating infrastructure over the next 25 years and beyond
while keeping customers’ bills affordable,” Lawrence Gosden,
Thames Water’s capital delivery director, said in MWH’s
statement.  The CVA venture of Costain, Veolia Water U.K. Ltd. and
Atkins was awarded a contract by Thames Water as part of its
upgrade plans that’s worth 450 million pounds to Costain, the
company said in a statement without disclosing total value of
the deal.  The SMB contract is to be split equally among the three
companies, according to SMB’s “super alliance” statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
