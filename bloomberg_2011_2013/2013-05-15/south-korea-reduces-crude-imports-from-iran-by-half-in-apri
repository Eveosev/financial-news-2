South Korea , the world’s fifth-largest oil importer, cut crude shipments from  Iran  by 51
percent in April from a year earlier, customs data show.  Purchases last month were 507,821 metric tons, compared
with 1.04 million tons a year earlier, according to data on the
 Korea Customs Service’s  website today. The volume was 556,658
tons in March, the figures showed. The April deliveries were
equivalent to about 124,000 barrels a day.  South Korea halted imports of Iranian crude in August and
September after the start of a European Union ban on insurance
coverage for tankers carrying oil from the Persian Gulf nation.
The injunction was a part of sanctions by Western countries
intended to pressure the Islamic republic to stop its nuclear
program, which the U.S. and  Israel  say is aimed at developing
atomic weapons and Iran says is for civilian purposes.  South Korea resumed crude shipments from Iran in October
after the Persian Gulf nation offered its own vessels for
transporting the commodity.  The Asian nation’s total crude imports fell 5 percent to
9.34 million tons last month from a year earlier, the customs
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
