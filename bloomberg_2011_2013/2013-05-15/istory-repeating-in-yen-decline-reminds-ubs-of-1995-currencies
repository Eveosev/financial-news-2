The  currency market  is experiencing a
bout of deja vu, with the yen’s tumble to a 4 1/2-year low and
the dollar’s rebound drawing resemblances to 1995.  Just as 18 years ago, the  Bank of Japan  is taking
unprecedented steps to boost the economy and U.S. growth is
showing signs of strengthening, raising speculation the Federal
Reserve will temper its stimulus. Back then, the events marked
the start of a three-year slide for the yen and a long-term  bull
market  in the greenback that pushed the  U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)  higher
in five of the following six years.  The year “1995 continues to offer striking parallels with
current market developments,” said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, the
Singapore-based head of foreign-exchange strategy at  UBS AG (UBSN) , the
world’s fourth-largest currency trader as measured by  Euromoney
Institutional Investor Plc. (ERM)  “The divergence between the two
central banks will help keep pushing the dollar-yen higher.”  After weakening 15 percent this year, the yen is less than
halfway through a drop that will take it to 120 in 2014,
according to Mohi-uddin’s forecast. Group of Seven countries’
finance chiefs signaled acceptance of the yen’s slide after
meeting late last week in Aylesbury, near  London , as the BOJ
tries to end years of  deflation  by flooding the financial system
with cash.  Dollar Boost  At the same time, the greenback is getting a boost as U.S.
jobs and housing rebound. The Dollar Index has risen 6.1 percent
to a nine-month high of 83.941 today from this year’s intraday
low of 78.918 on Feb. 1 as employers added an average of about
196,000 workers in the first four months of 2013.  “The recovery in the  U.S. economy  in 2013 is likely to
provide a tailwind for yen-selling,” Taisuke Tanaka, the chief
foreign-exchange strategist and head of fixed-income research at
Deutsche Bank AG, the biggest currency trader in a Euromoney
poll, said in a seminar in  Tokyo  yesterday.  The yen touched 102.76 today in  New York , the weakest since
Oct. 14, 2008. It declined 0.1 percent to 102.51 as of 12:35
p.m. in New York.  The pace of the yen’s drop has forced strategists to rush
to catch up, cutting their estimates versus the dollar and the
euro by the most among more than 50 currency pairs tracked by
Bloomberg.  Analysts have lowered year-end forecasts for the yen by
17.1 percent since December, to 105 per dollar from 87,
according to the median of more than 50 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Mohi-uddin and Tanaka said they see it at 110 by the
end of this year.  Buying Bonds  Against  Europe ’s 17-nation currency, the forecast has been
trimmed 17.4 percent to 132 per euro from 109. Estimates are for
the Japanese currency to fall to 110 to the dollar in 2014.  Mohi-uddin predicts the dollar will strengthen about 8
percent against both the euro and the British pound and more
than 3 percent versus the Swiss franc. The U.S. currency was at
$1.2902 per euro and $1.5215 to the pound. The franc was at
96.65 centimes per dollar.  The yen has tumbled about 9 percent since new BOJ Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda said April 4 the central bank would buy at least
7 trillion yen ($68.5 billion) of  government bonds  a month to
achieve a 2 percent annual inflation target within two years.
The plan accelerated a decline kick-started by Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe in November, when he called for “unlimited” easing
to defeat deflation.  Turning Point  The effect of the central bank’s monetary is “so far, so
good,” though a level of 110 yen to the dollar would be “too
weak,” said  Eisuke Sakakibara , a former Japanese vice-finance
minister known as “Mr Yen” for his influence on exchange rates
in the 1990s.  “It will probably weaken toward 105, but it will probably
turn around in the range between 105 and 110, because the
Japanese economy at this moment is very strong, and with a
strong economy, a currency does not keep falling,” Sakakibara
said in an interview.  “The difference in the policy outlook for Japan, where
it’s uncertain it can achieve its inflation target by 2015 even
after doubling the monetary base, and the Fed, where it’s
standing ready to exit quantitative easing, is crystal clear,”
said  Daisaku Ueno , a senior currency and fixed-income strategist
at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Fed policy makers are buying about $85 billion of
Treasuries and mortgages securities a month to foster the
recovery. The median estimates of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg is for gross domestic product to expand by an
annualized 2.6 percent by year-end, while  Japan ’s inflation rate
remains under 0.5 percent.  Unprecedented ‘Intensity’  “The current yen-bear cycle seems to have an intensity
that we’ve never seen before,” Ueno said.  For UBS’s Mohi-uddin, the yen’s decline echoes the three-year depreciation that started in the mid-1990s, to a eight-year
low of 147.66 per dollar in August 1998 from a then post-World
War II record of 79.75 in April 1995.  That slide followed the BOJ switching its policy target to
an overnight money-market rate for the first time to boost the
effects of monetary easing. Investor concern that Japanese
banks’ creditworthiness was declining and the impact of the
Asian regional crisis also weakened the currency in the 1990s.  Intervention Halted  Japan and its Asian neighbors aren’t suffering from those
problems now. And while Japan sold 4.96 trillion yen of its
currency in 1995, according to  Ministry of Finance  figures, it
hasn’t intervened in the foreign-exchange market since November
2011 following the currency’s climb to a record 75.35.  “We’re seeing yen depreciation from a fairly neutral
valuation, even without intervention,” said  Junya Tanase , the
chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo.  The yen has weakened 21 percent in the past six months,
making it the biggest loser among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The  real
effective exchange rate  fell to 67.49 in last month, the lowest
level since October 2007, data compiled by JPMorgan show. The
gauge surged to a record high 121.53 in April 1995.  As Japan ramps up monetary easing, signs of an improvement
in the U.S. are signaling less need for central bank stimulus in
the world’s largest economy.  Charles Plosser , president of the
Fed Bank of Philadelphia, said this week that he favors reducing
bond purchases that have pumped more than $2 trillion into the
economy and weighed on the dollar.  “Before Governor Kuroda dropped the stimulus bomb, dollar-yen had been driven mainly by the performance of U.S. economy
and Fed policy,” said Ueno of Mitsubishi UFJ. “The current
cycle could be the first one to be driven by domestic factors.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
