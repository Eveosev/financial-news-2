Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
closed above 15,000 for the first time since 2007 after the yen
touched a 4 1/2-year low against the dollar.  Sony Corp. (6758)  jumped
as shareholder  Daniel Loeb  pushed for its breakup.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  added 3.7 percent to pace gains among
exporters. Sony soared 10 percent as Loeb’s Third Point hedge
fund pressed the company to spin off part of its entertainment
business.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , which posts
results today, advanced 3.1 percent after the Nikkei newspaper
said the lender will beat earnings estimates and raise its
dividend.  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202)  surged 21 percent after forecasting
better-than-expected operating profit.  The Nikkei 225 gained 2.3 percent to close at 15,096.03 in
Tokyo, the highest since Dec. 28, 2007. Volume was about 54
percent above the 30-day average. The broader Topix Index
advanced 1.8 percent to 1,252.85.  “Every time the yen falls below a key level, the Nikkei
passes another milestone because it boosts corporate profits,
especially for manufacturers,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.,
which oversees the equivalent of $100 billion. “Stocks should
rise further as investors acknowledge the impact of government
policy. Given that, I don’t think stocks are that expensive.”  Best Performance  The Topix has risen 46 percent this year, outperforming all
major equity indexes amid unprecedented monetary easing from the
 Bank of Japan . The gauge yesterday traded at 1.4 times book
value, compared with 2.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The yen touched 102.43 per dollar, the lowest since October
2008, before trading at 102.24. A weaker yen enhances overseas
earnings at Japanese exporters.  Toyota advanced 3.7 percent to 6,440 yen and  Canon Inc. (7751) ,
the world’s biggest camera maker, gained 2.6 percent to 3,740
yen. Komatsu Ltd, a machinery maker that gets 30 percent of its
revenue in the Americas, advanced 2.3 percent to 2,894 yen.  Sony jumped 10 percent to 2,072 yen, the highest since July
22, 2011, after Loeb, founder of Third Point LLC, recommended
selling as much as 20 percent of Sony’s entertainment unit in an
initial public offering that would free it from the struggling
electronics business.  Sony Financial Holdings Inc. (8729) , the company’s insurance unit,
advanced 9.4 percent to 1,620 yen.  Earnings Results  Of the 754 companies on the Topix that have reported full-year earnings since April 1, and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 452 beat analysts’ projections. Mitsubishi UFJ and
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. are among more than 140
companies that post results today.  Mitsubishi UFJ gained 3.1 percent to 732 yen after the
Nikkei reported the bank’s annual payout will rise by 1 yen to
13 yen per share for the year ended March and is likely to gain
to 14 yen this fiscal year. Net income will be in the mid-800
billion yen range, topping the average analyst estimate of 745
billion yen.  Isuzu surged 21 percent to 872 yen after forecasting
operating profit of 180 billion yen for the year ending March
2014, above the average analyst estimate of 153 billion yen.  Among other stocks that rallied,  Meiji Holdings Co. (2268) 
advanced 8.3 percent to 4,825 yen after beating estimates for
net income forecast. Net income will be 16.5 billion yen in the
