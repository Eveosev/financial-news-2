Cyprus’s request to  Russia  for a loan
was a “big mistake” that delayed the country in taking the
right decisions for its economy, former Cyprus Finance Minister
Michael Sarris said.  Cyprus should have applied for a loan from the European
Stability Mechanism earlier, when the country’s problems were
smaller and could have been dealt with more easily, Sarris said
to an independent investigative committee in Nicosia today.  The solution imposed on Cyprus and the capital-control
restrictions have created a type of euro which differs from the
currency used in the rest of  Europe , Sarris said. “The only
euros that are the same as the ones that Germans hold are the
ones you hold in your pockets,” Sarris said.  Cyprus on May 13 received its first emergency aid payment
of 2 billion euros, part of a 10 billion-euro ($12.8 billion)
bailout agreement with the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund  in March. The country is due to receive another 1
billion euros in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
