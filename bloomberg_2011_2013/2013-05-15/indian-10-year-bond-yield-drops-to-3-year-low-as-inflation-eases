Indian bonds gained, pushing the
benchmark 10-year yield to a three-year low, after central bank
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said the slowest inflation since 2009
will be factored into policy decisions. The rupee advanced.  Government notes due 2022 rose for a seventh day, the
longest winning streak in three weeks, after an official report
showed that the pace of wholesale-price  gains  slowed to 4.89
percent in April. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was
for a 5.45 percent increase. The Reserve Bank of  India , which
cut its  repurchase rate  by 75 basis points to 7.25 percent this
year, will lower the measure to 7 percent at a June 17 review,
according to Standard Chartered Plc.  “Subbarao’s comments are important as he is acknowledging
the drop in WPI inflation,” said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a Singapore-based strategist at Standard Chartered.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.43 percent as of
9:55 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest for a 10-year bond since May 2010.  The government will auction a new benchmark note maturing
in 2023 on May 17, the RBI said by e-mail on May 13.  “We certainly will take note of the softening of inflation
and the external payments situation in the next mid-quarter
policy,” Subbarao said in  Frankfurt  yesterday.  The rupee advanced 0.1 percent to 54.7650 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange rate used
to price options, fell six basis points to 8.39 percent. It’s a
challenge to manage exchange-rate volatility, Subbarao said
yesterday.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.70 per
dollar, unchanged from yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 55.50 versus
55.52. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set
price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
