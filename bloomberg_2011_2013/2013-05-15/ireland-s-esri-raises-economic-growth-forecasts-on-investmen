Ireland’s  Economic Social & Research
Institute  raised its forecast for economic growth this year and
next, as investment by overseas companies buttresses the
nation’s emergence from its worst recession on record.  Gross domestic product will rise 1.8 percent this year, the
Dublin-based Economic Social & Research Institute said today,
raising a January forecast of 1.3 percent. The economy may
expand 2.7 percent in 2014, the ESRI said, lifting its 2.2
percent forecast.  “With Ireland continuing to attract foreign direct
investment, it seems likely that growth in construction
investment will recommence in 2013,” the ESRI said. “If the
anticipated international upturn does not occur, then the
outlook for the Irish economy is less positive.”  Companies from EBay Inc. to  Google Inc. (GOOG)  are expanding in
Ireland, drawn by the country’s 12.5 percent tax rate and
plentiful supply of workers. Unemployment, which almost tripled
in the wake of the nation’s real estate crash in 2008, may drop
next year to 13.9 percent next year from 14.2 percent this year,
the ESRI said.  The fiscal deficit will narrow to 4.6 percent of GDP in
2014 from 7.2 percent next year, the ESRI said, as the
government raises taxes and cuts spending following the 2010
international bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
