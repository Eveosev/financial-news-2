Liquefied natural gas imports by
 South Korea , the world’s second-largest buyer of the fuel, rose
29 percent in April as domestic demand increased.  Shipments climbed to 3.51 million metric tons from 2.72
million a year earlier, according to data on the Korea Customs
Service’s  website  today. The monthly volume dropped from 4.16
million tons in March.  The total cost of last month’s purchases increased to $2.61
billion from $2.15 billion in the same month a year earlier, the
data showed today. The average price paid declined to $742.62
per ton from $790.73 a year ago.  South Korea buys most of its LNG under multiyear contracts
from suppliers including Qatar, Indonesia and Oman. April’s
purchases included a spot shipment of 61,189 tons from
 Equatorial Guinea  at $885.29 a ton, the data show.  State-run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest LNG buyer,
said May 10 that its April domestic sales of gas increased 10
percent to 3.21 million tons from a year earlier. Demand from
electricity producers rose 5.2 percent, while that from local
city gas providers climbed 16 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
