Topdanmark A/S (TOP)  rose to a record in
Copenhagen trading as Danske Bank A/S said Denmark’s second-largest listed insurance company will report “splendid”
earnings next week.  Topdanmark rose as much as 1 percent to 148.90 kroner, the
highest price since the 1985 public listing, when adjusted for
stock splits. The share rose 0.7 percent to 148.40 kroner at
10:39 a.m. in Copenhagen with volume at 8.7 percent of the
three-month daily average. The stock has jumped 22 percent this
year, beating a 13 percent return by the Bloomberg Europe
Insurance Index of 28 companies.  Topdanmark, which is due to publish earnings May 21, has
exceeded analysts’ net income estimates in nine of its last 10
quarterly reports, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.
Danske Bank today raised its price estimate on the share by 5.7
percent and said “strong” first-quarter results from peers,
including Tryg A/S, bode well for Ballerup, Denmark-based
Topdanmark.  “Topdanmark is likely to deliver splendid first-quarter
earnings,” Danske said in a note to clients. The Copenhagen-based bank, which has a hold  recommendation  on the stock, raised
its price estimate to 149 kroner from 141 kroner.  Topdanmark may report a first-quarter net income of 310
million kroner ($53.7 million), according to the average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts. That compares
with a reported net income of 561 million kroner a year earlier.  Tryg, which is also based in Ballerup, reported on April 30
first-quarter net income of 575 million kroner, beating an
estimate of 479 million kroner in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
