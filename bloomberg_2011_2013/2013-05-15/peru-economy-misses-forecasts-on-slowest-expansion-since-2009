Peru ’s  economy  slowed more than
analysts expected in March as weaker global growth reduces
demand for the country’s metal and manufacturing exports.  Economic activity grew 3 percent from the year earlier, the
national statistics agency said in a report issued today in
 Lima . That compares with the 4.5 percent median forecast of 13
economists polled by Bloomberg and was the weakest pace since
October 2009.  China ’s slowing economy and recession in  Europe  are damping
growth in the world’s third largest copper and zinc exporter.
Peru’s central bank on May 9 cited weak global markets and
slowing inflation as rationale for keeping benchmark lending
rates at 4.25 percent for a 24th straight month.  “The figure will put the central bank on its guard though
it won’t lead to a rate cut,” Walther Benavides, a bond trader
at  BBVA Banco Continental , said by phone from Lima. “There’s
been a declining trend in GDP. Another month of growth at 3
percent will at least lead the central bank” to adjust the
language of its communiques.  Gross domestic product in the Andean nation will grow 6.15
percent this year, exceeding the Latin American average by more
than two percentage points, according to analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Still, manufacturing fell 3.6 percent in March from last
year, partially offsetting a 3.8 percent increase in
construction and 4 percent gain in retail, the agency said
today.  Peru’s exports slid 16 percent in March from a year ago,
the fourth straight monthly decline. Annual inflation eased to
2.31 percent last month, the lowest in more than two years, from
2.59 percent in March.  The sol fell 0.8 percent to 2.6250 per  U.S. dollar  at 12:22
p.m. in Lima, according to Datatec prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
