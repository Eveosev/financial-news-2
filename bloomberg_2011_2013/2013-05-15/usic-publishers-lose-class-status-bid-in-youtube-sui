A federal judge denied class-action
status to music publishers who sued  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube,
claiming that it violated copyrights by allowing the posting of
music clips on the website without authorization.  U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in  Manhattan  today denied
a motion for class certification by individual publishers.  “Plaintiffs offer no explanation of how the worldwide
members of this proposed class are to be identified, how they
are to prove copyright ownership by themselves or by their
authorized agent, or how they will establish that defendants
became aware of the specific video clips which allegedly
infringed,” Stanton wrote in his opinion.  The suit, filed in 2007 by music publishers and a U.K.-
based soccer league, is a companion to one brought by  Viacom
Inc. (VIAB)  that year against YouTube for copyright infringement.
Google reached a settlement of claims by the National Music
Publishers Association in 2011.  Stanton last month granted YouTube’s motion for judgment
without a trial and dismissed Viacom’s suit, saying YouTube was
protected from liability by the safe-harbor provision of
copyright law because it removed infringing videos when notified
about them.  This case is Football Association Premier League Limited v.
YouTube Inc., 1:07-cv-03582, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
