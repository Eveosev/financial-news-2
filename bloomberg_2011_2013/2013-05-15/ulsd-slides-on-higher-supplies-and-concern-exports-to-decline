after U.S. inventories increased last week and on concern
Europe’s recession threatens demand for Gulf Coast exports.  Futures dropped as much as 1.1 percent. The industry-funded
American Petroleum Institute reported yesterday that  distillate 
supplies rose 1.92 million barrels. A survey by Bloomberg
projected the Energy Information Administration will report a
gain of 475,000 barrels today. The  euro-area economy  shrank more
than economists forecast in the first quarter.  “The recession news coming out of Europe put a damper on
distillates,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks &
Opinions LLC in Houston. “A lot of U.S. refiners were looking
forward to more exports with the run cuts in Europe and then we
had the stock builds.”  ULSD for June delivery fell 3.16 cents to $2.8414 a gallon
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 27
percent below the 100-day average at 9:42 a.m. Prices have
dropped 3.2 percent in four consecutive days of declines.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate
crude oil widened 16 cents to $26.62 a barrel. The  premium over
Brent  crude slipped 49 cents to $17.58.  Some refineries in northwest Europe, particularly in the
U.K., have reduced production on declining margins, Miswin
Mahesh, an analyst at Barclays in  London , said in an e-mailed
research note on May 10.  European GDP  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro zone fell 0.2
percent after a 0.6 percent decline in the previous quarter, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  The EIA is scheduled to report last week’s inventories at
10:30 a.m. today in  Washington . The report will probably show
gasoline stockpiles fell 1.1 million barrels, according to the
survey. API reported a drop of  480,000 barrels .  Gasoline for June delivery sank 0.96 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to $2.828 a gallon on trading volume that was 15 percent above
the 100-day average.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 94 cents to
$25.91 a barrel, and the fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 33 cents
to $16.91.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.6 cent to
$3.588 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
