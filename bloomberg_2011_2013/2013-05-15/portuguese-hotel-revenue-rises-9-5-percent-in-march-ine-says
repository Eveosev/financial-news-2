Portugal ’s hotels recorded a 9.5
percent rise in revenue in March from the same month last year,
bolstered by the Easter break and an increase in overnight stays
by Spanish, British and German tourists.  Revenue rose to 121.2 million euros ($156 million) in
March, the Lisbon-based National Statistics Institute said today
in an e-mailed statement. In the first quarter of the year,
revenue increased 3.6 percent to 275.9 million euros.  Tourism represents about a tenth of Portugal’s gross
domestic product, according to the  Economy Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
