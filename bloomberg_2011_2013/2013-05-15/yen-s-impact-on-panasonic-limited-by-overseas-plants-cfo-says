Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,  Japan ’s second-largest maker of televisions, said it’s limiting exposure to
fluctuations in the yen by boosting overseas production.  The currency’s effect on Panasonic’s earnings has dropped
significantly as the company increased the number of production
facilities outside Japan to 189 from 117 during the past five
years, Chief Financial Officer Hideaki Kawai said in an
interview yesterday.  “We still have to take measures so that our businesses can
grow regardless of the currency’s movement,” Kawai said. “But
we can cope better now than before.”  The Osaka-based company  projected  its first annual profit
in three years last week after cutting jobs, closing plants and
selling assets to recover from more than 1.5 trillion yen ($15
billion) in losses the past two financial years. President
Kazuhiro Tsuga plans to spend 250 billion yen in the next two
years to eliminate losses at units making TVs, mobile phones,
semiconductors, circuit boards and optical devices.  The yen touched 102.76 per dollar yesterday, the weakest
since October 2008. The Japanese currency has tumbled about 20
percent since November, making it the biggest loser among 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Indexes.  Panasonic, the maker of Viera TVs, set up treasury offices
in nine countries -- including the U.S.,  China , the U.K., the
Netherlands and  Thailand  -- to manage risks from more than 30
combinations of currency contracts, Kawai said. That compares
with four in the 1980s, he said.  Annual Profit  The company’s forecast assumes an exchange rate of 85 yen
per dollar, 110 yen per euro and 13.7 yen per yuan.  Panasonic fell 1.7 percent to 883 yen as of 10:16 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, narrowing its  gain this year  to 69 percent. That
compares with the 45 percent gain by Japan’s benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average and the 115 percent gain by  Sony Corp. (6758)   A yen slide versus the dollar would boost the company’s
annual  operating profit  by about 1 billion yen. A 1-yen decline
against the euro would boost it by 1.7 billion yen, Kawai said
last week.  That compares with about a 6 billion-yen profit gain for a
weaker yen against the dollar before the company shifted
production bases overseas, he said.  The maker of Lumix cameras generated 52 percent of its
revenue in its home market,  14 percent in the Americas  and 13
percent in China in the year ended March 31.  Yuan’s Gain  While Panasonic still benefits from a weaker yen against
the dollar and euro, the company would lose about 5.2 billion
yen in annual profit on each 1-yen decline against the  yuan 
because it makes appliances and other products in China for sale
in Japan, Kawai said.  Still, the company doesn’t have a plan to reduce production
there or boost domestic manufacturing, Kawai said.  “What’s important is to structure our production bases so
that we can absorb demerits from currency movements,” he said.
“We’re focusing on making products in each region so that we
can respond better to customer needs.”  Net income  will probably be 50 billion yen ($488 million)
in the 12 months started April 1, compared with a net loss of
754 billion yen a year earlier, the company said May 10.
Operating profit may rise 55 percent to 250 billion yen while
sales may fall 1 percent, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
