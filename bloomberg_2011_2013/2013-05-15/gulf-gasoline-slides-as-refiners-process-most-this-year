U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened as
area refineries processed the most crude  since December ,
boosting fuel production.  Refiners along the Gulf increased runs by  2.7 percent  in
the week ended May 10 to 8.14 million barrels, the most since
Dec. 14, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration
data released today. That sent area stockpiles up 1.78 million
barrels to  74.4 million .  Operations increased as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Meraux,
Louisiana, plant, and Phillips 66’s  Borger,  Texas , refinery
finished planned work. The two plants can process a combined
281,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  discount  for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
on the Gulf Coast weakened 0.25 cent to 17.5 cents a gallon
below New York Mercantile Exchange futures at 12:15 p.m.
Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, was  unchanged  at a premium of
3.25 cents a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , widened 15 cents to $22.18 a barrel. The same
spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil slid $1.10 to $12.03 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
