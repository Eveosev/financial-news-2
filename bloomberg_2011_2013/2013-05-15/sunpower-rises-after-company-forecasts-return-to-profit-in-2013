SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , the second-largest
U.S. solar manufacturer, surged to a 21-month high after saying
increased revenue from large solar power plants and rooftop
systems may produce its first annual profit since 2010.  SunPower climbed 8.5 percent to $20.65, the highest since
July 2011, at the close in New York. The shares have more than
tripled this year.  Revenue this year will be in the range of $2.6 billion to
$2.7 billion, the  San Jose , California-based company said today
in a statement. That’s higher than the $2.42 billion the company
reported last year and the $2.57 billion average of 15 analysts’
 estimates  for 2013 compiled by Bloomberg. That will yield
results ranging from a loss of 5 cents a share to net income of
20 cents.  The company, which hasn’t reported an annual profit since
2010, is expected to lose 28.5 cents a share this year, the
average of eight estimates. SunPower is majority-owned by the
French  oil company  Total SA  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  is the largest U.S. solar manufacturer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
