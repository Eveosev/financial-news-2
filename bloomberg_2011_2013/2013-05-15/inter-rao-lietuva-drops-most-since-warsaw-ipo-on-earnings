Inter RAO Lietuva AB slumped the most
since the Baltic power distributor started trading in Warsaw in
December after reporting a 52 percent drop in first-quarter
profit.  The stock fell as much as 8.9 percent and traded 7.3
percent lower at 27.5 zloty as of 2:05 p.m. in Warsaw, valuing
the company at 550 million zloty ($169 million). The volume of
shares traded was twice the 30-day average, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  The Vilnius, Lithuania-based unit of  Russia ’s state-controlled electricity company  OAO Inter RAO UES (IRAO)  had net income
of 9.3 million litai ($3.5 million) in January-March, compared
with 19.3 million litai a year earlier, it said in a regulatory
statement late yesterday.  Profit was hurt by reduced demand for power in the Baltic
region and competition from Nordic producers as well as by costs
related to the company’s December initial public offering,
according to the statement.  The company sold 23.4 million euros of shares in the IPO at
5.85 euros, or 24.17 zloty each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
