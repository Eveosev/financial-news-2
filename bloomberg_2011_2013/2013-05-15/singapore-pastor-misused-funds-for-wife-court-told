Singapore’s  City Harvest Church 
founder Kong Hee conspired with five others to misuse S$50.6
million ($41 million) of the church’s funds to promote his
wife’s music career, a prosecutor said at the start of a trial.  Kong and the others devised sham bond investments to
embezzle S$24 million, money meant for a new church building,
using most of it to finance Ho Yeow Sun’s pop singing work,
prosecutor Mavis Chionh said today in a Singapore subordinate
court. Ho isn’t charged with any offence.  “The evidence will show that the offenses were part of a
deliberately planned, meticulously coordinated and carefully
executed scheme,” Chionh said.  Four of them, not including Kong, illegally used an
additional S$26.6 million to try and hide the misappropriation,
prosecutors say. All six pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Kong
faces a jail term of as long as 20 years and a fine for each of
the three counts of misappropriation.  The trial is the largest graft case involving a  Singapore 
charity. The city’s  Commissioner of Charities  has proposed
removing Kong as a governing board member of the church. City
Harvest has said it stands by Kong and the others charged and
denied allegations it was cheated of the money.  Singapore’s white-collar crime agency, the Commercial
Affairs Department, and the charities’ commissioner began
investigating the church in May 2010.  City Harvest had 19,819 followers in 2012, according to its
 website . The church, registered as a charity since 1993, had
earnings of about S$72 million for the year ended Oct. 31, 2009,
according to the regulator of charities.  The church in 2010 proposed to spend S$310 million for a
stake in the Suntec International Convention & Exhibition Centre
as well as related rent and renovation costs related to the use
of that space for its services.  The criminal case is: Prosecutor v. Kong Hee.
