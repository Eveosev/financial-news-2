Brazil ’s retail  sales  fell less than
analysts expected in March prompting traders to raise bets the
central bank may step up the pace of interest rate increases to
tame inflation.  Sales fell 0.1 percent from the previous month, after
falling a revised 0.5 percent in February, the national
statistics agency said today in Rio de Janeiro. The number was
lower than the negative 0.5 percent median  estimate  of 31
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Retail sales grew 4.5 percent
from a year-earlier, compared with a  forecast  for a 3.6 percent
increase.  Brazil’s consumer market in 2012 remained the bright spot
of the slowest-growing economy among the BRICS group that also
includes  Russia ,  India ,  China  and South Africa. This year,
inflation running near the top of the central bank’s target
range is eroding purchasing power, leading retail sales to
contract for a second straight month.  The monetary policy committee voted to raise  borrowing
costs  by a quarter-point to 7.50 percent last month, reversing a
rate-cutting cycle that began in August 2011.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.44 percent at 9:25 a.m. local time, as
traders bet the central bank may raise the key rate by half a
percentage point this month.  The real gained 0.1 percent to 2.0187 per U.S. dollar.  The retail sales decline included a 2.1 percent fall in
supermarkets and hypermarkets, including food, beverages and
tobacco. The broader retail index, which includes cars and
construction materials, rose 0.2 percent after dropping in
February, the agency said today.  Brazil’s  gross domestic product  expanded 0.9 percent in
2012, down from 2.7 percent in 2011 and 7.5 percent in 2010.
Economists in the latest central bank survey forecast growth of
3 percent this year, with 5.8 percent inflation. The central
bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  Inflation, which has remained above the 4.5 percent mid-point of the target since central bank president Alexandre
Tombini took office in January 2011, quickened to 6.49 percent
in April.  Tombini, in an interview with Globo television on May 10,
said policy makers “will do what’s needed” to slow inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
