Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) ,  Europe ’s second-largest clothing retailer, reported growth in monthly revenue
that missed estimates as a cold start to April weighed on sales
of spring fashions.  Revenue at stores and operations open at least a year rose
1 percent compared with a year earlier, the Stockholm-based
company said in a statement today, less than the 4.2 percent
average estimate in a SME Direkt survey. Total sales advanced 11
percent, missing a predicted 13 percent increase.  Unseasonably cold weather in the early weeks of April hurt
business, mostly in Europe, H&M said. Still, the gain in same-store sales ended a sequence of six straight monthly declines.  “I guess I and the market had underestimated the effect of
the cold weather,” said Soeren Loentoft Hansen, an analyst at
 Sydbank A/S. (SYDB)  “And easy comparables, due to calendar effects,
couldn’t compensate for this very cold month.”  H&M fell 1.2 percent to 231.80 kronor as of 9:04 a.m. in
Stockholm trading, trimming this year’s gain to 3.3 percent.  H&M, which this week became the first retailer to sign an
agreement enhancing fire and building safety in  Bangladesh  where
it is one of the biggest buyers of clothing, said it had 2,881
stores at the end of April, up from 2,549 a year ago. It plans
to open 350 this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
