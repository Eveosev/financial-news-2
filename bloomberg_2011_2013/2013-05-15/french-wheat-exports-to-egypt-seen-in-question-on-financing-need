Potential French wheat exports to
 Egypt , the world’s largest importer of the grain, are in
question because the North African country requires financing of
purchases, according to crop office FranceAgrimer.  “If the Russians agree to finance, then they will get the
wheat orders,” Remi Haquin, the president of FranceAgriMer’s
cereal council, told reporters today at a meeting in Montreuil-sous-Bois,  France . “Russia and the U.S. have financing.”  Egypt will curb wheat imports by 31 percent to 8 million
metric tons in 2012-13, still enough to make it the world’s
biggest buyer, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
