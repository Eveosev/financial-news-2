Asian  shares  rose as the Nikkei 225
Stock Average closed above 15,000 for the first time since 2007
after the yen touched a 4 1/2-year low against the dollar,
boosting the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters.  Sony Corp. surged 10 percent as billionaire Daniel Loeb
pushed for the initial public offering of the Japanese
electronics maker’s entertainment business.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
the world’s biggest carmaker, climbed 3.7 percent in Tokyo.  Li &

of 6:20 p.m. in Tokyo, with about two shares rising for each

yesterday as the Bank of  Japan  took steps to counter deflation
and policy makers in the U.S. and Europe remained on standby to
buoy growth.  “Every time the yen falls below a key level, the Nikkei
passes another milestone because it boosts corporate profits,
especially for manufacturers,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.,
which oversees the equivalent of $100 billion. “Stocks should
rise further as investors acknowledge the impact of government
policy. Given that, I don’t think stocks are that expensive.”  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 14.4 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 21 for the Nikkei
225, 15 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.4 for the

the lowest since October 2008, before trading at 102.39 at 5:08
p.m. in Tokyo.  The yen fell 18 percent against the dollar this year
through yesterday as the Bank of Japan introduced unprecedented
monetary easing and the U.S. economy showed recovery signs. A
weaker yen enhances overseas earnings at Japanese exporters.  The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  gained 0.4 percent. Chinese Premier
Li Keqiang signaled policy makers are reluctant to use stimulus
to counter an economic slowdown. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
rose 0.5 percent and  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index advanced 0.8 percent.
South Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.1 percent.  Australia Deficit  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 0.6 percent after

the biggest advance on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The maker of

yen. The projection beats the 152.9 billion average estimate of
10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the 422 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
