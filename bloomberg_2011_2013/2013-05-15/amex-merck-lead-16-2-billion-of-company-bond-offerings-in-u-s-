American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, and drugmaker  Merck & Co. (MRK)  led
borrowers selling or planning to issue at least $16.5 billion of
bonds in the U.S. today.  Merck, which yesterday had its unsecured  debt rating  cut
one level by Moody’s Investors Service, sold $6.5 billion of
bonds in six parts to fund share repurchases, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The biggest slice of the issue from Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based Merck was for $1.75 billion of 2.8 percent, 10-year
notes that yield 87 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. That compares with a 75 basis-point spread on $1 billion of 2.4 percent bonds due 2022 that
the drugmaker sold in September.  AmEx issued $1.85 billion consisting of $1 billion of 1.55
percent, five-year securities that pay 75 basis points more than
benchmarks and $850 million of five-year, floating notes at 59
basis points more than Libor, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will
be used to repay $1 billion of 4.875 percent debt maturing July
15, the company said in a regulatory filing.  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) , the third-largest U.S. hospital
company, issued $1.05 billion of 4.375 percent, 8.5-year secured
notes at a relative yield of 271 basis points, Bloomberg data
show. Proceeds will be used to redeem $925 million of 8.875
percent, first-lien securities due July 2019, according to a
company statement distributed today by  Business Wire . The new
securities are rated B+ by  Standard & Poor’s .  Tenet Healthcare  The extra yield investors demand to own dollar-denominated
corporate bonds rather than government debentures has increased
2 basis points this week to 203 basis points after reaching a
more than five-year low of 201 basis points on May 7, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Merck’s offering included $1 billion of 0.7 percent, three-year debt priced to yield 32 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $500 million of three-year, floating-rate notes that pay 19 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, the data show.  The company also sold $1 billion of five-year, floating
notes at a spread of 36 basis points more than Libor, an equal
portion of 1.3 percent, five-year securities at 52 basis points
more than benchmarks, and $1.25 billion of 4.15 percent, 30-year
debentures at 102, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
