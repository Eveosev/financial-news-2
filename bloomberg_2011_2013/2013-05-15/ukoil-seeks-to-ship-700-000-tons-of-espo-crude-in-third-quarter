OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer that isn’t state-owned, requested permission from the
Energy Ministry to export as much as 700,000 metric tons of East
Siberia-Pacific Ocean crude from the port of Kozmino.  Lukoil, the only one of Russia’s five-biggest producers not
to have shipped crude via the ESPO pipeline, will send the east-bound volumes from its west Siberian fields,  Dmitry Dolgov , a
company spokesman, said today by telephone from Moscow.  The company requested 600,000 tons of ESPO volumes in the
second quarter. It is expected to send its first 100,000-ton
cargo to Kozmino for loading from June 29 to July 2, according
to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
