“Angry Birds,” the  video game  that
conquered small screens to become the top-selling mobile-phone
application of all time, is coming to the big screen.  The animated 3-D film is being developed, produced and
financed by the game’s publisher, Espoo, Finland-based Rovio
Entertainment Oy, and will be distributed by Sony Pictures
Entertainment on July 1, 2016, the companies said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Sony Pictures was among several major Hollywood studios to
seek distribution rights for a film version of the game, in
which players use a virtual slingshot to hurl birds at targets,
the companies said. Versions of the game have been downloaded
more than 1.7 billion times and a cartoon series, available on
some video-on-demand channels, has attracted more than 150
million views.  Closely held Rovio, founded in 2003, also produces the
mobile games “The Croods,” based on the  DreamWorks Animation
SKG (DWA)  movie, “Tiny Thief,” and “Icebreaker.”  Sony Pictures is based in Culver City, California and is
owned by Tokyo-based  Sony Corp. (6758)  The parent’s American depositary
receipts fell 1.5 percent to $20.45 at the close in New York.
They have gained 83 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
