PPR SA (PP) , the Paris-based luxury and
sporting goods group, will start making branded leather goods in
 Serbia , lured by state incentives for new jobs.  PPR, which is being renamed Kering, will invest 6 million
euros ($7.7 million) in a tannery in Ruma, northwest of
Belgrade, receiving 8,000 euros for each of 120 employees it
plans to hire,  Serbia Investment and Export Promotion Agency , or
SIEPA, said in an e-mailed statement.  Kering bought bankrupt Ruma Fabrika Koze AD earlier this
year and will reopen it as Luxury Tannery DOO, SIEPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
