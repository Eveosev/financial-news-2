An  SSE Plc (SSE)  venture and  Fluor Corp. (FLR) 
ended a contractual dispute relating to wind-turbine foundations
at a North Sea offshore wind farm.  Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Ltd., owned by Perth,
Scotland-based SSE and  RWE AG (RWE) , reached agreement with Fluor on
all outstanding claims relating to the construction of the 500-megawatt Greater Gabbard facility, SSE said today in an e-mailed
statement without giving terms of the accord.  The main claim related to the quality of as many as 52
upper foundations forming the base on which the turbine stands,
and 35 lower foundations supporting the same machines, according
to the statement. Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds is “now
confident about the long-term structural integrity of the
disputed foundations,” it said in the statement.  Fluor said in a separate statement it built “a safe, fit-for-purpose facility” and that the agreement resolves all
disputes, ends its involvement in the venture and has no
material financial impact on the Irving, Texas-based company.  “The agreement between GGOWL and Fluor is a positive
development, bringing to an end the contractual dispute between
the two parties,” Iwan Tukalo, general manager at GGOWL, said
in today’s statement.  All 140 turbines at the park have been
operational since September, according to SSE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
