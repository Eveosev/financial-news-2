Malaysia  left the tax on crude palm
oil exports unchanged for a fourth month in June as the world’s
second-largest producer seeks to increase shipments and trim
inventories amid a decline in prices. Futures fell.  Shipments will be taxed at 4.5 percent next month as the
reference price was set at 2,332.02 ringgit ($777) a metric ton,
within the minimum band for a levy to be applied, according to a
Customs Department statement. The tariff was zero in January and
February before being raised to 4.5 percent in March.  Futures plunged 29 percent in the past year as production
outpaced demand, boosting inventories in Malaysia to a record in
December. The Malaysian government said in October it would cut
the export tax to between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent from about
23 percent to help trim the stockpiles and compete with
 Indonesia , the largest producer.  “The tax was within market expectations as price had been
hovering within that tax bracket,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head of
trading at LT International Futures Sdn., said by phone from
Kuala Lumpur. “Exports from Malaysia will not receive much help
from the tax being kept unchanged as Indonesia is more
competitive.”  Exports from Malaysia fell 7.6 percent to 599,300 tons in
the first 15 days of this month, surveyor Intertek said today.
Shipments dropped 5.6 percent to 1.45 million tons in April,
while inventories declined 11 percent to 1.93 million tons, the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board said May 10.  Indonesia cut its  export duty  to 9 percent this month from
10.5 percent the previous month.  The July-delivery contract dropped as much as 1.1 percent
to 2,277 ringgit a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, and
was at 2,280 ringgit at 11 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures fell
3.9 percent in April, falling for a third month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
