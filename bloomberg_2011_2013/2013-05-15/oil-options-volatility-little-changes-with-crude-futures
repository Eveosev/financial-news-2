Crude oil options volatility rose
along with the underlying futures on speculation that central
banks may take stimulus measures.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 21.6 percent at 3:20 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 21.5 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery rose 9
cents to settle at $94.30 a barrel on the Nymex, the first
advance in five days. July-delivery futures gained 8 cents to
$94.56 a barrel.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts, which fell 4 cents to 3 cents a barrel on volume
of 6,322 contracts. June $95 calls were the second-most active
with 5,545 lots. They dropped 16 cents to 27 cents a barrel.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, made up 56 percent of
electronic trading volume today. Calls, or bullish bets, made up
53 percent of yesterdayâ€™s volume of 120,718 contracts.  June $95 puts were the most-active options traded in the
previous session, rising 41 cents to $1.22 a barrel on volume of
5,939 lots. June $95 calls, with 5,388 contracts, fell 55 cents
