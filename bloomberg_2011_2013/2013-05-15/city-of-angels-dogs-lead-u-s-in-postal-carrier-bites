Postal carriers in  Los Angeles  are
most at risk for being bitten by dogs while doing their jobs, so
much so that mail delivery may be curbed if residents don’t
control dangerous mutts, the U.S. Postal Service said.  Last year, 69 mail carriers were attacked by dogs in Los
Angeles, a city of about 3.8 million people, the Postal Service
said today in an e-mailed statement. San Antonio and Seattle
tied for second with 42 bites apiece, followed by Chicago with
41. While  New York , the largest U.S. city, didn’t make the top
20, its borough of  Brooklyn  did with 26 bites.  “If our letter carriers deem your loose dog to be a
threat, you’ll be asked to pick up your mail at the post office
until it’s safe to deliver,” Ken Snavely, acting postmaster of
Los Angeles, said in the statement.  The  Postal Service , which  delivers  528 million pieces of
mail per day, offers tips to dog owners such as giving them
attention so they’re socialized well and keeping them in another
room or on a leash when the mail is delivered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
