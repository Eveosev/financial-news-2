Swiss stocks  may surge 17 percent by
the end of the year if a key resistance level is breached,
according to a technical analyst at ING Groep NV.  The benchmark  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  may climb as high as
9,548.09, a level last reached almost six years ago, if it
crosses above 8,294.19, said Roelof-Jan van den Akker. The
resistance represents the 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of
the decline from June 2007 through March 2009 in the aftermath
of the financial crisis. The 9,548.09 level is a gain of 17
percent from yesterday’s closing price.  “It has been a fantastic bull run,” Van den Akker said.
“We’re entering a stronger resistance area in the short term.
Looking at the longer term, there is still no reason to be
bearish. Markets should only take a breather before they
continue the trend.”  The SMI rose 1 percent to 8,266.62 at 2:44 p.m. in Zurich
as the Swiss franc weakened and Bank of England Governor Mervyn
King said a U.K. economic recovery is “in sight.” The gauge
 has surged  21 percent so far this year, the best start to a year
since 1997, as companies reported better-than-estimated earnings
and central banks continued to stimulate the global economy.  Van den Akker said the 8,600 level is the next short-term
resistance the index has to breach. Stocks may drop towards the
8,150 support level before resuming the rally, he said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
