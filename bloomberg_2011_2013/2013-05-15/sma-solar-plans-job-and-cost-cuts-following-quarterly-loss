SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) , the world’s
biggest maker of inverters, will cut jobs and costs to offset a
quarterly operating loss and sales that dropped by half in the
past year.  SMA needs to reduce headcount in its European sales and
service business, with most of the cuts to take place in
 Germany , Chief Executive Officer Pierre-Pascal Urbon told
analysts today on a conference call. The Niestetal, Germany-based company said it had a loss before interest and tax of 8.4
million euros ($11 million) in the first quarter of 2013.  “Measured in euro, the global photovoltaic market will
decline in 2013 for the first time in many years,” Urbon said
in a website  statement . “As the global market leader, we will
be especially affected by this. Therefore, we are forced to
adjust the personnel structures to the changes in underlying
conditions and the lower level of sales in the upcoming
months.”  SMA, a Niestetal-based supplier of inverters that convert
power from photovoltaic panels for use in the grid, in February
predicted a “tough year” for the solar industry and said it
may lose money in 2013, a forecast it confirmed today. Sales
fell 48 percent to 212.31 million euros compared to the same
period a year ago amid pricing pressure and falling subsidies
and demand for solar energy in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
