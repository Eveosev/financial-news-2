West Texas Intermediate crude was
little changed as equities gained on speculation of central-bank
stimulus measures after economic reports from the U.S. and
 Europe  missed forecasts.  Prices rose 9 cents, reversing a 2.2 percent intraday drop,
as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed to a record. Futures
tumbled earlier after U.S. industrial production fell by the
most in eight months in April, manufacturing in the New York
region unexpectedly shrank in May and the  euro-area economy 
contracted more than forecast in the first quarter. Fuel demand
slid 3.1 percent last week in a government report today.  “Bad news is good news,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago. “People look at
the bad macroeconomic picture and they think that the odds are
greater for the central banks to do something.”  WTI for June delivery settled at $94.30 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the first advance in five days. The
volume of all contracts traded was 30 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day at 3:04 p.m. Prices have increased
2.7 percent this year.  Brent for June settlement rose $1.08, or 1.1 percent, to
$103.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The volume of contracts traded was 23 percent higher
than the 100-day average.  The front-month European benchmark’s premium to WTI widened
99 cents to $9.38, the widest gap since April 26. It closed at
$7.65 on May 13, the narrowest spread since January 2011.  S&P 500  The  S&P 500  climbed as much as 0.7 percent to a record
1,661.49, erasing an earlier loss of 0.2 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 0.6 percent.  “We are moving with the equities,” said Bill Baruch, a
senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in Chicago. “Stocks
are pulling oil up.”  The  Federal Reserve  said on May 1 that it will keep buying
bonds at a monthly pace of $85 billion while standing ready to
raise or lower purchases as economic conditions evolve.  Output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities decreased 0.5
percent after a revised 0.3 percent gain in March that was
weaker than previously reported, the Fed said today.  Manufacturing in New York, northern  New Jersey  and
 Connecticut  declined for the first time since January, the
 Federal Reserve Bank of New York  reported. The New York Fed’s
general economic index decreased to minus 1.4 this month from
3.1 in April. Readings less than zero signal contraction.  The U.S. used 21 percent of world’s oil in 2011, according
to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  Fuel Consumption  Fuel consumption slipped by 584,000 barrels last week to
18.5 million barrels a day, the Energy Information
Administration reported today.  Gasoline demand  slid 1.2 percent
to 8.34 million barrels a day, the lowest level since March 15.
Consumption of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
decreased 2.4 percent.  “The demand data is tepid at best,” said  Chip Hodge , who
oversees a $9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior
managing director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston .
“Supplies remain at high levels and the most recent economic
numbers are muted.”  Crude Stockpiles  Crude inventories decreased 624,000 barrels to 394.9
million, according to the EIA, Department of Energy’s
statistical arm. Last week, they were at the highest level since
1931. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a gain of 450,000.
Production declined 48,000 barrels a day to 7.32 million in the
week ended May 10 from the most since February 1992.  “I am looking at the DOE report and it certainly doesn’t
look like a bullish one,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the
Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .  Gasoline supplies surged 1.2 percent to 217.7 million
barrels, and distillate stockpiles climbed 2 percent to 119.9
million barrels, the EIA said. Analysts had expected a decline
in gasoline stocks. Refinery utilization increased 1 percentage
point to 88 percent, the highest level since Jan. 4.  “You have this huge build in gasoline that people weren’t
expecting,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “Crude should really be
moving lower.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 21.5 percent at 3 p.m., compared with 21.5 percent
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 633,971
contracts as of 3:05 p.m. It totaled 611,364 contracts in the
previous session, 5.7 percent above the three-month average.
