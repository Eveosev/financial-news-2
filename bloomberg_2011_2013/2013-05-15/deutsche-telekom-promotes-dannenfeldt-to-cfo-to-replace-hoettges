Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  promoted Thomas Dannenfeldt to finance chief, replacing Timotheus Hoettges, who
is preparing to take over as chief executive officer at
Germany’s largest phone company next year.  Dannenfeldt, 46, has been with the company for two decades
and has overseen finances at the German division the past three
years, Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom said in a statement today.
CEO Rene Obermann, who announced his decision to step down last
December, is set to join Dutch cable operator  Ziggo NV. (ZIGGO)   Dannenfeldt will be responsible for finances at a company
with $75 billion in annual sales and that has just completed a
merger of its U.S. wireless business with MetroPCS
Communications Inc., gaining a U.S. listing for T-Mobile US.  Germany ’s former phone monopoly is also preparing to speed
up its fixed-line Internet to fend off cable providers in its
home market while trying to limit the damage from the economic
crisis on its European operations.  Dannenfeldt, who joined T-Mobile Germany in 1992, studied
business mathematics at the University of Trier. He was in
charge of finance at T-Mobile Germany from 2009, and was
previously responsible for managing the company’s European sales
and supply chain and worked on cost-cut programs.  Deutsche Telekom also extended German chief Niek Jan van Damme’s contract ahead of time, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
