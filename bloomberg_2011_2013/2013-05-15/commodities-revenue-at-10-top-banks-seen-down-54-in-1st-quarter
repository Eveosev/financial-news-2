Commodities revenue at the 10 largest
banks fell 54 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,
according to analytics company Coalition.  Commodities revenue of the top banks in the Coalition  index 
dropped to $1.2 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier, the
London-based Coalition said in an e-mailed report today. Revenue
fell 24 percent last year, it said in February.  “Low volatility, reduced client activity, and a shift of
institutional investment out of the asset class meant index
revenues halved,” Coalition said in response to questions from
Bloomberg. “Weak performance, capital constraints and
regulatory challenges caused some banks to re-evaluate the scope
and scale of their commitment to parts of the commodities
business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
