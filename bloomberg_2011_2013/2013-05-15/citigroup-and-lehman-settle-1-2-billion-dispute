A federal judge approved a settlement
between  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and defunct Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
over disputed amounts owed on foreign-exchange trades. Citigroup
was granted a right to a $1.2 billion priority claim while
paying Lehman $167 million, according to an order signed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. Larger sums remain in
dispute, the parties said in the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
