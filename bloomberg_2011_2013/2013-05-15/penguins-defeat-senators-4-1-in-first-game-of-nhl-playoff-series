The Pittsburgh Penguins beat the
Ottawa Senators 4-1 in the first game of their National Hockey
League Playoff series.  Paul Martin  got the opening goal for the Penguins on a
power play at Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh. Colin Greening
tied it for Ottawa and Evgeni Malkin also scored in the first
period for the home team.  Chris Kunitz  added a third goal for
Pittsburgh on a power play near the end of the second period and
Pascal Dupuis scored a shorthanded goal in the third.  Pittsburgh also hosts Game 2 in the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference series on May 17. The winner of the second-round
matchup will face the Boston Bruins or the New York Rangers for
a place in the Stanley Cup Final. That series gets under way May
16 in Boston.  Also tonight, the defending Stanley Cup champion Los
Angeles Kings host the  San Jose Sharks  in the first game of
their Western Conference series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
