Peru ’s sol slumped the most in two
years after a report showed economic growth slowed in March more
than analysts forecast.  The sol dropped 1 percent to 2.6290 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, the weakest level on a closing basis since May 2,
when it fell to a 10-month low, according to prices from
Datatec. Today’s decline was the steepest since June 2011.  Economic activity  expanded 3 percent in March from a year
earlier, the slowest pace since October 2009, the national
statistics agency said today. The median forecast of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for 4.5 percent growth.
Manufacturing output contracted and construction and retail
growth slowed, the agency reported.  “The economic data were really surprising,” said Hedmond Rios, an economist at Celfin Capital in Santiago. “We should
see a shift in monetary policy via a relaxing of reserve
requirements.”  Peru’s central bank raised reserve requirements four times
from January through April to curb demand for dollar loans.
Policy makers have kept the target lending rate at 4.25 percent
since May 2011.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond
due in August 2020 declined three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.79 percent at 2:43 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
