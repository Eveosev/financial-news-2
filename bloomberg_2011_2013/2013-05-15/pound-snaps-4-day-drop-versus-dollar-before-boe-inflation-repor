The pound strengthened the most in
two weeks against the euro after the  Bank of England  upgraded
its estimate of the U.K. economy and Governor  Mervyn King  said a
recovery was now “in sight.”  Sterling advanced against all except one of its 16 major
counterparts after the central bank’s quarterly Inflation Report
predicted growth may quicken to 0.5 percent this quarter from
0.3 percent during the previous three months. The pound also
rallied after a report showed U.K.  jobless claims  declined in
April even as unemployment increased.  Government bonds  fell,
pushing yields to the highest level in two months.  “The pound is reacting to the headlines on slightly higher
growth and lower inflation forecasts from the Bank of  England ,”
said  Gavin Friend , a currency strategist at National Australia
Bank Ltd. in  London . “It fits with the run of U.K. data we’ve
had recently. There’s a sense that some of the worst is over,
but the economy is still flatlining.”  The pound advanced 0.5 percent to 84.53 pence per euro at
4:20 p.m. London time after gaining as much as 0.7 percent, the
most since May 2. Sterling was little changed at $1.5211 after
appreciating as much as 0.4 percent.  The Bank of England increased its growth projections for
the next three years in its Inflation Report and predicted
inflation will peak at 3.1 percent in the third quarter, lower
than expected in February.  ‘Welcome Change’  “There is a welcome change in the economic outlook,” King
said at a press conference in London, his last before retiring
as central bank governor. “We don’t see a particularly rapid
recovery in the next few quarters but we do see a recovery and I
think there are good reasons for that.”  Jobless claims  fell 7,300 in April from the previous month,
when they dropped 7,000, the  Office for National Statistics  said
in London. Unemployment as measured by International Labour
Organisation methods rose 15,000 in the first quarter to 2.52
million, a rate of 7.8 percent.  The pound has appreciated 1.7 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar advanced 2.2 percent
and the euro appreciated 0.7 percent.  Gilts Decline  The 10-year gilt yield climbed two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.92 percent after rising to 1.95 percent,
the highest level since March 15. The 1.75 percent bond maturing
in September 2022 fell 0.135, or 1.35 pounds per 1,000 pound
face amount, to 98.60.  “The inflation report wasn’t particularly constructive
from a gilt perspective,” said Jason Simpson, a strategist at
 Banco Santander  SA in London. “The message is that things are
recovering. It was pretty much as we expected but it left a few
people in the gilt market a little disappointed. It’s not a big
departure from what we’ve seen before.”  Banco Santander forecasts the 10-year yield will climb to
2.75 percent by year-end, Simpson said. The rate will increase
to 2.18 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists
with the latest estimates given the heaviest weighting.  The 10-year  break-even  rate, a gauge of inflation
expectations derived from the difference between yields on
conventional gilts and index-linked securities, fell one basis
point to 3.17 percentage points.  The Debt Management Office will sell as much as 2.5 billion
pounds of 30-year bonds tomorrow.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.7 percent this month
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bunds fell 0.9 percent and Treasuries slid 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
