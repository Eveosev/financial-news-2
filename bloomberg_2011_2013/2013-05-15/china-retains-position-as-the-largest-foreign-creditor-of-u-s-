China  retained its lead over  Japan  as
the largest foreign creditor to America in March, U.S. Treasury
Department data show.  China’s  holdings  of Treasuries fell 0.1 percent in March to
$1.25 trillion, while Japan reduced its  stake  by 0.05 percent to
$1.1 trillion, according to data released yesterday. China held
11 percent of the  U.S. debt , compared with 9.7 percent by Japan.
China’s stake reached a record $1.31 trillion in July 2011.  Demand for the U.S. debt from  overseas  investors slowed in
March as  U.S. economy  showed signs of improvement and as
speculation increased that Japan would expand its purchases of
its own  government securities . The Treasury 10-year note reached
2.08 percent on March 11, the highest this year. Yields declined
later in the month on concern financial turmoil in Cyprus would
renew the euro region’s sovereign debt crisis.  “China’s showed continued faith in the U.S. over the long
run, otherwise you wouldn’t be adding $100 billion over the last
few months,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
securities with the  Federal Reserve .  Foreign currency reserves held by China have risen 4.8
percent since September to $3.44 trillion, according to the
People’s Bank of China. The nation’s Treasury holdings increased
$96.9 billion in that period.  Revisions to the data showed China held $1.2519 trillion of
Treasuries in February, more than the $1.2229 trillion first
reported for the period on April 15. The Treasury is revising
the data on a monthly basis rather than annually based on the
nationality of the beneficial holder of the debt, while the
initial data will still count the location of the purchase. For
the year, China’s holdings grew $30.1 billion, or 2.5 percent.  ‘Better Risk’  China also added $5.7 billion of agency securities, the
most since September, and $1 billion of corporate bonds in
March, Treasury data show.  “The fact that we’re seeing a reach for yield within the
sphere of U.S. debt is an indication that there’s a perception
of a better risk profile for  dollar -based assets than, say,
 Europe ,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The benchmark 10-year note yield fell three basis points or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.85 percent in March. The yield fell
four basis points to 1.94 percent yesterday in New York.  Increased Demand  Holdings of Treasuries outside the U.S. rose in February by
$39.6 billion, or 0.7 percent, to $5.758 trillion, the 15th
consecutive monthly increase, the data show. Foreign investors
have boosted their holdings 3.3 percent in the first three
months of 2013 after climbing 11.3 percent in 2012 and 12.8
percent in 2011.  The U.S.  marketable borrowing  reached $11.4 trillion in
March, and was up 11.2 percent for all of 2012, Treasury data
show.  Foreign investors owned 50.5 percent of the marketable
debt, the data, known as Treasury International Capital, show.
Of the $5.758 trillion Treasuries held outside of the U.S., 71.2
percent, or $4.099 trillion, are owned by  official institutions 
including central banks, finance ministries and other fiscal
agents, Treasury data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
