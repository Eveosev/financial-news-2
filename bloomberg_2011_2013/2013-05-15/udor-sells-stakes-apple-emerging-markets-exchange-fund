Apple, valued at $205.5 million at the end of March, according
to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange

financial companies its largest U.S.-listed equity holding.  Tudor also sold its stake  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , while buying
shares of  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , its largest new purchase.  Patrick Clifford, a spokesman for Tudor at Abernathy
