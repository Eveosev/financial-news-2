Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest insurer, may report an unchanged first-quarter profit in the absence of large natural catastrophe
losses.  Net income was probably $1.14 billion, unchanged from the
year-earlier period, according to the average  estimate  of 10
 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Zurich Insurance will report
earnings tomorrow at 6:45 a.m. local time.  Operating profit from general insurance, the company’s
largest business, may decline 4.4 percent to $818 million after
tripling in the year-earlier quarter, analysts said. Operating
profit from its unit selling life and pension products probably
rose 16 percent to $339 million with the acquisition of a Latin
American insurance business from  Banco Santander (SAN)  last year.  The following is a table of analyst estimates and year-earlier figures in millions of dollars, apart from the combined
ratio, which is a percentage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
