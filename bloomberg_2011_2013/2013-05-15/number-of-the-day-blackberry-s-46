Nearly half of BlackBerry's sales last quarter -- 46 percent -- came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Bloomberg News reporter Hugo Miller  reported . That's up from 37 percent three quarters earlier. The struggling Waterloo, Ontario-based company is counting on growth in emerging markets with its  cheaper smartphone, the Q5 , and a plan to expand its popular  instant-messaging service .  Will the strategy pay off? Shares fell 4 percent yesterday, the most in a week.  The stock  is down again at the moment.
