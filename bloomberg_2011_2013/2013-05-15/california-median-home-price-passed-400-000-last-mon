California ’s median home price
surpassed $400,000 for the first time in five years as rising
demand and a tight supply of properties for sale drove up
values, the state’s Realtors association said today.  The median price for an existing, single-family detached
home climbed to $402,760 last month, up from $378,960 in March
and the first time since April 2008 that the $400,000 mark was
exceeded, the Los Angeles-based group said in a statement.  Mortgage rates  close to record lows and a limited number of
properties for sale are combining to increase competition and
boost prices throughout the U.S. In California, the amount of
unsold inventory dropped to 2.8 months -- the time it would take
to sell the supply of homes at the current pace -- from 4.2
months a year earlier. A six-to-seven-month supply is considered
normal, the Realtors association said.  In the San Francisco Bay area, the median home price was
higher than $500,000 for the first time in almost five years,
research firm DataQuick said today in a separate report. The
median in the nine-county area rose almost 31 percent from a
year earlier to $510,000. The half-million-dollar mark was last
surpassed in May 2004, the San Diego-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
