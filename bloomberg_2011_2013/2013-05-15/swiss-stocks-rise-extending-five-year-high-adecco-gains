Swiss stocks rose for a second day,
extending the benchmark Swiss Market Index’s highest level in
more than five years.  Adecco SA (ADEN)  led gains on the  SMI (SMI) , rising 1.4 percent.  Roche
Holding AG (ROG)  gained after it won U.S. approval to sell a gene
mutation test.  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  dropped 1.4 percent after the stock
was downgraded at UBS AG.  The SMI jumped 0.6 percent to 8,235.32 at 9:22 a.m. in
Zurich, its highest level since Jan. 14, 2008. The gauge has
rallied 21 percent so far in 2013, its best start to a year
since 1998. The broader Swiss Performance Index also increased
0.6 percent today.  First-quarter gross domestic product in  Germany  rose 0.1
percent from the fourth quarter, when it fell a downwardly
revised 0.7 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said today. Economists forecast a 0.3 percent gain, according to
the median of 41 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The
French economy fell into its second recession in a year, with
output contracting 0.2 percent in the three months through
March.  Adecco, the world’s largest supplier of temporary workers,
gained 1.4 percent to 55.15 francs, rising for a fourth day.  Roche rose 0.9 percent to 246.10 francs. The world’s
biggest maker of cancer drugs won U.S. approval to sell a gene-mutation test that can help doctors pinpoint patients’
likelihood to respond to a popular treatment for  lung cancer .  Actelion, the Swiss drugmaker, slid 1.4 percent to 58.90
francs. The stock was downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS,
which said the share price is almost in line with its estimates
and could see volatility ahead of the approval of its Opsumit
drug in October 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
