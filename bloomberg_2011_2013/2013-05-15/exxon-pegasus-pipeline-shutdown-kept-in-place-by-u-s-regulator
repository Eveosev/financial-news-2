Restrictions on  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s
Pegasus crude oil pipeline, shut since March 29 after a spill,
remain in place after the company requested changes in a hearing
held on May 2, according to a  filing  from federal regulators.  Exxon told the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration that a 211-mile (340-kilometer) southern section
of the pipeline presented less risk because it was constructed
more recently than the northern leg that spilled about 5,000
barrels of oil near Mayflower, Arkansas.  The regulators pointed out at the hearing that the newer
section, built in 1954, and had a seam failure during a prior
hydrostatic test, according to a decision from Jeffrey Wiese,
associate administrator for pipeline safety. The corrective
action order preventing the line’s restart was kept in place,
with  modifications  to future limitations on pressure.  On April 30, Exxon found a second leak on Pegasus in
Doniphan,  Missouri . The shutdown of the line, which delivers
about 96,000 barrels a day to  Gulf Coast refineries  from Patoka,
 Illinois , helped back up oil supplies in the central U.S. Exxon
hasn’t provided a timeline for restarting Pegasus or filed a
plan with federal regulators to return it to service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
