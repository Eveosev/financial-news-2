Cotton futures fell, heading for the
third decline in four sessions, on mounting concern that global
supplies will be more than sufficient to meet demand.  Orange
juice  fell for the first time in a week.  Global inventories of cotton on July 31, 2014, will climb
9.4 percent from a year earlier to a record 92.74 million bales,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said May 10. A bale weighs
480 pounds, or 218 kilograms. The  International Cotton Advisory
Committee  on May 1 boosted its inventory forecast for next year
by 11 percent from a month-earlier estimate.  “There’s a lot of surplus you’ve got to go through,”
 Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port
St. Lucie, Florida, said in a telephone interview. “It looks
like we’re going to have some big crops.”  Cotton for July delivery slumped 0.9 percent to 86.11 cents
a pound at 12:03 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Prices
are up 16 percent this year through yesterday.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery dropped 1.4 percent
to $1.466 a pound. Prices rallied 7 percent in the five sessions
through yesterday. Futures may have “got ahead of themselves”
and are “taking a breather” today, Smith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
