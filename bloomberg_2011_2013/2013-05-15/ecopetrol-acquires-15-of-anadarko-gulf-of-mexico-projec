Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-run
oil company, acquired a 15 percent stake in the Deep Nansen
prospect in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from Anadarko Petroleum
Corp.  The deal with Ecopetrol occurred last month,  John
Christiansen , a spokesman for Anadarko, said in an e-mail today.
Christiansen had no immediate comment on terms of the deal and
an Ecopetrol spokesman didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
and phone calls seeking comment.  Anadarko’s share in Deep Nansen fell from 50 percent to 35
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
