Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened after a report showed production of the biofuel climbed
to a two-week high and on speculation output will increase to
meet demand in the summer driving season.  The spread, or price difference, expanded by 2.44 cents to
20.9 cents a gallon at 12:22 p.m. New York time after an Energy
Information Administration report showed ethanol  production  last
week rose 1.7 percent to 857,000 barrels a day. That was the
most since April 26 and the biggest weekly gain since April 19.
Returns to make the biofuel from a bushel of corn are near the
highest since December 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The EIA report “shows a nice increase in production to
853,000 barrels a day, but we’re still 33,000 below last year’s
levels,” said Justin Dirico, manager of the biofuels desk at
Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in New York.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery decreased 1.9 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.634 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 24 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery added 0.54 cent to $2.843 a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Demand for motor fuels and ethanol will increase as the
summer driving season begins on the U.S. Memorial Day holiday
weekend later this month, Dirico said.  “Production needs to increase in order to meet this
demand,” he said.  Gasoline Pool  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 95 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended May 10, down from a record
97 percent the previous week, EIA data show. For a third week,
there were no U.S.  imports , the longest such streak since March
2012.  Stockpiles of the fuel fell 2.5 percent to 16.4 million
barrels, a third weekly decline and the lowest level since Dec.
3, 2010, today’s report showed.  Ethanol is made primarily from corn in the U.S., with one
bushel of the grain distilling into at least 2.75 gallons of the
renewable fuel. Drought last summer wilted crops and boosted
manufacturing costs to make the biofuel.  Corn for July delivery gained 2.5 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$6.55 a bushel in Chicago.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread for July was 14 cents, compared with
17 cents yesterday and minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The amount
doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’
grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to
livestock.  A 2007 energy law requires the U.S. to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year. Compliance with the law is tracked
by Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, certificates
attached to each gallon of biofuel that can be submitted to the
government or traded between refiners.  The value of  corn-based ethanol RINs  climbed 0.6 percent to
80 cents at 12:01 p.m. New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, decreased 1.1 percent to 89 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
