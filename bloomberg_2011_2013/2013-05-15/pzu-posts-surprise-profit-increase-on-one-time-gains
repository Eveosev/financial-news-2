PZU SA, Poland’s largest insurer,
posted an unexpected increase in first-quarter profit after
collecting more premiums and one-time gains from a consolidation
of its investment funds.  Net income  rose to 838.1 million zloty ($259 million) from
822.3 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based company
said in a regulatory statement today. That exceeded the 754.9
million-zloty  average  estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Premiums rose 2.4 percent to 4.43 billion zloty and
the state-controlled insurer booked a 167.5 million-zloty gain
from investment fund consolidation, it said.  Income from investments slumped 51 percent to 428.9 million
zloty in the quarter from a year earlier. Warsaw’s all-share WIG
Index declined 8.2 percent and Polish government bond yields
fell to a record low.  PZU shares rose for the first time in a week, climbing 1.1
percent to 447 zloty as of 9:08 a.m. in Warsaw, extending this
year’s gain to 2.3 percent and valuing the company at 38.6
billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
