Rising hacking risks to drivers as
their cars become increasingly powered by and connected to
computers have prompted the U.S.’s auto-safety regulator to
start a new office focusing on the threat.  “These interconnected electronics systems are creating
opportunities to improve vehicle safety and reliability, but are
also creating new and different safety and cybersecurity
risks,”  David Strickland , head of the  National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration , said at a Senate Commerce Committee
hearing today. “We don’t want to be behind the eight ball.”  A new office within the agency to research vehicle-electronics safety will look at risks to the systems in cars and
those that communicate with other vehicles. NHTSA is conducting
a pilot project in  Ann Arbor ,  Michigan , of so-called talking-car
technology intended to prevent crashes.  Senate Commerce Committee Chairman  Jay Rockefeller , a West
Virginia Democrat, said while he’s excited about safety
improvements through technology, he’s concerned about new risks
including hacking.  “As our cars become more connected -- to the Internet, to
wireless networks, with each other, and with our infrastructure
-- are they at risk of catastrophic cyber attacks?” Rockefeller
asked.  Remote Access  Regulators are preparing for the possibility that cars
could be accessed remotely in the future, though now a person
would need to have physical access to a vehicle to redirect its
electronic functions, Strickland said.  “If there is a chance of it happening, we have to address
it,” Strickland told reporters after leaving the hearing.  NHTSA, part of the U.S. Transportation Department, was
criticized by Congress and safety advocates in 2010 for lacking
expertise in automotive electronics during hearings about  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s unintended-acceleration recalls.  No electronic cause was found for the incidents after the
agency asked  NASA  and the  National Academy of Sciences  for help
with the probe.  Cars are increasingly controlled electronically rather than
mechanically, from acceleration and starting to rolling down the
windows. Infotainment systems connect drivers to satellite and
wireless networks.  100 Million  Today’s typical luxury car has more than 100 million lines
of computer code, while software and electronics account for 40
percent of the car’s cost and half of warranty claims, said John
D. Lee, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s
industrial and systems engineering department. Lee also
testified at today’s hearing in Washington.  NHTSA and others developing new vehicle-control
technologies need consumers to accept them if they’re to
penetrate the market and provide safety benefits, Strickland
said. If consumers don’t trust the technology, they won’t buy
it, he said.  “Cybersecurity is hard,” he told reporters. “Even the
best systems in the world can be compromised, as we have seen.”  Strickland said the agency plans to decide by the end of
this year whether to regulate crash-imminent braking, a
technology that applies brakes automatically if sensors indicate
there’s about to be a crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
