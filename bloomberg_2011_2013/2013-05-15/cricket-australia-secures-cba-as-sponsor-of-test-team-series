Australia ’s Test cricket team and
elite home series will be sponsored by  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia  for the next four seasons, beginning with the 2013-14
Ashes contest against  England .  CBA, the nation’s largest lender by market value, will
shift its support to Test matches from one-day internationals,
Cricket Australia said, without disclosing financial details.
The deal is worth A$50 million over four years, the Australian
newspaper reported without saying where it got the information.  “They are an iconic Australian brand that is synonymous
with cricket in Australia and the sponsorship of the Test format
is a natural fit,” Cricket Australia Chief Executive Officer
James Sutherland said today in the statement. “We are pleased
to have them extend their support of cricket, especially leading
into an all-important Ashes year.”  CBA, which has sponsored Australia’s home one-day matches
for the past six years and has other deals in place with the Big
Bash League, Cricket Victoria and the top-ranked Australian
women’s team, replaces Vodafone as the main backer of Test
cricket in the country. Vodafone’s 11-year sponsorship of five-day matches ended in January.  The sponsorship vacancy left by CBA for the one-day games
may be filled as early as this week, Cricket Australia spokesman
Matthew Slade said by telephone.  Australia’s Test team, which suffered its first 4-0 sweep
of losses since 1970 in March in  India , takes on archrival
England in back-to-back five-match Ashes series this year, in
the U.K. beginning July 10 and then at home from Nov. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
