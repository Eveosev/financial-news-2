The ruble slumped for the first time
in three days against the central bank’s target basket of
currencies after Russian policy makers left interest rates
unchanged and oil fell.  The ruble weakened 0.2 percent against Bank Rossii’s basket
of dollars and euros to 35.5898 by 6 p.m. in Moscow and lost 0.5
percent against the dollar to 31.5225. Yields on benchmark OFZs
due February 2027 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 6.95 percent.  Bank Rossii kept its main interest rates unchanged for an
eighth month, as forecast by 18 out 24 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The regulator reduced some mid-term and long-term
rates on refinancing, backed by gold and non-marketable assets,
by 25 basis points. Brent oil extended declines for a fourth
day, trading in  London  down 0.9 percent at $101.72 per barrel.  The ruble “reacted slightly to the central bank decision
and oil, which is down,” Artem Roschin, a foreign-exchange
trader at Aljba Alliance LLC, said by phone from Moscow.
“Combined it put a lid on us. The reaction fits the decision.”  The  interest rate  implied from three-month non-deliverable
dollar-ruble forward contracts rose one basis point to 6.43
percent, six points below the 2013 closing high on March 22.  The regular tax period, which is traditionally supportive
for the ruble as exporters sell their foreign-currency revenue
to pay ruble taxes, started today and will continue until May
31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
