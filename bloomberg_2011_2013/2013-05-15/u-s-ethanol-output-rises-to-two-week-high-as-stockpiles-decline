Ethanol production in the U.S. rose
1.7 percent to 857,000 barrels a day, a report from the Energy
Information Administration showed today.  Output climbed to the highest level in two weeks while
 stockpiles  sank 2.5 percent, a third consecutive decline, to
16.4 million barrels. Inventories are the smallest since Dec. 3,
2010, the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical arm said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 95 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, down from a record 97 percent the previous
week. For a third week, there were no U.S.  imports , the longest
such streak since March 2012.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 0.1 cent to $2.652
a gallon at 11:01 a.m.  New York  time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have gained 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
