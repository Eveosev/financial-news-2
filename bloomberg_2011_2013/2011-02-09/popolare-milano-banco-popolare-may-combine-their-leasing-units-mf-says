Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl, Banco
Popolare SC and Banca Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna Scrl may
combine their leasing units, MF reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Popolare di Milano owns 40 percent of leasing company
Selmabipiemme, while the other two lenders control Alba Leasing,
according to MF.  A combination may happen “only if” Mediobanca SpA decides
to sell its 60 percent stake in Selmabipiemme, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
