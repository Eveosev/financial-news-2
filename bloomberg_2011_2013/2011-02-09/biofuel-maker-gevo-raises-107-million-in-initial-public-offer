Gevo Inc., the developer of biofuels
backed by billionaires Vinod Khosla and  Richard Branson , raised
$107 million in a U.S. initial public offering, pricing its
shares at the high end of the forecast range.  The Englewood, Colorado-based company sold 7.15 million
shares at $15 each after offering them at $13 to $15 apiece,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used
to buy and equip ethanol production facilities, the filing said.  Gevo is one of 10 companies trying to raise $3.3 billion
after two deals were postponed this week and only six of 12
scheduled offerings priced the week ended Feb. 4, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Kinder Morgan Inc., the Houston-
based pipeline company taken private in 2007, is the biggest IPO
on the current calendar and will try to raise $2.3 billion
Thursday after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index this week closed
at its highest level since June 2008, the data show.  Gevo, 38 percent-owned by Khosla Ventures, the Menlo Park,
California-based firm founded by billionaire Vinod Khosla, has
had net losses totaling about $77 million since 2005, according
to its SEC filing. Virgin Green Fund, backed by British
billionaire Richard Branson, owns 15 percent of Gevo, the filing
shows. Gevo is selling all of the shares in the offering.    UBS AG  of Zurich, Minneapolis-based  Piper Jaffray Cos . and  Citigroup Inc . in  New York  led Gevo’s offering. The shares will
start trading tomorrow on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the
ticker GEVO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
