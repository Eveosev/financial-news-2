(Corrects third paragraph to show output of 250 megawatts
of alternating current; corrects fourth paragraph to show 50
megawatts of alternating current.)    First Solar Inc ., the world’s biggest
maker of thin-film photovoltaic panels, said a unit of  Edison
International  intends to buy almost three-quarters of the energy
from a planned 340-megawatt solar plant in  Nevada .  Southern California Edison will purchase 250 megawatts over
20 years, said Alan Bernheimer, a First Solar spokesman. The
California Public Utilities Commission must approve the
contract.  The First Solar plant, dubbed Silver State South, will
consist of panels mounted on 2,500 acres near Primm, Nevada. It
should be built and operational by 2014, with a maximum output
of 250 megawatts of alternating current by 2017, the Tempe,
Arizona-based company said in a statement.  The facility will dwarf First Solar’s adjacent Silver State
North, which will produce 50 megawatts of alternating current.
That plant will sell power to Nevada utility  NV Energy Inc .
under a 25-year contract signed a year ago.  First Solar declined to disclose the terms of the Edison
agreement or the construction cost of Silver State South, which
will connect to Rosemead, California-based Edison’s proposed
Eldorado-Ivanpah 220-kilovolt transmission line.  First Solar, whose 38 percent increase this year
outperformed the 23 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, fell 1.4 percent to $156.27 as of 12:43 p.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  Edison International was little changed at $36.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
