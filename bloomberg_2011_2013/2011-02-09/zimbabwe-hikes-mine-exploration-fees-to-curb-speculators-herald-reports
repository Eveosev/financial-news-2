  Zimbabwe â€™s government has increased
exploration fees for new diamond and coal projects in a bid to
discourage the speculative holding of claims, the Herald
newspaper cited the Deputy Mines Minister Gift Chimanikire as
saying.  Exploration fees for new diamond projects would rise to $1
million from $50,000 while that for new coal projects would now
be $100,000 instead of $20,000, the Harare-based newspaper said.
Fees for other minerals, including gold and chrome, would also
be increased, the Herald said.  Chimanikire said the fee increases were meant to stop
speculators from holding claims and to encourage only serious
investors, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
