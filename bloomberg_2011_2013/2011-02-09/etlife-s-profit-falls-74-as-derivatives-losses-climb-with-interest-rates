  MetLife Inc ., the biggest U.S. life
insurer, said fourth-quarter profit declined 74 percent as
derivative losses widened amid a surge in  interest rates .  Net income fell to $82 million, or 5 cents a share, from
$320 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement distributed by  Business Wire .
Excluding some investment results, earnings were $1.14 a share,
beating the $1.10 average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  MetLife uses derivatives to produce income and guard
against market risks, such as interest-rate declines and
currency fluctuations. When yields rise, as two-year and 10-year
Treasury notes did in the fourth quarter, MetLife writes down
the value of some derivatives.  The derivatives result “is influenced by interest rates,”  Randy Binner , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said before the
earnings announcement. “It just highlights that the company is
very well hedged” against low interest rates. Binner has an
“outperform” rating on MetLife stock.  Two-year Treasury yields surged 41 percent in the three
months ended Dec. 31, the third-biggest quarterly gain since at
least 1981. MetLife, which had more than $200 billion of
derivative contracts at the end of September, guards against
interest-rate declines because the company depends on bond
coupons to help serve customers and record profits.  Alico Deal  Chief Executive Officer Robert Henrikson added 20 million
customers in the fourth quarter with the purchase of American
Life Insurance Co. from American International Group Inc. The
$16.2 billion deal, completed in November, boosted MetLife’s
presence in markets from  Chile  to Japan. In the U.S., the
company retreated from the market for long-term care insurance
to focus on more-profitable businesses.  “The integration of Alico is on target,” Henrikson said
in the statement.  MetLife posted a full-year 2010 profit of $2.79 billion,
compared with a $2.25 billion loss in 2009.  MetLife had $1 billion in derivatives losses in the fourth
quarter. In the same period of 2009, the company reported $527
million of losses on the contracts. Premiums, fees and other
revenue rose 3.6 percent to $9.66 billion.  Book value per share, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, fell 9.7 percent to $44.18 in the last three months
of 2010 as the company issued stock to fund the Alico purchase. 
MetLife slipped 60 cents to $47 in extended trading at 5:09 p.m.
in New York. The company gained about 35 percent in the past 
year on the  New York  Stock Exchange.   Net investment income surged 22 percent to $4.79 billion
from $3.92 billion a year earlier. MetLife said variable
investment income, a category that includes buyout and hedge
funds, was $423 million on a “strong performance” from private
equity.  Premiums, fees and other revenue in the U.S. declined 8
percent to $7.2 billion as insurance product sales fell.
International revenue jumped 75 percent, to more than $2
billion, on the Alico acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
