  Algeria  will invest $60 billion in
renewable energy projects by 2030, the state-run  Algeria Presse
Service  said, citing Noureddine Bouterfa, chief executive
officer of state-run gas and electricity company Sonelgaz.  The planned projects are expected to raise the North
African countryâ€™s renewable energy output to 650 megawatts by
2015, 2,700 megawatts by 2020 and 12,000 megawatts by 2030, he
said.  Of the 12,000 megawatts foreseen by 2030, about 7,200 will
come from geothermal plants, 2,800 from photovoltaic panels and
2,000 from wind farms, Bouterfa said, according to the report
yesterday.  Algeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, is seeking to diversify into renewable
energy and decrease its reliance on fossil fuels.  It awarded a contract valued at 29.8 billion dinars ($408
million) for the construction of a solar energy plant to  Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG  of Germany, Algeria Presse Service
reported yesterday. The plant will have an output capacity of
between 116 megawatts and 120 megawatts and is expected to start
production in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
