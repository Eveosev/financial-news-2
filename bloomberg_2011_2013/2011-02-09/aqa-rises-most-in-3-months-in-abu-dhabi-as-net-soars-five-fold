  Abu Dhabi National Energy Co ., the
state-run utility known as Taqa, advanced to a two-week high
after full-year profit surged five-fold.  Taqa gained 2.9 percent to 1.44 dirhams, the highest since
Jan. 27, at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate.  Energy companies in the United Arab Emirates, such as Taqa
and  Dana Gas PJSC , a Sharjah-based natural-gas producer,
benefited from a 28 percent increase in crude oil prices last
year. Taqa, which planned to spend $1.4 billion in 2010 on
developing assets, owns stakes in oil and gas production as well
as power generation in the Middle East,  North America , the North
Sea and India.  “While the economic environment remains somewhat
challenging, the more positive commodity pricing environment
resulted in a strong final half to the year,” Chief Executive
Officer Abdulla Saif al-Nuaimi said in a statement published in  Abu Dhabi  today.  Net income advanced to 937 million dirhams ($255 million)
from 182 million dirhams a year earlier as a result of higher
commodity prices and income from new assets. Taqa’s sales in
2010 rose to 21.35 billion dirhams from 16.86 billion dirhams.  Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority, also known as
Adwea, is Taqa’s majority owner. Adwea transferred several of
its stakes in power and water companies to Taqa in 2010, the
 statement  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
