The  International Monetary Fund  is
discussing the criteria for adding currencies to its Special
Drawing Rights valuation basket made up of the dollar, euro, yen
and pound, its number-three official said.  “We are starting to discuss how to assess SDRs, the
composition of SDRs and the criteria to add a currency to SDRs
if we decided to do so,”  Naoyuki Shinohara , deputy managing
director at the IMF, told a news conference in Tokyo today.
“There is no target date and there’s no premise that we are
going to add more currencies.”  Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  last month said the
currencies of Brazil, Russia, India and  China  should be included
in SDR valuation basket. U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s
administration said in January it supports “over time” putting
the yuan into the basket.  The IMF in November said the yuan doesn’t yet meet the
“freely usable” criteria required for the basket. The Fund
also signaled it will begin examining the indicators used to
select currencies.  Shinohara said leaders of the Group of 20 countries may
discuss the “role of SDRs” as part of discussions later in the
year as part of planned discussions on the international
monetary system. He said the IMF is flexible about the
composition of SDRs.  The IMF in November cut the U.S. dollar’s weighting to 41.9
percent compared with 44 percent after a 2005 review while the
yen’s fell to 9.4 percent from 11 percent. The euro’s share rose
to 37.4 percent from 34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
