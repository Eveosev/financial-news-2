Treasury 10-year yields were within
four basis points of the highest in nine months, as the U.S.
prepared to sell $24 billion of the securities after demand fell
at a sale of three-year notes yesterday.  The yields earlier rose to the most since April after
climbing 11 basis points yesterday, the biggest one-day advance
in more than a month.  U.S. debt  maturing in a decade and longer
handed investors a 2.3 percent loss in the past week, the
biggest decline of 174 indexes of sovereign bonds around the
world, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Treasury
will auction $16 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to speak today
amid speculation the central bank will curb its bond purchases
or opt not to extend them.  “The three-year auction last night was an unmitigated
disaster,” because of the structure of the bidding and the low
foreign demand, said  Marc Ostwald , a London-based strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. “This doesn’t mean that tomorrow’s 30-
year will go badly but it does leave a lot of questions about
the 10-year tonight.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield was little changed at 3.74
percent as of 8:52 a.m. in  London , according to BGCantor Market
Data. The 2.625 percent security maturing in November 2020
traded at 90 31/32. The yield earlier rose to 3.77 percent, the
highest since April 29.  Debt Auctions  The 10-year securities scheduled for sale today yielded
3.77 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 3.388 percent
at the previous sale of the debt on Jan. 12.  Investors bid for 3.30 times the amount on offer last
month, versus the average of 3.13 for the past 10 auctions.
Indirect bidders, the group that includes foreign central banks,
bought 53.6 percent, while the 10-sale average is 46.4 percent.  Yesterday’s $32 billion three-year note auction drew a
yield of 1.349 percent, compared with a forecast of 1.345
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 8 of the Fed’s 20 primary
dealers. The yield was the highest since the government sold $38
billion of the securities in May at 1.414 percent. Indirect
bidders at the auction, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 27.6 percent of the notes, less
than 39.4 percent in January.  The government will conclude this week’s auctions with a
$16 billion 30-year sale tomorrow.  Fed Purchases  The Fed is scheduled to buy $6 billion to $8 billion of
securities due from February 2015 to July 2016 today, according
to its  website . Policy makers announced in November the bank
would purchase $600 billion of Treasuries by the end of June to
pump money into the economy.  Fed Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said
yesterday the quickening U.S. recovery means policy makers need
to adhere to their commitment to review the program.  “The distinct improvement in the economic outlook since
the program was initiated suggests taking that re-evaluation
quite seriously,” Lacker said in a speech in  Newark ,  Delaware .  Fed Bank of  Dallas  President  Richard Fisher  said he’ll
probably vote against any proposal to further expand the central
bank’s balance sheet.  “Barring some unexpected shock to the economy or financial
system, I think we are pushing the envelope with the current
round of Treasury purchases,” Fisher, who votes this year on
the policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee , said in the
text of remarks in Dallas yesterday.  Bernanke Testifies  Yields are rising most on notes, where the central bank is
making the bulk of its purchases, reflecting concern those
securities will suffer the steepest losses when the buying
stops.  The difference between the Fed’s target rate and five-year
yields expanded to 2.15 percentage points yesterday, the widest
since May, and was at 2.14 percentage points today. The spread
between 10- and 30-year yields shrank to 1.02 percentage points
today, the narrowest since July.  The Fed plans to make 23 percent of its purchases in
Treasuries due in 5 1/2 years to 7 years, versus 4 percent for
those maturing in 17 years to 30 years, according to its
 website .  Bernanke is scheduled to testify today before the House
Budget Committee, as investors add to bets that quickening
economic growth will lead to inflation.  The  unemployment rate  declined to a 21-month low in
January.  Walt Disney Co ., the world’s biggest theme-park
company, reported yesterday first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates after an increase in attendance at its
resorts.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices over the life of the debt, was little changed at
2.36 percentage points after rising to an eight-month high of
2.42 percentage points on Jan. 5. The so-called breakeven rate
has risen from a 15-month low of 1.47 percentage points in
August. The five-year average is 2.09 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
