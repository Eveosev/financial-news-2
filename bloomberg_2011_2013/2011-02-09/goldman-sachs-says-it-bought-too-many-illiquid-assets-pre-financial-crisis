  Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., the fifth-
biggest  U.S. bank , purchased too many hard-to-sell assets 
before the financial crisis in 2008, Chief Financial
Officer David A. Viniar said.  Goldman Sachs was “buying more illiquid assets than we
probably should have,” Viniar, 55, said today at a conference
in Miami hosted by Credit Suisse Group AG, his eighth
consecutive appearance at the annual event. “It was a good
lesson learned.”  “Less liquid assets” increased at a 39 percent compound
annual growth rate between the start of 2005 and the start of
2008, compared with 24 percent growth in liquid assets,
according to a slide Viniar included in his  presentation . Since
the first quarter of 2008, the firm has reduced holdings of such
investments at an 18 percent compound annual rate, while liquid
assets are down 9 percent.  The assets included mortgage-backed and other asset-backed
securities, loans, high-yield debt, emerging-market stocks and
bonds and investments in funds and private equity, the slide
showed. They totaled $172 billion in the first quarter of 2008,
or 14 percent of the firm’s balance sheet, up from $65 billion,
or 11 percent, three years earlier.  After posting record profit in 2009, Goldman Sachs reported
a 38 percent drop in net income for 2010 as revenue from
underwriting and trading slumped. Viniar said he expects revenue
to rebound from fixed-income, currencies and commodities
trading, the firm’s largest division, known as FICC.  “You’ll see FICC start to improve,” he said.  Principal Strategies  Goldman Sachs closed a proprietary-trading unit called
Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies last year in response to new
financial regulations, known as the Volcker rule, that puts
limits on banks’ trading for their own account. Viniar has said
the company is waiting to see how the final rules are written to
determine if they will have to close other units.  “Whatever effects there have been, you’ve seen already,”
Viniar said today. “We don’t see that big of an effect from the
Volcker rule on our revenues.”  Goldman Sachs shares, which closed yesterday at $168.55,
fell 0.4 percent in 2010 after doubling in 2009. They reached a
peak of $247.92 in October 2007 and closed as low as $52 in
November 2008.  The firm, which paid $550 million last year to settle a
U.S. regulator’s fraud suit, published a set of new business
standards last month after a committee of employees completed an
eight-month review of the company’s practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
