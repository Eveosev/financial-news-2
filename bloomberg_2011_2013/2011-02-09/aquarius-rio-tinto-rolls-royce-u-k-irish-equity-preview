U.K. stocks fell for a second day as
sales at  Diageo Plc  missed analysts’ estimates and an unexpected
loss at Air France-KLM weakened the shares of International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA.  Diageo slumped 4.6 percent as growth in developing markets
failed to offset declines in European countries including
Ireland and Greece. International Consolidated Airlines
retreated 3.3 percent as rival Air France-KLM unexpectedly
reported a quarterly loss and cut its full-year forecast.  Rio
Tinto , the world’s third-biggest mining company, slid 2.4
percent after reporting profit that matched analysts’ forecasts.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  declined 32.28, or 0.5
percent, to 6,020.01 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. Even so,
the gauge has advanced 2 percent this year, bringing its rally
since March 2009 to 71 percent, as investors bet that the
strengthening global economic recovery will help corporate
earnings. The  FTSE All-Share Index  fell 0.6 percent today, and
Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated less than 0.1 percent.  “The pullback is further evidence of the fragility of
sentiment,” said  Richard Hunter , the head of U.K. equities at  Hargreaves Lansdown Plc  in London. “Some weaker-than-expected
corporate numbers have also weighed on the market.”  The Bank of England maintained its emergency stimulus today
and kept the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5
percent as predicted by all 62 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Former rate setter DeAnne Julius said yesterday the bank
needs to tighten policy “sooner rather than later” or risk
losing credibility.  Diageo, Airlines Slump  Diageo slumped 4.6 percent to 1,195 pence. Organic sales at
the London-based spirits maker, which exclude the effect of
acquisitions and currency swings, gained 4 percent. That missed
the 4.5 percent median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. So-called organic operating profit rose 2
percent, missing a 6.5 percent median estimate.  International Consolidated Airlines tumbled 3.3 percent to
251 pence.  Air France-KLM  posted a third-quarter net loss of 46
million euros ($62.7 million). Analysts had predicted a 60
million-euro profit, based on the average of seven estimates.  Rio Tinto slipped 2.4 percent to 4,549 pence. Net income
rose to $8.5 billion in the six months ended Dec. 31 from $2.4
billion a year earlier as the prices of  iron ore  and copper
climbed. That compares with the $8.6 billion average estimate of
12 analysts Bloomberg surveyed. The company also announced a $5
billion share buyback by the end of next year and full-year
earnings that tripled to $14.3 billion.    Smith & Nephew Plc  climbed 2.1 percent to 727 pence after
Europe’s largest maker of shoulder and knee implants named
Olivier Bohuon as chief executive officer to replace Dave Illingworth, who has decided to retire after four years in the
job. Smith & Nephew also reported earnings per share that
climbed to 20.5 cents, up from 14.5 cents a year earlier,
beating the 19.3 cent mean estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
