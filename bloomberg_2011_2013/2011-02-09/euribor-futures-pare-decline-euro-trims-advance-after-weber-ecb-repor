Euribor futures pared declines and
the euro trimmed gains after Reuters reported that Bundesbank
President  Axel Weber  will drop out of the race to succeed Jean- Claude Trichet as head of the European Central Bank.  The implied yield on the Euribor futures contract expiring
in December was two basis points higher at 1.94 percent at 11:37
a.m. in London, after earlier rising as high as 1.97 percent.
The yield tends to rise as investors increase bets on higher ECB
interest rates. The euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.3638 after
rising as much as 0.3 percent.  “Weber is a well-known hawk,” said  Neil Jones , head of
European hedge fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in London.
“Investors are scaling back bets on interest-rate hikes and
that’s pushing the euro lower.”  The Bundesbank denied the “rumor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
