  Italy ’s Christof Innerhofer won the
super-G event at the  Alpine World Championships  today for the
first major ski title of his career.  Innerhofer, 26, finished in a time of 1 minute, 38.31
seconds on the Kandahar course in Garmisch-Partenkirchen,
Germany, 0.60 second ahead of Austria’s Hannes Reichelt. Ivica Kostelic of Croatia, the overall World Cup leader, was 0.72
