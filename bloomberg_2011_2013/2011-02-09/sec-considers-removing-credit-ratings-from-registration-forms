The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission may propose replacing references to credit ratings in
forms companies use to register securities as part of a mandate
to apply new measures of creditworthiness in response to the
2008 financial crisis.  SEC commissioners may vote today to seek comment on a rule
that would remove credit ratings as a condition for companies to
use short-form registration to expedite public sale of
securities, according to a fact sheet released by the agency.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal regulators including
the SEC to replace references to credit ratings in their rules
by July 21. The regulatory overhaul calls on agencies to replace
the reference with an “appropriate” new standard for measuring
creditworthiness.  Lawmakers took aim at credit-rating companies after firms
including  Moody’s Corp . and McGraw-Hill Cos.’  Standard & Poor’s 
unit gave top rankings to subprime mortgage bonds whose collapse
sparked the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, assigned by
Congress to find the causes of the meltdown, said in its final
report last month that poor performance by credit-rating firms
was a significant contributor to the collapse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
