U.S. ethanol production fell 0.9
percent to 900,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department.  Stockpiles swelled 3.6 percent to 19.6 million barrels, the
highest level since July 16, the department reported today in  Washington .  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
fell 0.6 percent to 4.66 million barrels a day. Refiners receive
a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into
the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery soared 5.7 cents,
or 2.4 percent, to $2.444 a gallon at 10:34 a.m. New York time
on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price since July 31,
2008.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa and  Illinois  are losing 9
cents on every gallon produced on a spot basis, according to Ag
