South African fuel refiners and
retailers will need to invest as much as 20 billion rand to
provide for new grades being introduced by the nation, Business
Day reported today.  The Department of Minerals and Energy is introducing new
gasoline and diesel standards to replace the 1996 Euro 2
standard on sulphur and octane levels and refineries will need
to spend as much as $3 billion upgrading facilities, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper cited South African Petroleum
Industry Association director Avhapfani Tshifularo as saying.  A department announcement on the new standards is imminent,
spokesman Ndivhuwo Khangale told Business Day, without providing
more information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
