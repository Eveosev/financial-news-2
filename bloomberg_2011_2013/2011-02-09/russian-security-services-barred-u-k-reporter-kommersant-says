Russia’s security services barred
Luke Harding, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent since 2007,
from returning to  Russia , Kommersant newspaper  reported  today,
citing unidentified officials in the presidential administration
and the Foreign Ministry.  Harding’s expulsion was a “misunderstanding,” Kremlin and
Foreign Ministry officials told Kommersant, a Moscow-based
daily. They said that security services made the decision
without consulting anyone, Kommersant reported.  Harding, who reported that leaked U.S. diplomatic cables
described Russia as a “virtual mafia state” was denied entry
last weekend. Harding repeatedly travelled to areas where
counter-terrorism operations were under way without notifying
security services, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said
yesterday, according to state news service RIA Novosti.  The Foreign Ministry said on its website yesterday that
Harding was sent back to  London  over the weekend because he
broke immigration rules. Harding requested an extension of his
journalist’s accreditation and then left the country without
receiving his credentials, the ministry said in a statement. The
ministry didn’t mention Harding’s travel within Russia.  Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s spokeswoman Natalya Timakova declined to comment when reached by Bloomberg News
today as did Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Boldyrev. The
Federal Security Service, or FSB, didn’t return an e-mailed
request for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
