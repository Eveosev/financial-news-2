  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  and  BP Plc ,  Europe â€™s largest oil companies, plan to close and sell
refineries in the U.S. and  Germany  on declining demand for fuels
such as gasoline in developed nations.  BP plans to sell its 475,000 barrel-a-day  Texas City 
refinery in  Texas  and its 266,000 barrel-a-day Carson plant in  California , the London-based company said on Feb. 1.  Shell plans to stop oil-processing at its 110,000 barrel-a-
day Hamburg facility in 2012 after failing to find a buyer, the
company based in The Hague said on Jan. 12.  Following are two tables. The first lists refineries around
the world that have shut, are slated for permanent closure or
conversion, units idled for economic reasons, and those that are
up for sale. The second shows refinery sales that have been
agreed or completed since early 2010. Capacity is shown in
thousands of barrels of oil a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
