Investors and most economists are
forecasting the U.S. Federal Reserve will increase rates sooner
than history would suggest.  After the past two U.S. recessions, the Fed didn’t start
raising policy rates until joblessness had fallen about three-
quarters of the way back to the full-employment level, the CHART
OF THE DAY shows. To satisfy that requirement, the jobless rate
would need to be 6.5 percent, compared with today’s 9 percent.  “If we let history determine when the Fed will raise  interest rates , then the market consensus may be a little ahead
of itself,” said Rudy Narvas, a New York-based senior economist
at Societe Generale. Narvas expects the Fed won’t raise rates
until the end of 2012.  In the 1990-91 recession, the  unemployment rate  rose 1.6
percentage points over the  Congressional Budget Office ’s
estimate of full employment. The Fed began to increase interest
rates when the rate retraced about three-quarters of the
increase. The same pattern held after the 2003 peak in
unemployment.  The U.S. jobless rate and the CBO’s estimate of its full-
employment level were both about 4.9 percent in the first
quarter of 2008. Unemployment rose 5.2 percentage points since
then, peaking at 10.1 percent in October 2009. Economists
forecast 8.6 percent unemployment by the end of the first
quarter of 2012, which is when investors expect the Fed will
begin increasing policy rates, based on data from the Fed Funds
futures contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
