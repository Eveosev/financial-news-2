Suez Environnement, Europe’s second-
largest water company, reported a 40 percent increase in full-
year profit and said future growth will come from water
contracts in southern  Europe  and turning waste into energy.  The utility is targeting growth in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of at least 10
percent in 2011 at constant foreign exchange and at least 7
percent on average for 2012 and 2013, according to a statement
today. It aims to raise the dividend around 5 percent annually
for the three years through 2013, while 2011 net profit is
expected to exceed 425 million euros ($580 million).  “The prospects of growth are strong in all our
businesses,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Louis Chaussade said
today.  Spain ’s “ambitious water plans” and the need for
investment in waste and water infrastructure to meet European
rules will lead to more orders, he said.  Shares rose as much as 2.3 percent and were 33 cents higher
at 15.405 euros at 10:30 a.m. in Paris. The stock has risen 6
percent in the past six months.  Together with larger competitor  Veolia Environnement SA ,
Suez Environnement has struggled to increase industrial waste
sorting following the 2009 recession that forced factory clients
to idle plants, reducing demand for utility services. It shut
waste-treatment sites in Europe and cut its fleet of vehicles to
weather the slowdown. The utility has said 2011 will be a year
of growth.  ‘Higher Trend’  “Volumes treated at the start of 2011 were better” than
those during the same period of 2010, Chaussade said. “The
first numbers of the year are showing a higher trend than those
of 2010.”  The volume of waste handled by the utility in Europe rose 1
percent last year from 2009, and was stable for municipalities
and higher from industry, including a 12 percent increase in
sorting and recycling, Suez Environnement said. Prices for
recycled materials were higher.  The volume of waste handled hasn’t yet rebounded to levels
from before the 2009 slump and the utility hasn’t reopened sites
that were shuttered, Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Boursier
said.  Net income rose to 565 million euros from 403 million euros
a year earlier, according to today’s statement. Ebitda rose 14
percent to 2.34 billion euros while sales gained 13 percent to
13.9 billion euros.  Asset Sales  The utility doesn’t have any “major assets” to sell,
Chaussade told analysts today, adding that minor adjustments to
holdings are always possible.  The utility is seeking to reduce the debt-to-ebitda ratio
to around three by the end of 2011 from 3.22 at the end of 2010.  Net financial debt advanced to 7.53 billion euros on Dec.
31 from 6.28 billion euros a year earlier following the
acquisition of Spanish water supplier Sociedad General de Aguas
de Barcelona SA.  “We are watching carefully how the Spanish economy is
evolving,” Chaussade said. Agbar is “our arm” to win orders
in Latin America, including Brazil and  Chile , he said.  Suez Environnement aims to pay out a dividend ratio of
“more than” 60 percent after proposing a stable dividend of 65
cents a share from the previous year, Chaussade said.  Suez Environnement raised a target for cost savings to 300
million euros in the three years through 2012. It gets three-
quarters of its revenue from Europe and the rest
internationally. The company said today it and partners won a
water and waste contract for Adelaide in  Australia  worth 420
million euros net to the utility.  Suez Environnement was spun off by Suez SA in 2008 when
that company merged with Gaz de France SA. The combined entity,  GDF Suez  SA, owns 35 percent of the water and waste utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
