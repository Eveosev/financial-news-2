  LG Electronics Inc . said it will
raise prices for some home appliances in the U.S. by as much as
10 percent to reflect increasing expenses amid higher raw
material costs and stricter energy regulations.  The increase of 8 percent to 10 percent will apply to
“major” appliances from April 11, the Seoul-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today, without elaborating further.  LG joins other home appliance makers in fighting rising
costs.  Electrolux AB , the Stockholm-based owner of the
Frigidaire brand, last week predicted as much as 2 billion
kronor ($311 million) in added material costs this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
