Canadian stocks had their biggest
decline in almost three weeks as raw-material producers dropped
after  Teck Resources Ltd . missed analysts’ earnings forecasts.  Teck, Canada’s largest base-metals and coal producer,
declined 8.3 percent after profit fell 20 percent short of the
average estimate.  Barrick Gold Corp . lost 1.6 percent as gold
fluctuated and other precious metals fell.  TMX Group Inc ., owner
of the Toronto Stock Exchange, surged 6.4 percent after agreeing
to be bought by London Stock Exchange Group Plc.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell 108.22
points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 13,784.30 in Toronto, the
biggest decline since Jan. 20.  Teck’s results “send a shot across the bow that
commodities are still a volatile asset class,” said Todd Johnson, a money manager at BCV Asset Management in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, which oversees C$255 million ($256 million). “There’s
just a lot of hot money that’s moving quickly and will hit the
sell button really quick when they don’t see what they like.”  The S&P/TSX rallied 4.8 percent from Jan. 25 to yesterday
as economic data and corporate earnings signaled the global
economic recovery is becoming more entrenched. Since the current
earnings-reporting season began on Jan. 10, 74 percent of S&P
500 companies and 61 percent of S&P/TSX companies that have
reported financial results have beaten analysts’ average
earnings forecast.  An index of base-metals and coal producers fell from a
record level after Teck failed to match analysts’ average
earnings forecast, excluding certain items, for the fifth time
in six quarters. Copper fell after China, the world’s largest
user of industrial metals, raised interest rates.  Retreat  Teck slumped 8.3 percent in Toronto Stock Exchange trading,
the most since June 2009, to C$57.95.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd ., Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,
declined the most since Aug. 20, decreasing 5.5 percent to
C$129.75.  Thirty-one of 34 S&P/TSX gold companies retreated. Gold
futures fluctuated on speculation that central banks will raise
borrowing costs to cool inflation, eroding demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  Barrick lost 1.6 percent to C$47.69.  Kinross Gold Corp .,
Canada’s third-largest gold producer, fell 2.8 percent to
C$16.62.  Eastern Platinum Ltd ., which mines precious metals in
South Africa, dropped 6.8 percent to C$1.65.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index declined for a fourth day after
the U.S. Energy Department reported higher gasoline and
distillate-fuel inventories than most analysts had forecast.  Pipeline Company    Talisman Energy Inc ., which produces oil and gas in North
America, the North Sea and Indonesia, lost 2.3 percent to
C$22.60.  TransCanada Corp ., the owner of Canada’s largest
pipeline system, decreased 1.1 percent to C$37.79.    Niko Resources Ltd ., an oil and gas company with operations
in South Asia, slumped 13 percent to C$81.75 after missing
analysts’ third-quarter profit estimate by 10 percent, excluding
certain items.  TMX soared 6.4 percent to C$42.85 after agreeing to a deal
that values it at about C$42.68 a share. If the deal receives
approval from shareholders and regulators, TMX shareholders
would receive 2.9963 LSE shares for each TMX share they own,
giving them 45 percent of the combined company.  Results    Intact Financial Corp .,  Sierra Wireless Inc .,  Agrium Inc .
and  WestJet Airlines Ltd . each moved more than 3 percent after
reporting financial results.  Intact Financial, Canada’s largest property and casualty
insurer, slumped 4.7 percent to C$48.91 after trailing analysts’
average fourth-quarter profit estimate by 22 percent, excluding
certain items.  Sierra Wireless, which makes wireless-communications
products, sank 26 percent, the most since December 2008, to
C$11.37 after missing analysts’ average fourth-quarter profit
estimate by 32 percent, excluding certain items. The company
said it may have a loss of as much as 6 cents a share in the
first quarter.  Agrium, Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer,
advanced 3 percent to C$95.65, the highest since July 2008,
after topping analysts’ average earnings estimate by 20 percent,
excluding certain items.  WestJet, Canada’s largest airline by market value, jumped
12 percent to C$14.76 after reporting quarterly earnings of 33
cents a share excluding some items, two times the average
analyst forecast.  Air Canada , the biggest airline by revenue,
rose for a fifth day, advancing 4.3 percent to C$3.42.    Cameco Corp ., the world’s second-biggest uranium producer,
rose 2.9 percent to C$42.09 after Anthony Young, an analyst at
Dahlman Rose & Co., began coverage of the company with a “buy”
rating. Demand for uranium will increase due to construction of
nuclear power plants in China, Russia and India, Young said in a
note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
