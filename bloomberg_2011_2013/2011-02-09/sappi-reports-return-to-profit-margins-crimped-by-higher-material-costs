  Sappi Ltd ., the world’s largest maker
of glossy paper, reported a profit in the three months ended
Dec. 31 and said operating margins were below its expectations
because of the rising cost of materials.  Net income was $37 million in the fiscal first quarter,
compared with a loss of $51 million a year earlier, the
Johannesburg-based company said today in a statement. Sales rose
almost 16 percent to $1.87 billion.  Demand for paper and pulp products improved as the global
economy recovered from recession, the manufacturer said. Sappi
sold more of its products at higher prices, though operating
margins missed company forecasts because of rising pulp costs,
it said.  “Our raw material input costs are gradually increasing as
commodity prices rise,” Chief Executive Officer Ralph Boettger
said in the statement. Operating profit in the current quarter
will “continue the improving trend” relative to last year but
will be below that of the fiscal first quarter, he said.  Sappi fell as much as 1.11 rand, or 2.9 percent, to 37.40
rand in Johannesburg trading and was down 2.6 percent as of
10:19 a.m. local time.  Net debt gained to $2.43 billion from $2.22 billion at the
end of the previous quarter, Sappi said. The company will buy
back $150 million of its notes to reduce its debt repayment
schedule, it said in a stock exchange statement. The cash tender
will help reduce a total borrowing of $500 million in 6.75
percent notes due in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
