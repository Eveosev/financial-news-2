Gecamines, the Democratic Republic of
Congo’s state-owned copper and cobalt miner, could produce as
much as 1 million metric tons of copper a year with its
partners, General Manager Ahmed Kalej said in a speech in  Cape
Town  today. He didn’t give a time period.  Decades of mismanagement and war brought Gecamines’ copper
production to below 10,000 tons a year in 2003, from
476,000 tons in 1986.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
