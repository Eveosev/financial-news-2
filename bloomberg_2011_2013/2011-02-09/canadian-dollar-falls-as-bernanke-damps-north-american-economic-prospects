  Canada ’s dollar fell for a third day
against the euro as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke damped  North America ’s economic recovery prospects.  The loonie, as the currency is also known, followed its
U.S. counterpart lower after Bernanke said in congressional
testimony unemployment for Canada’s largest trading partner will
remain high for “some time.” The Canadian dollar later
advanced versus the greenback as the U.S. Treasury 10-year note
yield fell following the $24 billion auction of the debt.  “Canada shares a border with the U.S.,” said Michael O’Neill, managing director at Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange
Inc. in Toronto. “The Canadian dollar is in a sweet spot, and
the market doesn’t want to push it out of its range yet.”  The loonie declined 0.6 percent to C$1.3648 against the
euro at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.3560 yesterday. It touched
C$1.3661, the weakest level since Feb. 2. The Canadian currency
ended the day at 99.38 cents versus the greenback, up 0.1
percent from 99.52. The loonie touched 98.32 on Feb. 4, the
strongest level since May 2008.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it exited from a money-losing
wager yesterday that recommended betting that the Australian
dollar would weaken against its Canadian counterpart.  Canada’s dollar advanced 0.4 percent against the Australian
currency to C$1.0062, from C$1.0098 yesterday, when it touched
C$1.0128, the weakest level since Jan. 3.  The  Bank of Canada  has left its benchmark interest rate at
1 percent since boosting in September it for a third consecutive
meeting. The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia ’s target has stayed at
4.75 percent for the past two meetings.  Rate Cycle  “Canada just began its rate-tightening cycle in the
summer, while Australia is probably limited in how much farther
it can go in rates,” said Firas Askari, head currency trader at
Bank of Montreal in Toronto. “From a monetary policy view, I
like that trade, and you still have the commodity back up in
case the Aussie starts rallying again on increased growth.”  Goldman Sachs said in a research note today that it had
advised investors put on the trade in January. The potential
loss on the trade, including cost of carry, is about 4 percent,
the New York-based bank said.  Credit market prices show investors may be anticipating
higher Canadian policy rates. The yield on the September 2011
bankers’ acceptances contract was 1.74 percent, compared with
1.59 percent on Jan. 31.  The loonie rose to a two-year high on Feb. 4, when  Statistics Canada  reported that employers hired a net 69,200 in
January, more than four times the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. The jobless rate rose to 7.8 percent.  U.S. Jobless Rate  U.S. unemployment dropped to 9 percent last month, the
lowest level since April 2009. It fell to 9.4 percent in
December, from 9.8 percent in November.  While Bernanke told the House Budget Committee that the
declines in the U.S. jobless rate in December and January “do
provide some grounds for optimism,” he cautioned that “with
output growth likely to be moderate for a while and with
employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their payrolls,
it will be several years before the  unemployment rate  has
returned to a more normal level.”  Bets the Canadian dollar will gain against the U.S.
currency have fallen from 47,757 on Jan. 11, the highest level
since May, according to figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a drop was 33,814 on Feb. 1, compared
with net longs of 31,719 a week earlier.  ‘Off the Table’  “A lot of people are long Canadian dollars, and when you
don’t see a continuation of that move you’re going to see some
people take that money off the table,” said Bank of Montreal’s
Askari.    Government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year
note down four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.45
percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June
2020 increased 31 cents to C$100.42.  Canada auctioned C$3.2 billion ($3.2 billion) of three-year
bonds at an average yield of 2.262 percent. A total of C$7.8
billion in bids was received, the Bank of Canada said today on
its website.  To contact the reporter for this story:
