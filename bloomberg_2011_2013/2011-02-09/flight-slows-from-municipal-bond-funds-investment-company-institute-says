Investor withdrawals from U.S.
municipal bond funds fell last week to the slowest pace since
the start of December, after lower prices made the debt more
attractive.  Investors pulled $1.17 billion from U.S. municipal bond
funds in the week ended Feb. 2, the smallest amount since the
week ended Dec. 1, the Washington-based  Investment Company
Institute  said today in an e-mailed statement. U.S. domestic
stock mutual funds posted their fourth week of net deposits,
with investors adding $1.41 billion.  Municipal bonds fell 5.4 percent in the three months ended
Feb. 2, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Municipal
Master Index. Banking analyst  Meredith Whitney  stirred a debate
in the $2.86 trillion muni-debt market by predicting in December
as many as 100 significant defaults this year reaching
“hundreds of billions” of dollars. She said in a Jan. 30
interview that she doesn’t have specific numbers backing up that
prediction.  Investors added $1.75 billion to taxable bond funds and
$346 million to stock funds that invest outside the U.S. Funds
that invest in both stocks and bonds attracted $1.66 billion.  Domestic stock funds have attracted more money than funds
that invest in equities abroad for the past four weeks, a
reversal after investors withdrew about $98 billion from the
domestic stock funds in 2010.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, a measure of U.S. stocks,
rose 9.3 percent in the three months ended Feb. 2, compared with
a 6.3 percent increase for the MSCI EAFE Index of developed non-
U.S. markets and 1 percent by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
