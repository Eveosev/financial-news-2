  Hitachi Ltd ., Japan’s third-biggest
company by sales, completed a 4 billion yen ($49 million) plant
to expand its domestic production of wind power generators.  The plant, at Hitachi City, northeast of Tokyo, is part of
the company’s plan to increase production by 70 percent to 2,400
generators a year by 2013, the Tokyo-based company said today in
a  statement .  The company expects global wind power capacity to reach 445
gigawatts by 2014 from 160 gigawatts in 2009, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
