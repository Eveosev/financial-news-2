Kun Renewables LLP, a unit of
Kazakhstan’s  Lancaster Group , expects to begin exporting
purified silicon used in solar cells from a new plant in the
central Asian country next year.  “Production should begin in 20 months,” Prasad Bhamre,
president of the Almaty-based company, said in an interview
today in Mumbai. Potential markets are  India , Malaysia,  Thailand 
and  China , he said.  Purified silicon, known as polysilicon, is sliced into
wafers to make solar cells that are joined into photovoltaic
panels.  The $388 million plant in Astana is expected to produce
2,500 tons a year. The  Development Bank of Kazakhstan  is lending
$200 million to the project with Lancaster Group providing the
remainder in equity.  Electricity can account for as much as 45 percent of the
cost of making polysilicon in countries like Japan and the U.S.,
said Bhamre. “It’s the single biggest component” of costs.  Lower power rates in energy-rich Kazakhstan will allow the
plant to produce polysilicon more cheaply with electricity
accounting for about 20 percent of the cost, he said.    Kazakhstan  has 3 percent of the world’s oil supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
