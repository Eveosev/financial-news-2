Corn futures may open 12 cents to 16
cents a bushel higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after the
government said U.S. inventories will be smaller than forecast
last month, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago, and wheat futures may rise 8 cents to 10 cents a
bushel after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  trimmed its
forecast for global inventories and left domestic reserves
unchanged, Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
