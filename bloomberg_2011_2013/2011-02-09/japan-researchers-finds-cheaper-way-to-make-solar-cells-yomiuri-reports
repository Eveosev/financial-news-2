Japanese researchers found a way to
cut the cost of making solar cells for power generation by using
liquid silicon, the Daily Yomiuri newspaper  reported .  Researchers at the  Japan Advanced Institute of Science and
Technology  near Kanazawa northwest of Tokyo coated glass plates
with a silicon-based solution that are heated, the newspaper
said today, citing Professor Tatsuya Shimoda, the head of the
research team.  The usual method of turning solid silicon into gas is more
expensive, according to the report.  The cells produced by the group can generate 20 percent of
the power of conventional cells, the report said. The
performance can be increased by producing higher precision
silicon layers, the newspaper cited the researchers as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
