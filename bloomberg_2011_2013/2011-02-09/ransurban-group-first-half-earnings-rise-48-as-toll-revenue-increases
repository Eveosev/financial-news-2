  Transurban Group , Australia’s
biggest operator of toll roads, said first-half profit rose 48
percent and it’s on the lookout for assets in the U.S. and  Australia .  Net income was A$74.7 million ($75.6 million) in the six
months ended Dec. 31, from A$50.4 million a year earlier, the
Melbourne-based company said in a statement today. Toll revenue
rose 7.4 percent to A$447 million from a year ago.  Chief Executive Officer Chris Lynch is seeking to cut costs,
reduce debt and increase growth, in part to justify his
rejection of a A$7.2 billion takeover bid from the company’s
three biggest shareholders last year. The company’s shares are
6.6 percent below the A$5.57-a-share offer, which it spurned and
instead acquired the Lane Cove Tunnel in Sydney.  Lynch said in a telephone interview any future purchases
would have similar attributes to the Lane Cove Tunnel. “We had
an opportunity there that we’d be able to generate some
synergies that other buyers wouldn’t have had,” he said.  Transurban bought the Lane Cove Tunnel for A$630 million, a
third of its construction and financing costs.  The shares fell 1.7 percent to A$5.20 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of trading in Sydney.  “Watching Brief”  In the U.S., Transurban has a “watching brief” on some
assets, he said. While  Virginia , where the company currently
owns the Pocahontas 895 and is building a lane on the Capital
Beltway, will remain its focus for the next few years, it may
consider other areas in the future, Lynch said.  Free  cash flow , on which Transurban bases its dividend
payouts, rose 17 percent to A$188 million. The company will pay
out 13 Australian cents a share for the period and at least 26
cents for the full year, it said.  The company, which had two members of its executive team
leave after a restructure last month, will see more employees
depart, Lynch said, without specifying the number. The impact of
the cuts will start to be seen in financial year 2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
