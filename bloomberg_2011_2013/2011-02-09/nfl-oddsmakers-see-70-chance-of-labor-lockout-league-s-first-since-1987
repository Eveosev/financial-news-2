The  National Football League ’s labor
contract expires in less than a month and oddsmakers say there’s
a 70 percent chance the league is headed for its first work
stoppage in 24 years.  The NFL and NFL Players Association met Feb. 5, the day
before the  Super Bowl , in the first of a series of negotiating
sessions aimed at reaching a new collective bargaining agreement
before the end of the league year on March 3.  The two sides remain far apart on many issues, leading
sports gambling website  Bodog.com  to set 1-3 odds that owners
will lock out players on March 4. The odds against a lockout are
2-1 at Antigua-based Bodog, or 30 percent.  A winning $100 wager on a lockout taking place would return
about $33 along with the original stake.  The NFL’s last work stoppage was in 1987, when the regular
season was reduced to 15 games from 16 by a 24-day players’
strike. In 1982, a 57-day strike shortened the season to nine
games.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and union Executive Director  DeMaurice Smith  said last week that there’s a sense of urgency
on both sides to reach an agreement before the current deal
expires. If there’s a lockout, about 500 of the league’s 1,900
players would be unable to become free agents, while others
couldn’t collect salary raises and bonuses.  “This is the window of opportunity to get this done
right,” Goodell said during his Feb. 4 state-of-the-league news
conference. “Otherwise, uncertainty is going to seep into all
of our operations and make it harder for everybody to reach that
agreement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
