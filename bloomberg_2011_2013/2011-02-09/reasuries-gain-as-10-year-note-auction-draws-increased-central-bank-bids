Treasury 10-year note yields fell from
the highest level since April as the government’s $24 billion
auction of the debt drew the most demand on record from a class
of investors that includes foreign central banks.  Indirect bidders bought 71.3 percent of the notes, compared
with 53.6 percent in January and an average of 46.4 percent for
the past 10 sales. Yields had climbed the most in more than two
weeks yesterday after the Treasury’s three-year note auction
attracted the lowest indirect bids since 2007 amid concern
inflation is accelerating.  “The major severe selloff in the last couple of days
provided some value for investors, and they came in at
remarkable levels,” said Thomas Simons, a government debt
economist in  New York  at Jefferies Group Inc., one of 20 primary
dealers that trades with the Fed. “This is the polar opposite
of yesterday’s auction and was pretty remarkable. The biggest
story is the indirect bid and dealers missed as bad as any kind
off dealers can miss.”  The yield on the 10-year note dropped nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 3.65 percent at 5:02 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 rose 22/32, or $6.88
per $1,000 of face value, to 91 20/32.  The yield earlier touched 3.77 percent, the most since
April 29. It rose 11 basis points yesterday, the most since Jan.
20.  Note Streak  Two-year note yields fell five basis points to 0.8 percent
and snapped a seven-day streak, the longest since a 10-day drop
that began Dec. 18 2009.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the House Budget
Committee in  Washington  that the  unemployment rate  is likely to
remain high “for some time,” indicating the central bank will
maintain its policy of low  interest rates  and debt buying.  The Fed purchased $7.5 billion of securities due from
February 2015 to June 2016 today, part of its $600 billion debt-
purchase plan to bolster the economy, according to its website.
The Fed will update its buying schedule tomorrow. The central
bank has held its short-term interest rate target at almost zero
since December 2008.  The 10-year note sale drew a yield of 3.665 percent, the
highest since 3.9 percent in April, compared with a forecast of
3.725 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Federal
Rserve’s 20 primary dealers.  Bid-to-Cover  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.23,
compared with an average of 3.13 for the past 10 sales. The
notes drew a yield of 3.665 percent, compared with a forecast of
3.725 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the  Federal
Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 0.5 percent of
the debt, the fewest since at January 2009, compared with 8
percent at the January offering and a 10-sale average of 12.16
percent.  “Investors are looking to move out the curve and capture
more income as yield levels have reached points investors deem
attractive,” said  Kevin Flanagan , a Purchase, New York-based
fixed-income strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. “This
was as strong auction by all accounts and suggests that
investors may think the market selloff off late has come close
to its fulfillment.”  Overseas Buyers  Foreign investors held 49.7 percent of the $8.75 trillion
of public  U.S. government debt  outstanding as of November,
according to the Treasury.  Yesterday’s $32 billion auction of three-year debt sold at
1.349 percent, the highest yield since May. The U.S. will sell
$16 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow, completing three note and
bond auctions this week totaling $72 billion.  Bernanke told the House Budget Committee today that while
the declines in the jobless rate in December and January “do
provide some grounds for optimism,” he cautioned that “with
output growth likely to be moderate for a while and with
employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their payrolls,
it will be several years before the unemployment rate has
returned to a more normal level.”  The extent to which the recovery is established and
inflation is pointing higher or lower will help determine
whether the Fed expands or pulls back on the stimulus, Bernanke
said in response to questions.  Fed Stance  “It’s hard to see how The Fed is going to do anything
until the recovery is on track and until there is significant  job creation , which means they will be accommodative for
awhile,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG, a primary dealer.  Labor Department data on Feb. 4 showed the jobless rate
fell to 9 percent last month, a 21-month low, and employers
added 36,000 jobs, less than forecast.  Initial jobless claims are forecast to fall to 410,000
from 415,000 in the week ending Feb. 5, according to a forecast
of 50 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Treasury 10-year notes returned 7.9 percent last year,
compared with 5.9 percent for the overall Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
