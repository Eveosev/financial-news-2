Oil traded near the lowest in almost
two weeks in  New York  after a U.S. government report showed an
increase in stockpiles in the world’s second-biggest energy
consumer. Brent climbed above $100 a barrel  West Texas Intermediate slid 0.3 percent yesterday after an
Energy Department report showed crude inventories climbed for a
fourth week, the longest stretch of gains since the six weeks
ended May 21. Supplies of gasoline and distillate fuels also
rose. Brent in  London  traded above $100 for a ninth day amid
continued unrest in  Egypt .  “Rising U.S. crude and gasoline inventories pressured
WTI,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in a note
today. Protests in Egypt supported the “supply disruption
premium in Brent,” he said.  The March contract was at $86.82 a barrel, up 11 cents, in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:42
a.m. Sydney time. Yesterday, it slipped 23 cents to $86.71, the
lowest settlement since Jan. 27. Prices are 17 percent higher
than a year earlier.  The more-actively traded April contract rose 14 cents to
$90.24 a barrel.  In London, Brent crude oil for March settlement gained 21
cents, or 0.2 percent, to $102.03 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Crude, Fuel Supplies  Brent’s premium to West Texas Intermediate widened to
$15.16 a barrel from $15.11 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The gap averaged 76 cents last year.  U.S. crude stockpiles increased 1.9 million barrels to
345.1 million last week, the Energy Department report showed.
They were forecast to rise 2 million barrels, according to the
median of 15 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Inventories of crude at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate, declined 927,000 barrels to
37.4 million. Supplies in the week ended Jan. 28 climbed to the
highest since the department started keeping records at the
storage hub in 2004. Cushing is landlocked in the central U.S.  Gasoline stockpiles advanced 4.66 million barrels to 240.9
million last week, the highest since March 1990, the Energy
Department said. They were forecast to climb 2.6 million
barrels, according to the Bloomberg News survey.  Distillate fuel supplies, including heating oil and diesel,
rose 288,000 barrels to 164.4 million, the Energy Department
report said. They were forecast to decline 1 million barrels.  Tanker Seized  A 1,100-foot supertanker carrying Kuwaiti oil to the U.S.
was seized by pirates off eastern Oman yesterday, the first
hijacking of a vessel of that size since April.  The Irene SL is carrying 270,266 metric tons of oil
destined for the  Gulf of Mexico , Enesel SA, its owner, said in
an e-mailed statement.  Pirates hijacked a record 53 ships and 1,181 crew members
in 2010, most of them off Somalia, according to the London-based
International Maritime Bureau. Average ransom payments rose to
$5.4 million last year, compared with $150,000 in 2005,
according to Louisville, Colorado-based One Earth Future
Foundation, a non-profit group.  Daily exports of the four North Sea crude grades that
determine the price of Dated Brent are scheduled to drop 7.4
percent in March from this month.  Combined shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk
oil will total 1.13 million barrels a day next month, according
to Bloomberg calculations based on loading programs. That
compares with 1.22 million barrels a day in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
