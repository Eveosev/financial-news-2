Williams Grand Prix Holdings Plc said
shares in an initial public offering will be offered at 24 euros
to 29 euros apiece, valuing the company at 265 million euros at
the mid-point of the pricing. It commented in an e-mailed
statement today.  Williams F1 isn’t raising new capital in the offering,
which enables existing shareholders to sell down part of their
holding “to allow investor participation.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
