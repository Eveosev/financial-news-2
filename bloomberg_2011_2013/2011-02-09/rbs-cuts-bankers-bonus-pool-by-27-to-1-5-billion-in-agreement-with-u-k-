  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the
U.K.’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, cut the amount it set
aside for bonuses at its investment banking unit by 27 percent
to less than 950 million pounds ($1.5 billion), as part of an
agreement with the government.  Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester’s pay for this year
will remain at the level set in 2008. Hester, who will receive
no cash bonus, will get about 2 million pounds in stock for
2010. The decision followed consultations with shareholders,
according to a spokesman for the Edinburgh-based lender.  The lender set aside about 1.3 billion pounds for bonuses
at its Global Banking and Markets unit last year.  The decision followed an announcement today by Chancellor
of the Exchequer  George Osborne  that he had reached agreement
with Britain’s biggest banks, including RBS and  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc , to pay lower bonuses and set targets for business
lending. The deal, known as Project Merlin, came a day after the
U.K. raised tax on the banking industry by 800 million pounds.  Lloyds will award its outgoing Chief Executive Officer  Eric Daniels  a 1.45 million-pound bonus for 2010, all of it payable
in shares and deferred to 2013.  Both Lloyds and RBS said cash bonuses for 2010 payouts
would be limited to 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
