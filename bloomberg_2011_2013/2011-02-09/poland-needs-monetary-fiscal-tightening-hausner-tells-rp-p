Poland needs to narrow its  budget
deficit  and raise  interest rates  at the same time to avoid a
loss of investor confidence that could trigger a “drastic”
weakening of the zloty and a surge in inflation,  Jerzy Hausner 
of the central bank’s Monetary Policy Council wrote in an
article published in  Rzeczpospolita  newspaper today.  Simultaneous fiscal and monetary tightening, in a “safe
scenario,” may slow Poland’s economic growth for four to six
quarters, according to the article co-written with former
Finance Minister Miroslaw Gronicki and published on the
newspaper’s rp.pl website. Economic growth may slow from about
4.5 percent in the first half of the year to below 2 percent in
2012, if the “strong twin tightenings” are needed, Hausner and
Gronicki wrote, according to rp.pl.    Poland  must increase domestic interest rates because of
global price rises triggered by the monetary and fiscal stimulus
adopted during the financial crisis, and because the central
bank needs to maintain the spread of domestic interest rates
over the euro area’s when the latter begin to rise, Hausner and
Gronicki said, rp.pl reported.  “If this disparity were to significantly narrow, a drastic
depreciation of the zloty could occur and inflationary pressure
would grow,” Hausner and Gronicki said, according to the text
of the article in rp.pl.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
