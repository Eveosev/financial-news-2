  Ghana â€™s Parliament will pass an oil-
revenue management bill before Feb. 17, when President John Atta
Mills is scheduled to address the body, Majority Leader Cletus
Avoka said today.  Lawmakers have agreed on issues including using oil revenue
as collateral for loans, he said by phone from Accra, the
capital. The bill could be approved as early as this week, Avoka
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
