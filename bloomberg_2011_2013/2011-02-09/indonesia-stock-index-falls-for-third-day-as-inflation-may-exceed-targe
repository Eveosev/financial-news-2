  Indonesia ’s stocks dropped, with the
benchmark index falling for a third day, after the central bank
said inflation may exceed its target, prompting speculation  interest rates  will be increased further.  The  Jakarta Composite index  lost 1.2 percent to 3,417.47 as
of the 4 p.m. local time close, the lowest level since Jan. 31.
More than three stocks fell for each that rose. PT Bank Mandiri,
Indonesia’s largest bank by assets, plunged 4.2 percent, the
most since Jan. 10. PT Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur, an instant
noodle maker, slid 2.8 percent after wheat rose to a 29-month
high as drought threatened to damage crops in China.  Bank Indonesia raised its benchmark interest rate last week
for the first time in more than two years as the pace of
consumer price increases quickened to a 21-month high. Inflation
this year may exceed the target of 4 percent to 6 percent,  Bank
Indonesia  Deputy Governor Budi Mulya said today.  “Anomalies in weather conditions are spurring inflation in
many places around the world,” said Fadlul Imansyah, who helps
manage around $213 million at Jakarta-based PT CIMB Principal
Asset Management. “Bank Indonesia will likely respond with
another rate increase, which will eventually affect banks.”  Bank Indonesia raised its key interest rate by a quarter
percentage point to 6.75 percent on Feb. 4, the first increase
since October 2008. The Jakarta Composite has dropped 7.7
percent this year as faster inflation and higher interest rates
damped growth prospects in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy.
Domestic consumption accounts for about two thirds of the
economy, which grew 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the
fastest annual pace in six years.  Overseas Investors  Overseas investors have sold a net 2.572 trillion rupiah
($288 million) of shares this year and shares on the index are
trading at an average of 13.5 times estimated earnings, the
lowest level since May 2010.  Mandiri fell 4.2 percent to 5,700 rupiah and PT Bank Rakyat
Indonesia, the second largest bank by assets, declined 4.2
percent to 4,625 rupiah.  Indofood CBP, Indonesia’s biggest instant-noodle maker,
fell 2.8 percent to 4,425 rupiah, the lowest since Jan. 24.
Indofood uses wheat to produce instant noodles.  Wheat gained today to the highest level since August 2008,
rising to $8.83 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, as
drought threatened to damage crops in  China  and Middle Eastern
and African nations boosted purchases to tackle food inflation.
Wheat has surged 82 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
