Mozambique expects to start exporting
coal from July this year, Mineral Resources Minister Esperanca
Bias said.  The southeastern African nation has issued about 100 coal
exploration licenses and expects at least three companies to
submit mining proposals “soon,” she said in a speech at the
Mining Indaba conference in  Cape Town  today. Mozambique already
has three coal mining projects already under development, Bias
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
