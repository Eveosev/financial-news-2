  Marathon Oil Corp . will shut the No.
5 crude unit at its Catlettsburg refinery in  Kentucky  from Feb.
10 to March 2 for maintenance, according to a filing with state
regulators.  A naphtha pre-treater and high-pressure continuous
catalytic reformer will also be shut during the work, according
to the filing with the Kentucky Division of Air Quality.  Shane Pochard, a spokesman for Marathon, declined to
comment.  According to a separate filing the state received Jan. 3,
work on a catalytic reformer and naphtha pre-treater scheduled
to begin in February will boost processing capacity.
“Operational start-up” is expected in August, the filing
showed.  New stripper trays in a naphtha pre-treater unit will
eliminate a bottleneck and boost the capacity of the pre-treater
and associated units by 16 percent to 32,000 barrels a day,
according to the filing. The No. 5 crude unit’s processing
capacity is expected to rise 3 percent, and the No. 3 crude
unit’s by 3.5 percent.  The Catlettsburg refinery can process 240,000 barrels a day
of crude oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
