  Rio Tinto  Group extended its A$3.9
billion ($3.9 billion) offer for  Riversdale Mining Ltd . as  Brazil ’s  Cia Siderurgica Nacional SA  again lifted its stake in
the African coal project developer.  The A$16 a share cash bid expires on March 4, London-based
Rio said today in a statement. It’s seeking at least 50 percent
of Riversdale’s stock. Rio owns 14.96 percent of the Sydney-
based company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Rio Tinto is targeting Riversdale to boost reserves of
steelmaking coal as demand and prices climb. Riversdale’s
largest shareholder  Tata Steel Ltd . holds 24.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CSN, as the Brazilian
steelmaker is known, today said it increased its stake to 19.9
percent from 17.58 percent.  “CSN may want to ensure they definitely get a seat at the
table, they may be asking for a board seat,” said Cameron Peacock, a market analyst at IG Markets in  Melbourne . “They may
want to have as strong an equity hand as they can without having
to make a takeover offer.”  Riversdale shares gained 0.6 percent to A$15.95 at the
close in Sydney on the Australian stock exchange. The offer has
been recommended by the board of Riversdale, and Managing
Director Steve Mallyon said in a Jan. 24 interview that he
expected Rio’s bid to succeed.  “It has now been in excess of two months since the market
was made aware of a possible change of control transaction
regarding Riversdale and in that time no offer has emerged,”
Rio said in the statement.  CSN said it acquired 5.49 million shares yesterday at
prices between A$15.92 and A$16.00.  To contact the reporter on this story:
