Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world’s
largest maker of  wind turbines , forecast sales will increase to
a record 7 billion euros ($9.5 billion) this year, more than
analysts estimated.  Revenue will increase from 6.92 billion euros in 2010, the
Randers, Denmark-based company said today in a stock-exchange
statement. The manufacturer in November said 2011 sales would be
“level” with 2010. The average estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 30 analysts was 2011 revenue of 6.76 billion euros.  The credit crisis prompted banks to restrict loans to wind-
park developers that buy turbines from Vestas and competitors
including  Germany ’s Siemens AG, Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA of  Spain  and General Electric Co. Vestas today said that after a
“tough year” the company is “on track” as customers agreed
to buy a record amount of turbines last year.  “Orders are flowing again,” Gerard Reid, an analyst with
Jefferies Group Inc. in  London , said in a note before the
earnings were published. “Vestas has taken the majority of
orders placed among the publicly traded Western manufacturers.”  The shares rose as much as 6.4 percent in Copenhagen
trading and were up 6.8 kroner, or 3.8 percent, to 183.9 kroner
at 10:06 a.m. local time. The stock lost 44 percent last year
compared with an 8.7 percent gain in the  Bloomberg European 500 
Index.  Vestas reported fourth-quarter earnings before interest and
tax of 248 million euros when including one-time costs, missing
the average estimate of a 348 million-euro profit in a Bloomberg
survey of 16 analysts. Sales in the quarter more than doubled to
3.12 billion euros.  Global turbine contracts signed in the last six months of
2010 for delivery this year averaged 980,000 euros a megawatt,
London-based Bloomberg New Energy Finance said Feb. 7. That’s
down from 1.06 million euros for contracts signed in 2009 and a
peak of 1.21 million euros in 2007 and 2008, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
