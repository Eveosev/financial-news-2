European stocks fell after the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index closed yesterday near its highest level since
2008.    Sanofi-Aventis SA  slipped after saying earnings per share
will drop this year.  Statoil ASA  retreated after it reported
lower-than-estimated fourth-quarter profit and said production
may fall this year.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc  soared 3.1
percent after agreeing to buy Toronto Stock Exchange owner TMX
Group Inc.  The Stoxx 600 fell 0.4 percent to 287.35 at the close in  London . The measure had surged to near the highest level since
September 2008 amid optimism that the economic recovery is
accelerating and as European governments introduced policies to
support indebted countries using the single currency. The rally
has pushed the Stoxx 600 to about 16 times the reported earning
of its companies, the highest level in nine months, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ve had months of uninterrupted gains,” Philipp Baertschi, chief strategist at Bank Sarasin in Zurich, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “After that, we’re due for a
break. In the short term, sentiment is overly optimistic. The
market is due for a correction, but we see it as a buying
opportunity.”  Earnings Projections  More than 73 percent of the 309 companies in the U.S.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that reported results since Jan. 10
have topped per-share earnings projections, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In Europe, 56 percent beat forecasts, the
data show.  National benchmarks fell in 12 of the 18 western European
markets.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped 0.4 percent and  Germany ’s DAX
fell less than 0.1 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.6
percent.  Sanofi retreated 1.5 percent to 50.37 euros. The French
drugmaker trying to take over  Genzyme Corp . said business
earnings per share will drop 5 percent to 10 percent this year.
The forecast excludes any benefit from the possible purchase of
Genzyme and is at constant exchange rates, Sanofi said. Fourth-
quarter business net income of 1.84 billion euros ($2.5 billion)
compared with an average analyst estimate of 1.75 billion euros.  “Some earnings reports weren’t as good as expected,” said
Louis de Fels, a Paris-based money manager at Raymond James
Asset Management International, which oversees $30 billion
worldwide. “That can explain the decline in stocks today. But
the drop will be short term.”  2011 Production  Statoil ASA lost 3.2 percent to 137.7 kroner. Norway’s
largest oil company said fourth-quarter net income rose to 9.53
billion kroner ($1.7 billion), or 2.99 kroner a share, from 7.16
billion kroner, or 2.25 kroner a share, a year earlier. That
missed the 12.5 billion kroner average estimate from a survey of
12 analysts. The company said 2011 production may be slightly
below that of 2010.  LSE surged 3.1 percent to 920 pence. The 210-year-old
bourse operator agreed to buy TMX Group in an all-share
transaction valued at about C$3.2 billion ($3.2 billion) as the
companies cut costs to counter lost market share.  Trading in shares of NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse AG 
was halted after the companies confirmed Deutsche Boerse is in
advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext in an all-stock transaction
that would create the world’s biggest equity exchange.    Syngenta AG  advanced 4.4 percent to 320.5 francs. The
world’s biggest maker of agricultural chemicals reported annual
profit that beat analyst estimates and pledged to return $850
million in cash to shareholders.  Net income was $1.4 billion, little changed from a year
earlier, Syngenta said. Analysts had predicted $1.31 billion.  Slower Pace    Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc  lost 5.1 percent to 3,270
pence. The maker of Neurofen painkillers said 2011 sales will
probably rise at a slower pace than last year as the global
market stagnates.    Sanoma Oyj  slid 4.7 percent to 16.72 euros. The Nordic
media company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 900,000
euros, missing the 33.5 million-euro mean net-income estimate of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.    PagesJaunes Groupe  retreated 8.5 percent to 7.08 euros. The
directory company said 2010 net income fell 11 percent to 244.9
million euros.    Mobistar SA  slid 3.9 percent to 45.73 euros.  Belgium ’s
second-biggest mobile-phone company forecast profit will decline
this year and cut its dividend because of regulatory cuts in the
rate it charges other operators to handle calls on its network.  PSA Peugeot Citroen sank 4.5 percent to 29.81 euros.
Europe’s second-biggest carmaker posted a 0.5 percent second-
half operating margin for its auto division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
