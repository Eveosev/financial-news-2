Liberty Group Ltd.’s property unit
plans to spend 1 billion rand ($139 million) this year to
renovate and extend shopping malls, Business Day reported,
citing Sean Segar, its chief investment officer.  Liberty Properties won’t buy new property assets because of
limited opportunities, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited
Segar as saying. The company had 1.3 billion rand in cash at the
end of December, it reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
