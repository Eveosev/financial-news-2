  EBay Inc ., preparing for a day when
its PayPal online-payment unit is its biggest source of revenue,
will lay out a three-year plan tomorrow for expanding the
business and warding off threats from  Google Inc . and  Apple Inc .  At a meeting with analysts, EBay will unveil its strategy
for the mobile version of PayPal, the BillMeLater service and
its open-platform effort, which lets outside programmers work
with its software, the  San Jose , California-based company said.  While Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe will discuss
plans for the entire company, he’ll devote close attention to
PayPal -- EBay’s fastest-growing business. The payment service
is on track to generate more revenue than EBay’s e-commerce
marketplace in coming years, the company has said. Key to that
growth will be fending off threats from technology companies and
the three largest credit-card networks, which are all investing
in online-payment systems.  “There is a huge opportunity for innovation and share gain
in the payment space over the next five years,” said Dana Stalder, a former PayPal executive who’s now a venture
capitalist at Matrix Partners. “PayPal is the best-positioned
of any company to seize that opportunity, but it will take a lot
of great execution.”  The effort is led by Scott Thompson, a former  Visa Inc .
executive who joined PayPal in 2005. He aims to capitalize on
PayPal’s head start and avoid the fate of EBay’s auction site,
which lost its lead in e-commerce to  Amazon.com Inc . PayPal
declined to make Thompson, 53, available for an interview.  Smartphone Payments  A growing array of rivals is offering alternative payments
-- transactions not done with cash, check or credit cards --
spurred in part by the rise of smartphones.  Apple and Google are both working on enabling payments
through so-called near-field communications, a wireless standard
that would let users glide through checkout lines by waving
their phones, people familiar with the plans said.  Using PayPal on mobile devices requires consumers to
download its application. That hurdle may give an edge to Apple,
Google and carriers such as  Verizon Wireless  because they can
weave their payment technologies directly into a phone’s
interface.  “They are going to have to continue to innovate in mobile,
and they are somewhat at a disadvantage in that they don’t
control the mobile platform,” said  Aaron Kessler , an analyst at
ThinkEquity LLC in San Francisco.  ‘It’s All We Do’  PayPal says its advantage is its narrower focus.  “PayPal clearly is a leader in payments -- it’s all we
do,” said Anuj Nayar, a spokesman for PayPal, which has its own
campus down the road from EBay’s headquarters. “There are a lot
of new entrants in the payments market. Many of them have one or
two of the capabilities that PayPal delivers. Nobody has all of
them.”  Facebook Inc., meanwhile, has served as both a boon and a
threat to PayPal. People who play games on social-networking
sites use the payment service to buy virtual goods, such as a
tractor for “FarmVille” or a gun on “Mafia Wars.” Those kinds of
items now account for more than 33 percent of payment volume at
PayPal, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Facebook, though, has begun taking a 30 percent cut of
transactions on its site. It’s promoting its own option
called Facebook Credits, which works with PayPal as well as
other payment services. That may restrict the potential market.  Profit Margins  Another challenge: While PayPal has helped revive growth at
EBay, it’s come at a cost. The division carries lower profit
margins than EBay’s marketplace.  The main business has margins of about 40 percent,
according to  Spencer Wang , an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.
At PayPal, the figure was 22.1 percent at the end of 2010,
though the margin will grow to more than 25 percent over the
next five years, he predicts.  “The EBay business is structurally far more profitable,”
said Stalder, who became a venture capitalist after leaving EBay
in 2008. “In order to achieve the same  cash flow , PayPal has to
be dramatically bigger than EBay.”  PayPal also faces competition from startups such as Square
Inc. and Zong Inc., along with  MasterCard Inc ., Visa and  American Express Co ., which spent almost $3 billion last year to
buy Internet-based payment processors.  “PayPal has to figure out how to create loyalty to the
PayPal brand,” said  David Robertson , publisher of the payment-
industry trade publication Nilson Report. That may mean offering
users rewards to sign up for mobile services, or wowing them
with gee-whiz applications.  It also won’t be able to rely as much on the EBay site to
promote PayPal. Most EBay buyers and sellers already rely on the
payment service, so the marketplace is losing its power to find
new PayPal customers.  That’s adding pressure for PayPal to spread out, said Rich
Aberman, co-founder of payment startup WePay Inc.  “PayPal rode on the EBay wave into the mainstream,” he
said. “PayPal is obviously trying to change that because EBay
is not the golden goose it used to be.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
