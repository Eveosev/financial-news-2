Asian stocks fell, driving down a
benchmark regional index by the most this month, as China-
related shares dropped after policy makers took more steps to
curb inflation.  Cnooc Ltd., China’s largest offshore energy producer, and  China  Resources Land Ltd., a state-linked property developer,
sank more than 2.8 percent. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the
world’s biggest contract electronics maker, dropped 3.6 percent
in Taipei. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest automaker,
jumped 5.2 percent in Tokyo after boosting its profit forecast.  “There’s concern that if tightening continues in China,
there will be a pull back on demand,” said Matt Riordan, who
helps manage about $6 billion in Sydney at Paradice Investment
Management Pty. “Earnings have continued to surprise on the
upside. The signs of an economic recovery are clearly there.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.1 percent to 138.34 as
of 7:36 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than twice as many shares
declining as advancing. The gauge, on course for its biggest
drop since Jan. 20, climbed 1.4 percent last week for the
sharpest weekly gain this year as improving earnings outweighed
concern over political instability in  Egypt .  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.2 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.3 percent.  South Korea ’s
Kospi Index and  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index fell 1.2 percent.  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.4 percent.  China Reopens  China’s Shanghai Composite index lost 0.9 percent as
exchanges reopened following a week-long holiday for the Lunar
New Year. Yesterday, the People’s Bank of China raised the one-
year lending rate by a quarter point to 6.06 percent and the
one-year deposit rate an equivalent amount to 3 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent
today. The index rose 0.4 percent yesterday in  New York  after
the  International Council of Shopping Centers  said weekly retail
sales increased 2.2 percent in the week ended Feb. 5 following
four straight declines, and as McDonald’s Corp. rallied after
reporting higher-than-estimated monthly results.  Cnooc dropped 2.8 percent to HK$16.42 in Hong Kong.
PetroChina Co., the nation’s biggest oil producer, dropped 3.8
percent to HK$10.54, the third-biggest drag on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. BHP Billiton Ltd., which is the world’s largest
mining company and counts China as its biggest market for sales,
slipped 0.5 percent to A$46.74 in Sydney.  China Resources Land fell 3.9 percent to HK$13.36.  Agile
Property Holdings Ltd ., which builds villas and apartments in
China’s southern Guangzhou province, lost 1.7 percent to
HK$11.68. CapitaLand Ltd., which receives 26 percent of its
sales from China, dropped 2.8 percent to S$3.48 in  Singapore .  ‘Negative for Equities’  “We will definitely see further interest rate hikes as
China seeks to stabilize commodity prices and prevent asset
bubbles,” said Danny Yan, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at
Haitong International Asset Management, which oversees $600
million. “That’s negative for equities but I don’t see too much
downside. I’m confident, China will be able to engineer a soft
landing for the economy.”  China is Taiwan’s biggest export destination, and Taiwanese
exporters also fell. Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world’s
largest contract electronics manufacturer, dropped 3.6 percent
to NT$120 in Taipei and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
the world’s biggest contract manufacturer of chips, slipped 2.3
percent to NT$73.8. They were the heaviest drags on the MSCI
index.  MediaTek Inc ., which receives 93 percent of its revenue
from outside Taiwan, dropped 6.2 percent to NT$345.5.  Valuations, Toyota  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.6 percent this year
to the last close, compared with gains of 5.3 percent by the S&P
500 and 4.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.8 times for the S&P 500 and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Toyota jumped 5.2 percent to 3,670 yen after saying net
income may more than double to 490 billion yen ($5.95 billion)
for the 12 months ending March 31, compared with a previous
forecast of 350 billion yen. Toyota had the third-biggest gain
among the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index, and was the biggest
single support to the measure.  Separately, a U.S. government report found no link between
electronics in Toyota’s vehicles and sudden acceleration
incidents. Toyota faced record recalls last year that depressed
sales and hurt its reputation for quality.  “We feel that  Toyota vehicles  are safe to drive,” U.S.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in  Washington  yesterday.
LaHood, who said in February 2010 that Toyota owners should stop
driving cars subject to recall, said he later advised his
daughter to buy a 2011 Toyota Sienna. She did.  In Sydney,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , increased 2.1
percent to A$55.07. The lender said July-December profit rose 5
percent as business and retail lending increased. The bank was
the second-biggest support on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Today, 32 of the companies in the MSCI index are scheduled
to release earnings statements. Of the 384 that have reported
results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 151 have exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 115 have missed them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
