U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said a spending measure needed to continue financing
government operations this fiscal year will also prohibit money
to implement the health-care law.  Cantor, a Virginia Republican, said yesterday the spending
measure will include a provision that would “preclude any funds
to be used for” the overhaul of the U.S. health-care system
that was enacted last year.  Congress must pass legislation to continue financing the
government by March 4, when a temporary funding measure expires,
or risk a shutdown of offices and services. The House will begin
debating the measure next week.  As part of the legislation, House Republicans also are
proposing $35 billion in spending cuts for the 2011 fiscal year,
which ends Sept. 30.  The House, in one of its first actions since Republicans
took control following November’s elections, voted last month to
repeal the health-care law. That measure is unlikely to pass the
Democratic-controlled Senate, so House Republicans are pursuing
other ways to stymie implementation of the law, which fully
takes effect in 2014.  Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Cantor, told reporters that
Representative Denny Rehberg, a Montana Republican, would offer
the amendment to barring funds for the health-care law. Rehberg
has announced plans to run against Senator Jon Tester, a Montana
Democrat, in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
