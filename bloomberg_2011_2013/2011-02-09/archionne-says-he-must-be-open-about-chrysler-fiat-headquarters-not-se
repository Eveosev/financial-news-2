  Sergio Marchionne , the chief
executive officer of Chrysler Group LLC and  Fiat SpA , said he
must be open about corporate governance matters between the two
companies.  Italians’ concerns that a combined Fiat-Chrysler may put
its headquarters in the U.S. are overblown, he said today.  No decision has been made on governance or a headquarters
location, he said, adding that the issue isn’t one to be dealt
with before 2014.  “It was a typical overreaction to an honest reflection of
the issues that must be dealt with,” Marchionne said in an
interview at the Chicago Auto Show.  Last week in  San Francisco , Marchionne told reporters that
two corporate structures for Fiat and Chrysler don’t make sense
after the U.S. automaker goes public. Chrysler has said it could
make as much as $500 million in net profit this year and is
aiming for a public offering in the second half.  “Hopefully in the next two or three years we’ll get the  corporate-governance  issue resolved and we’ll end up looking at
one entity,” Marchionne said last week in San Francisco,
according to a transcript. “And for all I know it could be
based here, which would not be a bad idea. But I don’t know. I
don’t want to start making prognostications.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
