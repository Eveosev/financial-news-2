Negotiators for the  National Football
League  and its players union are meeting in  Washington  today and
tomorrow to continue talks on a new labor agreement, ESPN
reported on its Web site.  NFL owners voted in 2008 to opt out of the labor deal after
this season, saying it didn’t account for costs such as those of
building stadiums. Talks have included topics such as what share
of revenue players should get, expanding the season to 18 games
from 16, a rookie salary cap and health care.  The  players  say that the NFL plans to lock them out if a
new agreement isn’t in place when the current deal expires
March 4. The league says it is focusing on reaching an
agreement.  NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  declined comment, saying in an e-
mail that the league isn’t “confirming or commenting on
meetings.” NFL Players Association spokesman George Atallah
didn’t immediately return an e-mail. ESPN said it based its
report on unidentified people close to the negotiations.  The league and union representatives met Saturday in  Dallas 
for what Commissioner Roger Goodell and decided to hold
additional sessions this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
