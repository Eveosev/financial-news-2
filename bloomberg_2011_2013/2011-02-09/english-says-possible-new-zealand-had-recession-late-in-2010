New Zealand’s economy is struggling
to accelerate because of consumers’ reluctance to spend and a
stronger currency that has curbed exports, Finance Minister Bill English said.  New Zealand is one of several nations that have experienced
“greater upward pressure on their currencies than usual,”
English said in the text of a speech in Auckland today. “While
this is unlikely to be sustained, it is not helpful to the
adjustment our economy needs to undertake.”  The nation’s currency has gained about 7 percent in the
past year against the  U.S. dollar , curbing exports which make up
30 percent of gross domestic product. English last week said it
was possible the economy fell back into a recession in the
second half of 2010 because consumers and farmers preferred to
reduce debt rather than spend or invest.  “In the short term, a higher savings rate limits
consumption and retail spending,” he said today. “This was
readily apparent through the second half of 2010.”  GDP contracted 0.2 percent in the third quarter, the first
drop since a recession ended in early 2009, and a government
report Feb. 14 showed retail sales fell 0.4 percent in the three
months ended Dec. 31.  Two straight quarters of shrinking GDP -- a standard
definition of a recession -- would make  New Zealand  the first
country with a Group of 10 currency to slide back into a
contraction since the end of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
