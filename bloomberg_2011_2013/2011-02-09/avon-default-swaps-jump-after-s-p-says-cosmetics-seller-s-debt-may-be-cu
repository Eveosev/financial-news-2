The price to protect debt issued by  Avon Products Inc . jumped after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may
cut its rating on the world’s largest door-to-door cosmetics
merchant.  Credit-default swaps on the company’s debt jumped 13.6
basis points to 88 at 2 p.m. in New York, according to data
provider CMA. S&P cited New York-based Avon’s weaker operating
performance in a report.  “Leverage was higher than our expectations, primarily due
to lower-than-expected operating performance and the additional
debt used to fund an acquisition during fiscal 2010,” analyst
Susan Ding wrote. “We are uncertain as to when the company will
be able to remedy the operational issues and improve credit
measures.”  Avon reported fourth-quarter sales and profit that missed
analysts’ forecasts yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
