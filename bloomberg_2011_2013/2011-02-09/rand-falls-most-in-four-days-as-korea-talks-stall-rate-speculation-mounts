The rand slumped the most in four
days as concern deepened central banks will take further steps
to curb inflation, leading investors to shun emerging-market
assets.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated as
much as 1 percent and weakened 0.5 percent at 7.2117 per dollar
by 4:05 p.m. from a close of 7.1738 yesterday, extending its
decline this year to 8.1 percent and making it the worst
performer versus the dollar among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  China raised lending and deposit rates yesterday for a
third time since mid-October, and Indonesia increased borrowing
costs for the first time in two years last week. Emerging
economies are weighing the need to curb inflation against the
risk of attracting speculative capital seeking better returns
than offered by near-zero  interest rates  in the U.S. and  Europe .  China ’s base rate is still below the nation’s inflation rate,
giving savers an incentive to spend rather than save.  “New fears over global rate hikes are rising,”  John
Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency analysts at Johannesburg-
based Rand Merchant Bank, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients
dated today. “This probably supports rand gains in the short
term but raises risks to our longer-term views.”  China lifted its one-year deposit rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 3 percent, effective today, increased the
one-year lending rate to 6.06 percent from 5.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
