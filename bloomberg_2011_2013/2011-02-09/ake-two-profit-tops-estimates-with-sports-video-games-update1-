  Take-Two Interactive Software Inc .,
the publisher of “Grand Theft Auto” video games, beat
analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit with sales of its
basketball game. The company raised its fourth-quarter forecast.  Profit excluding some costs rose to $49.5 million, or 52
cents a share, from $49.2 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier,
Take-Two said in a statement. That exceeded the 34-cent average
of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company had forecast
profit of 25 cents to 35 cents a share on that basis.  Sales fell 7.2 percent to $334.3 million, beating analysts’
estimates of $312.6 million.  “We will have a lot of work to do,” Take-Two Chief
Executive Officer Strauss Zelnick said in an interview. “That
said, I think the release schedule looks great.”  Take-Two jumped as much as 6.6 percent to $15.50 in late
trading after the results were announced. The shares advanced 19
cents to $14.54 at 4 p.m.  New York  time on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, their highest price since October 2008, and have gained
19 percent this year.  Take-Two, based in New York, may be reversing a history of
annual losses by building a strong portfolio of company-owned
games, Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne Agee in  Dallas ,
said in a Feb. 3 note to investors. He has a “buy” rating on
the shares.  “Our sum-of-the-parts valuation yields values in the $17-
plus range and is based on the company’s strong game
portfolio,” including “L.A. Noire” and “Agent,” Bhatia
wrote.  New Releases  “L.A. Noire” is slated for May 17 release. Take-Two
hasn’t said when it will release “Agent,” an espionage game
announced in June 2009.  Take-Two’s 2K Sports division shipped more than 4 million
units of its “NBA 2K11” game worldwide over the holiday
period, according to the statement. The company said it also
continues to benefit from add-on packs for its “Red Dead
Redemption” Western shooter, which shipped more than 8 million
copies since its May 2010 release.  For the current quarter, Take-Two forecast a loss of 40
cents to 45 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $130
million to $150 million. That compares to an estimated loss of
51 cents a share on revenue of $136.3 million, according to 12
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  In October, Take-Two announced a change to a fiscal year
ending on March 31 from Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
