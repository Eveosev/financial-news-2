  Allstate Corp ., the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, tumbled 5 percent in extended
trading after posting a 43 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit
tied to catastrophe losses.  Net income fell to $296 million, or 55 cents a diluted
share, from $518 million, or 96 cents, a year earlier, the
Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer said today in a statement.
Operating income, which excludes some investment results, was
50 cents a share, missing the 86-cent average estimate of
19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Allstate joins competitors Travelers Cos. and Chubb Corp.
in posting lower earnings because of claims triggered by
catastrophes. Industrywide, insurers’ losses from natural
disasters surged 90 percent in 2010 to $38 billion, according to
Chicago-based insurance broker Aon Corp.  A number of weather events “fell into the category of
above-average” during the quarter,  Mark Dwelle , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets , said before the announcement. “You had the
midwest snowstorms, there was a substantial hailstorm in
Arizona, you had all the rain and mudslides and so forth in  California .” He has an “outperform” rating on the stock.  Shares Decline  Allstate slipped 20 cents to $32.36 as of 4 p.m. today in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading before the
announcement, then dropped to $30.75 as of 4:31 p.m. in after-
hours transactions. The stock gained 13 percent in the past year
through the end of the official session, while the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 23 percent.  Catastrophe costs in the fourth quarter were $537 million,
compared with $328 million a year earlier. The results reflected
20 events including the  Arizona  hailstorm with estimated losses
of $355 million. Property and casualty claims costs climbed to
$4.84 billion from $4.45 billion.  Premium revenue in Allstate’s property and liability
business fell to $6.44 billion from $6.52 billion a year
earlier.  Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Wilson has reshaped the
investment portfolio since 2008, when writedowns helped lead to
annual loss of $1.68 billion. He cut back on stocks, municipal
debt and commercial mortgage-backed securities while acquiring
corporate bonds.  “We continued to stay long corporate credit while reducing
our municipal bond and real estate portfolios,” Wilson said in
the statement.  Allstate reduced its municipal debt holdings by
$165 million in the fourth quarter. The insurer also cut
commercial real estate holdings by $248 million after sales,
collections and purchases of new positions.  Unrealized investment gains narrowed to $1.4 billion pretax
from a $2.7 billion gain in the third quarter. Book value, a
measure of what’s left for shareholders after subtracting
liabilities from assets, slumped to $35.32 a share from
$35.48 as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
