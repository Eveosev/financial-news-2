European stocks dropped after the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed yesterday near its highest level
since 2008. Asian shares and U.S. stock-index futures also fell.  Syngenta AG gained after earnings beat analyst estimates.
PSA Peugeot Citroen fell.  London  Stock Exchange Group Plc rose
7.6 percent as the bourse operator said it agreed to buy Toronto
Stock Exchange owner TMX Group Inc.  The Stoxx 600 slipped 0.1 percent to 288.16 at 8:07 a.m. in
London. The measure had surged to near the highest level since
September 2008 amid optimism that the economic recovery is
accelerating and as European governments introduced policies to
support indebted countries using the single currency.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
