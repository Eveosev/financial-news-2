Wheat rose to the highest in more
than two years in Chicago as drought threatened crops in  China ,
the world’s biggest grower, and as governments increased
purchases to contain inflation and protests.  Wheat has surged 83 percent in Chicago and doubled in Paris
in the past year as drought in  Russia  and floods in  Canada  and  Australia  hurt crops. Countries in the Middle East and North
Africa are speeding up grain purchases after rising food prices
contributed to riots and protests. Now China is facing severe
drought in the main winter-wheat growing region.  “Wheat is at the center of issues for the market now,”
said Han Sung Min, a broker at  Korea Exchange Bank  Futures Co.
in  Seoul . “China’s poor crop weather has fueled concern over
tightening supplies after some countries in North Africa and the
Middle East rushed to secure food.”  Protests have spread across North Africa and the Middle
East in the last month, driving  Tunisia ’s President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali into exile after 23 years in power and Egyptian
President  Hosni Mubarak  to pledge an end to his three-decade-
long rule by September. Riots erupted in part because of food
prices the  United Nations  says reached a record last month.
China raised  interest rates  for the third time in four months
from today to contain inflation.  March-delivery wheat rose as much as 1.2 percent to $8.845
a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the highest since August
2008, and was at $8.8325 at 1:36 p.m. Paris time.  Wheat Growing  The drought in China’s wheat-growing regions may worsen
“rapidly” as the weather gets warmer, the Ministry of
Agriculture said Feb. 4. The drought affected 35 percent of
wheat crops in eight provinces as of that date, it said.  “On the weather front, the drought in China is at center-
stage right now, as wheat is starting to come out of dormancy,”
Paris-based farm adviser Agritel said in a commentary today.  Milling wheat for March delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 1 percent to 278.75 euros ($380.16) a metric ton,
while November-delivery wheat, the contract with the most volume
and greatest open interest, rose 1.4 percent to 245 euros.    France  will export 12.1 million tons of soft wheat outside
the European Union in the year through June, crops office
FranceAgriMer said today, raising last month’s estimate by
300,000 tons.  Chinese wheat output may have dropped to 114.5 million tons
at the last harvest, compared with 115.1 million tons a year
earlier, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.
Macquarie expects output to drop a further 4 million tons this
year. The USDA will update its outlook today.  Wheat Reserves  U.S. wheat reserves on May 31 probably will total 808.3
million bushels, compared with 818 million forecast in January
and 976 million a year earlier, a Bloomberg survey showed. World
wheat inventories may decline to 177.2 million tons, a survey
found, from 178 million estimated by the USDA in January and
197.4 million a year earlier.  The USDA may cut its forecast for world corn inventories
before the Northern Hemisphere harvests to 125.4 million tons,
from 127 million estimated in January and 147.1 million a year
earlier, the survey showed. That would be the lowest level of
reserves since 2007.  March-delivery corn rose as much as 1 percent to $6.8025 a
bushel and was last at $6.79. The price reached $6.825 on Feb.
7, the highest since July 15, 2008.  Soybeans for March delivery gained as much as 0.6 percent
to $14.4325 a bushel and last traded at $14.425. The price
touched $14.525 on Feb. 3, the highest since July 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
