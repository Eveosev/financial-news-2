U.S. stock-index futures declined,
signaling the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may retreat
for the first time in five days after climbing to the highest
level since June 2008.  Walt Disney Co. rose 3.6 percent in German trading after
reporting first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  Take-Two Interactive Software Inc . advanced 1.6 percent after
narrowing its loss forecast.  Futures on the S&P 500 expiring in March dropped 0.3
percent to 1,318.1 as of 10:28 a.m. in  London . Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures slid 0.2 percent to 12,177 after
yesterday completing the longest winning streak since July,
while Nasdaq-100 Index futures lost 0.2 percent to 2,357.75.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may say in a
speech today the central bank plans to push ahead with its plan
to buy $600 billion of Treasuries to boost the economy after
saying on Feb. 3 that the U.S. needs to see faster job growth
before policy makers can be assured the recovery has taken hold.  “When the Dow has rallied 5 percent in a month, it is not
unreasonable for investors to pause for reflection,”  David Buik , a market strategist at BGC Partners Inc., said in e-mailed
comments. There may also be “a bit of concern about what
Bernanke might say this afternoon about the economy.”  Economy, Earnings  The S&P 500 has advanced 5.3 percent this year as better-
than-forecast economic data and company earnings boosted
confidence in the strength of the recovery. The gauge needs to
rise 2.2 percent to 1,353.06 in order to complete a 100 percent
rally from its March 2009 low.  Northrop Grumman Corp., the largest maker of U.S. Navy

media company said first-quarter profit rose 54 percent, beating
estimates, after an increase in attendance at its theme parks
and advertising sales growth at the ESPN sports channel.  Take-Two Interactive climbed 1.6 percent to $14.77 in
German trading. The publisher of “Grand Theft Auto” video
games narrowed its fourth-quarter loss forecast to 40 to 45
cents a share, from 50 to 60 cents previously. The average
analyst estimate was for a loss of 51 cents a share.  Third-quarter profit excluding some costs rose to 52 cents
