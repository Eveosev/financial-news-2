  Indonesia ’s rupiah traded near the
strongest level in almost three months on speculation the
central bank will raise borrowing costs further to curb
inflation.    Bank Indonesia  lifted its  reference rate  for the first time
in almost two years last week. Policy makers will increase the
benchmark rate to 7.25 percent this year from 6.75 percent now,
according to Bambang Eko Joewono, head of the global-markets
division at PT Bank UOB Buana. The currency has gained 1.5
percent so far this month as exchange data show overseas funds
bought $46 million more shares than they sold during the period.  “People say Bank Indonesia is behind the curve as
inflation is still there,” Jakarta-based Joewono said. “Funds
are still coming in from offshore parties, which is
strengthening the rupiah.”  The rupiah traded at 8,918 per dollar as of 8:12 a.m. in
Jakarta, compared with 8,919 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 8,898, the strongest level
since Nov. 11.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy rose
7.02 percent in January from a year earlier, the most in 21
months, according to official data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
