Japanese stocks traded in the U.S.
and most Australian shares fell as commodity prices dropped and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined for the first time in
five days.  The Bank of  New York  Mellon Japan ADR Index slid 0.5
percent yesterday, retreating from its highest close since
September 2008. American depositary receipts of Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest bank by market value, fell
0.5 percent, and Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of
chip-testing equipment, lost 2.2 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s No. 1 mining company and  Australia ’s largest oil
producer, dropped 0.7 percent in Sydney today.  “We’ll likely see a sell-off in stocks for profit taking
as shares have remained high and it’s ahead of a three-day
weekend,” said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $450
million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Japan’s market will be closed tomorrow for a holiday.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,625 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
10,620 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,620 in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index was little changed today, with about five shares declining
for every four that advanced.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index fell
0.4 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The index dropped 0.3 percent yesterday in New York amid
growing investor concern that accelerating global inflation will
lead to higher borrowing costs.  U.S. Unemployment  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S.
unemployment rate is likely to remain high “for some time”
even after the biggest two-month drop in the jobless rate since
1958.  “A high jobless rate means that the Fed will continue its
quantitative-easing measures, so that should be positive for the
market,” Ichiyoshi Investment Management’s Akino said. “When
the Fed will exit the measures will be a significant concern in
the market from now on.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.5 percent through
yesterday in 2010, compared with gains of 5 percent by the S&P
500 and 4.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.8 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Oil, Metals Drop  Crude oil for March delivery slipped 0.3 percent to $86.71
a barrel in New York yesterday, capping a fifth consecutive
decline to the lowest settlement price since Jan. 27. The London
Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals
including copper and aluminum dropped 1.2 percent yesterday, the
sharpest retreat in two weeks.  Today, 38 of the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 385 that have
reported results for the latest quarter, 152 have exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 116 have missed them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Cabinet Office is scheduled to announce machinery
orders for December at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo. The median forecast
of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 5 percent
gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
