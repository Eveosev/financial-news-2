  De Beers , a unit of  Anglo American
Plc , is considering spending as much as 10 billion rand ($1.4
billion) to extend the life of  South Africa ’s  biggest diamond
mine  as demand for the gems climbs.  The company has approved a feasibility study into building
underground operations at Venetia, an open-cast mine in the
Limpopo province, and will decide in 2012 whether to invest,
said Barend Petersen, executive chairman of De Beers’ South
African unit. The project would extend the life of Venetia,
source of about 40 percent of the country’s annual diamond
output, until 2046, he said in a speech in Cape Town today.  Russia’s ZAO Alrosa and De Beers, the world’s largest
diamond miners, are boosting output on anticipation demand will
outstrip supply, extending price gains. The economic recovery
prompted the ramp-up after global output slid 8.5 percent
between 2005 and 2008, and slumped 30 percent in 2009,  RBC
Capital Markets  said Dec. 14.  Global production probably rose 9 percent last year to
136.5 million carats, according to New York-based Rapaport
Group, the world’s main provider of diamond prices.  Venetia, located about 25 kilometers (16 miles) south of
South Africa’s border with Botswana and  Zimbabwe , produced about
2.2 million carats in 2009.  “The fate of De Beers in South Africa largely depends on
the future of Venetia,” Petersen told reporters after his
speech. The company is also considering extending the life of
 Voorspoed , in the Free State, and  Kimberley , in the Northern
Cape, he said.  De Beers, which is scheduled to announce annual results on
Feb. 11, increased production 58 percent to 7.5 million carats
last year, Petersen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
