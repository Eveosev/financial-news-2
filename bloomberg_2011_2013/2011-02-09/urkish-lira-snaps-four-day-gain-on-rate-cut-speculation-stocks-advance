The Turkish lira weakened for the
first time in four days as some investors speculated the central
bank may cut  interest rates  to stem capital inflows.  The lira depreciated 0.8 percent to 1.5886 per dollar at
12:16 p.m. in Istanbul.  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee meets Feb. 15
after cutting rates by 75 basis points to a record low of 6.25
percent in the previous two months. The bank may keep rates low
“for a long period” should capital flows into Turkish stocks
and bonds, known as “hot money,” gather pace, Governor Durmus Yilmaz said, according to a text of his speech e-mailed by the
bank on Feb. 7.  “The lira is falling because it is expected that a
possible rate cut by the central bank next week may weaken the
lira,” Serhan Yenigun, a trader at Finansbank in Istanbul, said
by phone.  The current-account deficit, the widest measure of
the balance of trade and services, widened to $44.9 billion, or
about 6 percent of gross domestic product, in the 12 months
through November.  Turkey  increasingly depends on short-term
purchases of stocks and bonds to finance the gap and has adopted
a policy of keeping rates lower to damp the inflows.  Yields on benchmark two-year lira bonds rose for a fifth
day, adding 7 basis points to 8.62 percent, the highest since
July 2.  The main  ISE National 100 index  of shares rose 400.89, or
0.6 percent, to 65,655.02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
