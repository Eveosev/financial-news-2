The Democratic Republic of Congo said
it plans to split the nation’s state-owned gold mining company,
which has formed ventures with operators including Randgold
Resources Plc, into three regional units to ease administration.  Dividing up Societe Miniere de Kilo-Moto will make the
company easier to deal with, Congo Mines Minister  Martin Kabwelulu  said at the Mining Indaba conference in  Cape Town 
today, without giving further details of the proposal.  The government-run company, known as Sokimo, has formed
ventures with mine operators to try to kickstart production in
the northeast of the country. It’s about to sign an agreement
with Mwana Africa Plc to explore the Zani-Kodo deposit, Willy
Bafoa Lifeta, director general of Sokimo, told the conference.  Randgold is expected to begin production at its Doko
deposit in 2013, he said, while Sokimo has also signed gold
exploration agreements with Sivahera AG and Ferro AG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
