  Australia ’s dollar fell the most in
two weeks after a government report showed full-time employment
dropped in January, fueling concern the economy is growing too
slowly to prompt the central bank to raise  interest rates .  The currency, called the Aussie, weakened against 10 of its
16 most-traded counterparts as swaps traders reduced wagers for
how much borrowing costs will rise over the next year.  New
Zealand ’s dollar fell as stocks slipped and economists forecast
a report next week will show retail sales fell in December.  “A drop in full-time employment will probably temper the
markets in terms of the Aussie dollar rising higher,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in  Singapore  at Westpac
Banking Corp. The overall job data “suggest the labor market is
in a pretty good shape, at least on the surface.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.8 percent to $1.0045 at 1:32 p.m.
in  New York , from $1.0124 yesterday. The currency, which gained
10 percent versus the greenback over the past six months,
weakened as much as 1.1 percent to $1.0010, the biggest intraday
decline since Jan. 27. It fetched 83.54 yen, from 83.36 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar slid 0.8 percent to 76.60 U.S. cents,
from 77.23 cents, and traded at 63.70 yen, from 63.61 yen.  Australian full-time employment declined by 8,000 in
January, even as employers added 24,000 jobs, statistics bureau
data showed today in Sydney. Economists in a Bloomberg News
survey forecast overall employment would increase by 17,500.  The MSCI World Index of stocks was down 0.4 percent after
falling earlier as much as 1 percent.  Rate Outlook  Swaps traders bet  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens will increase the benchmark by 41 basis points, or 0.41
percentage point, over the next 12 months, down from a
prediction of 47 basis points yesterday, according to a Credit
Suisse AG index.  New Zealand’s currency dropped for a second day after
Finance Minister Bill English said yesterday the nation’s
recovery will face challenges. The economy may have contracted
in the fourth quarter of 2010, entering its second recession in
two years, he said.  Retail sales declined 0.4 percent from November, when they
rose 1.5 percent, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg
before  Statistics New Zealand  reports the data on Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
