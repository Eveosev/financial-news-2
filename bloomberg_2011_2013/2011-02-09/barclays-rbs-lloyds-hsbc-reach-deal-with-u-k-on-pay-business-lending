Chancellor of the Exchequer  George
Osborne  said banks agreed to lend more to businesses, pay more
tax and reduce bonuses. He was speaking to lawmakers in the
House of Commons in  London  today.  “Most of us of find the levels of pay in financial
services to be completely out of kilter with what the rest of
society would regard as fair or reasonable,” he said. “We are
determined to bring responsibility and constraint -- and make
sure that pay is properly taxed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
