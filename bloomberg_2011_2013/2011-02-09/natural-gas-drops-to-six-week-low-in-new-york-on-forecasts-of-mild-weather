Natural gas futures were little
changed near the lowest level in almost 12 weeks on forecasts of
milder weather, which may reduce demand for the heating fuel.  Meteorologists predicted widespread warmer-than-normal
weather in the eastern and central U.S. next week. Temperatures
may be as much as 14 degrees above normal in the Midwest,
according to MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in
Rockville,  Maryland .  “The market is ignoring the current cold because it
believes we will see warmer temperatures,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “There’s a
sense that the market is going to continue to be well-
supplied.”  Natural gas for March delivery rose 0.4 cent to settle at
$4.044 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures settled at $4.04 yesterday, the
lowest level since Nov. 18. Gas has declined 24 percent from a
year ago.  “Four dollars is a significant level that people are
watching and you are seeing some defense of that level,” said
Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke Associates Inc., an energy
trading firm in Louisville,  Kentucky . “Overall, anticipation of
weather moderating is what’s driven the market lower.”  Temperatures Up  The low temperature in Chicago on Feb. 16 may be 33 degrees
Fahrenheit (1 Celsius), 11 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Detroit  may be 32, 12 degrees above normal.  U.S. heating demand next week will be 18 percent below
normal levels, according to Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  The department may report a larger-than-normal withdrawal
from gas  inventories  for the week ended Feb. 4 after frigid
weather across the U.S. last week, analysts predicted.  The Energy Department’s weekly natural gas storage report,
due tomorrow, may show a reduction in stockpiles of 196 billion
cubic feet for the week ended Feb. 4, according to the median of
22 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The five-year average withdrawal is 159 billion, according
to the department. A decline of more than 164 billion cubic feet
would erase a 0.2 percent surplus to the five-year average.  Gas Inventories  Gas inventories totaled 2.353 trillion cubic feet for the
week ended Jan. 28, department data show.  Stockpiles may total 1.651 trillion cubic feet by the end
of March, down from 1.662 trillion a year earlier, the
department estimated yesterday in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook .  Marketed gas production will average 62.32 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, up from 61.38 billion estimated in January,
the department’s Energy Information Administration said.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
331,731 as of 2:42 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 297,000. Volume was 481,352 yesterday. Open interest was
898,069 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
797,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
