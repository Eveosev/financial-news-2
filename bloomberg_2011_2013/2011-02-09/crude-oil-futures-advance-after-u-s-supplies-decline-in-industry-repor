Oil declined in  New York  after an
Energy Department report showed that U.S. crude stockpiles rose
for a fourth week and fuel inventories climbed.  Oil slipped 0.3 percent after the department said
inventories of crude added 1.9 million barrels to 345.1 million
last week. Supplies were forecast to increase 2 million barrels,
according to the median of 15 analyst projections in a Bloomberg
News survey. Inventories of gasoline and distillate fuels,
including diesel and heating oil, also gained.  “The market is trying to digest the big builds in today’s
reports,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions
LLC in Houston.  Crude oil for March delivery slipped 23 cents to $86.71 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement price since Jan. 27. Futures are up 18 percent from a
year ago.  Stockpiles of crude oil at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate, the grade traded in New York,
fell 927,000 barrels to 37.4 million. Supplies in the week ended
Jan. 28 climbed to the highest level since the department
started keeping records at the storage hub in 2004. Cushing is
landlocked in the central U.S.  “The Cushing situation has to be turned around,” said
Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in  St. Louis . “There’s a bottleneck there which has
resulted in a bizarre crack spread and WTI trading at a discount
to other grades.”  Refinery Profit Margins  The crack spread, or profit for processing three barrels of
oil into two of gasoline and one of heating oil, surged to a 43-
month high today as fuel stockpiles climbed. The crack rose 8
percent to $22.83 a barrel at 3:27 p.m. based on New York
futures prices, the highest level since July 10, 2007.  Gasoline supplies advanced 4.66 million barrels to 240.9
million last week, the most since March 1990, the Energy
Department said. Stockpiles were forecast to climb 2.6 million
barrels, according to the Bloomberg News survey.  “The big increase in gasoline supplies has major
implications for prices in the months ahead,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics, an energy advisory
firm in Austin,  Texas . “Crude prices will come under pressure
when refiners have to cut back on gasoline output.”  Gasoline for March delivery climbed 3.18 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.526 a gallon in New York, the highest settlement
since Sept. 26, 2008.  North Sea Oil  Daily exports of the four North Sea crude grades that
determine the price of Dated Brent are scheduled to drop 7.4
percent in March from this month. Combined shipments of Brent,
Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk oil will total 1.13 million barrels
a day next month, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
loading programs. That compares with 1.22 million barrels a day
in February.  Brent crude oil for March settlement climbed $1.90, or 1.9
percent, to end the session at $101.82 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The premium of Brent to West Texas Intermediate, the grade
traded in New York, widened a record $15.11 a barrel today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. The gap averaged
76 cents last year.  “The Brent premium seems overdone,” O’Grady said. “If
not for the situation in Cushing, crude in New York would be
trading at $104 to $105 a barrel.”  Tanker Seized  Oil in New York rose earlier after a 1,100-foot supertanker
carrying Kuwaiti oil to the U.S. was seized by pirates off
eastern Oman today, the first hijacking of a vessel of that size
since April.  The Irene SL is carrying 270,266 metric tons of oil
destined for the  Gulf of Mexico , Enesel SA, its owner, said in
an e-mailed statement.  “The increase in piracy adds to the cost of shipping
oil,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “Insurance rates will increase and longer routes will
be taken by shippers. This raises concerns about how easy it
would be for terrorists to seize a ship.”  Pirates hijacked a record 53 ships and 1,181 crew members
in 2010, most of them off Somalia, according to the London-based
International Maritime Bureau. Average ransom payments rose to
$5.4 million last year, compared with $150,000 in 2005,
according to Louisville, Colorado-based One Earth Future
Foundation, a non-profit group.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 859,670
contracts as of 3:34 p.m. in electronic trading in New York.
Volume totaled 1.01 million contracts yesterday, 41 percent
above the average of the past three months. Open interest was
1.54 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
