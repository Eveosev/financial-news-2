Oil options volatility declined as
the underlying futures dropped for a fifth day after the Energy
Department reported that U.S. crude stockpiles rose and fuel
inventories climbed.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.2 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 29.4 percent yesterday.  Oil for March delivery slipped 23 cents to settle at $86.71
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest level
since Jan. 27. Futures are up 18 percent from a year ago. They
settled at a two-year high of $92.19 on Jan. 31.  March $78 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 2,372 lots changing hands. They fell 1 cent
to 1 cent a barrel. March $85 puts, the next-most active
contract, dropped 9 cents to 59 cents a barrel with 2,277
contracts trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  July $70 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 14,914 lots changing hands. They fell 6
cents to 54 cents a barrel. The next-most active option, March
$85 puts, rose 7 cents to 68 cents a barrel on 11,861 contracts.  Open interest was highest yesterday for December $100 calls
with 40,960 contracts. Next were March $100 calls with 39,597
and December $120 calls with 38,995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
