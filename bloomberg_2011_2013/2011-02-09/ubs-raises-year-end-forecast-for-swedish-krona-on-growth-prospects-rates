UBS AG raised its forecast for the
Swedish krona against the euro, saying the nation’s central bank
may allow some currency appreciation instead of raising  interest
rates  as growth exceeds estimates.  UBS economists predict the krona will trade at 8.60 per
euro at the end of the year, from a previous forecast for 8.75
per euro,  Gareth Berry , a currency strategist in Singapore,
wrote today in a research note. “We continue to favor being
short euro-krona but positioning gives cause for concern” as
foreign holdings of Swedish assets increase, he said.  The krona was little changed at 8.7740 per euro as of 7:26
a.m. in London, after appreciating to 8.7568 yesterday, the
strongest level in 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
