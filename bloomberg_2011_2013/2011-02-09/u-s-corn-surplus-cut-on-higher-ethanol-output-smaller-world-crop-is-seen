U.S. stockpiles of corn before
the next harvest will be 9.4 percent smaller than estimated
last month, a bigger drop than expected, because of
increased ethanol production, the government said.  The surplus on Aug. 31, the end of the marketing year,
will be 675 million bushels, down from 745 million forecast in
January and less than 1.708 billion on hand a year earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report .
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 729 million
bushels, on average. Corn prices have jumped 89 percent in the
past year.  “The function of the market could be to trade higher
to ration demand,”  Dan Cekander , the director of grain
research for Newedge USA LLC in Chicago, said before the
report. The rally also will help to “encourage a large
expansion in planted acreage,” he said.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 1 cent yesterday
to close at $6.7375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price has surged in the past year as adverse weather
reduced global production.  The ratio of U.S. corn inventories to usage will drop
to 5 percent, matching a low set in the 1995-1996 marketing
year, the USDA said.  Reduced corn supplies may increase expenses for meat
companies such as  Tyson Foods Inc . and  Smithfield Foods
Inc . Makers of corn-based ethanol such as Valero Energy
Corp., Poet LLC and Archer Daniels Midland Co. may see
margins squeezed.  Ethanol Production  A record 4.95 billion bushels will be used to make
ethanol, up from 4.568 billion last year, the department
said. In January, the USDA forecast ethanol production
would consume 4.9 billion bushels.  About 1.95 billion bushels will be exported in the
marketing year that ends Aug. 31, unchanged from January’s
estimate and less than the 1.987 billion in the previous
marketing year, the USDA said.  The amount of corn used in livestock feed will rise to
5.2 billion bushels from 5.14 billion estimated for the
2009-2010 year, the department said.  The USDA estimated world production in the 2010-2011
season, which began Oct. 1, at 814.26 million metric tons,
down from 816.01 million forecast in January because of dry
weather in  Argentina . That compares with a record 812.34
million tons harvested last season.    China  Production  China, the second-largest producer, will harvest 168
million tons, unchanged from last month, the USDA said. The
forecast for China’s imports was left unchanged at 1
million tons, compared with 1.3 million tons last year.  Global consumption will reach 836.9 million tons, up
from 836.12 million estimated last month and more than
815.01 million last year, the USDA said. It would be the
second straight year world consumption exceeds output.  World inventories before next year’s harvest will
total 122.51 million tons, down from 127 million estimated
in January and from 145.16 million last year. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News expected stockpiles of 125.4
million, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
