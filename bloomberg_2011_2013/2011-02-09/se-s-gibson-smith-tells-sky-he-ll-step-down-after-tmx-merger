  London Stock Exchange Group Plc 
Chairman Chris Gibson-Smith told Sky News in an interview he
plans to step down once the merger with  TMX Group Inc . is
concluded and he’s ensured “it’s really successful.”  The decision to merge with TMX was taken as part of the
LSE’s “drive to become globally competitive,” Gibson-Smith
said to Sky News.  “It’s the right deal for a whole number of complementary
reasons” and gives LSE “maximum synergy,” Gibson-Smith said.
The merger opens access for TMX to European markets and gives
LSE a “huge footprint in North American markets,” Gibson-Smith
said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
