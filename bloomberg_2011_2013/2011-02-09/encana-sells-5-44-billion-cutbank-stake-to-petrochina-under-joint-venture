  Encana Corp ., Canada’s biggest
natural gas producer, rose the most in 14 months after
PetroChina Co. agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in gas assets in
western Canada for C$5.44 billion ($5.46 billion).  Encana, based in Calgary, gained C$2, or 6.5 percent, to
C$32.83 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 1:34 p.m. Shares
earlier rose as much as 7.5 percent, the most since Dec. 14,
2009. The shares have risen 12 percent this year, compared with
a 2.8 percent rise for the Standard and Poor’s Toronto Stock
Exchange Index, and more than twice the 2.8 percent increase for
the Canadian energy index.  State-controlled PetroChina is paying about 20 percent more
than the U.S. benchmark gas price, said  Gordon Kwan , head of
regional energy research at Mirae Asset Securities Ltd. in  Hong
Kong . The acquisition value equates to a long-term price of
$4.80 per million cubic feet, compared with the $4 prevailing
contract price for delivery at  Henry Hub  in Louisiana, he said.  “While some might view this valuation as rich, we believe
the premium is justifiable given the asset quality,” said Kwan.  Before today, Encana’s stock gained 5.4 percent on
speculation of potential ventures with Chinese competitors that
could shelter the Canadian company from the slump in gas prices,
said Daniel Pratt, director of oil and gas equity research at
Ticonderoga Securities in  New York .  Encana today reported fourth-quarter operating profit of
$68 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with an average of 11
cents estimated by six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
