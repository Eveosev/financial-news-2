  China  and North Korea are expected to
sign a deal to jointly mine and process the North’s reserves of
metals including rare earths and gold, South Korea’s Yonhap News
Agency reported, citing a person with knowledge of the deal.  The agreement is likely to be signed between China’s
 Commerce Ministry  and North Korea’s Joint Venture Investment
Committee on Feb. 15, or one day before the birthday of the
North’s leader  Kim Jong Il , the Feb. 6 report said. The deal may
include setting up a joint venture company in Hong Kong, Yonhap
said.  Mineral resources including coal make up more than 30
percent of North Korea’s exports through China, according to the
report. Trade between  North Korea  and China reached $3.1 billion
in the first 11 months of last year, a 9.6 percent increase over
the 2008 total of $2.7 billion, Yonhap reported.  The deal may also include anthracite coal used in making
steel, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
