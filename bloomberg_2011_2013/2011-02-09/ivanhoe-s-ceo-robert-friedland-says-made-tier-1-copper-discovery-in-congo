Ivanhoe Nickel & Platinum Ltd., the
mining company known as Ivanplats, said it made the first so-
called tier 1 copper discovery in the Democratic Republic of
Congo in more than a century.  Ivanplats also made a tier 1 discovery in  South Africa ,
Chairman Robert Friedland said today in a speech in Cape Town,
without elaborating. “The details of those discoveries will be
opening soon,” said Friedland, who is also chairman of Ivanhoe
Mines Ltd.  Mining companies are seeking to add assets after commodity
prices rallied last year, sending the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index up 20 percent. Copper has gained more than a third in
the past six months, while platinum rose by a fifth in  London .  While Friedland didn’t give the location of the deposits,
he said Congo’s southern Katanga province and South Africa’s
Bushveld platinum district are “two of the richest places on
this planet.”  The company’s Congo find is unusual because it doesn’t
contain cobalt, he said. The Central African country holds a
third of the world’s cobalt reserves and 4 percent of its
copper. The Bushveld region has the world’s largest platinum
reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
