The number of U.S. homes worth less
than their outstanding mortgage jumped in the fourth quarter as
prices fell and lenders seized fewer properties from delinquent
borrowers, according to Zillow Inc.  About 15.7 million homeowners had negative equity, also
known as being underwater, at the end of the year, up from 13.9
million in the previous three months, the Seattle-based real
estate information company said in a report today. The total
represented 27 percent of mortgaged single-family homes, the
highest in Zillow data dating to the first quarter of 2009.    Home prices  are declining as foreclosed properties sell at
discounts and unemployment at 9 percent limits buyer demand.
Values will fall as much as 5 percent this year, putting more
homeowners underwater, before finding a floor as the economy
improves, said Stan Humphries, Zillow’s chief economist.  “These seem like fairly grim numbers,” Humphries said in
a telephone interview. “We’re still expecting a bottom in home
values later this year. And this, if anything, makes me a bit
more confident because I’m seeing very large corrections now,
which means the market can start to repair itself.”  The median value for a U.S. single-family home was $175,200
in the fourth quarter, down 2.6 percent from the end of
September and 5.9 percent from a year earlier, according to
Zillow. Values have fallen 27 percent from the June 2006 peak.  Foreclosure Moratorium  Foreclosures slowed in the fourth quarter as lenders
including  Bank of America Corp . and Ally Financial Inc. halted
some home seizures after accusations they used improper
documentation and processes.  Attorneys general  in all 50 states
are investigating the practices.  Lenders also are taking a longer amount of time to take
over properties as they are overwhelmed with record defaults.
Homes in the foreclosure process in December were an average 507
days delinquent on their payments, 25 percent longer than a year
earlier,  Lender Processing Services Inc . reported this week.  Las Vegas led the nation in homes with negative equity, at
about 81.5 percent of all properties with mortgages, Zillow
said. It was followed by 69.9 percent in Phoenix; 67.9 percent
in Reno,  Nevada ; 61.7 percent in  Orlando ,  Florida ; and 58.5
percent in Modesto,  California .  The median home value in  Las Vegas  was $125,156 in
December, the lowest since February 2000 and down 59 percent
from the 2006 peak, Zillow said.  Atlanta had the fastest increase in negative equity, with
the percentage of underwater homes rising to 54 percent from
37.6 percent the previous quarter. Atlanta’s median home value
was $128,064 in December, equivalent to November 1999 and 29
percent below the area’s 2006 peak, according to Zillow.  The total value of U.S. single-family homes tumbled about
$798 billion in the fourth quarter, according to Zillow. For the
year, values fell by more than $2 trillion to $22.3 trillion.  Zillow’s estimates are based on sales data and public
information about individual homes that aren’t on the market,
such as their size and amenities, Humphries said. They exclude
homes that are resold after foreclosure, when prices are usually
at least 20 percent less than similar properties, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  John Gittelsohn  in  New York  at
