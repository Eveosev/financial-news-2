The U.S. Defense Department will
request about $113 billion for weapons in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, $7 billion less than planned in its forecast
last year, according to government officials.  In the budget, due for release Feb. 14, will be 32  Lockheed
Martin Corp . F-35 jets for the Air Force and Navy, software
upgrades for its F-22 fighter and additional MC-130 transports
for special operations, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to
discuss budget figures before the request is published.  The budget also includes for two Virginia-class nuclear
submarines made jointly by  Northrop Grumman Corp . and  General
Dynamics Corp ., four Littoral Combat Ships made by Lockheed and
General Dynamics-led teams, and $1 billion in advance funding
for the Northrop-built CVN-78  aircraft carrier , the officials
said.  The budget adds about $1.4 billion to buy more  Boeing Co .
Army AH-64 Apache helicopters, drones from other companies and
more Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles made by  Oshkosh Corp .  Still, the weapons request is $7 billion less than the
$120.3 billion in base budget procurement the Pentagon had
forecast last year for fiscal 2012. The reductions were part of
an overall $13 billion in fiscal 2012 cuts the Office of
Management and Budget imposed on the Pentagon for deficit
reduction.  “What this says is that the increase in procurement
spending the Pentagon had projected will not materialize,” said  Todd Harrison , a  defense budget  analyst for the non-partisan
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.  “It’s a steep reduction -- about 8.5 percent in real terms
-- from what they were previously predicting,” Harrison said.  Taking ‘Toll’  Additional delays on the F-35 program “and pressure in
Congress to reduce  government spending  are all taking their toll
on procurement accounts,” Harrison said.  U.S. spending on weapons through 2016 was supposed to grow
faster than the overall defense budget, which will have annual
increases of only about 1 percent above inflation.  “Our goal would be to get forces and modernization to grow
by 2 or 3 percent,” said Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale in a
Bloomberg interview in July 2010, while saying that “it’s not a
given.”  Gates’s Cuts  Hale’s remarks were made months before Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  agreed to cut $78 billion through 2016 for deficit-
reduction purposes and reduced the planned fiscal 2012 F-35
purchase by 13 aircraft to 32 and shift $4.6 billion into
extended development.  The base procurement budget increased 7.7 percent to $112.9
billion this year from $104.8 billion approved in fiscal 2010,
according to the non-partisan  Congressional Research Service .  The Pentagon Feb. 14 will release a $553 billion base
budget plus a request for about $117 billion to cover the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The request also includes $15 billion in procurement
dollars contained in the war-spending request, bringing the
entire weapons-purchase request to $128 billion, down from a
combined $137.5 billion requested this fiscal year and $135.8
billion in fiscal 2010, according to Pentagon figures.  Separately, the Pentagon will request about $75.7 billion
for research and development, $4.7 billion below the $80.4
billion Congress is considering for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
