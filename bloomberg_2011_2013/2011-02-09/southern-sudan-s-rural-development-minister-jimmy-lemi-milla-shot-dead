Southern Sudan ’s Minister of
Cooperatives and  Rural Development , Jimmy Lemi Milla, was shot
dead today along with his bodyguard by a brother-in-law in Juba,
the government said.  “What happened had no political motivation at all,” Gier
Chuang, minister of internal affairs in the southern government,
told reporters today in Juba, the regional capital. Police
arrested Emmanuel David Luga on suspicion of committing the
murder, he said.  The shooting took place at about 10:30 a.m. while Milla was
at his desk in a government ministries building about 200 yards
from President Salva Kiir’s office.  Southern Sudan is scheduled to become independent in July
after almost 99 percent of its voters chose independence in a
referendum last month. The plebiscite was the centerpiece of a
2005 peace deal that ended decades of civil war between northern
and southern  Sudan .  At independence the south will assume control of almost
three quarters of Sudan’s current oil production of 490,000
barrels a day, pumped mainly by China National Petroleum Corp.,
Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas
Corp. Sudan’s output is the third-biggest in sub-Saharan  Africa .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
