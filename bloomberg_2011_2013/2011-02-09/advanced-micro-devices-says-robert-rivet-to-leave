  Advanced Micro Devices Inc ., the
second-largest maker of processors for personal computers, said
Chief Operating Officer Robert Rivet is leaving the company, the
second senior executive to depart in a month.  Rivet, 56, who joined AMD as chief financial officer in
2000, stepped down yesterday, the company said in a regulatory
filing.  Rivet’s exit follows the Jan. 10 resignation of Chief
Executive Officer Dirk Meyer, who was replaced on an interim
basis by finance chief Thomas Seifert. Meyer left after a
dispute with AMD directors over how to invigorate server sales
and gain ground in mobile computing. AMD also said today that
Marty Seyer, senior vice president for corporate strategy, will
leave the company.  The two may have decided to leave when AMD said it would
conduct an external search for a CEO candidate, creating the
impression that they were cut off from a possible promotion,
said Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP Securities in  San Francisco .  “This is another distraction, another uncertainty,” said
Gauna, who has a “market perform” rating on AMD shares and
doesn’t own any himself. “The company is perennially stumbling
when it should be moving forward.”  Rivet and Seyer are departing after long careers at the
company to pursue other opportunities, said  Mike Silverman , a
spokesman for Sunnyvale, California-based AMD. Both are expected
to remain during a transition period, he said.  AMD fell 6 cents to $8.18 at 1:56 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares dropped 15 percent last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
