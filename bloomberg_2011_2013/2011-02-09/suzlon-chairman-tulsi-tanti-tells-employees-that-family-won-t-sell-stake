Tulsi Tanti, chairman of  India ’s
largest wind turbine maker  Suzlon Energy Ltd ., told employees
that his family isn’t selling its stake in the company.  The shares fell as much as 12 percent and were down 9
percent to 44.4 rupees in Mumbai trading as of 3:14 p.m. local
time, the biggest intra-day drop since Aug. 16, after the
company said in an e-mailed response to questions that the Tanti
family is “wholly and absolutely committed to Suzlon and will
not exit.”  In a Feb. 4 statement sent to the Bombay Stock Exchange,
Suzlon denied a report by NDTV Profit television channel that
the Tanti family may sell its stake to  Spain ’s Gamesa
Corporacion Tecnologica SA, calling it “speculative in nature
and inaccurate.”  That statement is unchanged, the e-mail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
