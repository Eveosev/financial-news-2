New Hope Corp. (NHC)  further sweetened its
takeover offer for Australian coal explorer Northern Energy
Corp. by 6 percent to A$238 million ($241 million) in cash after
the company rejected a previous increase.  New Hope offered A$1.85 for every Northern Energy share,
Ipswich, Queensland state-based New Hope said today in a
statement. The offer, 4.8 percent higher than Northern Energy’s
closing price yesterday, was declared final and unconditional.
New Hope had lifted its offer by 17 percent on Jan. 31.  Merger and acquisition activity in Australia’s coal sector
rose last year as companies sought to benefit from surging
prices and sales to Asia. Coal prices have gained this year
after flooding in Queensland, the world’s largest source of
steelmaking coal, curbed supply.  “Northern Energy has publicly stated that it has tried to
solicit competing offers and proposals for a number of months
now by allowing parties access to the company’s data room and
management, however New Hope’s offer for Northern Energy remains
the only offer open for acceptance,” New Hope Chairman Robert
Millner said in the statement.  Northern Energy, exploring for coal in Australia and
targeting production in 2012, said it’s worth at least A$2.70 a
share, according to an independent expert’s report. The company
rejected New Hope’s Jan. 31 offer.  Northern Energy appointed Merrill Lynch, a unit of Bank of
America Corp., as corporate adviser. New Hope has appointed Pitt
Capital Partners Ltd. as its financial adviser and Blake Dawson
as its legal adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
