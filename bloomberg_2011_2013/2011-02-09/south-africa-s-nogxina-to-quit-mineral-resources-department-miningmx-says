South African Department of Mineral
Resources Director General Sandile Nogxina will quit after 13
years in the post, Miningmx said, citing people close to the
department it didnâ€™t identify.  Nogxina, 53, declined to comment when approached by the
Johannesburg-based Internet news service at the Mining Indaba
conference in  Cape Town  this week, it said. He has offered his
voluntary retirement and is in talks with the department,
Miningmx said, adding that the split was amicable.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
