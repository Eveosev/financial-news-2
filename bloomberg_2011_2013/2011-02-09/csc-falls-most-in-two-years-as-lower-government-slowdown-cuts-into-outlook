  Computer Sciences Corp ., the provider
of computer services to U.S. government agencies and companies,
fell the most in more than eight years after lowering its fiscal
2011 forecasts, citing a slowdown in government contracts.  Sales will be about $16.2 billion for the year ending in
March, the  Falls Church , Virginia-based company said in a
statement today. That compares with its earlier forecast of at
least $16.5 billion. Earnings will be about $5.20 per share,
compared with its earlier forecast of at least $5.35.  The U.S. federal government continues to delay contracts,
slowing sales in the company’s public sector unit, Chief
Executive Officer Mike Laphen said in the statement. Revenue
from the unit, which makes up more than 35 percent of sales,
grew less than a percent to $1.48 billion last quarter.  Computer Sciences, which manages networks for NASA and the
U.S. Navy, fell $8.11, or 14 percent, to $48.43 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading -- the steepest drop since
September 2002.  Analysts, on average, estimated per-share earnings of $5.38
for the year, with sales of $16.6 billion, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  Fiscal third-quarter net income climbed to $242 million, or
$1.54 a share, from $211 million, or $1.36, a year earlier, the
company said. That topped analysts’ average estimate of $1.48 a
share. Sales for the quarter climbed 1.4 percent to $4 billion,
missing estimates.  Computer Sciences’ competitors include  International
Business Machines Corp .,  Accenture Plc  and  Northrop Grumman
Corp .  To contact the reporter on this story:
