  Italtile Ltd ., a South African
ceramic-tile manufacturer, said it will soon announce the
successor to Chief Executive Officer Gianpaolo Ravazzotti, who
was killed in airplane crash along with eight other people.  The wreckage of the company aircraft Ravazzotti and his
colleagues were travelling in was found today in the Robberg
area of Plettenberg Bay on  South Africa ’s south coast, the
company said in a statement. The bodies of all the passengers
have been found. The aircraft was due to land in Plettenberg at
4:30 p.m. yesterday.  “A full investigation is underway to determine the cause
of the crash,” said Chief Financial Officer Peter Swatton said.
“The board will announce its succession plans in due course.”  Ravazzotti, son to chairman and founder Giovanni Ravazzotti, was appointed as CEO in 2006, having joined the
family-controlled business two years earlier. Italtile has
retail outlets in 10 southern and eastern African nations,
according to its  website .  The senior Ravazzotti controls Italtile through his 60
percent interest in Rallen (Pty) Ltd., a company which in turn
owns 53 percent of the tile retailer, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Italtile was founded in 1969.  Ravazzotti is survived by his wife Vanessa and children.  To contact the reporter on this story:
