Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell
for the first time in four days, as machine makers slid after  China ’s central bank increased  interest rates . Toyota Motor Corp.
advanced after raising its profit forecast.  Komatsu Ltd., an earthmover maker that gets about 22
percent of its sales from China, slid 1.7 percent. Mitsubishi
Estate Co., Japan’s No. 2 developer, slid 1.8 percent after an
office brokerage said Tokyo vacancy rates rose in January.
Yokogawa Electric Corp., a maker of electronic measuring tools,
tumbled 11 percent after saying it will not pay a dividend.
Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, jumped 5.2 percent,
leading carmakers higher.  “Concerns about China’s interest hike slows the momentum
of Japanese stocks,” said Naoki Fujiwara, who helps oversee $6
billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.2 percent to
10,617.83 at the close in Tokyo, after rising as much as 0.6
percent. The broader Topix was almost unchanged at 944.02
compared with yesterday’s close of 944.00. About the same number
of stocks rose as fell on the Topix.  Komatsu Ltd. slid 1.7 percent to 2,498 yen, and Kubota
Corp., Asia’s largest tractor maker, sank 1.8 percent to 882 yen.
Toshiba Machine Co., a machine-tool maker which gets about 35
percent of its revenue from  Asia , dropped 4.5 percent. TDK Corp.,
an electronics maker that counts China as its largest market,
fell 0.9 percent to 5,860 yen.  The People’s Bank of China yesterday raised the one-year
lending rate by a quarter point to 6.06 percent and the one-year
deposit rate an equivalent amount to 3 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index fell as much as 1.2 percent.  Real Estate  “China’s interest rate increase gave investors a rationale
to take profits,” said Koji Toda, Tokyo-based chief fund
manager at Resona Bank Ltd.  Real estate stocks had the biggest decline among the Topix
index’s 33 industry groups after Miki Shoji Co., a privately
held office brokerage company, said Tokyo’s office vacancy rate
rose to 9.04 percent in January from 8.91 percent a month
earlier.  Mitsubishi Estate lost 1.8 percent to 1,609 yen. Mitsui
Fudosan Co. declined 2.5 percent to 1,663 yen. Sumitomo Realty &
Development Co., Japan’s third-largest developer by market value,
sank 2.8 percent to 2,013 yen. The company yesterday said net
income fell 6 percent to 44.4 billion yen for the nine months
ended Dec. 31.  Yokogawa Electric tumbled 11 percent to 662 yen, the
steepest drop in the  Nikkei 225 , after saying it will not pay a
dividend for this fiscal year. The company paid a dividend of 2
yen per share a year earlier.  Rating Changes  Dowa Holdings Co., a metal-products smelter, declined 5.9
percent to 586 yen after UBS AG reduced the investment rating
for Dowa to “neutral” from “buy,” and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
cut the rating to “underweight” from “neutral.” Obayashi
Corp., a general contractor, retreated 3.1 percent to 377 yen
after UBS cut its rating to “neutral” from “buy.”  Daikin Industries Ltd., Japan’s largest air-conditioner
maker, fell 3.1 percent to 2,837 yen, after saying nine-month
net income fell 38 percent to 11.8 billion yen ($143 million).  Among stocks that rose, Toyota jumped 5.2 percent to 3,670
yen, the biggest gain in the Nikkei 225. The automaker raised
its full-year profit forecast as sales in emerging markets
exceeded the company’s estimates. Net income may total 490
billion yen for the 12 months ending March 31, compared with an
earlier estimate of 350 billion yen, the company said.  Toyota Recalls  Separately, a U.S. government report found no link between
electronics in Toyota’s vehicles and sudden acceleration
incidents. Toyota paid U.S. fines totaling $48.8 million over
the way it conducted some recalls, the largest such penalty for
an automaker. The company also faces about 400 lawsuits alleging
lost vehicle value, injury or death from sudden acceleration.  Nissan Motor Co., which receives more than 75 percent of
its revenue abroad, and produces Leaf electric cars, advanced
2.5 percent to 893 yen. A measure of automakers was the biggest
positive contributor to the Topix.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration will propose that
consumers receive a $7,500 tax credit for electric cars at the
dealership, reducing the sticker price, instead of receiving the
benefits when filing their tax returns, said Energy Department
spokesman David Sandalow. The administration will also propose
grants for as many as 30 communities to build infrastructure to
recharge electric vehicles, according to Sandalow.  U.S. Retail  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The index climbed 0.4 percent yesterday in  New York  after
the  International Council of Shopping Centers  said weekly retail
sales increased 2.2 percent in the week ended Feb. 5 following
four straight declines, and as McDonald’s Corp. rallied after
reporting higher-than-estimated monthly results.  “Although there are factors of uncertainty, the  U.S.
economy  is steadily improving and the environment is getting
supportive for stocks,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities
manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  The Topix rose 5 percent this year to yesterday, as
economic reports and improved corporate earnings boosted
confidence in the strength of global growth. Companies in the
Japanese benchmark traded at 16.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with about 39 times at the start of 2010.  Today, 91 of the 1,668 companies in the Topix index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 1,197 that have
reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 161 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 117 have missed them as of
3:32 p.m. in Tokyo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
