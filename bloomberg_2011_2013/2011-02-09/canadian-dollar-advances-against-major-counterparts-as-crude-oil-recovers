  Canada ’s dollar rose against most of
its major counterparts as futures on crude oil, the nation’s
biggest export, rose from a one-week low.  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is also known, was little
changed versus the greenback after touching a two-year high last
week on employment gains. The Canadian dollar advanced from
within a cent of a one-month low versus the Australian dollar.  “The Canadian dollar had benefited from a push up in  oil
prices ,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at
Interactive Brokers Group LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut . “You
had a very strong employment report from Canada last week, and
the market should almost demand a stronger Canadian dollar.”  Canada’s dollar advanced 0.5 percent against the Australian
dollar to C$1.0050 at 11:42 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0098
yesterday, when it touched C$1.0128, the weakest level since
Jan. 3. The loonie appreciated 0.3 percent to 83.02 yen.  Crude oil futures rose for the first time in five days,
gaining 0.3 percent to $87.18 a barrel in New York after falling
yesterday as China increased borrowing costs.  The Bank of Canada has left its benchmark interest rate
at 1 percent since boosting it for a third consecutive meeting
in September. The  Reserve Bank  of Australia’s target has stayed
at 4.75 percent for the past two meetings.  Australia ‘Limited’  “Canada just began its rate-tightening cycle in the
summer, while Australia is probably limited in how much farther
it can go in rates,” said Firas Askari, head currency trader at
Bank of Montreal in Toronto. “From a monetary policy view, I
like that trade, and you still have the commodity back up in
case the Aussie starts rallying again on increased growth.”    Goldman Sachs Group Inc . said it exited from a money-losing
wager yesterday that recommended betting that the Australian
dollar would weaken against its Canadian counterpart.  The bank said in a research note today that it had advised
investors put on the trade in January. The potential loss on the
trade, including cost of carry, is about 4 percent, the New
York-based bank said.  The loonie traded at 99.53 cents per  U.S. dollar , compared
with 99.52 yesterday. It touched 98.32 cents on Feb. 4, the
strongest since May 2008. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0078.  Credit market prices show investors may be anticipating
higher Canadian policy rates. The yield on the September 2011
bankers’ acceptances contract was 1.74 percent, compared with
1.59 percent Jan. 31.  Bets on Loonie  Bets the Canadian dollar will gain against the U.S.
currency have fallen from 47,757 on Jan. 11, the highest level
since May, according to figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a drop was 33,814 on Feb. 1, compared
with net longs of 31,719 a week earlier.  “A lot of people are long Canadian dollars, and when you
don’t see a continuation of that move you’re going to see some
people take that money off the table,” said Bank of Montreal’s
Askari.  Canadian  government bonds  were little changed, with the
yield on the 10-year note at 3.48 percent. The price of the 3.5
percent security maturing in June 2020 increased 3 cents to
C$100.13.  The nation’s employment rose by 69,200 and the  labor force 
advanced by 106,400,  Statistics Canada  said Feb. 4. The jobless
rate climbed to 7.8 percent from December’s 7.6 percent.
Economists forecast 7.6 percent unemployment and job growth of
15,000, according to the median estimates in Bloomberg surveys.  To contact the reporter for this story:
