  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated against the  U.S. dollar  for the first time in three days as traders waited
to see if the central bank would sell foreign currency for the
fourth time in a week.  The cedi weakened 0.3 percent to 1.5190 per dollar at 11:56
a.m. in Accra, after closing at 1.5150 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank sold dollars on Feb. 2, Feb. 4 and
yesterday, said Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at  Barclays
Bank  of Ghana Ltd., in a phone interview today.  Brobbey said he didn’t know whether the  Bank of Ghana ,
which usually offers dollars on Wednesdays, would sell currency
“today or tomorrow.” No one in the bank’s treasury department
was available to comment, said a woman who answered the phone at
the office today and did not identify herself.  Ghana’s cedi declined 5.5 percent against the dollar in
January, its biggest monthly drop since June 2008, as traders
waited for the government’s bond-auction plans.  The central bank said Feb. 4 it would auction as much as
400 million cedis ($263 million) of three-year bonds on Feb. 16
and would step up its dollar sales, spurring a three-day rally.  “From now on we will be on the market more often, once we
realize the need for liquidity support,” Francis Andoh, head of
treasury at the institution, said in a phone interview Feb. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
