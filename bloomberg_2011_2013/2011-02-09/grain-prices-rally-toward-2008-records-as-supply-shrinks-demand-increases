Corn, wheat and soybean futures
jumped to the highest since 2008 after a U.S. government report
showed smaller crops and rising demand are eroding global
inventories as food prices surge.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its forecasts for
inventories held before this year’s harvests and said world
supplies of the crops will slump 2.2 percent. Droughts in  Russia , Ukraine and other parts of  Europe  and adverse weather in
the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia  slashed output as the world
economy rebounded from the most-severe recession in 70 years.  “There is not one crop you can point to that is without
supply problems,” Steve Nicholson, a commodity procurement
specialist at International Food Products Corp. in  St. Louis ,
said before today’s USDA report. “Production is not keeping up
with demand, exacerbating the global food crisis.”  The price of corn, used to make livestock feed and ethanol,
has soared 95 percent in the past year, wheat has surged 84
percent and soybeans are up 57 percent. Today, rice futures
reached a 27-month high.  An index of global food rose to a record in January as
dairy, sugar and cereal costs increased, and high prices may
persist for the next several months, the  United Nations  said on
Feb. 2.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 24.25 cents, or 3.6
percent, to close at $6.98 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $7.0075, the highest
for a most-active contract since July 2008.  ‘Enough Corn’  “There is going to be enough corn for food, for feed, for
fuel and for export opportunities,”  Tom Vilsack , the
agriculture secretary, said today at a press conference in
Washington.  Wheat futures for March delivery advanced 11.75 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $8.86 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached
$8.9325, the highest since August 2008.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 16.75 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $14.51 a bushel. Earlier, the oilseed reached
$14.5575, the highest since July 2008.  Rice futures for March delivery gained 38 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $16.295 per 100 pounds. Earlier, the commodity
reached $16.335, the highest since Nov. 5, 2008. The price has
climbed 68 percent since the end of June.  Record agricultural exports have provided a boost for
President Barrack Obama. The U.S. is the world’s leading shipper
of corn, soybeans and wheat and the third-biggest for rice.  Record Prices  The record highs for the commodities were $7.9925 for corn
on June 27, 2008; $16.3675 for soybeans on July 3, 2008; $13.495
for wheat on Feb. 27, 2008; and $25.07 for rice on April 24,
2008.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Index, which tracks
eight commodities including grains, sugar, cotton, coffee and
cocoa, surged 72 percent in the past year, reaching record 567.7
today.  Reducing poverty and improving access to affordable food
can help ease civil unrest in the world, Catherine Bertini, the
former executive director of the UN World Food Programme, said
today in an interview on Bloomberg Television.  A U.S. government program is seeking to improve food
security in parts of  Africa , Latin America and  Asia , where
people live on less than $1.25 a day, Gregory Gottlieb, the
senior deputy assistant to the administrator for the Bureau of  Food Security  at the U.S. Agency for International Development,
said today on Bloomberg TV.  Tyson, Valero  Lower grain supplies may increase livestock-feed expenses
for meat companies such as  Tyson Foods Inc . and  Smithfield Foods
Inc . Makers of corn-based ethanol including Valero Energy Corp.
and Archer Daniels Midland Co. may face narrowing margins.  Fertilizer producers such as CF Industries Holdings Inc.,
Mosaic Co. and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc. may boost sales
of plant nutrients.  The agriculture rally has bolstered the financial health of
U.S. farmers, sending Midwest cropland to record values and
boosting profits for rural banks and equipment makers, according
to a report yesterday by the Federal Reserve Bank of  Kansas
City .  Higher incomes allowed farmers to repay debt in the fourth
quarter, reducing delinquencies and increasing profit for
agriculture lenders, the Fed said.  The USDA forecast global production of corn, soybeans and
wheat would total 1.716 billion metric tons, down from 1.755
billion last year.  The U.S. is the leading producer of corn and soybeans.  U.S. Corn Supplies  Stockpiles of corn on Aug. 31 in the U.S. will plunge 60
percent from a year earlier to 675 million bushels, down from a
January forecast of 745 million, the USDA said. That represents
5 percent of projected usage and on par with the record low in
1995.  World inventories are forecast to fall 16 percent to 122.51
million tons from a year earlier, the USDA said. Reserves as a
percentage of global use will fall to 14.6 percent, down from
15.2 percent forecast last month and the lowest since 1974.  U.S. ethanol production will consume an estimated 4.95
billion bushels of corn this year, up from 4.9 billion estimated
in January and up 8.4 percent from a record 4.568 billion last
year.  Reduced inventories means farmers would need to plant at
least 93 million acres of corn this year, up from 88.2 million
sown last year, to return domestic supply to more comfortable
levels, said  Jerry Gidel , a market analyst at North American
Risk Management Services Inc. in  Chicago .  ‘Incentives to Plant’  “We have to raise prices to slow down demand and provide
more incentives to plant corn this spring,” Gidel said. “All
the markets will be pushing prices higher to attract more
acres.”  World soybean inventories before the next Northern
Hemisphere harvest will be smaller than forecast in January
because of reduced production from  Argentina , the USDA said.  Stockpiles will total 58.21 million tons of Sept. 30,
compared with 58.28 million forecast a month ago, the USDA said.
Argentina will harvest 49.5 million tons, less than the 50.5
million projected in January.  U.S. wheat reserves on May 31 will drop to 818 million
bushels (22.26 million tons), unchanged from a forecast in
January and down from 976 million a year earlier, the government
said.  The USDA cut its estimate of global wheat inventories to
177.77 million tons as of May 31, down 0.1 percent the January
projection.  “Increased consumption around the world eroded
stockpiles,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president at the
Linn Group in Chicago, said before the report. “The current
supply-and-demand imbalance looks to last for multiple years and
has emboldened new investment money to flow into agricultural
futures.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
