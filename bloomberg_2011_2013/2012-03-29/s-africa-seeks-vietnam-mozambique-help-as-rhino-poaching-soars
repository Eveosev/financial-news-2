South Africa  said it’s seeking
cooperation from  Vietnam  and  Mozambique  after the number of
Rhinoceroses poached so far this year rose to 150.  More than half of the animals were killed in the  Kruger
National Park , the Department of Environmental Affairs said in
an e-mailed statement today. Ninety arrests related to poaching
have been made this year, it said.  South Africa, home to about 93 percent of the world’s rhino
population, has asked the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and
 Rural Development  if they can conduct inspections and verify
that the white rhino trophies exported from South Africa to
Vietnam are still in the possession of the hunters. This follows
an investigation by the National Wildlife Crime Reaction Unit,
the department said.  There has been growing demand for rhino horns in  Asia ,
where they are used for their supposed medicinal properties,
including as a purported cure for cancer.  Environment Minister Edna Molewa has also met with
Mozambique’s Minister of Tourism Fernando Sumbana to discuss
rhino poaching in the Kruger National Park, where the two
countries share a border. Mozambique is currently “pondering
legislation that will elevate the offense of wildlife poaching
to a criminal offense carrying heavier sentencing rather than
the current offense of damage to property,” according to the
department. Mozambique has also formed a national anti-poaching
unit.  Last year a record 448 rhinoceroses were poached in South
Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
