Millennial Media Inc. (MM)  almost
doubled in the mobile-ad company’s trading debut, signaling
growing investor appetite for companies focused on mobile,
social networking, payments and entertainment.  Millennial Media advanced 92 percent to $25 at the close in
 New York . The company sold 10.2 million shares at $13 apiece in
its initial public offering yesterday, after offering them at $9
to $11 each.  Millennial Media, the U.S.’s second-largest mobile-ad
company after  Google Inc. (GOOG) , lets advertisers target consumers
through applications on devices such as smartphones and tablets.
The Baltimore-based company is in a business that’s attracting
growing interest,  Eric Jackson , founder of Ironfire Capital LLC,
a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund.  “A lot of investors are hungry for returns,” Jackson said
in a telephone interview. “Everything that’s seen as a growth
company gets a lot of attention.” He doesn’t own any Millennial
shares.  Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs & Co. and Barclays Plc led
the deal, with assistance from Allen & Co. and Stifel Financial
Corp. The shares are trading on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol MM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
