The European Parliament  advocated 
moving the 2014 World Ice Hockey Championship from Belarus to
until all political prisoners are released.  “Parliament welcomes the tougher sanctions imposed by the
European Union on Belarus in February and calls for further
restrictive measures, including targeted economic sanctions,”
the European Parliament  said  in a statement on its website
today.  The EU legislature also condemned the execution of two men
accused of bombing the Minsk subway last year and called on the
Belarusian authorities to release both men’s bodies to their
families for burial.  Belarus won the right to host the World Ice Hockey
Championship in May 2009. Two years later, the former Soviet
republic was hit by a severe balance-of-payments crisis which
caused its national currency lose two-thirds of its value in
2011. Belarus, a country of 9.5 million, currently has 26 ice
hockey  arenas  across the country in various stages of
construction, according to information on the website of the
Belarusian Ice Hockey Federation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
