The European Union and  Singapore 
are in the “final stages” of negotiations on a free trade
agreement, said Marc Ungeheuer, ambassador and head of the
delegation of the EU to the city state.  Foreign direct investment by the EU into  Southeast Asia  was
192 billion euros ($255 billion) in 2011, the European Chamber
of Commerce said in a statement in Singapore today which
included Ungeheuer’s comments. Trade between the two regions has
increased 26.6 percent since 2006 to 161.6 billion euros,
according to the group.  “With stagnating growth in Europe, Southeast Asia
continues to offer strong potential for further economic growth
and many businesses from Europe are exploring the opportunities
offered by the region,” according to the statement. “Though
 Europe  is currently facing challenges, its importance as an
economic block and as a major source of technology and
innovation exported to Southeast Asia, is still undisputed.”  Trade in goods between the EU and Singapore was 56.9
billion euros in 2010, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
