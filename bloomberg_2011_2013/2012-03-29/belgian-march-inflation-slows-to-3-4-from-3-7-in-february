Belgium ’s inflation slowed in March
to 3.4 percent as a drop in the cost of cut flowers and vacation
parks helped offset increases in fuel and heating oil.  The inflation rate in Belgium, the sixth-largest economy in
the euro region, compared with 3.7 percent in February, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs in Brussels said today in an e-
mailed statement. On a monthly basis, prices in March rose 0.22
percent.  Excluding energy, inflation slowed to 2.32 percent from
2.38 percent in February, according to today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
