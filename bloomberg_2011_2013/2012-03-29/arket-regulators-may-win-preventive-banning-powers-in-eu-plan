European Union regulators may win
powers to ban new financial instruments before they are sold, as
part of an overhaul of the region’s market rules.  Such “precautionary” bans would be justified if a
security “gives rise to significant investor protection
concerns or poses a serious threat to the orderly functioning
and integrity of financial markets,” according to a report by
Markus Ferber, the lawmaker leading work on the measures in the
European Parliament.  Ferber is seeking to bolster last year’s EU plans to revamp
the region’s market legislation, known as Mifid. The rules were
proposed by  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services
commissioner, to plug regulatory gaps exposed by the financial
crisis that followed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008
collapse.  To contact the reporters on this story:
