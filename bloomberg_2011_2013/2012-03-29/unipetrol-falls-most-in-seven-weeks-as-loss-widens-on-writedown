Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  fell the most in seven
weeks after the biggest Czech oil refiner said its audited 2011
loss was more than double the figure reported earlier.  The stock slumped 3.1 percent to 168.1 koruna by 9:56 a.m.
in Prague, making it the worst performer today in the 14-member
 PX (PX)  equity index, which retreated 0.7 percent.  The consolidated audited net loss was 5.9 billion koruna
($319 million) last year after the company wrote down more than
4.5 billion koruna from the value of its assets in the fourth
quarter, Unipetrol said in a  statement  today. That compares with
an unaudited loss of 2.8 billion koruna reported on Feb. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
