Suspected Islamist militants in
 Nigeria  shot dead a police inspector at a market in the
northeastern state of Borno, a police official said.  Ali Adamu was killed while shopping in Maiduguri, the Borno
state capital, yesterday afternoon, police spokesman Samuel
Tizhe said in a phone interview.  Maiduguri has been the center of a violent campaign by the
Islamist Boko Haram sect to impose Shariah law in  Africa ’s top
oil producer. The government blames Boko Haram, which draws
inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for a surge of
violence in the mainly Muslim north and in Abuja, the capital,
since 2009.  Police in Borno offered a 1 million naira ($6,341) reward
for any information leading to the recovery of weapons and
ammunition and the subsequent arrest of any of the militants,
Bala Hassan, the state’s chief of police, said yesterday in a
phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
