Birchcliff Energy Ltd. (BIR)  sank the
most in more than three years after the Canadian oil and
natural-gas explorer said it rejected two bids and is no longer
seeking a buyer.  The shares  fell  21 percent to C$7.01 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest decline since November 2008. Before today,
the shares had dropped 13 percent since the company announced it
was for sale.  Birchcliff, the owner of more than half a million acres of
undeveloped oil and gas prospects in  Alberta , received a verbal
and a written offer in response to its Oct. 3 sale announcement,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement today. Neither
represented “significant value for shareholders,” it said.  The company’s largest shareholder, Seymour Schulich, agreed
to buy 5 million common shares for C$38.3 million. An investment
syndicate led by GMP Securities LP, Cormark Securities Inc. and
National Bank Financial Inc. will buy shares for C$71.9 million,
according to the statement.  “Sale of a corporation at the bottom of the commodity
cycle will not achieve appropriate value for Birchcliff’s
shareholders,” Schulich, who holds a 26 percent stake, said in
today’s statement. “I am pleased at this juncture to invest
further.”  Gas accounted for 78 percent of Birchcliff’s production in
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gas futures
declined the most in a month today in  New York , extending a 10-
year low to settle at $2.149 per million British thermal units.  To contact the reporters on this story:
