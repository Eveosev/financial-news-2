Leon Black , head of the New York
private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, and his wife,
Debra, are contributing $48 million to a new visual arts center
at  Dartmouth College  in Hanover,  New Hampshire .  The Black Family Visual Arts Center will expand resources
for the discipline’s students and faculty with a gallery,
screening room, 243-seat auditorium, classrooms and offices,
Dartmouth said today in a  statement  on its website.  More than one in four Dartmouth students annually enroll in
visual arts, film and digital studies, and studio classes,
according to the statement. The Black family has commissioned a
work by abstract artist  Ellsworth Kelly  that will be installed
before the building’s dedication in September.  “This visionary gift recognizes the centrality of the
visual arts in our lives and the value of visual literacy for
all,” Jim Yong Kim, Dartmouth’s president, said in the
statement.  Black, who is Apollo’s founder, chairman and chief
executive officer, graduated from Dartmouth in 1973 and was a
trustee of the school from 2002 to 2011, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
