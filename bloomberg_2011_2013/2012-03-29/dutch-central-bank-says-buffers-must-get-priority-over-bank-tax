Dutch lenders should be given time
to strengthen their capital buffers rather than pay a levy,
according to the country’s central bank.  “We prefer buffers at banks over topped-off buffers at
banks that are shifted to the government,” Klaas Knot, who
heads the Dutch central bank, said at a press conference in
Amsterdam today.  The Dutch government wants to introduce a bank tax as soon
as mid-2012 to make lenders contribute to financial stability
after institutions including  ING Groep NV (INGA)  and ABN Amro Group NV
needed taxpayer bailouts in the wake of the global financial
crisis. The tax, designed to raise 300 million euros ($398
million) annually, will apply to all lenders that are active and
licensed in the Netherlands.  “We strongly strive for banks to strengthen their
buffers,” Jan Sijbrand, central bank director responsible for
the supervision of lenders, said today. “The bank tax just goes
in the wrong direction, it limits the speed with which banks’
capital buffers are built up.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
