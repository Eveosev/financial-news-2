Mobile Telecommunications Co.,
Kuwait’s largest mobile phone operator known as  Zain (ZAIN) , expects to
post higher profit this year even as competition increases,
Chief Executive Officer Nabeel Bin Salamah said.  “We’re facing a lot of competition and it’s not an easy
year for us,” Bin Salamah said in an interview today at Zain’s
headquarters in Kuwait City. “The impact of the last three
years will be felt in 2012 but the company will perform better
than last year.”  Zain posted net  income  of 284.9 million dinars ($1 billion)
last year, down from 1.1 billion dinars in 2010, when it sold
most of its African operations to Indian billionaire Sunil Mittal’s  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  for $9 billion. Zain failed in
September to sell a 25 percent stake in Zain Saudi Arabia to
 Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  and Bahrain Telecommunications Co. In March
2011,  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT)  abandoned plans to buy a
majority stake in Zain.  “We have a very healthy and strong financial position,”
Bin Salamah said. “Zain’s debt-to-equity ratio is 25 percent,
which is considered low.”  Zain, the market leader, competes in Kuwait with National
Mobile Telecommunications Co., known as  Wataniya (NMTC) , and with
Kuwait Telecommunications Co., which operates under the Viva
brand.  Zain  shares  were unchanged at 870 fils in Kuwait City
trading today. The stock has declined 3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
