Allianz SE (ALV)  offered less than 200
million euros ($265.7 million) for  Groupama SA (GPAS) â€™s GAN
Eurocourtage unit, Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing
unidentified people close to the insurance industry.  Groupama had wanted to raise 700 million euros from the
sale, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified people as
having said at the beginning of the month.  Allianz may be able to bid less than 700 million euros
because of limited interest in the business from other suitors,
FT Deutschland said in an e-mailed summary of an article to be
published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
