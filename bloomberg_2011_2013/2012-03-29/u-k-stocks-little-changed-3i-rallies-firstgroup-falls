U.K. stocks  fell for a third day,
with the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index closing at its lowest since January,
after  Standard & Poor’s  said Greece may have to restructure its
debt again.  FirstGroup Plc slumped the most since January 2009 after
saying that it faced “challenging trading conditions” in its
bus business.  BP Plc (BP/)  fell 2 percent as crude retreated.  3i Group
Plc (III)  gained 2.8 percent as Chief Executive Officer Michael Queen
said he’ll step down after 25 years at the London-based private-
equity firm.  The FTSE 100 dropped 66.96, or 1.2 percent, to 5,742.03 at
the close in London, its lowest level since Jan. 31. The gauge
has still  rallied 3.1 percent this year , boosted by the European
Central Bank’s 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) in loans to the
region’s financial institutions. The FTSE All-Share Index fell
1.2 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index declined 1.6 percent.  “After such a strong quarter, this rally is ending with a
whimper rather than a bang, perhaps understandably given the run
up in global markets,” said Chris Beauchamp, a markets analyst
at IG Index in  London . “There is enough to keep investors on
edge in advance of the European meeting in Copenhagen
tomorrow,” he said referring to the meeting of euro-area
finance ministers.  Greece will probably have to restructure its debt again and
may have to involve bailout partners such as the  International
Monetary Fund , said  Moritz Kraemer , head of sovereign ratings at
S&P.  Greece’s Rescue  European governments are preparing for a one-year increase
in the ceiling on rescue aid to as much as 940 billion euros to
keep the debt crisis at bay, according to a draft statement
written for finance ministers before they meet in Copenhagen.
Germany’s Chancellor,  Angela Merkel , this week gave her first
indication that she is prepared to allow an increase in the
firewall.  Stocks fell as the number of  Americans seeking unemployment
benefits  last week topped economists’ estimates. Initial jobless
claims fell 5,000 in the week ended March 24 to 359,000, the
Labor Department reported today in Washington. The  median
forecast  of economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for
350,000 claims. With the report, the government data also
contained revisions dating back to 2007.  U.K. Bus Market  FirstGroup Plc (FGP)  slumped 14 percent to 247.4 pence after
predicting operating profit at its U.K. bus unit of about 8
percent of sales in the financial year ending in 2013. That
compared with analysts’ estimates of about 12 percent, Bank of
America Corp. said in a note today.  BP lost 2 percent to 458.9 pence.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
retreated 1.1 percent to 2,191 pence. Crude declined, trading
near its lowest close in almost a week in  New York , after
stockpiles surged in the U.S. and Western countries discussed
tapping emergency reserves.  3i climbed 2.8 percent to 209.7 pence. Queen, who took up
the job in January 2009, struggled to increase the pace of 3i’s
investments, being hampered by the financial crisis and he euro-
area debt crisis. One of the U.K.’s oldest private-equity
investors, 3i lost its place in the FTSE 100 in September.  International Power Plc (IPR)  surged 5.6 percent to 405 pence
after saying that it received an indicative proposal of 390
pence per share from GDF Suez SA for the 30 percent stake in the
company that  Paris-based GDF does not already own.  Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment Plc soared 7 percent to
156.4 pence, the most since December, as full-year earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization topped
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
