Augusta Energy SA, a Geneva-based
oil trader, has for the third time won a tender to supply
petroleum products to Tanzania, under the East African country’s
bulk-procurement system.  “The tender is estimated to be worth $750 million at
today’s price,” Shanif Mansoor, chairman of Tanzania’s
Petroleum Importation Coordinator Ltd., said today in a phone
interview from  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital. PIC, as
the company which groups oil-marketing companies in Tanzania is
known, issues a tender to import fuel every two months.  Augusta Energy will supply 640,000 metric-tons of oil
products for delivery in May and June, Mansoor said. The next
tender will be issued in two months for consumption in July and
August, he said.  Tanzania consumes 1.54 million cubic meters (407 million
gallons) of petroleum annually, according to information on the
website of the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority.
The country is also a transit hub for oil products that are
shipped to nations in the region including the  Democratic
Republic  of Congo,  Rwanda , Burundi and Zambia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
