Danieli SpA (DAN) , Italy’s biggest steel-
mill engineering company, signed an accord with Serbia to set up
a 500 million-euro ($664 million) steel plant that may produce
some 750,000 tons a year by 2015.  The investment will probably begin soon and “it could take
three years to reach the full output capacity,” said Bozidar
Laganin, head of  Serbia’s Investment and Export Promotion
Agency , after Danieli’s Executive Director Franco Alzetta signed
the agreement with Serbian officials in Belgrade today.  Clients of the future plant, near the western town of
Sabac, will include  Fiat SpA (F) ’s car factory in Serbia, said
President  Boris Tadic . The Danieli plant may become the steel-
sheets supplier of Fiat’s Serbian unit in three years, Antonio
Ferrara, the head of Fiat  Serbia , which will start making the
new 500L model next month, said in an interview yesterday.  Danieli signed the document with Serbia after more than
nine months of talks, Alzetta said. The Italian company sought
to ensure steady supplies of electricity and gas, Laganin said,
without disclosing the agreed terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
