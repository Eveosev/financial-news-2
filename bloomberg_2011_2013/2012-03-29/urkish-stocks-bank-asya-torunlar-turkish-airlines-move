Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  retreated 0.4 percent to 61,544.94 at the close in
Istanbul, falling for a third day and paring its gain this year
to 20 percent.  The following stocks were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB TI), an Islamic lender also
known as Bank Asya, fell 1 percent to 1.93 liras. Turkey’s
revenue-linked bonds were deemed to break Islamic law barring
earnings from interest by a leading professor who advises the
country’s Islamic banks, Vatan reported. The Treasury has sold
about 1 billion liras of such debt and Islamic lenders have
requested the Treasury swap the fixed income instrument for
other paper, Vatan said citing Osman Akyuz, head of a group
representing the banks.  Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK)  , another
Islamic bank, fell 1 percent to 2.01 liras.  Torunlar Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (TRGYO)  , a
real estate company, added 3 percent to 5.46 liras after winning
a government land sale auction. Torunlar submitted the highest
bid of 355 million liras ($199 million) to buy about 72,000
square meters and received 49-year rights to use 3,935 square
meters of docks along the Bosphorus in Istanbul’s Beykoz
district, Ibrahim Kirsan, deputy head of the state asset sales
agency, said today.  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, Turkey’s national airline,
declined 1.2 percent to 2.56 liras. The company will lose about
10 percent of its revenue from the Middle East, or 100 million
liras, as a result of its decision to halt flights to  Syria  from
April 1, according to Haberturk newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
