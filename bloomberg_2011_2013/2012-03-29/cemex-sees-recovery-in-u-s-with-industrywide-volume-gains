Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, said it is seeing signs of a recovery in the
industry in the U.S. after years of struggling during the
housing bust.  Industrywide, U.S. cement volume during the first two
months of the year rose more than 20 percent, said Maher Al- Haffar, Cemex’s vice president of corporate communications,
public affairs and  investor relations .  Although the increase is partly due to mild weather, Cemex
has been seeing signs of improvement since the second half of
last year, Al-Haffar said in a telephone interview from  New
York . Cemex, based in San Pedro Garza Garcia,  Mexico , is raising
prices in most of its U.S. markets by $5 to $6 per ton in April,
he added.  “We’re cautiously optimistic,” Al-Haffar said. “The U.S.
is going through a fragile recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
