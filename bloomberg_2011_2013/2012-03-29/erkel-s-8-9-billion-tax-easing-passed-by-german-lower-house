The German government will forgo
6.1 billion euros ($8.9 billion) in taxes per year in 2013 and
2014 under a measure passed by parliament to raise the standard
deduction on income tax to help offset wage inflation.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s ruling coalition passed the step
with a vote of 310 to 243 in the lower house, or Bundestag, in
Berlin today, according to the parliament’s website. The upper
house, where  Germany ’s 16 states are represented, may seek
changes in the bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
