Jes Staley, chief executive officer
of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s investment bank, told CNBC that
equities activity in the first quarter was “still lighter than
we’d like to see it.”  Asked about the trading environment in the quarter,
particularly in equities, Staley said it’s “down about 20
percent” from a year ago. “Fixed-income is a little bit
higher,” he said in the interview today.  Staley’s remarks referred to data provided by Dealogic on
“equity capital markets issuance, not trading volumes” for the
entire industry, Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New
York-based JPMorgan, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
