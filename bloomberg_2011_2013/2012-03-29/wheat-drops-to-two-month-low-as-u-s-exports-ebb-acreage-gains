Wheat futures fell to a two-month
low on speculation that supplies will be ample as exports ebb in
the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper, and farmers boost
planting.  U.S. exporters sold 403,124 metric tons in the week ended
March 22, 26 percent less than a week earlier, the Department of
Agriculture said today. Farmers may plant 57.551 million acres,
up from 54.409 million last year, when floods swamped fields in
the northern U.S., according to a Bloomberg News survey of 29
analysts. The USDA will release acreage and inventory estimates
tomorrow.  “We’ve been focused on stocks and acreage numbers and how
we’re going to plant this crop,” Darrell Holaday, the president
of Advanced Market Concepts in Wamego,  Kansas , said in a
telephone interview. “That’s brought wheat and corn down.”  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 1.1 percent to $6.24 a
bushel at 9:56 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the
price touched $6.2125, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Jan. 24. Before today, the commodity dropped 13 percent in
the past year.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
