Chinese stocks listed in the U.S.
slumped a third day, led by  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , on concern
profit growth is slowing as the global economy falters and the
cost of lending remains at the highest in more than two years.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. sank 1.4 percent to 101.86 yesterday
in New York, the lowest level in three weeks, eroding this
quarter’s advance to 13 percent. SouFun, owner of  China ’s
largest realty website, posted the largest loss in six weeks.
American depositary receipts of  PetroChina Co. (PTR)  traded at a
discount to  Hong Kong  shares for a third day after the  oil
company  reported 2011 earnings that missed estimates.  Forty-eight firms on the U.S.-traded Chinese companies
gauge have released annual earnings this year, posting an
 average loss  of 0.7 percent, trailing analysts’ estimates by 3.2
percent and down from average profit growth of 28 percent in the
same period of 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Policy
makers have kept China’s benchmark lending rate on hold since
July, while other emerging nations from  Brazil  to  Russia  reduce
borrowing costs to insulate against a global slowdown.  “The market is reacting to slower earnings growth or
declines at some companies, which was caused by the government’s
monetary tightening last year,” said Jeff Papp, a senior
analyst in Lisle,  Illinois  at Oberweis Asset Management Inc.,
which manages $700 million of assets including Chinese stocks.  Societe Generale SA analysts said in a March 27 report that
Chinese corporate profits won’t grow at all this year amid the
European debt crisis and sluggish U.S. recovery.  Government Measures  The  IShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., sank 1.1 percent in a third
day of losses to a two-month low of $36.30, cutting its gain
this quarter to 4.1 percent. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
retreated 0.2 percent to 1,403.24, extending a three-day slump.  “We may see company profits recover from the second half
of this year as the government is expected to roll out more
measures to stimulate growth,” Oberweis’ Papp said.  The benchmark  one-year lending rate  was raised to 6.56
percent in July, the highest level since 2008. The People’s Bank
of China cut the amount lenders must keep in reserve on Feb. 24
for the second time since December. Policy makers lowered the
nation’s 2012 economic growth goal to 7.5 percent on March 5,
from an 8 percent target over the previous seven years.  Beijing-based SouFun plunged 6.1 percent to $18.07 in  New
York , the biggest one-day drop since Feb. 15. The stock has
rebounded 24 percent this quarter after losing 18 percent in
2011.  ‘Tough’ Market  SouFun said in a Feb. 15 statement that fourth-quarter net
income declined 24 percent from a year ago to $30.1 million. The
company forecast sales for 2012 will grow between 10.5 percent
and 16.3 percent, after increasing 53 percent in 2011 to $343.8
million, according to the statement.  China’s real estate market will still be “tough” in the
first half, SouFun chief executive officer Vincent Mo said on a
conference call with analysts on Feb. 15. “For the second half
of the year, the market probably will turn better, depending on
the central government’s regulation policies,” Mo said.  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a Shanghai-based provider of
property agency services, fell 1.8 percent to $5.50, the lowest
level since Jan. 13. The stock has gained 15 percent this
quarter, following a 71 percent slump last year.  “China’s property market will remain weak this year and
real estate companies still face pressure,” Echo He, a senior
analyst covering U.S.-traded Chinese stocks at Maxim Group LLC
in New York, said yesterday by phone. He rates E-House sell,
with a 12-month price target of $5.  PetroChina Discount  ADRs of PetroChina declined for a third day, down 0.8
percent to $137.74, the weakest level since Jan. 6. Each ADR
represents 100 common shares in the company. The ADRs traded 0.4
percent lower than the company’s  Hong Kong stock , which sank 2
percent to HK$10.74, the equivalent of $1.38 per share. The
discount narrowed from 1.6 percent on March 28.  Net income for 2011 at the Beijing-based energy producer,
China’s second-largest refiner, missed analysts’ estimates as
losses from selling diesel and gasoline at state-controlled
prices outweighed gains in crude sales.  Profit dropped 5 percent to 133 billion yuan ($21 billion)
last year, PetroChina said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange yesterday. That compares with a mean estimate of 138
billion yuan in a survey of 20 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  NetEase Downgraded  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1.4 percent to a two-
month low of 2,252.16 yesterday. The decline brought losses over
the past three trading sessions to 4.2 percent, the biggest
three-day slide since Dec. 15. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong fell 1.6 percent
to 10,532.98. The gauge has declined every day since March 13,
except for March 27.  NetEase Inc. -- which said in a statement yesterday that it
received shareholder approval to change its name from
 NetEase.com (NTES)  Inc. -- fell the most in three weeks in the U.S. as
Deutsche Bank AG reduced its rating on the stock on prospects
the operator of China’s second-largest online games website will
lose market share to  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)   ADRs of NetEase fell for a third day, dropping 1.8 percent
to $58.34, the biggest decline since March 6. Tencent, China’s
biggest Internet company by sales, slipped 2.1 percent to HK$216
($27.82) yesterday in Hong Kong trading and is up 38 percent
this quarter.  Deutsche Bank downgraded NetEase to hold from buy in a
report dated yesterday, saying the stock was fairly valued.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , the world’s sixth-biggest
silicon-based solar module maker, fell 1.4 percent to $3.65 in
New York, boosting its loss in the quarter to 10 percent.  Nitin Kumar, an analyst at Nomura Singapore Ltd.,
downgraded the bank’s recommendation on the company to reduce
from neutral yesterday, meaning they expect its absolute return
to be down 5 percent or more. The price target was lowered to $3
from $3.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
