Brazil ’s central government surplus
before interest payments widened to a record for the month of
February on higher dividend payments by state companies.  The primary surplus grew to 5.4 billion reais ($2.95
billion) from 2.5 billion reais in the same period a year ago,
the Treasury said in a statement distributed in Brasilia today.
Dividends paid by state-controlled companies to the Treasury
surged to 4.9 billion reais from 1.5 billion reais.  President Dilma Rousseff’s administration slashed 55
billion reais off its 2012 budget on Feb. 15 to create room for
the central bank to further reduce  interest rates  and ensure the
country meets its 139.8 billion-real primary surplus target.  “We are meeting the primary surplus target by a margin,”
Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin told reporters today in
Brasilia. “This margin reassures us that we will fully meet the
target by year end.”  Augustin reiterated the Brazil may sell real bonds abroad
this year, without providing a timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
