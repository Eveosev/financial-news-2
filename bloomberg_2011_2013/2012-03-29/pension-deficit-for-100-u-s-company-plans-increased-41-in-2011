The pension-funding deficit for 100
of the largest defined-benefit pension plans at U.S. companies,
including  Boeing Co. (B)  and AT&T Inc., increased 41 percent last
year as low interest rates drove up liabilities.  The 100 largest plans posted a record shortfall of $326.8
billion for 2011, up from $232.1 billion a year earlier,
according to a report by  Milliman Inc. , a Seattle-based
actuarial and consulting company.  Pension-related charges to earnings rose to $38.3 billion,
also a record, from $30.5 billion in 2010, according to the
report, based on figures for the largest U.S. plans that
reported 2011 data in 10K filings to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission by March 5. Contributions to pensions were
$55.1 billion for the 100 companies tracked, according to the
report.  Costs related to pensions will continue to rise because of
low  interest rates , which cause estimated pension payouts to
increase  after they are calculated at net present value.
Companies use a discount rate based on a basket of corporate-
bonds yields, which have been dragged down by the  Federal
Reserve ’s pledge to hold rates at current levels until 2014.  “Given the record low discount rates, we estimate that
2012 pension expense will increase to $54 billion, resulting in
another record-high charge to corporate earnings,” Milliman
said in the report by John Ehrhardt, a consulting actuary, and
colleagues.  A 9.3 percent increase in pension liabilities outpaced a
5.9 percent weighted-average return on assets for the 100 plans,
Milliman said. Even with voluntary contributions, the funded
level of the 100 plans fell to 79 percent at the end of 2011,
from 84 percent a year earlier and 82 percent at the end of
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
