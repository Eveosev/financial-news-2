Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the pace of recovery from the recession has been
“extremely sluggish,” while action by the world’s central
banks helped prevent another Great Depression.  Bernanke made his comments in slides prepared for a lecture
today to students at George  Washington  University. In the
aftermath of the crisis, the U.S. has bolstered financial
oversight, and the banking system is now “significantly
stronger” he said in Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
