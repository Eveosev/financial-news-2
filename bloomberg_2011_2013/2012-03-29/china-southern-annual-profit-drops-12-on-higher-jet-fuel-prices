China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) ,  Asia ’s
biggest carrier by passenger number, said profit declined 12
percent last year because of higher fuel prices and slower
domestic travel growth.  Net income fell to 5.11 billion yuan ($810 million) in 2011
from 5.79 billion yuan a year earlier, the company said in a
 Hong Kong  stock exchange  filing  late yesterday. That compares
with the 5.8 billion yuan average of 11 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Total operating revenue rose 18 percent
to 90.4 billion yuan.  China  Southern, the nation’s biggest domestic carrier,  Air
China Ltd. (753)  and China Eastern Airlines Corp. all posted lower
profits last year as they contended with a 40 percent jump in
fuel prices. Guangzhou-based China Southern also filled a
smaller proportion of seats on international routes as it added
new services to pare its reliance on cooling domestic markets.  “The growth rate is expected to slow down,” the airline
said. Continued high  oil prices  will also “exert greater
pressure on the profits of the aviation industry in 2012.”  The airline’s domestic passenger numbers rose 4.6 percent
to 72.9 million last year, trailing the 14 percent growth rate a
year earlier.  China Southern’s spending on jet fuel jumped 39 percent to
32.7 billion yuan because of higher prices and increased
flights.  Jet Kerosene prices  averaged $125.67 a barrel in
Singapore trading in 2011, 40 percent higher than the year
before, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company proposed to pay a  final dividend  of 0.2 yuan
per share, compared with nothing a year earlier.  The airline, China’s only operator of Airbus SAS A380s,
flew a total of 80.7 million passengers in 2011, 5.5 percent
more than a year earlier. Yield, a measure of average fares,
increased 8.1 percent.  International Expansion  On international routes, the carrier filled 73.9 percent of
seat, a 0.9 percentage point decline. Yields fell 3.4 percent.
Passenger numbers jumped 16 percent to 6 million, helped by the
start of flights to Auckland, Perth and  Vancouver .  The carrier, which has three A380 superjumbos, has only
used the planes on flights within mainland China and Hong Kong
as it awaits permissions to begin international services.  The airline rose 1.7 percent to HK$3.59 in Hong Kong
yesterday, before the earnings release. It has dropped 8.7
percent this year, compared with a 12 percent increase in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Air China earlier this week reported a 41 percent decline
in net income for 2011. China Eastern’s profit last year fell
7.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
