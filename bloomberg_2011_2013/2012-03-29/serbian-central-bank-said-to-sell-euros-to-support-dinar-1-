Serbia ’s central bank sold euros
today to slow declines in the dinar, supporting the national
currency for the third consecutive day.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 20 million
euros ($26.52 million) to “enable the smooth functioning of the
foreign-exchange market,” it said in a statement posted on its
website. The bank has sold 435.5 million euros since the start
of 2012 to prop up the dinar.  The bank stepped in after the dinar dropped to as low as
111.7270 to the euro, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency closed the session in Belgrade at 111.3218 to the
euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
