Bundesbank Vice President Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the new Basel III banking rules are
unlikely to make it more difficult for  Germany ’s medium-sized
companies to obtain credit from lenders.  “There is a concern that the new Basel capital rules will
cause a credit crunch in some regions in  Europe ,”
Lautenschlaeger said at an event in Munich today. “For Germany
we have not seen any signs of less credit or even a credit
crunch.”  Capital and liquidity rules for banks, known as Basel III,
were enacted by international regulators in 2010 in a move to
help protect the world’s economy after the worst worldwide
financial crisis in decades. Basel III regulations, which need
to be implemented by 2019, require some banks to hold more
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
