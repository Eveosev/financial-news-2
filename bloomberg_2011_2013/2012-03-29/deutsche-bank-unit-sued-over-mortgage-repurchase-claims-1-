A  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  unit was sued
over the sale of mortgage bonds by investors who claim
$250 million in damages and are demanding that the bank
repurchase loans underlying their securities.  DB Structured Products Inc. breached representations made
to investors about the loans packaged and sold as securities,
according to a summons filed yesterday in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan.  The Deutsche Bank unit agreed to repurchase loans that
breached representations, plaintiffs RMBS Recovery Holdings 4
LLC and VP Structured Products LLC said. They sued on behalf of
all securities holders in a mortgage securitization trust.  “We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this
action and believe it is without merit,” Renee Calabro, a
spokeswoman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The case is RMBS Recovery Holdings 4 LLC v. DB Structured
Products Inc., 650980-2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
