Gasoline rose on concern that
refinery shutdowns in the U.S. East Coast will tighten supplies
as demand rises heading into the peak summer driving season.  The motor fuel reached an 11-month high before paring gains
as oil dropped to a six-week low on speculation that U.S. and
European nations are nearing an agreement to release emergency
crude oil supplies.  “Concern in the gas market is that as we get closer to the
driving season the refinery closures makes the market jittery,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for April delivery rose 0.51 cent to settle at
$3.4006 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 27 percent this year, making the fuel the best performer in
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI commodity index.  April futures touched $3.4455, the highest intraday level
since April 29, after an Energy Department report yesterday
showed demand for the motor fuel increased last week.  Sunoco
Inc. (SUN)  and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  have shut two plants in Pennsylvania and
Sunoco may to idle a third by July that together could process
more than 700,000 barrels a day of oil. Supplies of the motor
fuel along the East Coast were at an 11-week low as of March 23.  Strategic Reserves  Prices retreated as crude dropped the most since Dec. 14
after French Prime MinisterFrancois Fillon said the prospects
of an accord to release strategic oil reserves are good. Oil for
May delivery on the exchange sank $2.63, or 2.5 percent, to
$102.78 a barrel.  The potential release of crude reserves “represents a
bearish impact on the physical market,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  Gasoline contracts for May delivery fell 2.24 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.3397. April gasoline and heating oil contracts
will expire at the close of floor trading tomorrow. April’s
premium over May increased to 6.09 cents, the largest gap
between the contracts nearest to expiration since October.  Deliveries (DOEDMGAS)  to wholesalers increased 4 percent from the
prior week to 8.71 million barrels a day, the highest level
since December, according to department data. Demand over the
past four weeks was 6.1 percent below a year earlier.  Gasoline supply in the East Coast, or Padd 1, fell 1.81
million barrels to 58.7 million, the lowest level since Jan. 6.
Padd 1 includes  New York  Harbor, the delivery point for Nymex
contract for reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB.  Lower Imports  Supplies may shrink further as imports fail to make up for
production from the shuttered refineries.  Shipments (DOEIGAS1)  to the East
Coast from abroad dropped to 496,000 barrels a day last week,
the lowest level for this time of year since at least 2004,
department data show. Cargoes of the fuel from Europe to the
U.S. may slip to a seven-month low, Bloomberg News surveys show.  Traders and oil companies booked or probably will hire 17
tankers on average during a 14-day forward period for each week
this month, according to median estimates in surveys of
shipbrokers, traders and owners.  The shipments are set to fall as inventories of gasoline in
northwest  Europe  rose to the highest level since 2008. The crack
spread, or premium to  Brent crude , for Eurobob rose to $16.93 a
barrel as of 5:21 p.m. London time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the highest level since
Sept. 12, 2008.  April-delivery heating oil fell 4.9 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $3.1589 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices have gained 7.6 percent
this year. The May contract slipped 5.24 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $3.1698.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1
cent yesterday to $3.921, according to AAA, the nation’s biggest
motoring club. Prices are 9.3 percent above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
