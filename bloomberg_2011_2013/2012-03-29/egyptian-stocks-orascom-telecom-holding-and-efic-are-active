Egypt ’s benchmark  EGX30 Index (EGX30)  fell
for the first time in three days, retreating 0.4 percent to
5,018.55 at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. That pared the
measure’s gain to 39 percent this quarter, making it the world’s
best performer.  The following shares were active on the Egyptian Exchange.
Stock symbols follow company names  El Ezz Aldekhela Steel (IRAX)   advanced 1.2 percent, the
most since March 20, to 510.07 pounds. The metal manufacturer
majority-owned by  Ezz Steel (ESRS)   said 2011 profit rose 4.2
percent to 696.9 million pounds ($115 million) compared with a
year earlier. Ezz Steel declined 0.9 percent.  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)   decreased 1.2 percent
to 4.09 pounds, the lowest close in more than a week.  Algeria ’s
government has yet to decide on the purchase price for a
majority stake in Djezzy, a unit of Orascom, the Finance
Minister said. An Algerian court fined Djezzy about $1.3 billion
for foreign exchange violations, a ruling the company is
appealing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
