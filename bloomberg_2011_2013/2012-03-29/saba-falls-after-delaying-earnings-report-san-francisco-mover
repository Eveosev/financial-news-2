Saba Software Inc. (SABA) , a maker of
Internet-based software for training and Web conferencing,
tumbled the most since 2006 after an internal accounting review
delayed the release of its third-quarter earnings.  Saba needs more time to check the accounting of its
internal transactions, the  Redwood City , California-based
company said today in a statement. The company had previously
planned to release earnings today after the close of trading.
Saba didn’t give a date it expects the review to be completed.  While it’s hard to tell how serious the matter is,
investors may be concerned that the review could escalate into a
Securities and Exchange Commission probe, said Mark Schappel, an
analyst at Benchmark Co. in  New York . The shares have climbed 26
percent this year as Saba benefited from a shift to cloud
computing, which delivers software over the Internet.  “Sometimes these things turn into not a big deal, and
sometimes they can drag out to a full-blown SEC investigation,”
said Schappel, who has a buy recommendation on the stock.
“That’s the issue here and that’s why the stock is selling off
on so little news.”  The shares dropped 18 percent to $9.94 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since June 2006.  Roy Lobo, Saba’s vice president of  investor relations ,
didn’t return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
