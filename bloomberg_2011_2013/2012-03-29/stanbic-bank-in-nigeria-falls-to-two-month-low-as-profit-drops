Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , a unit of
 Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , fell to the lowest level in more than
two months, after net income plunged and the company declared a
“disappointing” dividend, according to Lambeth Trust &
Investment Co.  The stock fell 4.9 percent to 6.80 naira by the close in
Lagos, the lowest since Jan. 26, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Net income for the 12 months through December dropped 21
percent to 7.44 billion naira ($47 million) from 9.45 billion
naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based lender said. Revenue rose
19 percent to 67.4 billion naira. Stanbic will pay a 10 kobo per
share dividend for the year, it said.  The dividend, which translates into a yield of 1.5 percent,
“is too disappointing,” David Adonri, chief executive officer
of Lambeth, said by phone from Lagos today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
