PICC Property & Casualty Co. (2328) ,
 China ’s biggest non-life insurer, fell by the most in three
weeks in Hong Kong trading after profit for last year missed
analyst estimates because of stock-market losses.  The  stock  dropped as much as 4.2 percent to $HK9.45, the
most since March 6. The stock traded at HK$9.46 as of 10:27 a.m.
local time.  Net income  rose 52 percent to 8.03 billion yuan
($1.27 billion), the company said yesterday, which compares with
the 8.8 billion yuan median estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  “The main driver of the miss was a 2 billion yuan
impairment loss on its equity investment,” Barclays Plc
analysts led by Mark Kellock wrote in a report today. “More
importantly though, underwriting income was better than
expected.”  PICC suffered 2.6 billion yuan in net realized and
unrealized losses on investments amid a 22 percent rout in the
benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , reversing from a 1.1 billion
yuan gain in 2010, the company said in a statement to the Hong
Kong stock exchange yesterday. Underwriting profit almost
tripled to 8.02 billion yuan, as Chairman Wu Yan maintained
controls on claims and expenses.  New China Life Insurance Co. (1336) , the nation’s third-biggest
life insurer, dropped 6.5 percent to HK$30.00. New business
value for last year, which measures the profitability of new
policies sold, fell 8 percent, the weakest in the sector, the
company said yesterday.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editor: Malcolm Scott, Tomoko Yamazaki  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
