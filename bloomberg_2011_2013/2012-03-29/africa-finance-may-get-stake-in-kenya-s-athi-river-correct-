(Corrects  Kenya  tonnage in fourth paragraph.)  Africa Finance Corp.,  a Nigeria-
based development-finance institution that’s providing a $50
million convertible loan to  Athi River Mining Ltd. (ARML) , may get a
13.62 percent stake in the Kenyan cement maker if the loan is
converted into equity, Athi River said.  Africa  Finance is providing the loan to help fund an
expansion by Kenya’s second-biggest cement company in eastern
and southern Africa, including adding 1 million metric tons of
production capacity, Athi River said in a statement on March 27.  “If AFC wants to convert the loan into shares then they
will at $3.3 per share,” Julius Nyabicha, a company spokesman,
said in a phone interview from Nairobi, Kenya’s capital,
yesterday. The conversion amount is higher than Athi River’s
share price “because we want to avoid dilution,” he said.  ARM, as the Nairobi-based cement company is known, said it
plans to increase annual production capacity to 2.6 million tons
in  East Africa  by next year. Output in Kenya will be 1 million
tons, Tanzania 1.5 million tons and Rwanda 100,000 tons, it
said.  “The loan has already been approved by AFC so we are now
waiting for approval from  Capital Markets Authority ,” Nyabicha
said. “CMA comes in because the loan is convertible into
equity” within six years.  Cement Production  ARM currently produces 40,000 bags of cement at its plant
in Athi River, 25 kilometers (16 miles) southeast of Nairobi,
and 30,000 bags at another plant at Kaloleni in the port city of
Mombasa, Nyabicha said on March 9. Each bag of cement weights 50
kilograms (110 pounds).  A 750,000-ton per annum grinding plant in  Dar es Salaam ,
Tanzania’s commercial capital, is currently being commissioned
and will be operational by June, the company said. A 1.2
million-ton clinker plant in the town of Tanga, with a second
grinding plant of 750,000 tons that is also under construction,
will be operational early next year, it said.  Shares in Athi River gained 0.6 percent to 162 shillings at
12 p.m. in Nairobi today. The stock has advanced 8 percent so
far this year, in line with a 7.8 percent gain in the benchmark
 NSE-20 Index (KNSMIDX)  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
