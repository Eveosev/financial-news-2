Telefonica SA (TEF)  filed a lawsuit
against  America Movil  SAB seeking almost 800 million pesos ($63
million) in payments it said it’s owed from agreements on
interconnection fees, Reforma newspaper  said .  The lawsuit was accepted today in the First District Court
for Civil Matters, which had originally rejected the claim, the
newspaper said on its website, without saying where it got the
information.  An America Movil official who asked not to be identified
because of the Mexico City-based company’s policy declined to
comment to Bloomberg News. An official for Madrid-based
Telefonica had no immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
