BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s largest
chemical company, will change the way it organizes research and
development as it increases the budget to bring new products to
market to 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) this year.  BASF, which spent 1.6 billion euros last year on R&D, more
than any other chemical company, said today that it will stop
bundling such efforts in so-called growth clusters. Instead it
will back research and development in 13 growth fields,
including plant biotechnology, water filtration techniques and
systems for medical use, to supply seven key industries.  The effort is part of a plan to reach sales of 115 billion
euros by 2020, with 30 billion euros of revenue generated by
innovations, defined as products and offerings less than 10
years old, BASF said at a press conference at its headquarters
in Ludwigshafen,  Germany .  BASF’s targets by 2020 include 1.9 billion euros in gross
trait sales from genetically improved crops, more than 800
million euros in sales of water technology, and more than 500
million euros in sales to the medical industry with products
such as anti-infective coatings for devices, the company today
said.  The company plans to double its research activities in  Asia 
and North and South America by 2020 and conduct 50 percent of
its research and development outside  Europe  by that year, it
said in an e-mailed statement today.  BASF increased the number of research and development
personnel by 500 last year to 10,100, working on a total of
2,800 projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
