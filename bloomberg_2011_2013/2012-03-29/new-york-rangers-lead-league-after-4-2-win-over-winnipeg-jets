The  New York  Rangers have the best
record in the  National Hockey League  after a 4-2 comeback win
over the Winnipeg Jets.  The Rangers (49-21-7) and Western Conference-leading St.
Louis Blues each have 105 points, although New York has one more
non-shootout win. New York is 12 points ahead of the Boston
Bruins of the Northwest Division in the Eastern Conference and
five points ahead of the  Pittsburgh Penguins  in the Atlantic
Division.  Winnipeg took a 2-0 lead through goals by Spencer Machacek
and Bryan Little in the first five minutes of the second period
last night at MTS Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Rangers
answered with Michael Del Zotto’s shorthanded goal and  Ryan Callahan ’s power-play score to end the period tied 2-2.  Brian Boyle scored the go-ahead goal for the Rangers at the
start of the third period and Derek Stepan sealed the win with a
power-play goal midway through the final period.  The Jets are 10th in the Eastern Conference with 78 points,
and in third place in the Southeast Division, 11 points behind
Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
