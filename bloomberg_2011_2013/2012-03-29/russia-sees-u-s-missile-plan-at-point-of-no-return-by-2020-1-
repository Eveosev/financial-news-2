Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Sergei Ryabkov said a U.S. plan to build a missile shield in
 Europe  will be past the point of no return by 2020, when it
reaches the fourth phase of its development.  “There’s no chance now of us reaching an agreement” with
the current administration of U.S. President  Barack Obama , whose
position didn’t change during talks with Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in Seoul this week,
Ryabkov said in an interview in New Delhi today.  “We already tried to come to an agreement on missile
issues with the Republicans and we will continue to try” if
they return to the White House,” Ryabkov said. Whoever wins
this year’s presidential elections, Russia is ready to discuss
the matter further, he added.  The U.S. isn’t sharing any secret data on missile defense
with  Russia , Ryabkov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
