FMC Technologies Inc. (FTI) , the third-
largest U.S. oilfield-equipment maker, rose the most in almost
two months after signing an agreement with  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4)  worth as much as $1.5 billion in revenue.  FMC climbed 2.7 percent to $49.77 at the close in New York,
the biggest increase since Feb. 1.  The four-year agreement calls for FMC to supply pre-salt
subsea equipment that can be used in depths up to 8,200 feet
(2,500 meters) off the coast of Brazil, the Houston-based
company said in a statement today. An initial part of the
contract with Petrobras, as Brazilâ€™s national oil company is
known, is valued at about $900 million in revenue, FMC said.  National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV)  and  Cameron International Corp. (CAM) 
are the first- and second-largest makers of oilfield equipment,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
