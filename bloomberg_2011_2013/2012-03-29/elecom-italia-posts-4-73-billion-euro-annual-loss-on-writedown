Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  posted a bigger-
than-estimated loss in 2011 after Italy’s largest phone company
wrote down goodwill for 7.3 billion euros ($9.68 billion).  The net loss was 4.73 billion euros compared with net
income of 3.12 billion euros a year earlier, the Milan-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had  estimated  a loss of 612 million euros. Excluding
the writedowns and other non-recurring items, net income in
comparable terms was 2.6 billion euros, it said.  Last year “was tough for the global economy and even more
so for Italy, which was hit by the sovereign debt crisis,”
Chairman Franco Bernabe said in the statement. “The increased
cost of capital caused by higher  interest rates  led to a
reduction of the domestic goodwill value.”  The company wrote down the goodwill following “the
Olivetti/Telecom Italia deals of 1999 and 2003” and the
purchase of Telecom Italia Mobile minorities in 2005, Bernabe
said. “The writedown has no financial consequences and no
impact on the group’s debt reduction plans.”  Telecom Italia’s board proposed dividends of 4.3 cents and
5.4 cents per ordinary and savings share respectively, compared
with 5.8 cents and 6.9 cents a year earlier.  Latin America  “The loss is wider than expected because of the goodwill
writedown, but in practice it doesn’t have an impact on the
dividend distribution, because it’s a non-cash item,” said
Saverio Papagno, an analyst at AZ Fund Management in Luxembourg.  Telecom Italia confirmed that earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 7.3 percent in 2011,
helped by growth in  Latin America , and revenue advanced 8.7
percent to 29.96 billion euros. It also reiterated a February
forecast of “essentially unchanged” Ebitda and revenue this
year. The company gave preliminary 2011 figures in February.  To spur growth abroad, Telecom Italia’s Brazilian unit  Tim
Participacoes SA (TIMP3)  in July agreed to buy AES Atimus Group to add
network capacity in  Sao Paulo  and  Rio de Janeiro . Tim surpassed
billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil SAB in July to become
 Brazil ’s second-largest wireless operator. In Latin America,
Telecom Italia also controls  Telecom Argentina SA (TECO2) , the country’s
second-largest phone company.  Telecom Italia fell 2.7 percent to 90 euro cents in Milan
trading, giving it a market value of 16.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
