Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-
largest truckmaker, signed a 1.2 billion-euro ($1.59 billion)
revolving credit line, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The five-year facility pays interest at 85 basis points
more than the euro interbank offered rate and replaces a $1.4
billion credit line signed in 2006, Bloomberg data show.  The new financing is 200 million euros more than 1 billion
euros originally sought by the Gothenburg, Sweden-based company.  In a revolving credit, money can be borrowed again once it
is repaid. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Stuttgart, Germany-based  Daimler AG (DAI)  is the world’s largest
truckmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
