China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to its lowest level in more than 10 weeks, on
concern the slowing economy is spurring earnings shortfalls.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  and gold producer Zijin Mining
Group Co. retreated at least 2.6 percent after net income
trailed estimates. Sinovel Wind Group Co., the country’s biggest
maker of  wind turbines , dropped for a sixth day after the
Shanghai Securities News reported the government is slowing
growth in new wind power projects. Poly Real Estate Group Co.
led a gauge of developers to its biggest gain in almost two
weeks on speculation the government may relax some property
restrictions as the economy decelerates.  “It looks like the slump in economic and earnings growth
exceeds investors’ expectations,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-
based chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment Management
Co., which manages about $120 million. “The market may need to
correct until the end of the first half.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 32.72 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,252.16 at the close, the lowest since Jan. 16. The
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 1.3 percent to 2,443.12. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, retreated 2 percent in  New York  yesterday.
China’s markets will be closed from April 2 to April 4 for
public holidays.  The Shanghai Composite has dropped 8.5 percent from this
year’s high on March 2 on concern the world’s second-biggest
economy is stalling as the government’s property curbs and tight
monetary policies reduce profits. The index fell the most in
four months yesterday after Societe Generale SA said Chinese
corporate profits won’t grow at all this year. The gauge is
still up 2.4 percent since Dec. 31 and is poised for the biggest
 quarterly gain  in a year.  Analysts Estimates  Five-hundred and five companies in the  Shanghai  Composite
have released annual earnings, posting average profit growth of
17 percent, which trails analyst estimates by 3.6 percent,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. That compared with an
increase of 38 percent in the previous year.  Sany Heavy, the biggest Chinese machinery maker, fell 4.1
percent to 12.32 yuan. Net income rose 54 percent to 8.65
billion yuan ($1.4 billion) last year, compared with the 9
billion yuan average of 16 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The company had forecast a 50 percent to 60 percent
increase in  profit .  Zijin Mining, China’s largest gold producer, lost 2.6
percent to 4.10 yuan. Net income climbed 18 percent to 5.71
billion yuan. The company forecast a profit of 5.8 billion yuan
for 2011 on Feb. 3.  Further Declines  Sinovel Wind lost 1.4 percent to 15.05 yuan, capping a six-
day, 10 percent decline.  Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology
Co. (002202) , the country’s second-biggest maker of wind turbines, slid
2.4 percent to 7.45 yuan. The National Energy Administration
told local governments not to “arrange” new wind power
projects in areas where more than 20 percent of wind farm output
is lost because of limited grid capacity, Shanghai Securities
News reported, citing a notice.  Chinese equities will probably extend their retreat unless
there is “significant” easing of monetary policy, according to
Alan Lam, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bank Julius Baer & Co.,
which has about $286 billion in client assets worldwide.  “In the coming three months, the rally has ended,” Lam
said by phone yesterday. “The economic slowdown will continue
for a while and there are overexpectations on policy. It’s a
fact that the economic slowdown in  China  is negative on
profitability.”  The Shanghai Composite was the worst performer among the
world’s 10 biggest markets in 2010 and 2011, tumbling a combined
33 percent, as the central bank increased  interest rates  and
lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios to tame inflation.  Developers Gain  Slow economic recovery will prompt the government to loosen
monetary policy, according to Morgan Stanley, which increased
its estimate for China’s 2012 economic growth to 9 percent from
8.4 percent.  Morgan Stanley expects measures including at least one cut
of 25 basis points in the benchmark lending rate, further bank
reserve ratio cuts and the resumption of infrastructure
investment projects, according to an e-mailed report by analysts
led by Helen Qiao.  A measure of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite
added 0.7 percent, its biggest gain since March 16. Poly Real
Estate, China’s second-largest developer by market value,
climbed 2.4 percent to 10.80 yuan.  Gemdale Corp. (600383) , the four
biggest, gained 4 percent to 5.79 yuan.  “The country’s economic growth is slowing down, so
investors speculated that the government may not maintain an
absolute tightening over the market,” said Dai Fang, a
Shanghai-based property analyst at Zheshang Securities Co.  Thirty-day  volatility  on the Shanghai Composite was at 17.4
today, its highest since March 2. About 8.4 billion shares
changed hands in the gauge yesterday, or 5.6 percent lower than
the daily average this year.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Bonnie Cao in Shanghai.
