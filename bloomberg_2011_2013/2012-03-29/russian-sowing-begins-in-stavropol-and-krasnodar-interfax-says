Russia has sown 15,800 hectares
(39,041 acres) of an expected 860,000 hectares of spring crops
in the southern Stavropol region, Interfax said, citing Anatoly
Kutsenko, the region’s first deputy agriculture minister.  In the southern Krasnodar region sowing has been completed
on about 15,000 hectares, or three times less than a year
earlier because of cold weather in March, Interfax said, citing
data of the region’s agriculture department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
