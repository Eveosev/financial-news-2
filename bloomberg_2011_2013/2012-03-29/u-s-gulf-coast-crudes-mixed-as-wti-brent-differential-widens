U.S. Gulf Coast crudes were mixed
even as the differential between Brent and West Texas
Intermediate widened.  Brent’s  premium  over WTI, based on May futures prices,
widened by 78 cents to $19.53 a barrel in  New York  at 2:25 p.m.
When Brent increases versus WTI, it typically boosts the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  The WTI-Brent spread increased on speculation the U.S. and
European countries are moving closer to an agreement on a
release of supplies from emergency stockpiles. Oil and gasoline
prices have risen on concern that tensions over  Iran’s nuclear
program  will curtail exports from the  Middle East .  The U.S.  released  30.6 million barrels of oil from the
reserve in July and August as part of an International Energy
Agency effort to offset the loss of production during an armed
rebellion in  Libya . Last year’s release was of light, low sulfur
oil from storage facilities in Texas and  Louisiana , and sold
relative to Light Louisiana Sweet prices.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium to WTI added 10 cents to
$22 a barrel at 2:07 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium lost 50
cents to $23 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI sank 55 cents to $18.75 a
barrel.  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  was up 5 cents to $15.75 over the U.S.
benchmark.  Poseidon’s premium increased 15 cents to $15, while
Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at $15.75 a barrel over.
 West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 40 cents to $5.40 below WTI.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount narrowed $3.50 to $24 a
barrel. Bakken oil was unchanged at an $11 a barrel discount,
and Syncrude’s discount shrank 50 cents to $4.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
