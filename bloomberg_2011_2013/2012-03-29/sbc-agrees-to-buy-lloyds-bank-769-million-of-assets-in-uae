HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, agreed to buy $769 million of  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s
consumer and commercial-banking assets in the United Arab
Emirates to bolster its presence in the Middle East.  The unit has about 8,800 customers, London-based HSBC said
in a statement today. Lloyds will keep its private and
expatriate operations in the UAE, the company said in a separate
statement. The banks didn’t disclose the price of the deal.  “The acquisition underscores the strategic importance of
the UAE, and of the Middle East and North Africa region as a
whole, to HSBC,” said Simon Cooper, deputy chairman and chief
executive officer of HSBC in the Middle East and North Africa.  HSBC said customer accounts in the UAE grew 11 percent to
$18.17 billion in 2011.  Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver 
in February named the UAE along with Mexico and India as an area
for “repositioning” the bank in consumer finance.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
