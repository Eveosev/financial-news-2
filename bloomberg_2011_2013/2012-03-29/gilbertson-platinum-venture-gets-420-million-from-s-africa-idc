Pallinghurst Resources Ltd. (PGL) , a
commodities investment firm founded by former  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
head Brian Gilbertson, said the Industrial Development Corp. of
 South Africa  is investing $420 million in a mining venture.  The IDC will hold a 16.2 percent stake in the platinum
venture focusing on operations in the country’s North West
Province, Pallinghurst said today in a statement. The new
company will include interests owned by Pallinghurst and the
Bakgatla Ba Kgafela tribe, it said.  The venture “will certainly transform the local platinum
mining and beneficiation landscape,” Geoffrey Qhena, chief
executive officer of the Johannesburg-based IDC, said in the
 statement. “IDC’s equity funding is the catalyst that is
 required to implement the consolidation plan that has been
 developed by Pallinghurst over the last five years.”  The venture around the Pilanesberg Platinum Mine may create
as many as 9,000 jobs, Pallinghurst said. The resource base of
the new company is about 70 million ounces of platinum group
metals, it said.  Pallinghurst rose as much as 6.5 percent to 3.30 rand in
Johannesburg trading, the highest intraday price since Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
