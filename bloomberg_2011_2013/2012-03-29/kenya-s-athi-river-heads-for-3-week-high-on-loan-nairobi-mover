Athi River Mining Ltd. (ARML) , Kenya’s
second-biggest cement maker by market value, rose to a three-
week high after the company secured a $50 million convertible
loan to fund expansion plans in east and southern  Africa .  The stock climbed 0.6 percent to 162 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, its strongest level since March 8.  Africa Finance Corp., a Nigeria-based development-finance
institution, is providing a $50 million convertible loan to Athi
River, which translates to 13.62 percent of the company’s equity
if converted, Athi said on March 27. Plans to increase annual
production capacity to 2.6 million tons a year by 2013 will
bring output to 1 million tons in Kenya, 1.5 million tons in
 Tanzania  and 100,000 tons in  Rwanda , the company said. It didn’t
give its current capacity.  “The debt is mainly for expansion plans in the region to
complete ongoing projects and to expand a clinker plant in
Tanzania,” Vimal Parmer, head of research at Kestrel Capital
East Africa Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi today. “We are
expecting good cash flows from these operations especially in
Tanzania.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
