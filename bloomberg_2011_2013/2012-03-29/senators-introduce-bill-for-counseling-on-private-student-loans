Two U.S. Democratic Senators
introduced a bill that would require colleges to counsel
students before they sign on to private loans and inform them if
they are eligible for federal loans.  The “Know Before You Owe Act of 2012” would also require
the borrower’s school to confirm the student’s enrollment
status, cost of attendance and estimated federal financial aid
assistance before the private student loan is approved,
according to a  statement  today released by Senator  Richard Durbin , a Democrat from  Illinois .  Private loans don’t have the same kinds of protection as
federal loans, which include income-based repayment and
deferment options. U.S. educational debt has reached $1
trillion, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  “With student loan debt at a record level, we must empower
students to make informed decisions about how they finance their
education, especially when it comes to the risks of private
loans, which can sink students into financial quicksand and are
not dischargeable in bankruptcy,” the other sponsor,  Tom Harkin , a Democrat from  Iowa , said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
