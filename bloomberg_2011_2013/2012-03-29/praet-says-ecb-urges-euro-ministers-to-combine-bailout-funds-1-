European Central Bank Executive
Board member Peter Praet said euro-area finance ministers should
quickly approve the combining of the region’s two bailout funds,
the European Stability Mechanism and the European Financial
Stability Facility, in order to expand emergency resources.  “The ECB welcomes the commitment of  Europe ’s leaders to
regularly review the lending capacity of the ESM and urges them
to quickly agree on a significant increase of the resources of
the ESM by combining the lending capacity of the ESM and the
EFSF,” Praet said in an article prepared for a seminar in
Copenhagen today.  Euro-area finance chiefs will probably decide at a meeting
in Copenhagen tomorrow to run the 500 billion-euro ($666
billion) permanent ESM alongside the temporary EFSF, increasing
the size of the firewall, a European official told reporters in
Brussels yesterday. The funds are designed to aid  member states 
locked out of financial markets because of concerns about their
debts, helping to stem contagion.  Praet said the debt crisis “is not over” and the
responsibility for resolving it “lies with the euro-area
governments, not with the central bank.”  The ECB has already cut its key  interest rate  to a record
low of 1 percent and flooded the banking system with more than 1
trillion euros of cheap three-year loans to fight the crisis.  “While central banks can smooth the adjustment process of
deleveraging and the implementation of structural reforms, they
cannot provide a lasting solution,” Praet said. “The primary
objective of monetary policy is to maintain  price stability .
Monetary policy cannot be a substitute for structural reforms,
or for fiscal and financial discipline.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
