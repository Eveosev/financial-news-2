Torunlar Gayrimenkul Yatirim
Ortakligi AS (TRGYO) , a Turkish real estate invesment trust, rose the
most in almost three weeks, after winning a government land sale
auction.  Torunlar surged as much as 8.3 percent before paring its
gain to 3 percent at 5.46 liras by the close in Istanbul.  Torunlar submitted the highest bid of 355 million liras
($199 million) to buy about 72,000 square meters of land and a
49-year right to use 3,935 square meters of docks along the
Bosphorus in Istanbulâ€™s Beykoz district, according to Ibrahim Kirsan, deputy head of the asset sales agency.  Five companies competed in the sale, Kirsan, who managed
the auction, said in Ankara today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
