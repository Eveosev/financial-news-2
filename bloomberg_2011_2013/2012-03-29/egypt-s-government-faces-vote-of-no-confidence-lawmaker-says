Egypt ’s parliament will probably
press ahead with plans for a vote of no confidence in the
interim military-appointed government, said Hussein Ibrahim, an
official with the Islamist party the Mulsim Brotherhood.  Government officials have repeatedly argued that only the
ruling military council can dismiss the government.  “The military council should dismiss the government when
it finds that it doesn’t want to resign, and that parliament has
refused to give it a vote of confidence,” Ibrahim told
reporters in Cairo.  The FJP, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood,
rejected proposals by Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, saying
they failed to address the country’s challenges facing the
country following the ouster of former President  Hosni Mubarak 
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story: Mariam Fam in Cairo +2-
