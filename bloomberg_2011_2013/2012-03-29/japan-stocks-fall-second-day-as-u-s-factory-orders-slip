Japanese  stocks  declined for a
second day after orders placed with U.S. factories for durable
goods rose less than economists estimated. Oil and metals prices
retreated, driving down traders of commodities.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s biggest carmaker by market value,
slumped 1.7 percent after the yen strengthened, damping the
earnings outlook for exporters.  Mitsui & Co. (8031) , a trading house
that counts commodities as its biggest source of revenue, fell
3.3 percent. Ebara Corp. dropped 4.2 percent after Yamato
Holdings Co. filed a lawsuit seeking compensation involving the
cleanup of land purchased from the hydraulic pump maker.  “U.S. data is pouring cold water on the rally,” said
 Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “The market is in a correction phase
amid worries it has risen too much.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 0.7 percent to
10,114.79 at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , its biggest two-day drop
since March 6. The gauge this week finished clawing back losses
since the country’s record earthquake on March 11 last year,
with the rebound driven by a 7 percent decline in the yen
against the dollar, reconstruction efforts and an improving
global economic outlook. The broader Topix Index slid 0.8
percent to 857.74 today, with volume 15 percent lower than the
30-day average.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.1 percent.
The gauge lost 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday after a report
showed that factory bookings for goods meant to last at least
three years advanced less than expected in February after a
revised decline the month before.  Exporters also dropped after the yen touched 82.55 against
the dollar today, strengthening from as low as 83.39 yesterday.
The currency gained on speculation the nation’s companies will
repatriate overseas earnings before the end of the fiscal year
on March 31. A stronger yen damps the value of overseas income
at Japanese companies.  Export Stocks Fall  Toyota fell 1.7 percent to 3,575 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s
biggest exporter of consumer electronics, lost 1.5 percent to
1,746 yen.  The correlation between the Nikkei 225 and the dollar-yen
rate has risen to 0.89, the highest since February 2009,
according to Bloomberg data. A value of one means the rate and
the index are in lockstep.  Crude oil for May delivery slumped 1.8 percent yesterday in
New York after the U.S. Energy Department said inventories
climbed the most in 20 months. The London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial commodities including copper and
aluminum fell 1.8 percent yesterday.  Commodity Stocks Decline  Trading companies were among the  biggest declines  in the
Topix’s 33 industry groups. Mitsui lost 3.3 percent to 1,354 yen.
Mitsubishi Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest commodity trader by sales,
retreated 2.8 percent to 1,931 yen. Inpex Corp., the nation’s
largest energy explorer by market value, dropped 1.6 percent to
563,000 yen.  “With all the good news being factored in, we are coming
to a tougher period and markets are vulnerable to any bad
news,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “We are starting to see data come out
on the softer side of what’s expected.”  Sharp Extends Rally  Ebara slumped 4.2 percent to 298 yen, the steepest drop in
the Nikkei 225. The company was sued for not cleaning up
asbestos from a property it sold to Yamato Holdings, a parcel
service that is seeking 7.4 billion yen ($90 million) in damages,
according to a statement filed to the Singapore Stock Exchange.  Sharp Corp. jumped 6.7 percent to 608 yen, extending
yesterday’s surge on Foxconn Technology Group’s plan to invest
in the liquid-crystal-display manufacturer. The stock fell to a
30-year low earlier this month.  Shares on the Topix are valued at 1.05 times book value, up
from 0.88 in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A number less than one means companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 0.4 percent to 19.61,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
