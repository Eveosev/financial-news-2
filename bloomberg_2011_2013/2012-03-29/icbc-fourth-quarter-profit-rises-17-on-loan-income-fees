Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd.  widened its lead as the world’s most profitable
lender, posting a 17 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings
as loan growth outpaced rising defaults.  Net income climbed to 44.4 billion yuan ($7 billion), from
37.9 billion yuan, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
full-year figures published today by the Beijing-based lender.
That compared with the 43.4 billion-yuan average  estimate  of 22
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  China’s efforts to bolster banks’ risk buffers and curb
inflation after a two-year, $2.7 trillion credit boom have
pushed up funding costs, slowed the economy and triggered
defaults. Still, ICBC shares have rallied 41 percent since a 2
1/2-year low on Oct. 4 as investors bet policy makers will move
to protect the economy from a so-called hard landing.  “ICBC has extended its edge over rivals with its long-
standing prudent management and better risk control,” Rainy Yuan, a Shanghai-based analyst at Masterlink Securities Corp.,
said before the earnings were released. “We are now cautious on
the whole banking sector because the economic slowdown will
affect everybody to some degree as weak loan demand hurts
pricing power.”  China ’s 3,800 banks had fourth-quarter net income of $35.4
billion, a third more than the total earnings of 7,357 U.S.
lenders including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co., data from the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. showed.  Economic Slowdown  ICBC advanced 998 billion yuan of new loans in 2011,
increasing the total by 15 percent to 7.79 trillion yuan. Non-
performing loans rose to 73 billion yuan from 69.2 billion yuan
at the end of September, according to the statement.  The lender said it expects to keep its bad-loan ratio to
below 1.2 percent at the end of this year, compared with 0.94
percent in 2011.  China’s  gross domestic product  expanded 8.9 percent last
quarter, the slowest pace in 2 1/2 years, as  Europe ’s debt
crisis damped export demand and the  property market  weakened.
 Standard & Poor’s  warned March 12 that a jump in bad loans may
erode profitability at Chinese lenders.  The economy may bottom out in the first half and the
country has already passed through the tightest credit
conditions in this cycle,  Ba Shusong , a researcher at the
Development Research Center of the State Council, said March 22.  Chinese lenders advanced 7.47 trillion yuan of new loans
last year, 6 percent less than the amount offered in 2010. The
weighted average borrowing cost rose to 8.01 percent in
December, up 1.82 percentage points from the beginning of the
year, according to the central bank.  Small-Business Defaults  Higher borrowing costs coupled with weaker export demand
have fueled defaults at smaller businesses, causing bad loans at
the banks to rise for the first time since September 2008.  At least 14,400 small and midsized enterprises went
bankrupt in Zhejiang province, a hub for exporters, in the first
half of last year, Hu Chengzhong, deputy head of the Zhejiang
Federation of Industry & Commerce, said this month. About 15
percent of the region’s companies with annual sales of 20
million yuan were losing money, Hu said.  For 2011, ICBC earned 208.3 billion yuan, up 26 percent
from the year earlier, fueled by rising loan demand and wider
margins. Net income was almost double that of  JPMorgan (JPM) , the
largest and most profitable U.S. bank last year.  Goldman Stake  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in November raised $1.1 billion
selling  shares of ICBC , trimming its investment for the third
time since its initial purchase in 2006. The U.S. firm still
owns about 8.5 billion ICBC shares.  ICBC’s capital adequacy ratio rose to 13.17 percent by the
end of December, from 12.51 percent three months earlier. Its
core capital adequacy ratio stood at 10.07 percent.  Net interest income, or revenue from lending minus interest
paid to depositors, rose 19 percent to 362.8 billion yuan in
2011, as the net interest margin expanded 17 basis points to
2.61 percent. ICBC’s fee income gained 39 percent to 101.6
billion yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
