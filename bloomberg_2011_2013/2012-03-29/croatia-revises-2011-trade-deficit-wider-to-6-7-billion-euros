Croatia ’s 2011 trade gap widened to
6.7 billion euros ($8.9 billion) after a revision, from
initially reported 5.8 billion euros.  The change is because of a “technical error,” the
 statistics office  said in a statement on its website today,
citing a preliminary figure. Final data will be reported on July
4, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
