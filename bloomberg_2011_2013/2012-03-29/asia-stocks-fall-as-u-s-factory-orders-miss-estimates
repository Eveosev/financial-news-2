Asian  stocks  fell for a second day
on concern China’s economic slowdown is weighing on company
earnings and after orders placed with U.S. factories for durable
goods rose less than estimated.  PICC Property & Casualty Co. slid 3.9 percent in  Hong Kong 
after China’s biggest non-life insurer missed analysts’ profit
estimates.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which depends on  North America 
for 28 percent of its sales, fell 1.7 percent. Speco Co. led
gains among South Korean defense-related companies on a report
North Korea has begun to fuel a rocket it plans to launch.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.6 percent to 126.54
as of 7:23 p.m. in  Tokyo , with more than twice as many stocks
declining as rising. The gauge is headed for its first monthly
drop since November, paring the biggest quarterly gain since the
period through September 2010. The measure has risen 11 percent
this year.  Weaker earnings are “consistent with other data out of
 China  showing a slowdown,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head
of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
almost $100 billion under management. “What’s lacking is more
aggressive easing by the Chinese authorities. That’s what is
concerning the markets. I think if the data was soft and
authorities were easing, investors would be a lot more
comfortable.”  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.7 percent, with
trading volume 11 percent below the 30-day average. South
Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.9 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
slid 0.1 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.3 percent
and the  Shanghai  Composite Index declined 1.4 percent.  PICC slipped 3.9 percent to HK$9.48, its lowest close since
Oct. 21. Full-year profit rose to 8.03 billion yuan ($1.27
billion), missing the 8.8 billion yuan median estimate of 16
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg as the insurer booked a loss on
stock investments.  Sany Heavy Industry Co., a builder of heavy construction
machinery, slid 4.1 percent to 12.32 yuan in Shanghai after net
income trailed analysts’ estimates.  In Sydney,  Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) , Australia’s largest
construction company, plunged 6.7 percent to A$22.16 after
saying underlying profit last year may miss an earlier forecast
by as much as 38 percent because of delays to two of its major
project caused by wet weather and lower productivity.  Of 666 companies listed on the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index that
have reported quarterly profit since Jan. 9, 57 percent have
missed analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  U.S. Outlook  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has fallen about 2 percent this
month amid as confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy
wavers. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday said
unemployment remains too high and the recovery isn’t guaranteed.  Shares on the regional gauge were valued at 15 times
estimated earnings on average as of yesterday, higher than 13.5
times for the Standard & Poor’s Index 500 and 11.1 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  rose 0.3 percent today. The index
lost 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday after factory orders for
durable goods advanced less than expected in February. The data
followed reports this month showing less-than-expected growth in
manufacturing and a drop in  consumer confidence  amid higher
gasoline prices.  “We are starting to see data come out on the softer side
of what’s expected,” AMP Capital’s Oliver said. “With all the
good news being factored in, we are coming to a tougher period
and markets are vulnerable to any bad news.”  Korean Rocket  Toyota dropped 1.7 percent to 3,575 yen.  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, fell 1.7 percent to 1.28 million won.  Renhe Commercial Holdings Co. (1387)  slumped 22 percent to 56
cents in Hong Kong after Moody’s Investors Service cut the
shopping mall developer’s credit rating two levels to B3, six
ranks below investment grade. The stock plunged 20 percent
yesterday after posting underlying profit that fell more than 90
percent.  Among shares that rose today, defense-related companies
advanced in  Seoul  after Tokyo Shimbun reported North Korea
started to fuel a rocket it plans to launch. The newspaper cited
an unidentified person it said was familiar with the situation.  Speco, which makes parts for naval ships, rallied 5.4
percent to 2,910 won. Victek Co., a maker of military
communications equipment, jumped 12 percent to 1,970 won.  Huneed
Technologies (005870)  added 2.8 percent to 3,700 won.  Korea’s  Kospi 200 Volatility Index (VKOSPI)  rose 2 percent to 17.78,
