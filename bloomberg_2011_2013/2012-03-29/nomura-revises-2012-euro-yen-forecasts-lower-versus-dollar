Nomura Holdings Inc. revised its
forecasts for the euro and yen against the dollar, estimating
that the two currencies will weaken further by the end of 2012.  The firm revised its euro-dollar year-end forecast to $1.23
from $1.25 and increased its estimate for the end of the second
quarter to $1.28, from $1.20,  Jens Nordvig , a managing director
of currency research in  New York  at Nomura, wrote in a note to
clients. Nomura is keeping its 80 yen-per-dollar forecast for
midyear and said the Japanese currency may gradually weaken to
85 in the second half of 2012.  Nomura sees “increased potential for near-zero overnight
rates for a multi-year period and liquidity effects creating
potential for the euro to become a key global funding
currency,” Nordvig wrote. “We have analyzed the yen flow
picture in detail and concluded that gradual weakness is more
likely than a pronounced extension of recent moves.”  The 17-nation euro has strengthened 2.5 percent to $1.3284
this year, and fell to as low as $1.2624 in January. The yen has
weakened 6.4 percent to 82.16 per dollar, depreciating to 84.18
earlier this month.  The euro has weakened 0.4 percent since Feb. 29, when the
 European Central Bank  awarded the region’s banks 529.5 billion
euros ($703 billion) in a second round of three-year loans. The
loans, along with a 1 percent benchmark interest rate, represent
the central bank’s efforts to shore up the euro region’s economy
amid its sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
