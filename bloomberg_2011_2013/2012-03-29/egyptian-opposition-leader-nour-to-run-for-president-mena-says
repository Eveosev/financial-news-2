Egyptian opposition politician
 Ayman Nour , imprisoned on fraud charges after contesting the
2005 elections, said he will stand for president, the Middle
East News Agency reported today.  Nour said the Ghad Party he heads chose him to represent
them in a May vote, the first presidential race since  Hosni
Mubarak  was ousted last year, the state run news agency said.  Nour was pardoned of “all the consequences” relating to
his 2005 conviction yesterday by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein
Tantawi, clearing the way for him to run.  The politician ran against Mubarak in the 2005 race, and
was subsequently imprisoned on fraud charges described by the
New York-based  Human Rights Watch  as “trumped up.” Nour served
most of the sentence before being released for health reasons.
The deadline to register for the elections is April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
