Josef Ackermann , who becomes
chairman of  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN)  after stepping down as
chief executive officer of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , plans to continue
to play a role in discussions about the euro region’s future.  “I get many requests in Europe and, of course, Germany,”
Ackermann said today in an interview on the sidelines of the
Zurich Financial annual general meeting in Zurich. “The
experience that I have accrued in the last years, especially in
the way in which Europe is administered, the challenges for the
euro zone, there I want to continue to play a role.”  Ackermann is the chairman of the Institute of International
Finance, the Washington-based global lobby group for financial
companies that that led debt-swap negotiations for private
creditors with  Greece , until June 6 and leaves Deutsche Bank in
May after a decade as CEO.  Ackermann will continue to engage with “the big European
questions,” he said, adding his new role as chairman at
Switzerland’s biggest insurer is a good combination with his
continued involvement in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
