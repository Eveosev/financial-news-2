Turkey  may raise its 20 percent
stake in the planned Trans-Anatolia Pipeline project, or Tanap,
 Reuters  reported, citing Metin Kilci, undersecretary of the
Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.  Turkey and Azerbaijan, which holds 80 percent of Tanap, may
sign an intergovernmental agreement on the project by the end of
April, Kilci said, according to the news service. The pipeline 
would carry natural gas from the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz field in 
the  Caspian Sea  via Turkey to Europe.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan hasnâ€™t received an offer from
Turkey to increase its stake in the project, Elshad Nassirov,
vice president of the Baku-based company, said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
