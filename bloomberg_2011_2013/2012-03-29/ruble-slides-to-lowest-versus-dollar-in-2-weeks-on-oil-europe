The ruble dropped to its lowest in
more than two weeks after oil fell and concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will worsen curbed demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency weakened 0.3 percent to 29.49 per dollar by
the close in Moscow, its lowest since March 12. The ruble fell
0.1 percent to 39.1201 per euro and closed down 0.2 percent at
33.8235 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Urals crude, the country’s main export blend, dropped for a
third day, sinking 1 percent to $119.35 a barrel.  Greece  will
probably have to restructure its debt again, said  Moritz
Kraemer , head of sovereign ratings at S&P. Oil and gas together
account for 17 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product and 50
percent of state revenue, according to government estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
