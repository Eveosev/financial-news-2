Irish Bank Resolution Corp (ANGL) ., which
is being wound down by the Irish state after one of the
costliest financial rescues in history, said almost two thirds
of its loans are unlikely to be repaid in full.  IBRC, based in Dublin, said 17.8 billion euros ($23.7
billion), or 61 percent, of its loans were impaired at the end
of 2010, rising from 48 percent at the end of 2010, it said in a
statement today. Impaired loans are those unlikely to be repaid
in full. The bank has set aside 10.4 billion euros of provisions
to cover losses, it said.  The former Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and Irish Nationwide
Building Society were merged last year to create IBRC after the
cost of saving the two lenders helped push Ireland into a
bailout. In all, the state has committed about 34.7 billion
euros to the two real-estate lenders, and now wants European
help to reduce the cost of saving the lender.  IBRC’s net loss narrowed to 885 million euros from 17.7
billion-euros, an Irish corporate record, in 2010. The year-
earlier figure included an 11.5 billion-euro loss on the loans
IBRC sold to the National Asset Management Agency and a separate
impairment charge, mainly on soured loans, of 7.77 billion
euros.  IBRC recorded a 426 million-euro loss on the disposal of
assets during 2011, primarily on the sale of the majority of its
U.S. loan book, it said. Some 803 million euros of IBRC’s 1.87
billion-euro residential mortgage portfolio was impaired at the
end of 2011.  As losses at IBRC mount, the government is seeking to
restructure the long-term costs of rescuing the lender, which
was seized by the state in January 2009. The government financed
almost all of the 35 billion-euro cost of rescuing IBRC through
promissory notes -- a form of IOU -- that are scheduled
to be repaid by the state over more than a decade.  Notes  IBRC currently uses the promissory notes for the majority
of the collateral it is using to access emergency funding from
the Irish central bank. For at least a decade, the state has
committed to paying 3.1 billion euro a year to IBRC to help pay
back the central bank.  Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  has indicated he may
ultimately seek to use the euro-area bailout fund to refinance
these notes. He has also said re-engineering the notes over 30
years at “more favorable rates” would lead to a “serious
reduction” in the country’s debt burden.  IBRC said today it agreed in principle with Noonan’s plan
to use a government bond to settle this year’s 3.1 billion euro
payment as it seeks a broader solution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
