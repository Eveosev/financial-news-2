Argentina  will boost inspections of
containers passing through  Buenos Aires  customs and the main
international airport from tomorrow to help combat tax fraud,
according to a statement in the official  gazette  today.  Inspectors will send pictures of the merchandise to the
federal tax agency to help officials verify that the contents
and value of the items matches what importers declared in a
sworn statement previously filed to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
