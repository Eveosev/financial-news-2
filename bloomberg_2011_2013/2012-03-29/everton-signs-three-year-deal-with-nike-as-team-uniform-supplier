Everton signed a three-year
contract with  Nike Inc. (NKE)  that will see the world’s biggest
sporting-goods maker equip the English Premier League soccer
club with uniforms from next season.  Nike will replace Le Coq Sportif Holding SA as the supplier
of the team’s royal blue jersey for the 2012-13 season, Everton
said in an e-mailed statement. Nike will also produce the club’s
official training wear.  “We’re all excited by the prospect of working with Nike’s
design, marketing and retailing teams and look forward to seeing
some impressive, original kits and products,” Everton Chief
Executive Officer Robert Elstone said in the statement.  The sponsorship is Nike’s first association with the nine-
time English soccer champion, adding it to a portfolio of clubs
including Manchester United, Barcelona and Arsenal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
