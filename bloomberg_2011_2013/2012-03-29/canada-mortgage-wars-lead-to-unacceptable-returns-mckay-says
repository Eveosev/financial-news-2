Canada’s “hyper-competitive”
mortgage-lending has depressed returns to unacceptable levels
that aren’t likely to last, said David McKay,  Royal Bank of
Canada ’s head of banking for the country.  “You hate doing business at 2.99 and making such low-to-
negligible margins for five years,” McKay said today, referring
to  interest rates  on some mortgages, during a conference in
Montreal hosted by  National Bank of Canada. (NA)  “Some of those rate
wars have taken these returns down to unacceptable levels for
our shareholders.”  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  reduced its five-year fixed-rate mortgage
by 50 basis points to 2.99 percent on March 8, prompting Royal
Bank and other lenders to discount some home loans. Royal Bank
raised its four-year fixed mortgage by 50 basis points to 3.49
percent on March 26, ending its special offer.  “We’re hoping they don’t sustain there over time,” he
said, referring to the market’s current levels. “And it appears
that they won’t.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
