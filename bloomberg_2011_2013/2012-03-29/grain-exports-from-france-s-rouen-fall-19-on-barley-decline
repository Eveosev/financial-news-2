Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 19 percent
in the latest week as barley deliveries declined.  Shipments dropped to 128,865 metric tons between March 22
and March 28 from 159,777 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River
port  said in an e-mailed report today. Exports included 112,350
tons of soft wheat, little changed from the prior week.  Algeria was the biggest export destination, taking 76,550
tons of soft wheat. Barley shipments to  Morocco  declined to
13,525 tons, less than half the 32,898 tons shipped the previous
week, the data showed.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to figures from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
