Nigerian police said they shot dead
two suspected Islamist militants who attacked and burned down a
police station in northeastern Damagun town in Yobe state.  Three policemen were injured in the assault yesterday. The
attackers arrived in 10 vehicles and threw improvised explosive
devices before they began shooting indiscriminately, said Toyin
Gbadegesin, a spokesman for Yobe state police. The suspected
Boko Haram members also attacked a military base near the police
station and freed inmates from a prison in the town, he said.  “For now, 14 inmates have escaped, while some of them
chose to return to the prison after being freed,” Gbadegesin
said by phone today.  The government of  Africa ’s top oil producer blames Boko
Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban
movement, for a surge of violence in the mainly Muslim north and
in Abuja, the capital, since 2009.  Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a
sin,” claimed responsibility for multiple blasts and attacks in
the city of Kano on Jan. 20 that killed at least 256 people,
according to the Civil Rights Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
