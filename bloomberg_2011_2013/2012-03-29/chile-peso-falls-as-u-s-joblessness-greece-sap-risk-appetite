Chile’s peso weakened as higher-
than-forecast U.S. jobless claims and a warning that  Greece  may
need to restructure its debt again eroded demand for riskier,
emerging-market assets.  The peso slid 0.1 percent to 489.75 per  U.S. dollar  as of
11:04 a.m. in Santiago from 489.29 yesterday. The Bloomberg
JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index fell 0.4 percent , the
most  in two weeks.  Regional currencies weakened against the dollar after U.S.
jobless claims topped forecasts and  Standard & Poor’s  head of
sovereign ratings Moritz Kraemer said Greece may need to
restructure its debt again. The peso weakened less than
currencies in Brazil and Colombia after domestic  retail sales 
increased more than forecast.  “The local news was very good,” said Ronald Volpi, head
of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA
in Santiago. “We’ll have to see how international markets
unfold.”  Chilean retail sales expanded 12.4 percent in February from
a year earlier, the government’s statistics institute said in a
report today.  That beat the 7 percent median forecast of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey and led Jorge Selaive, chief economist at  Banco
de Credito e Inversiones (BCI)  in Santiago, and Deputy Economic
Minister Tomas Flores, to estimate the economy grew 6 percent or
more in the 12 months through February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
