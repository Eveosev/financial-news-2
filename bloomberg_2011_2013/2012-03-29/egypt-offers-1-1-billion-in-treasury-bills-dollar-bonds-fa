Egypt will offer 6.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($1.1 billion) in treasury bills today as it
resumes negotiations with the  International Monetary Fund  for a
loan. The nation’s dollar bonds fell for a second day.  The North African nation will seek bids for  six-  and  12-
month (EGTBY12)  securities valued at 3 billion pounds and 3.5 billion
pounds, respectively, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. It sold similar-maturity bills last week at average
yields of 14.799 percent and 15.768 percent, respectively.  An IMF technical committee is back in the country to
discuss the loan and an 18-month economic program proposed by
the government,  Al Ahram newspaper  reported today, citing
Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed. The program focuses on
Egypt’s budget deficit and revamping tax and customs laws, and
won’t have a negative impact on the country’s poor, the
newspaper said.  Today’s sale is the first of a plan to raise 150 billion
pounds in the quarter that ends in June, which marks the end of
 Egypt ’s fiscal year. Yields on  one-year notes  have surged 518
basis points, or 5.18 percentage points, since the start of the
country’s anti-government protests in January 2011.  The yield on the country’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 advanced 1 basis point to 6.49 percent at 12:24 p.m. in
Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level on a closing basis in more than two weeks. The
Egyptian pound was little changed at 6.0395 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
