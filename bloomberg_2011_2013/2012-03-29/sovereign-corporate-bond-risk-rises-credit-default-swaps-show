The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 1.5 basis points to 269.5, according to
BNP Paribas SA at 10:45 a.m. in London. A rise signals worsening
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings added 9.5 basis
points to 602.5.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 2.5 at 123.5 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers rose 5.5 basis points to 214.5 and the subordinated
gauge was 11.5 higher at 349.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
