Liquefied natural gas supplies from
the U.S. may find limited buyers in  Asia  because of competition
from other regions,  Wood Mackenzie  Ltd. said.  U.S. LNG exports may be less than 28 million metric tons a
year before 2018, lower than forecasts of 31 million to 94
million tons a year estimated by the U.S. Energy Intelligence
Agency, Wood Mackenzie said today in an e-mail. Proposed
Australian and African LNG developments are competing with U.S.
terminals.  “Incremental U.S. LNG exports into Asia are likely to be
restricted by competition and by buyer appetite rather than
export approvals,” Noel Tomnay, head of global gas research at
Wood Mackenzie, said in the note.  Buyers may be put off by political risk and specification
that U.S. gas exports be “lean,” or devoid of condensates and
gas liquids, Tomnay said. U.S. firms have applied for licenses
to export about 97.5 million tons of proposed LNG capacity to
non-Free-Trade Areas, Wood Mackenzie said.  U.S. projects poised to deliver before 2018 into the
Pacific area may gain “significant first-mover advantages,”
according to the note.  Some existing LNG import facilities in the U.S. are being
converted into production areas at a cost of about $2.50 per
million British thermal units, Amber McCullagh, a specialist on
North American gas, in the note.  LNG is natural gas chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 162 degrees Celsius), converting it into a liquid state
for shipping by tanker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
