U.S. stock-index futures extended
losses after jobless claims topped economistsâ€™ forecasts,
damping optimism about the economy.  S&P 500  futures expiring in June slipped 0.4 percent to
1,394 at 8:33 a.m. New York time.   Initial jobless claims were 359,000 last week, the Labor
Department reported today in  Washington . The median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for 350,000 claims.
With the report, the government data also contain revisions
dating back to 2007.  The S&P 500 has risen 12 percent this year through
yesterday amid better-than-estimated economic and corporate
data. The benchmark gauge is poised for the best first-quarter
since 1998 as measures of financial and technology shares surged
at least 21 percent.  U.S. equities fell in the previous two sessions, sending
the S&P 500 down 0.8 percent from an almost four-year high
reached on March 26, amid concern the rally in stocks has
outpaced prospects for global economic growth.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
