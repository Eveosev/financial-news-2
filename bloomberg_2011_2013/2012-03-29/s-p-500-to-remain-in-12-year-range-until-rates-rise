The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
will likely remain stuck in the 500-point range where it’s been
four-fifths of the time since 2000 until the  Federal Reserve 
allows interest rates to rise, according to Piper Jaffray Cos.  The benchmark measure fell in the previous two days after
reaching 1,416.51, the highest level since May 2008 and 9.5
percent below its record high of 1,565.15 from 2007. The index
has traded between 1,000 and 1,500 for about 80 percent of the
time since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Equity gains stalled in the past 12 years as the economy
suffered from the bursting of bubbles in technology and real
estate, forcing the central bank to cut its benchmark  interest
rate  to near zero from 6.5 percent to spur growth. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  has pledged to keep borrowing costs low through
at least late 2014.  “The S&P 500 is approaching the upper end of the secular
trading range,” Craig W. Johnson, a Minneapolis-based technical
market strategist with Piper Jaffray, wrote in a note yesterday.
“This resistance will likely remain intact until 2014-2015, and
will correspond with a secular change in bond yields.”  The S&P 500 has climbed 12 percent this year and is poised
for the best first quarter since 1998, amid better-than-expected
earnings and economic data. The index jumped 2.4 percent in the
five days through March 16, when yields on  10-year  (USGG10YR) Treasury
notes had the biggest weekly increase in eight months following
an upgrade in the Fed’s economic assessment.  The  S&P 500  now faces “resistance” at 1,440, or 2.5
percent above its close of 1,405.54 yesterday, according to
Johnson. A pullback may take the measure down to its 200-day
 average , he said. The average was at 1,265.78 yesterday, which
would be a 10 percent loss from the current level.  “The broader market may continue to sputter higher on
light volume over the next several weeks, but will then likely
stall,” Johnson said. He forecasts that the S&P 500 will end
the year at 1,350.  To contact the reporter on this story:
