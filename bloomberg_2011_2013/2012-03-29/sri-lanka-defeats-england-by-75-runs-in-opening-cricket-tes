Rangana Herath took 12 wickets as
 Sri Lanka  beat top-ranked England by 75 runs in their series-
opening cricket Test.  England was bowled out for 264 in the last session, losing
its last 6 wickets for 31 runs as it tried to chase down a team-
record 340 to win in Galle. Its previous highest winning fourth-
innings total in a Test was 332 in 1928 against Australia in
 Melbourne . Herath took 6 wickets in the second innings, and had
more than 10 in a Test for the first time.  The victory puts Sri Lanka 1-0 up in the best-of-two
contest as the home team seeks a first elite series win since
beating  New Zealand  in August 2009. The second Test starts April
3 in  Colombo . It was the host’s first home Test victory since
the 2010 retirement of Muttiah Muralitharan, the sport’s record
wicket taker.  “It’s been a tough period for us to try to get things
right, but the boys have worked really hard,” Sri Lanka captain
Mahela Jayawardene said.  England’s defeat was its  fourth straight  in away Tests
following a 3-0 sweep of losses against Pakistan in the United
Arab Emirates. It last won a Test series on the road against
Asian teams other then bottom-ranked Bangladesh in 2001, when it
won 2-1 in Sri Lanka.  England was bowled out for 193 runs in its first innings,
and dropped catches that may have lowered its run chase.  Mistakes  “In truth, we made too many mistakes in the game,”
Captain Andrew Strauss said. “In between the mistakes, we
played hard. We left ourselves with too much to do, especially
because of our batting in the first innings.”  England , which resumed at 111-2 on day four, lost Kevin
Pietersen and Ian Bell in the morning session to the spin
bowling of Herath and Suraj Randiv, who took 4 wickets in the
innings.  Jonathan Trott  hit 112 before being caught off Randiv.
The batsman combined with Matt Prior for 81 runs before the
wicketkeeper was caught off Herath.  England, which has now scored 300 runs or more only once in
its past eight innings, had been chasing what would have been a
ground-record score batting fourth in Galle. The biggest fourth-
innings total in 18 previous Tests in the port city was Sri
Lanka’s 253 in a loss against  Australia  last year, while the
home team’s 96-0 against  India  in 2010 was the highest winning
score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
