University of  North Carolina 
basketball players Harrison Barnes, John Henson and Kendall
Marshall will enter the National Basketball Association draft,
the school said on its website.  Barnes, a sophomore forward, led North Carolina in scoring
in 2011 and 2012, averaging 16.4 points per game. He earned
first-team Atlantic Coast Conference honors this season.  Marshall won the 2012 Bob Cousy Award as the top point
guard in the country after setting the single-season ACC assists
record with 351, the fourth most in National Collegiate Athletic
Association history. He is a sophomore.  Henson, a junior forward who was the ACC’s defensive player
of the year in 2011 and 2012, departs having averaged 2.56
blocked shots per game, the best in school history.  The  Chapel Hill , North Carolina-based Tar Heels went 32-6
this season to win the ACC regular-season title and earn a No. 1
seed in the NCAA tournament. They lost 80-67 to  Kansas  on March
25 in a regional final game, playing without Marshall, who had
surgery after breaking his wrist in a March 18 win against
Creighton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
