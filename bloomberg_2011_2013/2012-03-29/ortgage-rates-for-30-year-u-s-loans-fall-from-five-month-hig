 Mortgage  rates  for 30-year U.S.
loans fell from an almost five-month high, lowering borrowing
costs as the housing market gains strength.  The average rate for a 30-year mortgage declined to 3.99
percent in the week ended today, from 4.08 percent, which was
the highest since Oct. 27, according to  Freddie Mac. (FMCC)  The average
 15-year (NMCM15US)  rate decreased to 3.23 percent from 3.3 percent, the
McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company said in a
statement.  Demand for houses, bolstered by a growing economy, has
improved in the past year.  New homes  sold at an annual pace of
313,000 last month, up 11 percent from February 2011, while down
1.6 percent from January, the Commerce Department said March 23.
The number of  contracts  to buy previously owned houses jumped 14
percent in February from a year earlier, the National
Association of Realtors reported.  “The housing market and the overall economy are
stabilizing,”  Stuart Miller , chief executive officer of  Lennar
Corp. (LEN) , told analysts March 27 after the company reported first-
quarter results that included a 33 percent jump in new home
orders. “A very real trend is beginning to take shape.”  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of home-loan
applications declined 2.7 percent in the period ended March 23,
the Washington-based trade group said yesterday. The measure of
 refinancing  decreased 4.6 percent, while the  purchase  gauge rose
3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
