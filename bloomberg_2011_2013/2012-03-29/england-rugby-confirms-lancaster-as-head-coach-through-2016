England rugby’s interim manager
 Stuart Lancaster  was given the full-time job today by the
country’s board to lead the squad through the next  World Cup .  Lancaster was ratified unamiously in a vote this morning by
the Rugby Football Union’s board and will be given a contract
through 2016, the RFU said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Stuart is the right person to lead England Rugby forward
into the 2015 Rugby World Cup,” Chief Executive Ian Ritchie
said in the statement. “He has shown throughout the RBS 6
Nations and subsequently in both interview and other
conversations I, as chairman of the advisory panel, have had
with him that he has the skills and vision needed in the  England 
Head Coach.”  The 42-year-old, who took over for the Six Nations after
Martin Johnson quit Nov. 16 following the World Cup in New
Zealand, guided England to second place in the championship
behind Grand Slam winner Wales. England won three away matches
in the tournament for the first time.  England will play 37 matches before the next World Cup,
which it will host.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
