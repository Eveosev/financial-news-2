Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
yields to a two-week low, as a slide in stocks on concern
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen fueled demand for the
safest assets.  U.S. government bonds gained, changing course after falling
yesterday, as traders prepared to bid for $29 billion of seven-
year debt in the last of the week’s three note sales. Treasuries
rose even after initial claims for U.S. jobless benefits fell.
 Greece  will probably have to restructure its debt again, a
Standard & Poor’s official said. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said this week U.S. economic recovery isn’t assured.  “Europe had dropped out of the headlines during the down-
trade and has resurfaced and is back on the radar,” said
 Richard Bryant , a trader at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New
York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the U.S. central
bank. “The chairman reminded the market that the Fed stands
ready to act to keep  interest rates  low. Those two things turned
things around.”  Yields on 10-year notes dropped four basis points, or 0.4
percentage point, to 2.16 percent at 11:47 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 2.15
percent, the lowest level since March 14. The 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 advanced 10/32, or $3.13
per $1,000 face amount, to 98 17/32. The yields increased two
basis points yesterday.  Thirty-year bond  yields slid four basis points to 3.27
percent and touched 3.26 percent, the lowest since March 13.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.8 percent, and the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares dropped 1.3 percent.  Loss for Quarter  Treasuries have lost 1.2 percent this quarter in the
biggest three-month decline since 2010, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes, as the  U.S. economy  showed signs
of improvement. They slid 2.7 percent from October through
December of 2010.  The declines were led by securities maturing in 10 years or
more, which are down 5.1 percent since Dec. 31, Merrill indexes
show. The global government  bond market  has returned 0.4 percent
since then, while the global broad bond market is up 1.1
percent, the data show.  The 10-year yield will climb to 2.54 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg survey of banks
and securities companies, with the most recent projections given
the heaviest weightings. The yield has averaged 3.86 percent
over the past decade.  Treasuries gained today after Moritz Kraemer, head of
sovereign ratings at  Standard & Poor’s , said another Greek
restructuring “may be down the road” and may involve bailout
partners such as European governments.  ‘Far From Over’  “While the situation in the euro region may have improved,
it’s far from over, and this concern should continue to underpin
demand for haven assets like Treasuries,” said  Matteo Regesta ,
a senior fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London .  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
said the situation in the euro area is “expected to remain
fragile” as the economic recovery lags behind that of the U.S.  The American economy will grow 2.9 percent in the first
quarter and 2.8 percent in the following three months, according
to the OECD’s forecast. On a weighted average, the three largest
euro-area economies,  Germany ,  France , and  Italy , will shrink by
an annualized 0.4 percent in the first quarter.  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 3 percent annual rate
in the last three months of 2011, the same as previously
estimated, revised figures from the Commerce Department showed.  Initial  jobless claims  fell 5,000 in the week ended March
24 to 359,000, the lowest since April 2008, the Labor Department
reported today in  Washington .  Further Options  U.S. policy makers don’t rule out further options to
support growth, Bernanke said March 27, according to a
transcript of an ABC News interview provided by the network. The
central bank bought $2.3 trillion of debt under two rounds of
quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011.  The Fed sold $8.6 billion of Treasuries today maturing from
July 2014 to March 2015 as part of a program to replace $400
billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with longer
maturities to cap borrowing costs.  The U.S. seven-year notes being sold by the government
today yielded 1.575 percent in pre-auction trading, compared
with 1.418 percent at the offering of the securities on Feb. 23.  Investors  bid  for 3.11 times the amount offered last month,
compared with an average of 2.86 for the past 10 auctions.
Direct bidders, non-primary dealers buying for their own
accounts, bought 19.3 percent, the most since the Treasury
Department revived sales of the notes in February 2009.  The U.S. five-year note sale yesterday attracted reduced
demand. The  bid-to-cover  ratio was 2.85 at the $35 billion note
sale, the least since the August auction.  ‘Keep Traders Cautious’  “Historically, the performance of the five-year auction
tells little about the seven-year which follows, but the five-
year results are likely to keep traders cautious,” wrote Larry Dyer, a fixed-income strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  New
York , in a research note today.  A $35 billion two-year auction on March 27 drew bids for
3.69 times the amount of debt offered, compared with the average
of 3.53 for the prior 10 sales.  Ten-year Treasuries have underperformed German bonds this
year, with the  extra yield  investors demand to hold the U.S.
securities widening yesterday to 37 basis points, the most since
February 2011. The spread was 36 basis points today. German
bonds are little changed this year, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Inflation Bets  The  five-year, five-year  forward break-even rate, the Fed’s
preferred measure for determining inflation expectations and
which projects the pace of consumer-price increases starting in
2017, fell to 2.71 percent on March 26 from 2.78 percent on
March 19, the highest level since August. The average for the
past decade is 2.76.  The gap between the yields on 10-year Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities and conventional government debt narrowed
for a seventh day to 2.33 percentage points in its longest slide
since March 2010. The figure, called the  10-year break-even  rate
reflects traders’ outlook for inflation over the next decade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
