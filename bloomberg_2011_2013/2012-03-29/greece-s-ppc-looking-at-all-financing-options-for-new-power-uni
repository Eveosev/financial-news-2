Public Power Corp. SA (PPC) , Greece’s
largest electricity producer, is looking at various financing
possibilities for the Ptolemaida V power unit, Rania Ekaterinari, PPC deputy chief executive said.  “It is challenging to find the financing and we are
exploring all sources including the  European Investment Bank  and
commercial banks,” Ekaterinari said today at a conference in
Athens.  PPC is also considering using some of its own funds to part
finance the project while Germany’s Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau IPEX Bank Gmbh, also known as KfW, is financial
adviser and arranger for a possible syndicated loan. KfW is
discussing with Germany’s Export Credit Agency, Euler-Hermes,
getting insurance cover for the loan, she said.  The 1.4 billion-euro ($1.9 billion) project with a
production capacity of 660 mega watts and 140 mega watts of
thermal capacity will be PPC’s main power unit. Scheduled to
begin operations in 2018, the lignite-fueled plant will use 28
percent less of the fuel than existing lignite-powered plants,
Ekaterinari said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
