New Zealand business confidence
rose to a seven-month high in March, while a second gauge of
sales and profits also advanced, according to a survey by ANZ
National Bank Ltd.  A net 33.8 percent of companies expect the economy will
improve over the next 12 months, up from 28 percent in February,
according to the survey released in Wellington today.  A measure of expectations for companiesâ€™ own sales and
earnings increased to 38.8 percent from 31.2 percent in
February. The net figure subtracts the number of pessimists from
the number of optimists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
