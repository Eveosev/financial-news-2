The ruble strengthened and bonds
denominated in dollars rose as oil, the country’s chief export
earner, traded near a one-year high.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 29.294 per dollar
as of 10:17 a.m. in Moscow, paring yesterday’s 1.3 percent
decline. The yield on  Russia ’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due
2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.074
percent.  Brent crude  was little changed at $124.14 per barrel,
within $2.08 of the highest price since April 2011. Oil and gas
together contribute about 17 percent to Russia’s gross domestic
product and 50 percent to state revenue, according to government
estimates.  The ruble was little changed at 39.04 per euro and 0.2
percent stronger at 33.6665 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket. Investors pared bets on the currency
weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing it at 29.6723
per dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
29.7533 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
