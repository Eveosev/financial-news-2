The decision by  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO) 
AO, or  Turkish Airlines , to halt flights to and from  Syria  will

revenue from the  Middle East  by 10 percent, the newspaper said.  Turkish Airlines increased revenue from Middle Eastern
routes in 2011 by 46 percent to 1 billion liras, Haberturk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
