Germany ’s Green Party shouldn’t
exclude the option of forming a coalition with Angela Merkel’s
Christian Democrats after the 2013 vote, Baden-Wuerttemberg’s
Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann said in an interview with
 Der Tagesspiegel .  While a coalition with the Social Democrats is the

newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
