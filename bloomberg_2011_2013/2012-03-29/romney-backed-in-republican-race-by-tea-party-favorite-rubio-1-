U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of  Florida 
endorsed Republican presidential front-runner  Mitt Romney ,
saying it’s time for the party to unite behind the candidate who
has “earned” the nomination.  Rubio, 40, a first-term senator who is a favorite of Tea
Party activists and is regarded as a top prospect to be the
Republican vice-presidential running mate, announced his backing
for the former Massachusetts governor on Fox News tonight.  “We have got to come together behind who I think has
earned this nomination, and that’s Mitt Romney,” he said.  Rubio tonight called the strategy of former Pennsylvania
Senator Rick Santorum and former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  to pursue the nomination through a floor fight at the
party’s August convention “a recipe for disaster.”  A series of elected officials, business leaders and party
activists have announced their support of Romney during the past
week, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Romney is
scheduled to receive the official endorsement tomorrow of former
President George H.W. Bush, Jeb’s father.  Former first lady Barbara Bush has also backed Romney, and
recorded calls for voters voicing her support played before the
March 6 primaries in Ohio and Vermont. Jeb’s brother, former
President  George W. Bush , has yet to make an endorsement in the
Republican race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
