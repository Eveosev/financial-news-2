Israeli police have tightened
security in preparation for planned demonstrations today by
Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the  West Bank  and in the
country’s north, and possible protests at borders.  The demonstrations mark “Land Day,” the anniversary of
the death of six Israeli Arabs killed by Israeli police in a
1976 protest against government confiscation of Arab-owned land.  The Global March to  Jerusalem , a group comprised of
Palestinians and international activists, will stage protest
marches today from the West Bank to Jerusalem, according to an
e-mailed statement the group sent yesterday.  Israeli police will heighten their presence in the
Jerusalem area and at Israeli Arab communities in the north,
police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said in a phone interview.
Police will also assist the army as needed if there should be
any trouble at the country’s borders, Rosenfeld said.  Palestinians and international activists in Lebanon are
planning to demonstrate today at the Israeli border, the Haaretz
daily said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
