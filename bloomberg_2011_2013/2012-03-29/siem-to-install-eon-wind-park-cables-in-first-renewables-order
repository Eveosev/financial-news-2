Siem Offshore Inc. (SIOFF) , a Norwegian
offshore services company, will install grid cables at an  EON AG (EOAN) 
wind farm in the  North Sea  after winning its first renewable-
energy contract, valued at about $60 million.  Submarine cables will connect turbines at the Amrumbank
West wind farm, Siem said today in a website  statement . The
contract includes a service agreement, according to the
Kristiansand-based company.  EONâ€™s Climate & Renewables Central Europe unit is
developing the project in the German Bight section of the North
Sea. The wind farm will have 80 turbines, each with a capacity
of 3.6 megawatts, connected with almost 86 kilometers (53 miles)
of cable, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
