Jeremy Lin had lunch this week with
the former ESPN editor who was fired for publishing a headline
about the  New York Knicks ’ guard that included a racially
insensitive word, the New York Daily News  said .  Lin and 28-year-old Connecticut resident Anthony Federico
met in a Manhattan restaurant on March 27 and discussed their
mutual interest in basketball and the Christian faith, according
to the newspaper.  Federico’s headline after a Knicks loss, which contains a
word sometimes used as a slur toward those of Chinese ancestry,
appeared on ESPN’s mobile website for 35 minutes on Feb. 18
before it was removed. Federico was fired the following day.  Lin is the first Chinese- or Taiwanese-American to play in
the  National Basketball Association .  A family member of Lin’s contacted the former editor in
February, Federico told the Daily News. He said that he and Lin
discussed the headline for less than three minutes, choosing
instead to talk about religion and the Knicks.  Federico and Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN apologized publicly
after the headline was removed. Lin told reporters at the time
that he accepted the apology and that he didn’t think it was
intentional.  Lin, 23, has missed the Knicks’ last two games with a left
knee injury. He is averaging 14.6 points and 6.1 assists this
season, his first in  New York . The Knicks are 26-25.  The Knicks play the Hawks in Atlanta tomorrow night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
