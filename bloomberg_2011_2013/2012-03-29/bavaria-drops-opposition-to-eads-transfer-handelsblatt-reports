The German state of Bavaria has
dropped its opposition to a  European Aeronautic Defence and
Space  Co. plan to move part of its headquarters to Toulouse,
France from Ottobrunn, close to Munich, Handelsblatt reported.  Horst Seehofer , the state’s prime minister, said he would
be “pleased” if EADS were to invest in jobs and research and
development in Bavaria, the newspaper reported, citing an
interview with the politician.  EADS Chief Executive Officer designate  Tom Enders  has
agreed to that, Handelsblatt reported in an e-mailed summary of
an article to be published tomorrow, without specifying where it
got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
