Honduran prisoners wielding knives
and guns rioted in a maximum security jail, leaving at least 13
inmates dead, the  Red Cross  said.  The head of one inmate was severed and thrown at
firefighters who rushed to put out a fire set in the kitchen of
a jail in San Pedro Sula, said Haira Carcamo, a spokeswoman for
the Red Cross. The cause of death for the other 12 victims is
still under investigation, Carcamo said in a phone interview
today from Puerto Cortes. It’s believed the riot was started by
gang members fighting for control of the prison, she said.  Last month, 366 inmates died after a blaze swept through a
penitentiary in the Honduran city of Comayagua, the world’s
worst prison fire in a century.  -- Editor: Jonathan Roeder  To contact the reporters on this story:
