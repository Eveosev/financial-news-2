The  City of London  Corporation,
which governs the square-mile financial district surrounding the
 Bank of England , agreed to support a  campaign  to pay a higher
minimum wage to workers in the British capital.  The  London living wage  is 8.30 pounds ($13.20) an hour,
compared with the national minimum wage of 6.08 pounds. The City
of London, based in the six century-old Guildhall, will
negotiate the living wage with service providers on a case-by-
case basis, rather than require it for a contract to be granted.  “We support the London living wage,” Stuart Fraser, the
City of London policy chairman, said in an interview yesterday.
“We were reluctant a little bit.”  Citizens U.K., a London-based community organizing group,
has campaigned since 2009 for the City of London to adopt the
policy. It is supported by London Mayor  Boris Johnson , whose
government sets the rate. More than 100 organizations back the
London living wage, including  Barclays Plc (BARC) , accounting firm KPMG
and law firm Allen & Overy LLP.  “It’s a partial victory and a positive step in the right
direction,” said Neil Jameson, director of Citizens U.K. “The
next stage is to set this as an obligation in their procurement
policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
