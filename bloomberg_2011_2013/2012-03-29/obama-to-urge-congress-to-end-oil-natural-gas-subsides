President  Barack Obama  will renew a
call to Congress today to end oil and natural gas subsidies of
$4 billion a year and divert those tax dollars to clean-energy
fuels.  Obama’s remarks in the White House  Rose Garden  are
scheduled for 10:45 a.m. Washington time.  Obama will urge members of Congress to side with the
American people instead of oil and gas companies making record
profits, according to an administration official, who spoke
anonymously in order to preview Obama’s remarks.  The president will call it a simple choice, according to an
e-mail from the official highlighting Obama’s prepared remarks.
The three largest U.S. oil companies in 2011 made a combined
profit of more than $80 billion, or more than $200 million per
day, according to the e-mail.  The Senate plans to vote today on repealing the tax breaks.
In his Feb. 13 budget, Obama said existing tax breaks for the
oil and natural gas companies amount to an unwarranted
“preference” of these industries over others.  Ending such breaks would reduce the  deficit  by $41 billion
over a decade, the budget said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
