U.S. stocks trimmed losses as
investors speculated a three-day retreat in equities was
overdone and prepared for the final day of the biggest first-
quarter rally since 1998.  Caterpillar Inc., Alcoa Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. climbed more
than 1 percent for the biggest gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average , which erased most of a 94-point decline. Bank of
America Corp., American Express Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. led
losses in the 30-stock average.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.3 percent at
1,400.78 at 3:31 p.m. in  New York  after tumbling as much as 1
percent earlier. The Dow fell 11.58 points to 13,114.63,
reversing a drop of as much as 94 points.  Earlier declines came after after S&P said  Greece  may have
to restructure its debt again.  The S&P 500 will likely remain stuck in the 500-point range
where it’s been four-fifths of the time since 2000 until the
 Federal Reserve  allows interest rates to rise, according to
Piper Jaffray Cos.  The benchmark measure fell in the previous two days after
reaching 1,416.51, the highest level since May 2008 and 9.5
percent below its record high of 1,565.15 from 2007. The index
has traded between 1,000 and 1,500 for about 80 percent of the
time since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Equity gains stalled in the past 12 years as the economy
suffered from the bursting of bubbles in technology and real
estate, forcing the central bank to cut its benchmark  interest
rate  to near zero from 6.5 percent to spur growth. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  has pledged to keep borrowing costs low through
at least late 2014.  “The  S&P 500  is approaching the upper end of the secular
trading range,” Craig W. Johnson, a Minneapolis-based technical
market strategist with Piper Jaffray, wrote in a note yesterday.
“This resistance will likely remain intact until 2014-2015, and
will correspond with a secular change in bond yields.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
