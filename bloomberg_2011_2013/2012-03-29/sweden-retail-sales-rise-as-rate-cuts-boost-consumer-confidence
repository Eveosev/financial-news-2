Swedish  retail sales  surged more
than estimated in February after the central bank cut borrowing
costs to revive economic growth.  Sales rose an annual 3.4 percent last month and climbed a
 monthly  1.2 percent, Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said
today. The  median estimate  in a survey of eight economists by
Bloomberg was for a 1.6 percent annual increase.  Swedish  consumer confidence  improved more than predicted in
March to a seven-month high, the National Institute of  Economic
Research  said yesterday. The central bank on Feb. 16 cut its
 benchmark interest rate  a quarter of a percentage point for a
second meeting to 1.5 percent to prevent a recession.  The Riksbank will stick to its forecast to keep the rate
unchanged this year as  growth  will pick up in the second half as
domestic consumption will contribute more to the recovery
compared with exports than in previous recoveries, NIER said.  Swedenâ€™s economy, which contracted last quarter as it
relies on exports mainly to debt-stricken  Europe  for about half
of its output, will expand 0.4 percent this year and 2.5 percent
in 2013, NIER predicted.  Unemployment (SWUERATE)  will peak at an average
7.7 percent in 2012, up from 7.5 percent last year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
