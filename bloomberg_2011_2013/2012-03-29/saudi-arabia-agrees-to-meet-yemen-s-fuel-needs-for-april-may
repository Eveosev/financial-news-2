Saudi Arabia  agreed to meet Yemen’s
entire domestic fuel needs for April and May.  Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, will receive
500,000 metric tons of oil products worth $600 million in each
of the months, state news agency Saba reported this week. Saudi
Arabia will supply fuels including gasoline and diesel free of
charge, Naser Shaif, a spokesman for Aden Oil Refinery Co., said
today.  Yemen is producing crude at about half of its 250,000
barrel-a-day capacity and refineries aren’t receiving supply,
Oil Minister Hisham Sharaf said in an interview last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
