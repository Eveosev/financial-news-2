Turkish prosecutors presented faked
evidence of an alleged coup plot to overthrow Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government, Vatan  reported , citing expert
findings submitted to court.  Computer documents presented during the trial could not
have been created on the dates alleged by the prosecution, an
expert panel from Istanbul’s Yildiz Technical University said,
confirming a report prepared by Chelsea, Massachusetts-based
Arsenal Consulting on behalf of the defendants, Vatan said.  At least 80 documents dated 2003 had “xml” file
extensions, which didn’t exist until 2007, and many of them were
written in the Calibri font, which was developed in 2004 and not
made available until 2007, the university report found,
according to Vatan. Other inconsistencies include personnel
lists from 2003 that reflected officers’ ranks in 2007, it said.  More than 150 soldiers including retired General Cetin
Dogan are charged with planning to trigger civil unrest and
remove Erdogan’s party from power after it won elections in
November 2002. Dogan and other suspects deny the charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
