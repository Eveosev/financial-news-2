Kazakhstan â€™s central bank cut its
refinancing rate to a record low after inflation eased last
month to the slowest pace since May 1999.  The National Bank of Kazakhstan reduced the benchmark rate
by half a percentage point to 6.5 percent, effective April 2,
the Almaty-based regulator said in a  statement  on its website
today. Consumer  prices  rose 4.7 percent last month from a year
earlier, after a 5.9 percent increase in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
