European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another fell to the lowest in eight months, according to
a money-market indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 42 basis
points at 1:32 p.m. in  London , data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That’s the lowest since Aug. 3.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars rose for the second day. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap  was 51 basis points below Euribor from minus 50
yesterday.  The one-year basis swap 44 basis points less than Euribor,
from minus 43 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday
to 777 billion euros ($1 trillion), up from 774 billion euros on
March 27.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.783 percent from 0.787 percent.
One-week Euribor fell to 0.317 percent from 0.320 percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans fell to 0.468 percent from 0.470 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
