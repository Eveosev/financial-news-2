Auto sales pushed  Michigan’s (STOMI1) 
economy in January to its highest level in six years, according
to Comerica Bank’s monthly economic activity index.  Michigan ’s index rose to 98 from December’s 91, the best
improvement among the five states Dallas-based Comerica
monitors, said chief economist Robert Dye. The others are
 California , Texas, Florida and Arizona.  Car sales may continue to fuel the upswing. A “huge”
pent-up demand for new vehicles pushed February sales to a level
that implies an annual rate of 15.1 million vehicles, Dye said.
That’s up from 13.5 million in December.  Michigan’s February  unemployment rate  dropped to 8.8
percent, the first time it’s fallen been below 9 percent since
September 2008, Dye said. The U.S. unemployment rate in February
was 8.3 percent.  He said manufacturing, led by the  auto industry , is fueling
a national recovery.  “We’re starting to see an economy that’s moving past the
faltering recovery we’ve had the last couple years,” Dye said
in a telephone interview from  Dallas . “I hope by the end of
2012 there will be a strong consensus that we’re in a self-
sustaining economic expansion.”  Michigan added 62,000 jobs since February 2011, a 1.5
percent increase, according  to the state Department of
Technology, Management and Budget.  It showed the second-best economic recovery among states,
behind  North Dakota , by the third quarter of 2011, according to
the Bloomberg Economic Evaluation of States index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
