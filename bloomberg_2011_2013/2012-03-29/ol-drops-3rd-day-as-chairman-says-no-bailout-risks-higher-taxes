Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, fell for a third day, extending the stock’s decline
this month.  The shares dropped 0.6 percent to 18,550 forint by the
close in Budapest. That brings the monthly decline to 0.8
percent after a 0.5 percent retreat in February. Oil declined as
France said governments are moving closer to an agreement on a
release of barrels from emergency stockpiles to curb price gains
and U.S. equities declined.  Hungary failing to obtain a bailout would raise the risk of
the government extending special industry taxes, Zsolt Hernadi,
Mol’s chairman, said in a March 27 interview at the company’s
Budapest headquarters.  “That is undoubtedly a risk factor,” Attila Vago, an
analyst at Budapest-based broker Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt., said
of the potential extension of industry taxes in the absence of
an International Monetary Fund loan. Vago added that the trading
volume on Mol shares was low today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
