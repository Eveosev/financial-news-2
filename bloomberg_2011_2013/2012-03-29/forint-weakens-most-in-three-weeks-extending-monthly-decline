The forint depreciated the most in
more than three weeks against the euro, extending its monthly
decline.  The forint weakened 1.1 percent to 296.2 per euro by 5:04
p.m. in Budapest, the biggest slump on a closing basis since
March 5 and heading for a 2.7 percent slump in March.  European stocks fell for a third day as  Standard & Poor’s 
said Greece may have to restructure its debt again and lower-
than-forecast profits fueled concern  China ’s growth is slowing.  “It’s simply a risk-off mode on European Union concerns,
and as usual we are the black sheep in the region,” Akos Ruzsonyi, a Budapest-based currency trader at Commerzbank AG,
wrote in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg today.  Hungarian assets have weakened in the past month on concern
the country’s talks on a bailout from the  International Monetary
Fund  and the European Union will face further delays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
