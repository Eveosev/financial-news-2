     (Corrects reference to commercial banks in last paragraph.)  Mali and members of the junta that
took power in Mali last week face economic sanctions from the
Economic Community of West African States if the army doesn’t
hand over power by April 2  The commission will deny Mali access to the ports of the
region if the junta doesn’t leave power by the deadline, said
Desire Kadre Ouedraogo, president of the group.  Mali accounts at the group’s central bank in Dakar would
also be frozen and accounts of the government in commercial
banks would lose access to cash supplied by the central bank,
Ouedraogo said. The commission would also freeze assets of the
members of junta and their associates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
