The sugar cane crop in Brazil’s
Center South, the main producing region of the world’s largest
grower, is forecast to be 500 million metric tons in 2012-13,
according to  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)   That’s down from the bank’s earlier estimate of 520 millon
tons and little changed from the 494 million tons reaped in
2011-12, according to a report e-mailed today. Dry weather in
the Center South has reduced the prospects for a meaningful
recovery, London-based analyst  Kona Haque  said in the report.  The cane crop in the Center South region fell for the first
time in a decade in 2011-12 after drought, frost and flowering
cut yields, according to industry group Unica.  Weather data shows that producing areas such as  Sao Paulo ,
parts of  Minas Gerais  and Aracatuba received less than 50
percent of the average amount of rainfall in February and March
this year at a crucial time for cane development, according to
the report.  “In the southern region of Mato Grosso do Sul and the
Maringa region of Parana state, low rainfall has impacted yield
output, causing, in some cases, irreparable damage to the cane
crop,” Haque said, adding a drier-than-normal April has been
forecast.  Most sugar mills in the country are expected to start
crushing by late-April, later than normal in the month.  “For the new season, we are expecting mills to continue to
favor sugar production over ethanol” with the former currently
remunerating some 25 percent more in returns, Haque said. Mills
in the country use the raw material to produce either sweetener
or ethanol.  Sugar Rally  “The concerns over the Brazilian crop are causing the New
York front month May 2012 contract to rally ahead of forward
contracts,” according to the report. “The  risk premium 
associated with the Brazilian crop under-performing again saw
speculators increase their net-long position on ICE last week by
more than 30,326 contracts.”  Price rallies may be capped at 26 to 27 cents a pound, with
the most bullish contract being May 2012, when supplies will be
the tightest, the bank said. It sees the bottom of the market at
21 to 22 cents in the third quarter, according to the report.  “The outlook for prices for the 2012-13 October to
September season are slightly better, as production growth will
likely slow, causing the surplus to shrink further,” the bank
said.  The global sugar surplus is seen at 5.5 million tons for
the October 2011 to September 2012 year, down from a previous
forecast of 7.9 million tons, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
