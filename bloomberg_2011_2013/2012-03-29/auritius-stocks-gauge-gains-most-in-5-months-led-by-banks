Mauritius stocks advanced the most
in six months, boosted by improved earnings from  Terra Mauricia
Ltd (TERA)  and  Swan Insurance Co. (SWAN)   The 38-member  SEMDEX (SEMDEX)  index rose 1.2 percent, the biggest
gain since Sept. 28, to 1,793.78 by the close in  Port Louis , the
highest value in a month. The increase added 1.83 billion rupees
($63.2 million) to the gauge’s market value.  Terra Mauricia, a company with interests in sugar
production and energy, said after the market closed yesterday
that 2011 net income more than doubled to 582.7 million rupees.
The shares gained 6.4 percent to 41.4 rupees. Swan Insurance
said today full-year profit increased 6.4 percent to 195.85
million rupees. The stock climbed 0.7 percent to 310 rupees.  “The positive results from Terra and Swan have most
probably given a boost to the market today,” Kishen Nadassen, a
senior research analyst at CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a
phone interview. It has generated “an accrued interest for bank
stocks,” he said.  State Bank of Mauritius Ltd , the second-biggest lender by
market value, gained as much as 2.5 percent, and closed 1.9
percent higher at 81.5 rupees, the strongest since Feb. 22.
 Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the largest lender, rose 0.6 percent
to 163 rupees.  The two banks have a 40 percent weighting on the SEMDEX
index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
