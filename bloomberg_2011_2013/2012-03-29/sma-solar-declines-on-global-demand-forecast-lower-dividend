SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) ,  Germany ’s
biggest solar-power company by market value, fell the most in
almost four weeks after it said global installations may decline
this year and proposed a lower dividend.  The stock dropped as much as 9 percent in Frankfurt
trading, the most since March 2, and was down 7.8 percent to
34.50 euros at 12:01 p.m. German time. The shares have declined
20 percent this year.  SMA, the world’s biggest supplier of inverters, expects
“only” moderate growth in the photovoltaic market this year
and sees a possible decline. New capacity is likely to be 20 to
26 gigawatts compared with 23 gigawatts last year, Chief
Executive Pierre-Pascal Urbon said today on a conference call.
Inverters convert electricity from panels for use in the grid.  In a statement, SMA confirmed its full-year results with a
54 percent drop in operating profit to 240 million euros ($319
million) and maintained its guidance for 2012. It proposed a
1.30-euro per share dividend compared with 3 euros last time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
