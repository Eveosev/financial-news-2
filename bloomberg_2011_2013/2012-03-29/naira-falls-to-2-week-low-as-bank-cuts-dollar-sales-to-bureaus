The naira depreciated to the lowest
in more than two weeks against the dollar on accumulated demand
for the U.S. currency following the  central bank ’s decision to
reduce sales to foreign-exchange bureaus.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated
0.2 percent to 157.905 per dollar as of 12.15 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its weakest since March 13, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria on March 18 cut dollar sales to
each bureau by 25 percent to $75,000 dollars per week, without
giving a reason. The regulator raised the weekly sales to
$100,000 in August in an attempt to reduce demand pressure and
stabilize the naira.  “There is demand pressure at the  interbank market  from
bureau de change after the central bank cut sales to
operators,” Abubakar Muhammed, chief executive of Lagos-based
Forward Marketing Communications Bureau De Change, said in a
phone interview. “Pressure from the accumulated demand is
exposing the naira to depreciation.”  Nigeria  sold $150 million at a foreign-currency auction
yesterday, with the marginal rate gaining by less than 0.1
percent to 156.01 per dollar, the central bank said.  The regulator left its key  interest rate  unchanged at 12
percent for a third consecutive meeting on March 20 to curb
inflation and stabilize the local currency.  Nigeria sold domestic bonds due 2019 at a yield of 15.30
percent yesterday, 86 basis points lower than the 16.16 percent
at a previous auction on Feb. 29, the Abuja-based debt
management agency said today. The yield on the country’s $500
million of dollar bonds due 2021 fell five basis points to 5.315
percent.  Ghana’s cedi appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.7717 per dollar
in Accra, the capital.
