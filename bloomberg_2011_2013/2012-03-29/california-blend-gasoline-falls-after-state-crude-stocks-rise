California-blend gasoline fell
after a report said refinery oil stockpiles jumped last week.  Refineries had 16.6 million barrels of crude on hand last
week, 9.4 percent more than the week ended March 16, the state
Energy Commission said yesterday.  Tesoro (TSO)  Corp. said last week
itâ€™s Golden Eagle refinery in Martinez,  California , was back at
normal rates following a maintenance turnaround, signaling an
increase in fuel production this week.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in  Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)  fell
5.25 cents to a discount of 7.25 cents a gallon against gasoline
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P) 
dropped 5.75 cents to a 9.75 cent discount to futures.  CARB diesel in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD)  gained 1.75 cents to a 16.75
cent-a-gallon premium against Nymex heating oil futures. The
same fuel in  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  rose 1 cent to a 14 cent premium
versus futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon , fell
0.25 cent to a 6.5 cent premium to gasoline futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
