Jordan should promote export
industries and manufacture goods domestically to substitute for
imports in order to reduce a trade deficit that widened to 41
percent of gross domestic product in 2011,  Banque Audi sal- Audi
Saradar Group  said.  The gap widened by 20 percent to $11.6 billion in 2011,
according to a report by the Beirut-based bank published today.
It was 36 percent of GDP in 2010, it said.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
relies on foreign investment and grants to support its budget
and current-account deficits. The government has increased
public salaries and subsidies since pro-reform protests broke
out last year as part of the regional turmoil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
