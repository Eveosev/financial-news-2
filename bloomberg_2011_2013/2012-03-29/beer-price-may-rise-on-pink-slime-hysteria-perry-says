U.S. consumers may soon be paying
more for beef because of misinformation about the safety of
lean, finely textured beef that has been dubbed “pink slime”
by food activists,  Texas  Governor Rick Perry said.  Retailers who stop using the product at a time when the
size of the Texas herd of beef cattle is at an all-time low
because of the state’s record drought is a “formula for a
fairly significant price hike in beef for no valid reason,”
Perry said today during a press conference in South Sioux City,
Nebraska. The product is made of beef trim and treated with
ammonium hydroxide to kill pathogens.  Beef Products Inc. has temporarily suspended output of the
product at three plants because of consumer concerns. U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said yesterday that the meat
is safe to eat.  Beef is a $7.5 billion industry in Texas, according to
Perry, who spoke at the press conference with state leaders
including governors Terry Branstad of  Iowa  and  Sam Brownback  of
 Kansas . Eldon and Regina Roth, the co-founders of Beef Products,
were also in attendance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
