ZTE Corp. (763) ,  China ’s second-largest
maker of phone equipment, is seeking to improve margins for
handsets this year after profitability for the business declined
in 2011.  ZTE will work on product innovation and marketing of its
smartphones to boost profitability, Chief Executive Officer Shi Lirong told reporters in Hong Kong today. The Shenzhen, southern
China-based company plans to restore margins for the handset
business to 2010 levels, he said, without specifying figures.  Sales of cheaper smartphones such as the V880 Blade helped
ZTE to post a 23 percent gain in 2011 revenue amid competition
from rivals including Huawei Technologies Co. The low-cost
strategy partly contributed to a 37 percent decline in full-year
profit for the company, which generates most of its earnings
from selling telecommunication networks to carriers.  “There was a transition in the handset market toward
smartphones last year, and we were adjusting our business and
trying to grapple with issues such as the supply chain,” Shi
said. “Our handset revenue grew very fast, but our gross profit
margin dropped.”  ZTE rose 3 percent to HK$20.65 as of 2:38 p.m. in  Hong Kong 
trading, after gaining as much as 8.5 percent. The shares have
declined 15 percent this year. The company’s  Shenzhen-traded
stock (000063)  advanced 1.3 percent to 16.29 yuan.  ZTE’s terminals division posted a gross profit margin, or
the percentage of sales left after deducting production costs,
of 15.2 percent in 2011, narrowing 3.8 percentage points from a
year earlier. The company doesn’t break out margins for
handsets, which is part of the business along with tablet
computers and other portable devices.  Net income  fell to 2.06 billion yuan ($327 million) from a
restated 3.25 billion yuan in 2010, ZTE reported yesterday. That
missed the 2.78 billion yuan average of 10 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
