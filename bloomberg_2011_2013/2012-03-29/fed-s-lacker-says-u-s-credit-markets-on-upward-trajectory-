Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said U.S. credit markets have started
to improve three years after the last U.S. recession.  “We are still on a journey in how we regulate and
understand” debt instruments, Lacker said today at a conference
at the Richmond Fed’s branch in Charlotte,  North Carolina .  “Credit markets have obviously taken a hit in the last
couple years” and now “seem on an upward trajectory,” Lacker
said. He plans to deliver a speech in Charlotte at 6:45 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
