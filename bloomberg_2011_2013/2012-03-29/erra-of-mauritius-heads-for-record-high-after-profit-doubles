Terra Mauricia Ltd. (TERA) , a Mauritian
company with interests in specialty sugars production and
energy, headed for a record high after announcing that 2011
profit more than doubled.  The  stock  gained 2.6 percent to 40 rupees, its highest
since Jan. 6 after its new listing under the investment segment
of  Stock Exchange of Mauritius , by 10:55 a.m. in Port Louis, the
capital. The company previously traded as Harel Freres Ltd.  “It will probably close at a new all-time high today,”
Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at  AXYS Stockbroking Ltd. ,
which rates the stock as a buy, said in a phone interview.  Terra Mauricia announced after the market closed yesterday
that net income for the year through December rose to 582.7
million rupees ($20.1 million) from 250.4 million rupees a year
earlier, as its sugar division reversed losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
