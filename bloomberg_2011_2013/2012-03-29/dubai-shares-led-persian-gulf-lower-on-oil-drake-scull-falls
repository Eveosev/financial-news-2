most in three weeks, leading declines in Persian Gulf shares, as
oil dropped and U.S. government data showed orders placed with
factories for durable goods missed economists’ estimates.  Islamic Arab Insurance Co. (SALAMA) , an insurance provider, slumped
the most since March 2009.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the biggest
publicly traded construction company in the United Arab
Emirates, declined the most since March 18. The  DFM General

emirate, trimming this year’s rally to 22 percent. Abu Dhabi’s

continuation of Dubai momentum,” said  Julian Bruce , the Dubai-
based director of institutional sales trading at EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE. “We expect overall enthusiasm to wane going into
the weekend.”  Oil traded near the lowest close in almost a week in  New

the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:28 p.m. in Dubai. The Gulf
