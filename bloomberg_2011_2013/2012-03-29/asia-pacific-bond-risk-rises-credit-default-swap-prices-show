The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 2.5 basis points to 155 basis
points as of 8:31 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge is set for the highest close since March 12,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index advanced 2.5 basis points to
153 as of 9:40 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
measure is poised for the highest close since March 26,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index increased 2 basis points
to 145 basis points as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney,  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
