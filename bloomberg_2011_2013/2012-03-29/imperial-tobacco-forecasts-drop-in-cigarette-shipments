Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT) ,
 Europe ’s second-biggest tobacco company, expects first-half
cigarette volume to fall, even as sales and profit increased in
the second quarter.  Selling quantities for the six months ending March 31 will
decline about 4 percent, hurt by a 7 percent drop in the fiscal
first quarter, the Bristol, England-based company said today in
a statement. Revenue will rise about 3 percent at constant
currency-exchange rates, Imperial said. Financial performance
remains in line with company forecasts, it said.  Tobacco companies are relying on growth in emerging markets
and from new products to offset declining consumption in western
Europe and  North America . In the U.K., where Imperial is the
biggest seller of cigarettes, the tobacco duty rose by 37 pence
on March 21.  First-half shipments of Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes and
West cigarettes, as well as sales of Cuban cigars, saw
“continued success,” the company said.  Imperial has gained 3.5 percent in London trading this
year, compared with a 4.1 percent increase in shares of  British
American Tobacco Plc. (BATS)  Imperial  plans  to release first-half
earnings details on May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
