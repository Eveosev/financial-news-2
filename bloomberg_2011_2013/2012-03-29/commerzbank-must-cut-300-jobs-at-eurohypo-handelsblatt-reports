The European Union ordered
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  to cut more than 300 of the 1,200 jobs at its
Eurohypo public-finance and commercial-property unit, under
reorganization measures related to a bailout,  Handelsblatt 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The exact number of job cuts required has yet to be
decided, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
