England  reached 177-4 as it chases
what would be a team-record 340 to win the series-opening
cricket Test against Sri Lanka in Galle.  England, which resumed at 111-2 on day four, lost Kevin
Pietersen and Ian Bell in the morning session to the spin
bowling of Suraj Randiv and Rangana Herath.  Jonathan Trott  added
36 runs to his overnight score to be 76 not out at the interval,
with Matt Prior on 15.  Top-ranked England has 60 overs left today and all day
tomorrow to get the remaining 163 runs needed for the victory.
Its previous highest fourth-innings total to win a Test was 332
in 1928 against Australia in Melbourne.  Sri Lanka  is rated the 2-5 favorite to get the six wickets
it needs to win the match by U.K. bookmaker William Hill, which
rates England as the 2-1 outsider.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
