Greece  may need a special currency
arrangement within the euro region to adjust its economy, Polish
central bank Governor Marek Belka told  Financial Times
Deutschland  in an interview.  “I’m not advocating forcing Greece out of the euro,”
Belka told the German newspaper. “But for internal purposes,
one could think about a payment instrument that would be used
within the country, especially by the public sector.”  Savings collected before the introduction of the system
would be managed in euros, while wages and salaries would be
paid out in a devalued currency, Belka said. Such an “indirect
devaluation” could improve the competitiveness of the  Greek
economy , while relying on lowering prices and wages is a
“hopeless” strategy, he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
