German plant and machinery orders
declined for a fourth month in February, driven by a drop in
foreign demand, the VDMA machine-makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 16 percent from a year
earlier after declining an annual 6 percent in January, the
Frankfurt-based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today.
Domestic orders fell 12 percent, while export orders dropped 18
percent. In the three months through February, orders declined
11 percent compared to the same period a year ago.  “The high rates of decline still go back to an extremely
high previous-year level,” VDMA chief economist  Ralph Wiechers 
said in the statement. “The impression that order intake
stabilized at the current level has firmed in February.”  In February 2011, machinery orders increased 38 percent
from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
