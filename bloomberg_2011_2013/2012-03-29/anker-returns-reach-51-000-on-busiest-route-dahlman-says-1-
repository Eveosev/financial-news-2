Earnings for the largest  oil
tankers  carrying Middle East crude to Asia, the industry’s
busiest trade route, rose about 15 percent to $51,000 a day,
according to Dahlman Rose & Co.  Daily returns on the voyage last surpassed $50,000 in about
June 2010,  Omar Nokta , a New York-based analyst at the
investment bank, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Shipping costs on the route for very large crude carriers
averaged $25,000 daily in January and February and are gaining
ahead of European Union sanctions targeting Iran’s crude exports
that take effect July 1, he said. Each VLCC can hold 2 million
barrels of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
