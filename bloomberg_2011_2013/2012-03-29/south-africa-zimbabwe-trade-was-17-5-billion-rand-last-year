Trade between  Zimbabwe  and  South
Africa  was worth 17.5 billion rand ($2.3 billion) in 2011, South
Africa’s Deputy Trade Minister Elizabeth Thabethe said.  Thabethe didn’t give data for previous years of trade
between the neighboring countries when speaking to reporters in
Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second-largest city, today. Zimbabwe
imported goods, mainly minerals and fuel, worth 14.5 billion
rand from South Africa in 2011 while exports to South Africa
amounted to 2.9 billion rand.  Thabethe, who is accompanying a delegation of 49 South
African companies visiting Zimbabwe, said her country has
invested about 10.9 billion rand in its neighbor since 2003.  Zimbabwe has the world’s second-largest platinum and chrome
reserves after South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
