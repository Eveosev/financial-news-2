Athletic Bilbao  rallied to beat
Schalke 4-2 in their Europa League quarterfinal opener, as
Atletico Madrid, AZ Alkmaar and Sporting Lisbon also won.  Three goals in the final 17 minutes last night gave Bilbao
the away victory. Atletico used a last-minute goal to beat
Hannover 2-1, while AZ beat Valencia and Sporting defeated
Metalist Kharkiv by the same score.  Bilbao, Hannover, Valencia and Metalist will host the
return matches in the two-game series on April 5.  Bilbao’s  Fernando Llorente  opened the scoring in Germany in
the first half with  Raul Gonzalez  tying the game less than a
minute later.  Raul put Schalke in front the 60th minute with his record-
extending 76th goal in European competition before Llorente
scored with a header in 73rd minute. Oscar De Marcos gave Bilbao
the lead with nine minutes left and Iker Muniain clinched the
victory in stoppage time.  Eduardo Salvio’s 89th-minute goal gave Atletico, the
bookmakers’ co-favorite with Valencia to win Europe’s second-
tier club competition, the victory. Radamel Falcao also scored
for Atletico and Mame Biram Diouf had the Hannover goal.  A 79th-minute goal from Maarten Martens lifted AZ past
Valencia.  Brett Holman  scored for the Dutch league leader in
first-half stoppage time and Valencia’s Mehmet Topal tied the
score six minutes after the break.  Goals from Marat Izmailov and Emiliano Insua in the second
half gave Sporting a 2-0 lead in Lisbon before Metalist’s
Cleiton Xavier scored a consolation penalty in stoppage time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
