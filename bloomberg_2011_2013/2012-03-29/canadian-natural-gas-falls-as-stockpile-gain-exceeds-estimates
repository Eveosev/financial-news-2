Canadian natural gas fell after a
U.S. report that stockpiles of the fuel rose more than analysts
estimated.  Alberta  gas declined 3.9 percent. U.S. stocks of the fuel
rose 57 billion cubic feet to 2.437 trillion last week,
according to the  Energy Department (DOENUSCH) . Analysts expected a gain of
48 billion, the median of estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  “It was a pretty big number,” said  Kyle Cooper , director
of research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “There’s still plenty
of supply.”  Alberta gas for April delivery fell 6.5 cents to $1.6125 a
gigajoule ($1.54 per million British thermal units) as of 12:20
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. It was
the lowest level for the April near-month contract since it
started trading in 2000.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 44 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 11.1 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $2.171 per million
Btu as of 11:56 a.m.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17 billion cubic
feet, 185 million above target.  Pipeline Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.97 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.3 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 953 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.7 billion cubic feet today, or 64 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.01
billion cubic feet at 10:35 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
