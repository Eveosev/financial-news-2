Rihanna, the Barbados-born
recording artist, is scheduled to headline at the Robin Hood
Foundation benefit on May 14. Lady Gaga last year helped the
organization raise $47.4 million.  Starbucks (SBUX)  Chief Executive Howard Schultz, NBC Universal CEO
Stephen Burke and New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning are
benefit co-chairmen, joined by their wives, Sheri Schultz,
Gretchen Burke and Abby Manning.  The organization fights poverty in New York City by funding
and providing technical assistance to about 200 nonprofits.  Last year, the event drew 4,000 guests to the Jacob K.
Javits Convention Center. The money the foundation raises at the
event goes directly to grantees.  The board, led by Lee S. Ainslie III, managing partner at
Maverick Capital Management, underwrites 100 percent of the
foundation’s administrative costs. Board members include  David
Einhorn  of  Greenlight Capital (GLRE)  Re Ltd. and Steve A. Cohen of SAC
Capital Advisors LP.  The  invitation , which has a  New York City  subway theme,
went out this week. NBC anchor Brian Williams and “Saturday
Night Live” star Seth Meyers are listed as hosts.  Last year’s event sold out by mid-April.  Editors: Jeffrey Burke, Mark Beech.  To contact the writer on this story:
