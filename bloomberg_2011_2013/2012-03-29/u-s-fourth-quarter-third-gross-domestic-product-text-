Following is the text of the
Gross Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services
produced by labor and property located in the  United States  -- increased
at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011
(that is, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter), according to the
“third” estimate released by the  Bureau of Economic Analysis .  In the
third quarter, real GDP increased 1.8 percent.  The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source
data than were available for the “second” estimate issued last month.  In
the second estimate, the increase in real GDP was also 3.0
percent.  The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected
positive contributions from private inventory investment, personal
consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, exports,
and residential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative
contributions from federal  government spending  and state and local
government spending.  Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation
of GDP, increased.  The acceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily
reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and accelerations in
PCE and in residential fixed investment that were partly offset
by a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment, a downturn in
federal government spending, an acceleration in imports, and a
deceleration in exports.  Motor vehicle output added 0.47 percentage point to the fourth-
quarter change in real GDP after adding 0.12 percentage point to the
third-quarter change.  Final sales of computers added 0.12
percentage point to the fourth-quarter change in real GDP after adding
0.22 percentage point to the third-quarter change.  This news release is available on BEA’s Web site along with the
Technical Note and Highlights related to this release.  For information on
revisions, see “Revisions to GDP, GDI, and Their Major
Components.”  The  price index  for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices
paid by U.S. residents, increased 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the
same increase as in the second estimate; this index
increased 2.0 percent in the third quarter.  Excluding food and energy
prices, the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.2 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 1.8 percent
in the third.  Real personal consumption expenditures increased 2.1 percent in the
fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 1.7 percent in the third.
Durable goods increased 16.1 percent, compared with an
increase of 5.7 percent.  Nondurable goods increased 0.8 percent, in
contrast to a decrease of 0.5 percent.  Services increased 0.4 percent,
compared with an increase of 1.9 percent.  Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 5.2 percent, compared
with an increase of 15.7 percent.  Nonresidential structures decreased 0.9
percent, in contrast to an increase of 14.4 percent.
Equipment and software increased 7.5 percent, compared with an increase of
16.2 percent.  Real residential fixed investment increased 11.6 percent,
compared with an increase of 1.3 percent.  Real exports of goods and services increased 2.7 percent in the
fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 4.7 percent in the third.
Real imports of goods and services increased 3.7 percent, compared
with an increase of 1.2 percent.  Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross
investment decreased 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter, in contrast to an
increase of 2.1 percent in the third.  National defense decreased
12.1 percent, in contrast to an increase of 5.0 percent.  Nondefense
increased 4.5 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 3.8 percent.  Real
state and local government consumption expenditures and gross
investment decreased 2.2 percent, compared with a decrease of 1.6 percent.  The change in real private inventories added 1.81 percentage points
to the fourth-quarter change in real GDP, after subtracting 1.35
percentage points from the third-quarter change.  Private businesses
increased inventories $52.2 billion in the fourth quarter, following a
decrease of $2.0 billion in the third quarter and an increase of $39.1
billion in the second.  Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in private
inventories -- increased 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with
an increase of 3.2 percent in the third.  Gross domestic purchases  Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of goods and
services wherever produced -- increased 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
compared with an increase of 1.3 percent in the third.  Gross national product  Real gross national product -- the goods and services produced by
the labor and property supplied by U.S. residents -- increased 1.8 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 1.9 percent in the
third.  GNP includes, and GDP excludes, net receipts of income from the
rest of the world, which decreased $36.7 billion in the fourth quarter
after increasing $3.9 billion in the third; in the fourth quarter,
receipts decreased $21.8 billion, and payments increased $15.0 billion.  Current-dollar GDP  Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation’s output of
goods and services -- increased 3.8 percent, or $143.3 billion, in the
fourth quarter to a level of $15,319.4 billion.  In the third quarter,
current-dollar GDP increased 4.4 percent, or $163.3 billion.  Gross domestic income  Real gross domestic income (GDI), which measures the output of the
economy as the costs incurred and the incomes earned in the production of
GDP, increased 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to an increase
of 2.6 percent in the third.  For a given quarter, the estimates of GDP
and GDI may differ for a variety of reasons, including the incorporation
of largely independent source data.
However, over longer time spans, the estimates of GDP and GDI tend to
follow similar patterns of change.  Revisions  The “third” estimate of the fourth-quarter percent change in real GDP
is the same as the “second” estimate issued last month, primarily
reflecting a downward revision to exports that was offset by an
upward revision to nonresidential fixed investment.  Advance Est   Second Est    Third Est  (Percent change from preceding quarter)  Real GDP.........            2.8         3.0          3.0

Gross domestic purchases  price index               0.8         1.1          1.1  2011 GDP  Real GDP increased 1.7 percent in 2011 (that is, from the 2010
annual level to the 2011 annual level), compared with an increase of 3.0
percent in 2010.  The increase in real GDP in 2011 primarily reflected positive
contributions from personal consumption expenditures, exports, and
nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by
negative contributions from state and local government spending, private
inventory investment, and federal government spending.  Imports, which are
a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.  The deceleration in real GDP in 2011 primarily reflected downturns
in private inventory investment and in federal government spending and a
deceleration in exports that were partly offset by a deceleration in
imports and an acceleration in nonresidential fixed investment.  Real GDI increased 2.1 percent in 2011, compared with an increase of
3.6 percent in 2010.  The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.5 percent
in 2011, compared with an increase of 1.5 percent in 2010.  Current-dollar GDP increased 3.9 percent, or $567.5 billion, in 2011
to a level of $15,094.0 billion.  In 2010, current-dollar GDP increased
4.2 percent, or $587.5 billion.  During 2011 (that is, measured from the fourth quarter of 2010 to
the fourth quarter of 2011), real GDP increased 1.6 percent.  Real GDP
increased 3.1 percent during 2010.  The price index for gross
domestic purchases increased 2.6 percent during 2011, compared with an
increase of 1.4 percent during 2010.  Corporate Profits  Profits from current production (corporate profits with inventory
valuation and capital consumption adjustments) increased $16.8 billion in
the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of $32.5 billion in the
third quarter.  Current-production  cash flow  (net cash flow with inventory
valuation adjustment) -- the internal funds available to corporations for
investment -- increased $44.8 billion in the
fourth quarter, compared with an increase of $35.8 billion in the third.  Taxes on corporate income decreased $0.7 billion in the fourth
quarter, compared with a decrease of $9.1 billion in the third.  Profits
after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments
increased $17.5 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase
of $41.6 billion in the third.  Dividends increased $10.3 billion,
compared with an increase of $14.0 billion; current-production
undistributed profits increased $7.2 billion, compared with an increase of
$27.7 billion.  Domestic profits of financial corporations increased $29.9 billion in
the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of $9.2 billion in the third.
Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations increased $28.4 billion in
the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of $17.9 billion in the
third.  In the fourth quarter, real gross value added of nonfinancial
corporations increased, and profits per unit of real value
added increased.  The increase in unit profits reflected decreases in both
unit labor and nonlabor costs that more than offset a decrease in unit
prices.  The rest-of-the-world component of profits decreased $41.5 billion in
the fourth quarter, in contrast to an increase of $5.4 billion in the
third.  This measure is calculated as (1) receipts by U.S. residents of
earnings from their foreign affiliates plus dividends received by U.S.
residents from unaffiliated foreign corporations minus (2) payments by U.S.
affiliates of earnings to their foreign parents plus dividends paid by U.S.
corporations to unaffiliated foreign residents.  The fourth-quarter
decrease was accounted for by a decrease in receipts and an increase in
payments.  Profits before tax with inventory valuation adjustment is the best
available measure of industry profits because estimates of the capital
consumption adjustment by industry do not exist.  This measure
reflects depreciation-accounting practices used for federal income tax
returns.  According to this measure, domestic profits of both financial
and nonfinancial corporations increased.  The increase in
nonfinancial corporations reflected increases in all the major
subaggregates shown, except for “other” nonfinancial.  The largest
increases were in retail trade and in manufacturing.  Within manufacturing,
a large decrease in petroleum and coal products was more than offset by
increases in the remaining
industries shown.  Profits before tax decreased $8.3 billion in the fourth quarter, in
contrast to an increase of $22.3 billion in the third.  The before-tax
measure of profits does not reflect, as does profits from current
production, the capital consumption and inventory valuation adjustments.
These adjustments convert depreciation of fixed assets and inventory
withdrawals reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to
the current-cost measures used in the national income and product accounts.
The capital consumption adjustment decreased $1.8 billion in the fourth
quarter (from $102.7 billion to $100.9 billion), compared
with a decrease of $4.6 billion in the third.  The inventory valuation
adjustment increased $26.9 billion (from -$45.5 billion to -$18.6 billion),
compared with an increase of $14.9 billion.  Corporate Profits in 2011  Profits from current production increased 7.9 percent in 2011,
compared with an increase of 32.2 percent in 2010.  Domestic profits
increased 6.7 percent, compared with an increase of 41.6 percent.
The rest-of-the-world component of profits increased 12.4 percent,
compared with an increase of 6.0 percent.  Taxes on corporate income increased 1.3 percent in 2011, compared
with an increase of 50.9 percent in 2010.  Profits after tax with
inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments
increased 9.9 percent, compared with an increase of 27.5 percent.
Dividends increased 10.3 percent, compared with an increase of 18.9
percent; current-production undistributed profits increased 9.4
percent, compared with an increase of 38.8 percent.  According to the measure of profits before tax with inventory
valuation adjustment, domestic profits of financial corporations decreased
in 2011, and domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations
increased.  The increase in nonfinancial corporations reflected increases
in manufacturing, information, and “other” nonfinancial industries that
were partly offset by decreases in utilities, retail trade, transportation
and warehousing, and wholesale trade.  Within manufacturing, the largest
increase was in petroleum and coal products.  Next release -- April 27, 2012, at 8:30 A.M. EDT for:
