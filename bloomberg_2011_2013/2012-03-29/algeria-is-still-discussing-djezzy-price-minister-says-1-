Algeria is still discussing the
purchase price for 51 percent of mobile-phone company Djezzy,
Finance Minister  Karim Djoudi  said in an interview today.  Djoudi said there was “nothing new” to report on the
negotiations about the purchase of the stake from  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) ,
the world’s sixth-largest wireless service operator by
subscribers. “We are still discussing the price,” Djoudi said
in an interview in Algiers, the capital. “We are still in
negotiations.”  Djoudi said that a $1.3 billion fine levied on Djezzy would
be factored in during the negotiations. He did not elaborate.  Algeria and  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , which is majority
owned by VimpelCom, have been locked in an ownership dispute
over Djezzy since early 2010. Reuters reported yesterday, citing
an unidentified Finance Ministry official, that Algeria agreed
to pay $6.5 billion for the stake in Djezzy.  Orascom, North Africa’s biggest mobile-phone company, said
in a filing to the Egyptian stock exchange today that it isn’t
currently involved in the talks between  Algeria  and VimpelCom,
with which it merged last year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
