GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , Europe’s biggest
utility by market value, will offer 6 billion pounds ($9.5
billion) for the shares in  International Power Plc (IPR)  it doesn’t
already own.  The board of International Power said in a statement it
received an indicative proposal of 390 pence a share for the 30
percent not already owned by GDF. Shares in International Power
jumped as much as 6 percent to 406.4 pence, the biggest gain
since July 2010.  The non-binding offer represents a premium of 1.7 percent
to London-based International Power’s closing price yesterday.  International Power agreed to merge assets with Paris-based
GDF last year, boosting its gross generation capacity to more
than 70,000 megawatts in 30 countries. The agreement involved
combining International Power divisions with GDF assets in
 Turkey , the U.K. and outside Europe, creating the world’s
second-biggest power producer.  International Power said today’s statement was made without
the consent of GDF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
