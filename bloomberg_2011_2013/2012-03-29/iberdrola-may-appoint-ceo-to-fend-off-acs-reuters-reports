Iberdrola SA (IBE)  may appoint a Chief
Executive Officer alongside Chairman  Ignacio Galan  to curry
favor with institutional investors in its battle against
Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA, Reuters said.  The move may help Galan secure the backing of international
fund managers at the annual shareholders meeting where he may
have to fend off another attempt by ACS, Iberdrolaâ€™s biggest
shareholder, to secure a seat on the board, Reuters reported,
citing three people with knowledge of the process, without
identifying them.  Chief Financial Officer Jose Sainz Armada and Fernando
Becker, another current Iberdrola executive, are the most likely
candidates for the job, the agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
