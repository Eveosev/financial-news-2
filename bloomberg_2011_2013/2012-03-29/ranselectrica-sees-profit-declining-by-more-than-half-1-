Transelectrica SA (TEL) ,  Romania â€™s state-
owned power grid operator, sees its profit declining by more
than half in the next three years after reaching a five-year
high in 2011.  The Bucharest-based company sees its net income likely to
fall to 40 million lei ($12 million) this year, from 91 million
lei in 2011, Transelectrica said in a filing to the Bucharest
Stock Exchange today. It expects a profit of about 41 million
lei in 2013 and 43 million lei in 2014, according to the
statement.  Transelectrica plans to invest 782 million lei this year to
upgrade an outdated power-grid, so it can carry increasing
electricity supply amid growing wind-power output. Romania will
probably expand its wind power capacity to 1,400 megawatts by
the end of this year from the current 800 megawatts, Environment
Minister Laszlo Borbely said on Feb. 28.  The company plans to increase investment to 881 million lei
in 2013 and 831 million in 2014, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
