Barclays Plc’s (BARC)  Jeffrey Weiss, an
investment banker with experience at firms such as  Capital One
Financial Corp. (COF)  and  MetLife Inc. (MET) , plans to leave the bank in
June, according to an internal memorandum obtained by Bloomberg.  Weiss, 51, is based in New York and is head of financial
institutions investment banking worldwide at Barclays. He
previously held the same role at  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,
where he worked from 1983 until 2008, when Barclays acquired
Lehman’s North American operations. Weiss is retiring to
“pursue entrepreneurial opportunities,” according to the memo.  Barclays, Britain’s second-largest lender by assets, ranks
fifth in advising on global financial M&A this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That puts the London-based firm
on pace to finish in the top 15 advisers of financial
institutions for the fourth straight year since it gained Weiss
and Lehman’s unit in 2008, the data show.  Barclays, which failed to make the top 50 for financial
institutions deals the year before Weiss joined, advised Capital
One on its $9 billion purchase of  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s U.S. online
bank, completed last month. In 2010, Weiss’s group counseled
MetLife’s board on its acquisition of American Life Insurance
Co. from  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  and helped  Prudential
Financial Inc. (PRU)  complete a deal last year to buy $4.8 billion of
assets from AIG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
