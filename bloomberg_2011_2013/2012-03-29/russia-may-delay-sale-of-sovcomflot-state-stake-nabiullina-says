Russia  may delay the sale of a
stake in OAO Sovcomflot, owner of the world’s largest number of
tankers, after overcapacity in the freight market drove down
shipping rates and squeezed valuations last year.  “Sovcomflot might be sold this year or the deadline could
be reconsidered,” Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said in an
interview today in New Delhi. “We will look at the state of the
freight market.”  In February, Nabiullina said there was no reason to delay
the privatization of a stake in Sovcomflot, which is wholly
owned by the Russian government.  Global shipping markets have slumped as the fleet grows
faster than oil demand. The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a gauge
of costs to hire crude-oil tankers on 12 maritime routes,  fell 
62 percent since the end of 2007, according to the London-based
Baltic Exchange.  Russia may start selling its holdings in energy companies
including OAO Rosneft, OAO RusHydro and Federal Grid Co. this
year, Nabiullina said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
