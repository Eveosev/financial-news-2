Israel ’s benchmark bonds declined,
driving yields higher for the first time in eight days, on
speculation the central bank will maintain interest rates over
the next year amid signs of an economic recovery.  The yield on the 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit notes due January 2022
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.68 percent
at 3:30 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The rate has gained 15 basis points
this quarter. The  Bank of Israel  held the  benchmark lending rate 
at 2.5 percent for a second month on March 26, and the bank’s
research department predicted the rate would remain at the
current level through the first quarter of 2013.  “Yields on long-term bonds are rising as the central bank
indicated that  interest rates  will not decline in the near
future,” said Moshik Yaniv, head of the local fixed-income desk
at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd., in Tel Aviv.  Israel posted a monthly unemployment rate of 6.5 percent
for last month, down from 6.6 percent in January, the  Central
Bureau of Statistics  said today. The central bank this week
raised its growth forecast to 3.1 percent from 2.8 percent,
saying that “recovery in the U.S. is expected to continue.”
Exports account for about 40 percent of gross domestic product,
with the U.S. and  Europe  the largest markets.  One-year interest rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for the benchmark rate in the period, dropped two
basis points to 2.53 percent. Borrowing costs are likely to hold
at 2.5 percent for a third month at the next interest rate
decision on April 23, according to 16 economists in a  Bloomberg
survey (ISBRANN) .  The one-year breakeven rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bond and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, rose less than one basis point to 290. That
implies an average annual inflation rate of about 2.90 percent.  The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40) , which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, fell 0.1 percent to 265.85. The
shekel weakened 0.2 percent to 3.7356 a dollar, trimming this
year’s gain to 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
