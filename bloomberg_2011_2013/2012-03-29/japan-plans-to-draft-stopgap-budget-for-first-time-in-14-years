Japan’s government will draft a
stopgap budget for the first time in 14 years as the nation’s
parliament struggles to pass a spending bill before the new
fiscal year starts on April 1.  The interim budget will total 3.6 trillion yen ($43.4
billion) to pay for spending and to cover the minimum cost of
running the government for the first six days of April,
according to a release published by the  finance ministry  today.  Passage of the main budget has been delayed by disputes
over a sales tax increase and opposition attempts to dissolve
parliament. Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s ruling party
yesterday signed off on a bill to double Japan’s sales tax to 10
percent by 2015 to pay for swelling pension and welfare costs, a
measure opposed by opposition parties and some members of the
ruling party.  Under Japanese law, a budget proposal will be enacted
automatically 30 days after approval by the lower house, the
more powerful of the nation’s two parliamentary chambers. The
fiscal 2012 budget bill will become effective on April 6.  The government doesn’t intend to sell any bonds to pay for
the interim budget though it plans to issue short-term
securities worth about 3.6 trillion yen to finance expenditures
for the first six days.  The last time  Japan  adopted a temporary budget was in 1998
when Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was prime minister at the time,
struggled to push through a budget proposal in parliament that
stalled over measures to tackle the country’s financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
