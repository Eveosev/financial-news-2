Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.15 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.21 percent and averaging 0.14 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.
ICAP’s monthly average is 0.129 percent.  The central bank will sell $8 billion to $8.75 billion of
Treasuries maturing from June 2014 to March 2015. The sales are
part of the Fed’s program to replace $400 billion of short-term
debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort
to reduce borrowing costs further and counter rising risks of a
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
