Spanish inflation eased for a fifth
month in March as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy entered
its second recession since 2009 amid continued austerity
efforts.  Consumer prices , based on European Union calculations, rose
1.8 percent from a year earlier, the slowest pace since August
2010, and less than the 1.9 percent increase in February, the
 National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today. The rise was
in line with economists’ forecasts, according to the median of
11 predictions in a Bloomberg News survey.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December, has
pledged to present cuts worth 3.2 percent of gross domestic
product in his 2012 budget tomorrow to comply with EU limits
even as he forecasts the economy will contract 1.7 percent.  The government expects inflation to slow to 1 percent this
year. The European Commission has forecast that Spanish
consumer-price growth will ease to 1.3 percent from 3.1 percent
in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
