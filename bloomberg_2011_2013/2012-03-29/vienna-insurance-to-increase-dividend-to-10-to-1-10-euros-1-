Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG) , eastern
 Europe ’s biggest insurer, is proposing to increase its dividend
by 10 percent to 1.1 euros a share.  Net income rose 7 percent to 406.7 million euros ($542
million) from 379.8 million euros a year earlier, the Vienna-
based company said in a statement today. It was expected to
report a profit of 420.2 million euros, according to the average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Vienna Insurance, which makes more than half of its
earnings in the former communist bloc, already hinted that it
would increase its dividend by 10 percent when it announced
preliminary earnings on Jan. 24.  “The priority in 2012 will be on promoting further organic
growth and on increasing profitability on a continuous basis,”
the company said in the statement. “As far as the situation in
the European markets is concerned, the group expects if at all
selective stagnating revenues due to restrained consumption.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
