Adams Golf Inc. (ADGF) , whose golf clubs
are used by players including  Tom Watson  and Kenny Perry, was
sued by an investor claiming a $70 million offer for the company
by  Adidas AG (ADS)  is inadequate.  The proposed transaction represents a “paltry premium of
just 9.5 percent” over Adams Golf’s closing price on March 18,
the day before the announcement, and fails to adequately
compensate shareholders for the “significant synergies”
created by the merger, shareholder Daniel Tarsha said in the
complaint.  Adams Golf directors “have exacerbated their breaches of
fiduciary duty by agreeing to lock up the proposed transaction
with deal protection devices that preclude other bidders,”
Tarsha said in the complaint made public today in  Delaware
Chancery Court (1400L) .  Adidas, the owner of the TaylorMade brand, said it would
pay $10.80 a share in cash for Plano, Texas-based Adams. The
deal, which will be financed through cash or existing credit
lines, is expected to close mid-2012, Adidas said.  The deal includes provisions that prevent Adams Golf from
soliciting other bidders, gives Adidas four days to match any
competing offer and requires the company to pay Adidas a
termination fee of approximately 4 percent of the total offer,
Tarsha said in his complaint.  Tarsha is seeking to represent all Adams Golf shareholders
in his request for a court order barring the deal. Adams Golf
officials weren’t immediately available to comment.  The case is Tarsha v. B.H. Adams, CA7362, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
