Russian stocks dropped to their
lowest in more than two months as commodity prices fell and
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen curbed bets on riskier
assets.  The 30-stock Micex Index retreated 1.7 percent to 1,494.86
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its weakest since Jan. 24.  OAO
Surgutneftegas (SNGS) , the nation’s fourth-largest oil company,
declined 3.3 percent. OAO Mechel, Russia’s biggest miner of
steelmaking coal, plunged 6.1 percent. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s
biggest bank and the largest stock in the index with a 15
percent weighting, lost 2.4 percent. The  Russian Depositary
Index (RDXUSD)  of London-traded stocks fell 2.6 percent to 1,756.87.  Oil sank 1.9 percent to $103.4 a barrel in  New York  after
sliding 1.8 percent yesterday as the Energy Department said
crude inventories rose the most since July 2010.  Greece  will
probably have to restructure its debt again and this may involve
bailout partners such as European governments, said  Moritz
Kraemer , head of sovereign ratings at S&P.  “The market is struggling with a sombre outlook for
commodities,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF
Global Trading in  London , said by e-mail today.  “ Hedge funds 
are shorting metal and mining stocks and retail punters in
Russia have been bailing out of the oil and gas sector.”  Sales of oil and gas account for almost 50 percent of the
Russian government’s revenue last year and contribute 17 percent
of gross domestic product.  Mechel sank to 260.5 rubles as coal prices fell and the
miner said it started talks with lenders to obtain waivers and
amendments to loans on the expectation falling prices caused it
to breach financial covenants.  ‘Financial Gearing’  UBS AG downgraded Mechel’s stock today to neutral from buy
and reduced its price estimate for the company’s American
depositary receipts to $11.50 from $15.  “High financial gearing in the absence of a rising
commodity-price environment puts pressure on the stock,” UBS
analysts wrote in the report.  OAO Raspadskaya, a Russian coal producer, slid 4.5 percent
to 109.13 rubles, its biggest one-day loss since November.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) , the world’s largest producer of the
metal, fell 0.8 percent to 5,346 rubles. Copper, aluminum and
nickel declined on the London Metal Exchange.  Norilsk, which is also Russia’s largest mining company, is
competing for a license in the Taimyr region, where it was
founded, with billionaire Iskandar Makhmudov’s Ural Mining &
Metallurgical Co., Interfax reported yesterday. UMMC overtook
Norilsk as Russia’s largest copper producer last year.  Cheapest BRIC  The  Market Vectors Russia exchange-traded fund , a U.S.-
listed ETF that holds Russian shares, declined 1.6 percent to
$30.14, the lowest level since Jan. 30.  The Micex is up 6.7 percent this year compared with a 12
percent advance for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)  The Micex
trades at 6 times analysts’ earnings estimates for member
companies compared with 10.9 for Brazil’s  Bovespa index , which
has gained 16 percent this year. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
trades at 9.5 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India
Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has a ratio of 15.1.  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s biggest non-state oil producer, lost
1.5 percent to 1,776.1 rubles.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , the country’s
