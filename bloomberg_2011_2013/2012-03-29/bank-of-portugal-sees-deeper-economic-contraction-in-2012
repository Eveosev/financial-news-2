Portugal ’s central bank said the
economy will contract more than previously forecast in 2012 and
won’t grow next year as consumer spending drops and export
growth eases.  Gross domestic product  will fall 3.4 percent this year
after declining 1.6 percent in 2011, the Bank of Portugal said
today in its spring economic bulletin. In January, the bank
forecast GDP would decrease 3.1 percent in 2012, also a bigger
drop than previously estimated, and predicted that the economy
would expand 0.3 percent in 2013.  “The risks surrounding the current projection point to
more unfavorable economic-activity developments,” the Lisbon-
based central bank said in a statement. “These risks stem to a
large extent from external-driven factors, in particular related
to the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area, which may
constrain external-demand developments.”  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($104
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal
followed Greece and Ireland last April in seeking a bailout and
now plans to return to bond markets in 2013.  “If the macroeconomic environment weakens further, the
adoption of additional measures that ensure the fulfillment of
the fiscal goals may be necessary,” the Bank of Portugal said.  Investment, Consumption  The central bank forecasts investment will drop 12 percent
in 2012 and 1.7 percent next year, while private consumption
will decline 7.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. It
projects inflation of 3.2 percent for this year, after an
increase in the value-added tax rates of some goods, and 0.9
percent in 2013.  Exports (PTTBEUEX)  will grow 2.7 percent in 2012 and 4.4 percent in
2013, slower than estimated in January. Portugal’s current- and
capital-account deficit will narrow to 2.8 percent of GDP in
2012 and 0.4 percent in 2013, from 5.2 percent in 2011,
according to the Bank of Portugal.  Portugal narrowed its  budget deficit  to about 4 percent of
GDP in 2011 from 9.8 percent in 2010 following the transfer of
banks’ pension funds to the state. The government expects the
shortfall will reach 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012 and the EU
ceiling of 3 percent in 2013.  The IMF expects Portugal’s ratio of debt-to-GDP to
stabilize at about 115 percent in 2013 and then gradually
decline, Abebe Aemro Selassie, the head of the fund’s aid
mission to the country, said on March 5. Debt was 93.3 percent
of GDP in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
