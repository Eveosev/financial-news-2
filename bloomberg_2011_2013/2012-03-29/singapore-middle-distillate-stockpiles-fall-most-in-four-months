Singapore â€™s stockpiles of middle
distillates fell the most in four months, according to data from
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  middle distillates  such as kerosene
and gasoil fell 18 percent to 9.24 million barrels in the week
ended March 28,  International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of
the ministry, said in an e-mailed statement today. The decline
is the biggest since Nov. 9.  Fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy  residues  rose 6.3 percent to
23.4 million.  Light distillates  such as gasoline, reformate and
naphtha, were little changed at 10.1 million.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
