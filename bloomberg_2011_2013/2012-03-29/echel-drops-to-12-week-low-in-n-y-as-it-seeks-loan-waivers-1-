OAO Mechel (MTL)  tumbled to a 12-week low
in U.S. trading as the company seeks loan waivers on
expectations falling prices have caused it to breach financial
covenants.  American depositary receipts  of Moscow-based Mechel,
Russia’s largest producer of coal for steelmakers, fell 3
percent to $9.10 in  New York , the lowest level since Jan. 6.
Trading volumes totaled 7.35 million, or 234 percent of the
average three-month trading activity for the shares, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ADRs have gained 7.1 percent
this quarter.  The Moscow-based company said in a statement today that it
is in talks with lenders over waivers and amendments to some of
its loans. Declining coal prices mean  Mechel (MTLR)  will probably
breach covenants on credit facilities for 2011, and while the
company is confident of a “positive outcome,” no assurance can
be given that it will obtain the waivers, according to the
statement.  “This news is creating a negative perception of the
company,” Oleg Petropavlovskiy, mining and metals analyst at
Broker Credit Service in Moscow, said by phone. “While the news
stream remains negative, the shares of Mechel will be under
pressure.”  Russian prices for coking coal, used by steelmakers, slid
to about 5,000 rubles ($170) a metric ton this month from 6,600
rubles a ton in October, according to Morgan Stanley. Coal from
 Australia , the world’s largest exporter, dropped to about $200 a
ton from $270 in the period, the bank said in a report this
week.  Mechel has $2.66 billion of debt payments due this year,
according to a company presentation given in December.  The ADRs traded at a 3.1 percent premium to the company’s
Moscow-traded shares.  Mechel (MTLR)  fell 6.1 percent to 260.50 rubles,
or $8.83 on  Russia ’s Micex Index, the lowest level since Dec.
29. One New York-listed ADR is equal to one ordinary share
traded on the Micex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
