Hungary’s benchmark BUX stock index
dropped 0.2 percent to 18,617.26 as of the close in Budapest.
The following are among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, fell for a
third day. Oil fell as governments moved toward releasing
emergency stockpiles. Mol’s chairman said a failure by Hungary
to obtain a bailout would raise the risk of the government
extending special industry taxes. The shares dropped 0.6 percent
to 18,550 forint.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, rose 0.8
percent to 3,850 forint. The shares earlier fell as much as 1
percent as a report showed the country’s unemployment rate
climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
