The supply of supertankers
competing to load cargoes of Persian Gulf crude fell to a nine-
month low, according to Marex Spectron Group.  There are 54 very large crude carriers available in the
gulf over the next four weeks, Kevin Sy, a Singapore-based
freight-derivatives broker at Marex Spectron, said by e-mail
today. That’s the fewest VLCCs in the region since June 7, he
said. Each of the ships can hold 2 million barrels of crude.  Daily  returns  for VLCCs plying the industry’s benchmark
Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route jumped 20 percent yesterday to a 13-
month high, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. They
rose as U.S. investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co. said Iranian
output is “at risk of coming off line,” potentially disrupting
supply and supporting higher freight rates for tankers.  “There are more than 15 cargoes available until April
20,” said Sy. “The supply of VLCCs until this date has
dwindled to about 28.”  VLCCs on the benchmark voyage, the industry’s busiest trade
route, are earning $35,531 a day, the most money since Feb. 21,
2011, the exchange’s figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
