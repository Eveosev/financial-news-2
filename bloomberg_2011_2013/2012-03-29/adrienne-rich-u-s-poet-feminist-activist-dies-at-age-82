Adrienne Rich, a U.S. poet who
influenced the feminist and gay-rights movements, has died at
the age of 82.  Rich suffered complications caused by rheumatoid arthritis,
the  Associated Press  reported, citing her son, Pablo Conrad.  Her work challenged the American dream and was quoted by
anti-war protesters.  Rich was born on May 16, 1929, in Baltimore and published
her first book of poems in 1951, while still a student at
Radcliffe College.  Before her graduation, her poetry was chosen by W.H. Auden
for publication in the Yale Younger Poets series.  “The resulting volume, ‘A Change of World’ (1951),
reflected her formal mastery,” according to “Webster’s New
Explorer Dictionary of American Writers.”  Her next two collections -- “The Diamond Cutters” (1955)
and “Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law” (1963) -- became looser and
more personal in style. Her fourth book, “Necessities of Life,”
was written almost wholly in free verse.  Her work in the 1960s and 1970s showed her increasing
commitment to the women’s movement and to a lesbian-feminist
perspective, critics said.  Dark Fields  Her books included “Leaflets” (1969); “Diving Into the
Wreck” (1973, National Book Award); “The Dream of a Common
Language” (1978) and “Dark Fields of the Republic” (1995).  She also wrote criticism, including: “Of Woman Born,” on
motherhood (1976, National Book Award); “On Lies, Secrets and
Silence” (1979) and “Blood, Bread and Poetry” (1986.)  Her poem “The Roofwalker,” written for Denise Levertov,
captured her role in life as a poet. In it, she begins by
describing builders on the roof of some “half-finished houses”
as darkness falls. They look like “shadows on a burning deck.”
Then she writes:  “A life I didn’t choose  chose me: even  my tools are the wrong ones  for what I have to do.”  (Mark Beech and James Pressley write for Muse, the arts
