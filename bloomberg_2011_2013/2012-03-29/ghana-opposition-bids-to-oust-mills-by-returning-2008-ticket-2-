Ghana ’s main opposition party named
former Bank of Ghana Deputy Governor Mahamudu Bawumia as its
vice presidential candidate, reuniting the electoral ticket that
lost to President John Atta Mills by less than 1 percentage
point in 2008.  “Bawumia is the right choice for the management of economy
and well being of our people,” Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey, chairman
of the New Patriotic Party, said in remarks broadcast on Joy FM
today. The NPP ruled Ghana, the world’s second-biggest cocoa
producer, under President John Kufuor from 2000 to 2008. Mills,
of the National Democratic Congress, defeated Nana Akufo-Addo,
the NPP candidate who is running again in the election.  Bawumia, who was deputy governor from 2006 to 2009, was
named the resident representative for the  African Development
Bank  in  Zimbabwe  last year.  “He is likely to make the NPP’s bid very competitive,
counting on his experience, exposure and people’s familiarity
with him,” Theodore Dzeble, public affairs director at the
Accra-based Centre for Democratic Development, said by phone
today.  Ghana will hold presidential and parliamentary elections in
December.  Bawumia's candidacy “gives the picture of regional
balance,” Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, a political analyst at Damina
Advisors LLP, said in an e-mail. Since 2000, both parties have
picked their vice presidential candidates from the Muslim north,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
