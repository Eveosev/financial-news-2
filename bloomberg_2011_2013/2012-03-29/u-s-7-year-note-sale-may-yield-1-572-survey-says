The Treasury Department’s $29
billion sale of seven-year notes may draw a yield of 1.572
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in March 2019, yielded 1.575
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time. The notes drew a record low yield of 1.359 percent at the
January auction.  The size of today’s offering is the same as at the past 20
sales of the maturity after peaking at $32 billion in auctions
from November 2009 to April 2010.  The Feb. 23 sale’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 3.11,
versus an average of 2.86 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 41.8 percent of the notes at the
February auction, the most since the December offering and
compared with an average of 40.2 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.3 percent of
the notes at the last offering, the most since sales of the
maturity resumed in 2009 and compared with the 10-auction
average of 13 percent.  Loss in 2012  Treasury seven-year notes have lost 0.9 percent this year
after returning 14 percent in 2011, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index. The overall Treasury market has
fallen 1.2 percent this year after gaining 9.8 percent in 2011.  Today’s offering is the third of three auctions of U.S.
notes this week totaling $99 billion. The Treasury sold $35
billion of five-year debt yesterday at a yield of 1.040 percent
and the same amount of two-year securities on March 27 at 0.340
percent.  This week’s note auctions will raise $39.5 billion of new
cash as maturing securities held by the public total $59.5
billion.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
