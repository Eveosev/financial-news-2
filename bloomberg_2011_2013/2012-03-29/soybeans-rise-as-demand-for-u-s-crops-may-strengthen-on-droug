Soybeans, poised for the biggest
gain in five quarters in Chicago, rose on speculation demand for
U.S. supplies from importers led by  China  will strengthen as a
drought cuts South American production. Corn fell.  The U.S. soybean balance will be in deficit as farmers see
a limited gain in acreage amid rising exports after the drought
hurt South American crops, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
yesterday. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is set to release
the survey of planting intentions tomorrow.  “If you take  South America  out of the equation, China has
to go to the more expensive supplier, which is the U.S.,”
 Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at National Australia
Bank Ltd., said by phone from  Melbourne . “China is certainly a
key swing factor in the global grain and oilseed complex.”  Soybeans for May delivery climbed 0.2 percent to $13.705 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 2:15 p.m. Paris time,
paring an increase of as much as 0.7 percent. The oilseed has
advanced 13 percent this quarter.  Southern Hemisphere soybean output will fall 12 percent to
121.5 million metric tons this year, researcher Oil World
forecast this week. Shipments of the oilseed to China, the
biggest global soybean importer, will jump 6.3 percent in the
2011-12 season, it said.  U.S. farmers will sow 75 million acres of soybeans, similar
to the previous year, while the area seeded with corn will jump
to 94 million acres from 91.9 million acres, the USDA forecast
last month.  Corn for May delivery slid 0.9 percent to $6.1475 a bushel,
headed for a fourth drop in a row. The grain, also used to make
ethanol in the U.S., has declined 4.9 percent this quarter.  Ethanol production in the U.S. fell 0.5 percent to 889,000
barrels a day last week, with output dropping to the lowest
since Oct. 7, the Energy Department reported yesterday.  Wheat for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to $6.2925 a
bushel. The grain has dropped 3.6 percent this quarter. Milling
wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
slipped 0.1 percent to 202 euros ($268) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
