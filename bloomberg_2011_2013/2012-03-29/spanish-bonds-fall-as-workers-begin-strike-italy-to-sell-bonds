Spanish bonds fell and Italian
notes slid by the most in two months as industrial action in the
Iberian nation highlighted the challenges facing euro-area
governments as they seek to cut costs and reduce deficits.  Italy’s securities declined as it sold 8 billion euros
($10.6 billion) of five- and 10-year debt. German 10-year bunds
rose for a third day as a report showing European confidence
weakened boosted demand for safety.  Spain ’s Budget Minister
Cristobal Montoro presents the 2012 budget tomorrow, which aims
to reduce the deficit even as the economy contracts.  Greece  may
have to restructure its debt again,  Moritz Kraemer , head of
sovereign ratings at  Standard & Poor’s , said yesterday.  “The economic situation in Spain is gloomy,” said Sercan Eraslan, a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf,
Germany. “That’s the main driver today for Spanish and Italian
debt. S&P’s warning on Greece” fueled bets the crisis may
spread, he said.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield climbed 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 5.46 percent at 4:49 p.m. London time after
rising as much as 18 basis points to 5.50 percent. That’s the
biggest daily increase since March 21. The 5.85 percent bond due
in January 2022 fell 1.02, or 10.20 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 102.88.  The nation’s two-year note yield also rose 13 basis points,
to 2.59 percent.  Union Demands  Unions said 77 percent of Spanish workers took part in the
strike, angered by Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s austerity
measures. The government “will not cede” to demands to retract
labor-rule changes, Montoro said yesterday.  The additional yield investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-
year bonds instead of German bunds widened to as much as 369
basis points, the most since Feb. 16.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed 10 basis points to 5.21
percent, increasing the spread over bunds by 13 basis points to
340 basis points. The gap has widened from its 2012 low of 276
basis points set on March 16.  The nation’s  two-year yield  jumped as much as 39 basis
points to 3.03 percent, the biggest increase since Jan. 16,
before dropping back to 2.99 percent.  Italy  sold 3.25 billion euros of bonds maturing in
September 2022 at a yield of 5.24 percent, compared with 5.5
percent at the previous auction on Feb. 28. Investors bid for
1.65 times the amount allotted, versus a bid-to-cover of 1.40
times last month. The nation also auctioned debt maturing in May
2017 and floating-rate securities due in June 2017.  ‘Key Events’  Volatility in Italian government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by German securities,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield
spreads and credit-default swaps.  “There’s absorption of the supply to take into account,”
said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “We have a few political
key events coming up, with the euro finance ministers’ meeting,
Spain’s fiscal update and Italy’s labor market reforms. There’s
still some uncertainty with regards to what happens over the
next few days.”  European finance ministers will meet tomorrow in Copenhagen
to discuss measures to counter the region’s debt crisis.  Another reorganization of Greek debt may involve partners
such as European governments, S&P’s Kraemer said in London
yesterday. There may be “down the road, I’m not predicting
today when, another restructuring of the outstanding debt.”  Greece’s bond maturing in February 2023 fell, driving the
yield up 33 basis points to 20.64 percent. The price dropped
0.54 to 24.045 percent of face value.  Confidence Declines  Bunds advanced after a report showed  economic confidence  in
the euro area unexpectedly declined in March, adding to concern
the region’s economy is struggling to recover.  The  10-year bund  yield dropped three basis points to 1.81
percent after falling to 1.80 percent, the least since March 13.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation bloc fell to 94.4 from a revised 94.5 in February, the
European Commission said in Brussels. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast a gain to 94.5 from a previously
reported 94.4. The number of people in  Germany   out of work  fell
a seasonally adjusted 18,000 to 2.84 million in March, the
German Federal Labor Agency said today.  Ten-year bund futures may advance to the highest since
March 12 should they break above a key level of so-called
resistance, Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen said, citing
trading patterns.  Contract High  The contract “firmed yesterday and surpassed the
resistance in the 137.70-75 range,” Viola Stork and Ulrich Wortberg, analysts at Helaba in  Frankfurt , wrote in an e-mailed
report. “A rise above 138.14 would boost the situation further
and create scope for a test of the current contract high of
139.06,” they wrote. Resistance refers to an area where
technical analysts anticipate sell orders may be clustered.  The 10-year contract expiring in June climbed 0.4 percent
to 138.29 after rising to 138.43, the highest level since March
13. It last reached 139.06 on March 12, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  German bunds are little changed in 2012, their worst
quarterly performance in a year, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Portuguese bonds returned 14 percent, with Italian
securities earning 11 percent, the indexes show.  Portuguese (GSPT2YR)  two-year notes fell for the first time in 11
days today, ending their longest run of gains since February
2009. The rate jumped 25 basis points to 9.62 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
