Corporate bond sales in the U.S.
soared to a record $427 billion in the first three months of
2012, beating a previous quarterly high set a year ago as
companies tap the  debt market  at the lowest-ever borrowing
costs.  Offerings by companies from the neediest to the most
creditworthy surpassed the previous record of $397 billion
reached in the first quarter of 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Yields on investment-grade bonds fell to 3.4
percent on March 2, the lowest in records dating back to 1986,
and were within 10 basis points of the mark at 3.47 percent
yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
