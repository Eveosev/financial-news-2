Victoria Azarenka ’s 26-match
winning start to women’s tennis season ended with a quarterfinal
defeat to  Marion Bartoli  at the Sony Ericsson Open.  France’s Bartoli, the No. 7 seed at the tournament in Miami,
upset top-ranked Azarenka 6-3, 6-3 last night to secure her
third win in 11 career meetings with the Belarusian.  Azarenka’s start had been the best on the WTA Tour since
Martina Hingis opened the 1997 season on a 37-0 run. The 22-
year-old Azarenka won all four of her previous tournaments,
taking titles in Sydney, Doha and  Indian Wells , and clinching
her first Grand Slam championship at the Australian Open.  “What I’ve done in the last couple of months, I have to be
really proud of myself,” Azarenka said in comments on the
tournament’s website. “I could have maybe played better today,
that’s for sure, but I gave it all I had.”  The 27-year-old Bartoli, who scored her third career
victory over a No. 1-ranked player, will face fifth-seeded
Agnieszka Radwanska of  Poland  for a place in the final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
