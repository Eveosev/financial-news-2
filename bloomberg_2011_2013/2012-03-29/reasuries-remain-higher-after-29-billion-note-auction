Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
yields to a two-week low, as investors sought the safest assets
on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is poised to flare again.  Bonds stayed higher as a $29 billion auction of seven-year
Treasuries drew the highest demand since August from a category
of investors that includes foreign central banks. Greece will
probably have to restructure its debt again, a Standard & Poor’s
official said yesterday. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said this week the economic recovery isn’t assured.  “The uncertainty surrounding the situation in Europe has
moved back toward the forefront,” said  Chris Ahrens , head
interest-rate strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at UBS AG,
one of 21 primary dealers that are obligated to bid in U.S. debt
auctions. “We’ve seen a little bit of pressure in the risk
markets. We’re back to risk-off.”  Benchmark  10-year note  yields dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.16 percent at 5:03 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 2.15
percent, the lowest level since March 14. The 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 advanced 11/32, or $3.44
per $1,000 face amount, to 98 19/32. The yields increased two
basis points yesterday.  The  yield  on the current seven-year note fell four basis
points to 1.54 percent and reached 1.53 percent, also the lowest
level since March 14.  Volume (ICPTVOL)  declined. About $291 billion of Treasuries changed
hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker,
compared with $299 billion yesterday and $160 billion on March
26. The average daily volume over the past year is $267 billion.  Stocks slid, with the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index falling
as much as 1 percent before ending the day down 0.2 percent.  Quarterly Loss  Treasuries have lost 1.2 percent this quarter in the
biggest three-month decline in more than a year, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, as the  U.S. economy 
showed signs of improvement. They dropped 2.7 percent from
October through December of 2010.  The declines were led by securities maturing in 10 years or
more, which are down 5.1 percent since Dec. 31, the indexes
show. The global government  bond market  has returned 0.4 percent
since then, while the global broad bond market is up 1.1
percent, the data show.  Treasury 10-year yields will climb to as high as 3 percent
by Dec. 31 in what may be the end of the 30-year rally in
Treasuries, according to BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest
money manager, with $3.51 trillion in assets. The yield reached
2.4 percent on March 20, the highest since October, after
dropping to a record low 1.67 percent six months earlier.  ‘Grind Higher’  “Even after the recent yield spike, many bonds look richly
valued,” BlackRock executives including Rick Rieder, chief
investment officer for fundamental fixed-income portfolios,
wrote in a report dated March 28. “We believe yields will grind
higher, with benchmark 10-year U.S. government bonds likely
yielding 2.75 percent to 3 percent by year-end.”  Increases in yields will probably be capped by purchases by
central banks and “investors desperate for yield,” they wrote
in an update to the firm’s 2012 investment outlook.  Treasuries gained earlier after Moritz Kraemer, head of
sovereign ratings at S&P, said another debt restructuring of the
outstanding debt of  Greece , where the euro region’s debt crisis
began in 2009, “may be down the road” and may involve bailout
partners such as European governments. Kraemer spoke late
yesterday at an event in London.  European governments are preparing for a one-year increase
in the ceiling on rescue aid to 940 billion euros ($1.3
trillion) to keep the debt crisis at bay, according to a draft
statement for finance  ministers. Euro-area officials meet
tomorrow in Copenhagen to discuss the measure.  ‘Far From Over’  “While the situation in the euro region may have improved,
it’s far from over, and this concern should continue to underpin
demand for haven assets like Treasuries,” said  Matteo Regesta ,
a senior fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London .  Bernanke said today the pace of recovery from the recession
has been “extremely sluggish,” while action by the world’s
central banks helped prevent another Great Depression. He made
the comments in slides prepared for a lecture to students at
George Washington University.  U.S. policy makers don’t rule out further options to
support growth, Bernanke said on March 27, according to a
transcript of an ABC News interview provided by the network. The
central bank bought $2.3 trillion of debt under two rounds of
quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011.  The Fed sold $8.6 billion of Treasuries today maturing from
July 2014 to March 2015 as part of a program to replace $400
billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with longer
maturities to cap borrowing costs.  Jobless Claims  Bonds gained even after  initial claims  for U.S. jobless
benefits fell. Applications fell 5,000 in the week ended March
24 to 359,000, the lowest since April 2008, the Labor Department
reported.  Today’s auction was the last of three note offerings this
week totaling $99 billion. The seven-year securities drew a
 yield  of 1.590 percent, compared with a forecast of 1.572
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine primary dealers. The
bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids
with the amount of securities offered, was 2.72, versus an
average of 2.86 for the previous 10 sales.  “The market is holding up here; there are definitely
buyers of Treasuries out there,” said Justin Lederer, an
interest-rate strategist in New York and the primary dealer
Cantor Fitzgerald LP.  Foreign Central Banks  Indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42.8 percent of the notes. That
compared with an average of 40.2 percent for the past 10
offerings and was the highest since reaching 51.7 percent in
August.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 13.4 percent,
versus an average of 13 percent at the past 10 sales.  The securities drew a  yield  of 1.418 percent in February at
the last sale and reached a record low of 1.359 percent at the
January auction.  The government sold $35 billion of five-year debt yesterday
at a yield of 1.040 percent and the same amount of two-year
securities on March 27 at 0.340 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
