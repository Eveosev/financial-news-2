Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  is raising 1.5
billion euros ($2 billion) selling covered bonds at the tightest
yield spread from a French issuer since July.  The 2017 notes from  France ’s third-largest bank will yield
63 basis points above the benchmark mid-swaps rate, according to
a banker involved in the deal. It’s the narrowest spread on a
new issue of French covered notes since Credit Mutuel Group sold
2 billion euros of 2016 bonds at 58 basis points on July 5, DZ
Bank AG data show.  Banks sold 10.4 billion euros of covered bonds so far this
month compared with 16.7 billion euros in February and 26.6
billion euros a month earlier, according to  Credit Agricole 
data. Sales of the notes fell after the  European Central Bank 
pumped more than $1 trillion of three-year loans into the euro-
region financial system through its longer-term refinancing
operation.  “Sales of covered bonds had declined significantly after
the LTRO,” said Serafi Rodriguez, a fixed-income trader at
Morabanc in Andorra, who put an order to buy some of the notes.
“Credit Agricole chose the right time to come back to the
market.”  Deutsche Bank AG, ING, Natixis and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc helped Credit Agricole manage the deal which was
initially marketed at extra yield of about 70 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
