The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
trimmed losses in the final two hours of trading ahead of data
forecast to show growth in consumer confidence and spending
tomorrow, the final day of the best first quarter since 1998.  The S&P 500 retreated 0.2 percent to 1,403.28 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time, paring a loss of as much as 1 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  rose 19.61 points, or 0.2 percent, to
13,145.82 after reversing a drop of as much as  94 points  to halt
a two-day decline.  “It’s buying on weakness,”  Tim Ghriskey , who oversees $2
billion as chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford
Hills, New York, said in a phone interview. “The corrections
seem to be very short lived because money just seems to be
flowing right in. The end of the quarter is imminent. Given that
it’s been a positive quarter for stocks, many managers don’t
want to show any cash in their client portfolios.”  The S&P 500 has risen 12 percent since the beginning of
2012 amid better-than-estimated economic data and expectations
Europe would tame its crisis. The index has gained 2.8 percent
in March, rallying for a fourth straight month and poised for
the longest streak of monthly gains since September 2009.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ,  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and Coca-Cola Co. climbed more
than 1.5 percent for the biggest gains in the Dow today.  Red Hat
Inc. (RHT)  surged 20 percent after profit and sales topped
projections.  Bank of America Corp.  and Citigroup Inc. fell more
than 1.4 percent to pace losses in financial companies.  Best Buy (BBY) 
Co., the largest consumer-electronics retailer, slumped 7
percent on plans to close 50 stores as sales missed forecasts.  ‘Down the Road’  Benchmark equity indexes slumped earlier as S&P said Greece
may have to restructure its debt again. There may be “down the
road, I’m not predicting today when, another restructuring of
the outstanding debt,” said  Moritz Kraemer , head of sovereign
ratings at S&P. In the U.S., claims for unemployment benefits
fell to the lowest since April 2008. The economy grew at a 3
percent annual rate from October through December, separate data
showed.  “People are taking some chips off the table,” said  Matt McCormick , who helps oversee $5.8 billion at Bahl & Gaynor Inc.
in Cincinnati. “It’s been a good run and people are
questioning: is that sustainable? The measures taken by European
authorities have put those issues in the back burner. If that
narrative changes, it makes people address something that they
thought was already taken care of.”  Gauges of utility and health-care companies in the  S&P 500 
gained, while  financial  shares slumped. Alcoa added 2 percent to
$10.03. Caterpillar rose 1.7 percent to $106.02. Coca-Cola
advanced 1.6 percent to $73.81.  Corporate Demand  Red Hat surged 20 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to a
12-year high of $61.43. The company was surprised by demand for
its Red Hat Enterprise Linux software from  corporations 
preparing to move more applications to the so-called cloud,
where they can be delivered to users over the Internet, Chief
Executive Officer Jim Whitehurst said in an interview. Profit
for the current fiscal year will be as much as $1.20 a share,
the company projected, exceeding estimates.  Health maintenance organizations rose. Investors speculated
the Supreme Court will overturn aspects of the Affordable Care
Act, benefiting managed care companies, according to  Dave Shove ,
an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.  Aetna Inc. (AET)  added 6.5 percent
to $49.56.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  rallied 4.8 percent to
$58.11.  Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  climbed 5.1 percent to $52.40. Roche Holding
AG raised its hostile takeover offer for Illumina by 15 percent
to about $6.7 billion, yielding to demands for a higher price
from shareholders of the U.S. maker of gene-mapping tools.  Collective Brands  Collective Brands Inc. (PSS)  jumped 8.4 percent to $19.99. South
Korean clothing company E-Land Group said it will bid for the
retailer, which owns the Payless ShoeSource chain.  Global dealmaking slumped for a third straight quarter as
chief executive officers funneled cash into share buybacks and
new products, a trend that may reverse in the coming months as
the economic recovery gains momentum. Mergers and acquisitions
so far this quarter fell 14 percent from the fourth quarter to
$418 billion, making it the slowest three-month period in 2 1/2
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “I still think big cash surpluses will lead to more M&A
because companies fundamentally want to grow,” said Peter Tague, who started as co-head of global M&A at  Citigroup (C)  in New
York this month.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  slumped 1.1 percent as 23 of its 24
stocks declined. A measure of European lenders dropped 2.9
percent. Bank of America lost 2.3 percent to $9.53. Citigroup
slid 1.5 percent to $36.51.  Best Buy  Best Buy tumbled 7 percent to $24.77. Chief Executive
Officer  Brian Dunn  trimmed discounts after the holiday shopping
season, sacrificing sales to maintain profitability. The
retailer is closing big-box stores and cutting jobs to reduce
costs while boosting online sales and opening smaller locations.  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  slid 5.1 percent to $55.27. The largest U.S.
potash producer said  earnings  fell to 64 cents a share in the
quarter ended Feb. 29 from $1.21 a year earlier. That missed the
69-cent average estimate of 19 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Big Lots Inc. (BIG)  sank 4.8 percent to $43.42. The discount
retailer’s sales trends are “not as good as we’d hoped,”
Charles Grom, an analyst with Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note
after meeting with the company’s management.  The S&P 500 will likely remain stuck in the 500-point range
where it’s been four-fifths of the time since 2000 until the
 Federal Reserve  allows interest rates to rise, according to
Piper Jaffray Cos.  Trading Range  The benchmark measure fell in the previous two days after
reaching 1,416.51, the highest level since May 2008 and 9.5
percent below its record high of 1,565.15 from 2007. The index
has traded between 1,000 and 1,500 for about 80 percent of the
time since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Equity gains stalled in the past 12 years as the economy
suffered from the bursting of bubbles in technology and real
estate, forcing the central bank to cut its benchmark interest
rate to near zero from 6.5 percent to spur growth. Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke has pledged to keep borrowing costs low through
at least late 2014.  “The S&P 500 is approaching the upper end of the secular
trading range,” Craig W. Johnson, a Minneapolis-based technical
market strategist with Piper Jaffray, wrote in a note yesterday.
“This resistance will likely remain intact until 2014-2015, and
will correspond with a secular change in bond yields.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
