German  government bonds  snapped a
two-day advance before a report that analysts said will show
euro-area economic confidence improved for a third straight
month in March.  German 10-year yields rose from yesterday’s two-week low.
Unemployment in  Europe ’s largest economy held at the lowest in
more than two decades in March, data will show today, according
to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Italy is scheduled to
auction as much as 8.25 billion euros ($11 billion) of bonds due
in 2017 and 2022.  The German 10-year yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.85 percent at 7:28 a.m.  London  time. The
rate dropped to 1.83 percent yesterday, the least since March
13. The 2 percent bond due January 2022 fell 0.115, or 1.15
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.365.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area increased to 94.5 from 94.4 in February, the
European Commission will say today, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Germany ’s adjusted jobless rate held at 6.8 percent from
February, a separate survey showed.  German bunds are little changed in 2012, their worst
quarterly performance in a year, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italian securities gained 11 percent and Portuguese
bonds returned 14 percent since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
