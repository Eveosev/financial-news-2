Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell for
a third day on concern higher fuel costs will spur inflation,
reducing room for the central bank to cut  interest rates . The
dong strengthened.  Vietnam raised local prices of petroleum products by as
much as 12 percent on March 7.  Consumer prices  increased 14.15
percent this month from a year earlier, the smallest gain in a
year, government data showed on March 24. Slowing inflation may
allow the nation to cut borrowing costs by 100 basis points per
quarter, central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said March 12.  “We’ve seen demand for government fixed-income assets
waver in both primary and secondary markets as investors are
concerned of a spike in inflation,” Marc Djandji, head of
research in  Ho Chi Minh City  at Viet Capital Securities, wrote
in a research report today.  The  yield  on benchmark five-year notes rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.51 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level since March 21.  The dong advanced 0.6 percent to 20,725 per dollar as of
3:42 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on either side
of that rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
