Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , the Nigerian
unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd., said full-year profit dropped
21 percent to 7.44 billion naira ($47 million) as it made
provisions for bad debt.  Net interest income rose to 29.8 billion naira from 26.4
billion a year earlier, the Lagos-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Non-performing loans rose 30 percent to
18.5 billion naira, while gross lending increased 42 percent to
266.6 billion naira, the bank said in the statement.  The bank took a loss provision of 4.7 billion naira,
“eroding the modest earnings accretion,” Vetiva Asset
Management Ltd. said in an e-mailed note. The company’s proposed
dividend of 10 kobo per share is “disappointing,” according to
Vetiva, which placed its “Accumulate” rating on the bank under
review.  Stanbic IBTC’s shares dropped 4.9 percent to 6.80 naira by
the close today in Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
