Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-
largest cement-maker, risks losing its investment-grade credit
rating this year unless it sells assets, according to an ING
note.  The company “has not satisfied investment-grade metrics
since 2007,” Ian Osburn, an ING analyst, wrote in a note.  Peter Gysel , a spokesman for Holcim, said: “The  ratings
agencies  have written nothing about that we should make
divestments to keep our rating.”  Moody’s assigned a negative ratings outlook to Jona,
Switzerland-based Holcim in November 2011. The company is rated
Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, BBB by Standard & Poor’s and
BBB by Fitch, the second-lowest investment grades.  Holcim’s European competitors  Lafarge SA (LG)  and
 HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  have already been assigned junk ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
