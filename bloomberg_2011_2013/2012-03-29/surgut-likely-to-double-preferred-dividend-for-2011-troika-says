OAO Surgutneftegas (SNGSP) ,  Russia ’s
fourth-largest oil producer, will probably double its 2011
dividend to 2.148 rubles a preferred share after profit rose,
Troika Dialog said.  Net income climbed 81 percent to 233 billion rubles ($8
billion) last year under Russian accounting standards, because
of rising crude prices and an asset revaluation, the Surgut-
based company said on its website yesterday.  The dividend on preferred shares would produce a 10.3
percent yield, Troika estimated, based on Surgutneftegas’s
dividend policy. The  company  paid 1.18 rubles a preferred share
for 2010.  Surgutneftegas’s profit last year was bolstered by the
revaluation of a $29 billion cash position, which may be
denominated in dollars or other foreign currencies, Troika
estimated.  Surgut’s preferred shares fell 1.3 percent to 20.232 rubles
a share on the Micex exchange at 10:51 a.m. in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
