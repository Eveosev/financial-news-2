VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , Russia’s third-
biggest mobile carrier by subscribers, rose as  Algeria ’s Finance
Minister denied the government has agreed to pay $6.5 billion
for a controlling stake in the company’s Djezzy unit.  American depositary receipts of VimpelCom added 0.5 percent
to $11.26 in  New York , after dropping as much as 2.1 percent
earlier. Volume totaled 2.7 million, or 135 percent of the
average three-month trading activity for the shares, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has gained 19 percent
this quarter.  Algeria is in talks to buy a stake in Djezzy from
VimpelCom, which merged with Orascom last year. It is still
discussing a purchase price for the 51 percent stake, Finance
Minister  Karim Djoudi  said in an interview today. Orascom said
yesterday an Algerian court fined Djezzy about $1.3 billion for
violating foreign-exchange regulations, a ruling the company is
planning to appeal. Djoudi said today that the fine would be
factored in during the negotiations.  Reuters reported yesterday Algeria had agreed to pay $6.5
billion for a controlling stake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
