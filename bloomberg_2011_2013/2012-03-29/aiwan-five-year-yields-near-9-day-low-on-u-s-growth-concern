Taiwan’s dollar weakened for the
first time in three days as worse-than-expected U.S. economic
data sapped demand for riskier assets.  Government bonds  were
little changed.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of  stocks  dropped after
official a report released yesterday showed orders placed with
U.S. factories for durable goods rose 2.2 percent in February,
less than the 3 percent gain economists estimated in a Bloomberg
survey. Global funds sold $70 million more Taiwanese shares than
they bought in the first four days of the week, according to
exchange data.  “The stock market is getting hit by the mediocre U.S. data
overnight,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities
Co. in Taipei. “Investors are still unsure whether we’re seeing
a solid U.S. recovery.”  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.04 percent to NT$29.582 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency has appreciated 2.4 percent this quarter. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that
traders use to price options, was unchanged at 4 percent.  The yield on the 1 percent notes due January 2017 was 0.996,
compared with 0.992 percent yesterday, according to Gretai
Securities Market. That was the lowest rate for benchmark five-
year yields since March 19.  The overnight  money-market  was steady at 0.409 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the  Taiwan  Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
