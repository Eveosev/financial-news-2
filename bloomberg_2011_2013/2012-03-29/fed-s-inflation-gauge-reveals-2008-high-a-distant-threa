BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest
money manager, expects yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes to
rise to as high as 3 percent by the end the year in what may be
the end of the  30-year rally  in bonds.  Investors in Treasuries have lost 1.2 percent this quarter
including reinvested interest, set for the biggest drop since
losing 2.67 percent in the final three months of 2010, the Bank
of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Master Index shows.  “Yields will grind higher,” executives including Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fundamental fixed-income
portfolios at BlackRock, wrote in a report dated March 28.
However, “a yield explosion is not in the cards.”  Global central banks stand ready to buy long-term debt if
rising yields threaten economic recovery, Rieder wrote. The New
York-based firm advised investors to move away from “flight-to-
quality” bonds such as Treasuries, bunds and gilts and into
higher-returning assets as the economy stabilizes and  interest
rates  begin to normalize.  The yield on the  10-year note  fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.16 percent at 3:42 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Ten-year yields are up from 1.97 percent at the end of
February, and this year’s low of 1.79 percent on Jan. 31. Yields
were last at 3 percent in July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
