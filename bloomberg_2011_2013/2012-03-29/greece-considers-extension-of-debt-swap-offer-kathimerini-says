Greece  may extend a new debt-swap
offer to holders of bonds governed by Swiss, Italian and
Japanese law, as the legal framework of the current exchange
prohibits their participation,  Kathimerini  reported.  Such an offer would be made after April 11, to allow formal
completion of the current swap, and might ask the holders to
exchange their bonds for cash, rather than new securities, the
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
