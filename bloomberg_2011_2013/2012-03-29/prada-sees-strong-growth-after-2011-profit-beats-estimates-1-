Prada SpA (1913) , an Italian maker of
$2,950 perforated patent-leather  handbags , reported fiscal 2011
profit that beat analysts’ estimates and proposed paying the
first dividend since last year’s initial public offering.  Net income rose 72 percent to 431.9 million euros ($573.9
million) in the year ended Jan. 31, the Milan-based company said
today in a statement. The average of 13 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of 414.3 million euros.
Shareholders will get a dividend of 5 cents a share.  The results “confirm the group’s ability to achieve strong
growth while continuing to become more profitable,” the company
said. Prada, whose IPO was Hong Kong’s biggest in 2011, follows
competitors including  Hermes International SCA (RMS)  in predicting
sustained demand for high-end goods as Chinese economic growth
slows and Europe’s debt crisis weighs on  consumer spending .
Revenue last year climbed 25 percent to 2.56 billion euros.  Prada’s growth story is “‘appealing but risks remain,”
 Antoine Belge , an analyst at HSBC, wrote in a report this month.
The level of fixed costs means profitability “will be more
exposed to a slowdown in demand than others,” wrote Belge, who
has a “neutral”  recommendation  on the shares.  While the medium-to-long-term context is “positive” for
the luxury industry, “the current macroeconomic environment is
still characterized by uncertainty and volatility which,
especially in the short-term, could have negative repercussions
for performance on certain markets,” Prada said. “In light of
this situation, the group will maintain adequate control of the
use of resources and ensure that it is flexible enough to be
able to react to possible changes in the situation.”  Store Upgrades  In 2012, Prada will focus on upgrading and opening more
stores, including in mature markets, where there is an
increasingly significant flow of foreign travelers, it said.  The earnings were released after the close of trading in
 Hong Kong . Prada shares rose 1.8 percent to HK$49.55 today,
giving the owner of the Prada, Miu Miu, Church’s and Car Shoe
brands a market value of HK$126.8 billion ($16.3 billion).  Revenue climbed in all geographies last year, led by the
Asia-Pacific region, which increased its share of total sales to
34.6 percent from 30.4 percent, and by the Prada and Miu Miu
brands, the company said.  Retail sales climbed 38 percent as Prada opened 75 stores,
taking the number of boutiques it operates directly to 388. On a
like-for-like basis, retail growth was 23 percent.  Wholesale revenue declined 5.2 percent, which the company
attributed to its policy of being more selective about third-
party accounts in  Europe  and to bad weather and strikes in
 Italy , which affected deliveries.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization advanced 42 percent to 759.3 million euros, while
the Ebitda margin widened to 29.7 percent from 26.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
