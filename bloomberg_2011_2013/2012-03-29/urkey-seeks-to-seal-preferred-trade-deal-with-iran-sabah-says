Turkey and Iran have been working
on a preferential-trade agreement for a while and it’s time to
seal the deal, Turkish Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan said,
Sabah  reported .  Trade between the two neighbors is growing and Turkish
lira-Iranian rial transactions are rising due to international
sanctions against Iran, Caglayan told reporters during a visit
to Tehran with Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , according to
the Istanbul-based newspaper.  The minister said he will discuss the preferred-trade
agreement with his counterpart and that both countries seek to
increase bilateral trade, Sabah reported. Turkey’s energy
purchases from its eastern neighbor continue and there are no
problems with the state-run  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  facilitating
payments, Caglayan told reporters, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
