Tsingtao Brewery Co. (600600) ,  China ’s
second-largest brewer, posted a 14 percent increase in 2011
profit, beating analyst estimates, as rising incomes fueled
demand for alcoholic drinks in the world’s most populous nation.  Net income  rose to 1.74 billion yuan ($276 million) from
1.52 billion yuan a year earlier, Tsingtao said in a  Shanghai 
stock exchange filing yesterday. Profit exceeded the 1.68
billion yuan median estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Sales increased 16 percent to 23.2 billion yuan.  The company, based in the coastal city of Qingdao in
Shandong province, said it faces challenges this year including
“weak global economy, slowing domestic consumption growth, and
rising human-resources costs.”  Profit margin at its core businesses narrowed to 33.4
percent from 35.2 percent a year earlier as raw material costs
increased, the company said.  Kingway Brewery Holdings Ltd. (124) 
earlier this month said its 2011 profit dropped 4.1 percent amid
increased competition and production costs.  The company pledged to expand capacity, develop new
products, and “actively seek suitable merger and acquisition
targets” to achieve growth. The management is “full of
confidence” about its ability to achieve annual sales of 10
million hectoliters of beer in 2014, it said.  Tsingtao rose 0.6 percent to 33.07 yuan in Shanghai
yesterday, before the earnings announcement. The brewer’s Hong
Kong-listed stock retreated 2.9 percent to HK$42.40.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
