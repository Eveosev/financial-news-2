Danny Manning will coach the
 University of Tulsa  men’s basketball team, leaving his job as an
assistant at the  University of Kansas , where he was the all-time
leading scorer and rebounder.  It’s his first job in charge of a college program.  Manning, 46, agreed to become the 29th head coach in Tulsa
history, Athletic Director Ross Parmley said today on the
department’s  website . He will remain with the Jayhawks for their
appearance in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament’s Final Four and join the Golden Hurricane in
 Oklahoma  next week.  Manning spent the last nine seasons on the  Kansas  staff,
helping the Jayhawks to five Big 12 tournament titles and an
NCAA championship in 2008, according to the website. As a player
from 1984 to 1988, Manning scored 2,951 points and grabbed 1,187
rebounds and helped the Jayhawks win the national championship
in his final year.  He takes over for Doug Wojcik, who was fired this month
after seven seasons at Tulsa. Since 2005, the Golden Hurricane
men’s basketball program has seen a 35 percent decrease in
season-ticket sales and a 43 percent decline in revenue, Parmley
said at the time of Wojcik’s dismissal.  Wojcik had a 140-92 record at Tulsa, the most wins in the
school’s history, and finished with a 17-14 record this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
