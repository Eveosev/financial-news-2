Northampton Saints forward Calum
Clark was suspended 32 weeks for an incident during the LV Cup
rugby final which left an opponent with a broken elbow.  Clark admitted at a hearing today to hyperextending the
right arm of Leicester Tigers’ Rob Hawkins during March 18
match, the Rugby Football Union said in a statement. Clark was
suspended indefinitely by Saints six days ago following a club
investigation.  Clark has the right to appeal the RFU ban, which runs to
Nov. 1. He was also ordered to pay a 500-pound ($798) hearing
cost, the governing body said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
