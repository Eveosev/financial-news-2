its Platinum Container Lines Co. unit, it said in a regulatory
filing.  Dusit Thani Pcl (DTC)  , a hotel operator, declined 2.2

answered.  Pranda Jewelry Pcl (PRANDA)  , a jewelry producer, rose
0.8 percent to 6.45 baht. The company’s first-quarter revenue

Bangkok wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
