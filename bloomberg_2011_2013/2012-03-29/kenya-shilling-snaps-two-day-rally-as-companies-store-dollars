Kenya ’s shilling snapped a two-day
rally, weakening the most in two weeks, as businesses sought to
accumulate dollars following its recent gain.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.8 percent to 83.20 and was trading 0.7 percent
weaker at 83.13 to the dollar at 11:57 a.m. in Nairobi. A close
at this level will be the largest decline since March 16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has weakened on increased dollar demand
driven by the recent good levels of the shilling, attracting
buyers to accumulate dollars ahead of the new month,” Jeremiah Kendagor, acting head of trading at Nairobi-based  Kenya
Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said in a phone interview.  The shilling had strengthened 0.8 percent in the two
previous sessions, the longest winning streak in two weeks, to
close yesterday at 82.53 per dollar.  Tanzania’s shilling appreciated on increased dollar
supplies from the  mining industry . The currency of the second-
biggest economy in East Africa gained as much as 0.6 percent to
1,585.75 and last traded 0.3 percent stronger at 1,590.  “The shilling has gained against the dollar as businesses
from the mining sector are offloading dollars into the market
with little demand coming in,” Yonoh Mtengule, chief economist
at National Bank of Commerce, said by phone from  Dar es Salaam ,
the commercial capital.  The Ugandan shilling also snapped a two-day rally, to
weaken the most in almost 4 weeks. The currency of the third-
biggest economy in  East Africa  depreciated 0.8 percent to
2,518.50 at 12:26 p.m., the largest decline since March 5,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
