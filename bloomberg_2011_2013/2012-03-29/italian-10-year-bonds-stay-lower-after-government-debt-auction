Italian 10-year  government bonds 
stayed lower after the nation sold 8 billion euros of debt due
2017 and 2022.  The 10-year bond yield rose five basis points to 5.15
percent at 10:23 a.m. London time. Five-year notes also fell,
with the yield climbing eight basis points to 4.30 percent.  Italy sold 3.25 billion euros of bonds due in September
2022 at a yield of 5.24 percent, the lowest at a 10-year auction
since August. Investors bid for 1.65 times the amount of debt
allotted. That compares with a so-called bid-to-cover of 1.40 at
a previous auction of the securities on Feb. 28, which were sold
at 5.5 percent.  The nation also sold bonds maturing in May 2017 and
floating-rate securities due in June 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
