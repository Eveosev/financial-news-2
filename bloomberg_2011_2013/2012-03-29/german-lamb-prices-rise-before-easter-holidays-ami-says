German lamb prices before the
Easter holidays increased from a year earlier, market researcher
Agrarmarkt Informations GmbH reported.  The price of lamb increased to 5.63 euros ($7.47) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) of slaughtered weight in the week through
March 25 from 4.53 euros in the year-earlier week, Bonn-based
AMI wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Easter typically results in a “considerable” increase in
demand for lamb, the researcher wrote. Lambing is more expensive
in winter due to high feed costs, and the bulk of lambs are born
in spring, meaning the supply of slaughtering lambs will
increase from mid-April into the summer, according to AMI.  “Currently the supply of domestically produced lambs is
relatively small,” AMI wrote. “Supply from abroad is also not
plentiful and lamb-meat prices are rising across the board,
particularly leg is very much in demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
