Ethanol futures fell to an eight-
week low in  Chicago  on signs of cheaper production costs.  Prices sank for a fourth day and followed corn lower on
speculation demand for the grain will slow, and before an
Agriculture Department report on corn tomorrow. One bushel of
the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “Corn and ethanol continued to be in full liquidation mode
before the planting intentions report tomorrow,” SCB &
Associates LLC in Chicago wrote in a note to clients.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slumped 5.7 cents, or
2.6 percent, to $2.15 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Feb. 3. The futures have dropped 2.4
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  tumbled 7
cents, or 3 percent, to $2.25 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive slipped 5.5 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.175, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast slid 5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
$2.325 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel fell 4 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.255.  Corn for May delivery sank 16.25 cents, or 2.6 percent, to
$6.04 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
