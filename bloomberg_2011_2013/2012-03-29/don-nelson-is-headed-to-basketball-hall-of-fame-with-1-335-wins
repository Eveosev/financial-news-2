Don Nelson, whose 1,335 coaching
wins are the most in National Basketball Association history,
said he’s headed to the Basketball Hall of Fame.  A three-time NBA coach of the year, the 71-year-old Nelson
told ESPN yesterday that he’d received the call from the Hall of
Fame, and confirmed the account  during an interview  with the Bay
Area News Group in  California .  “Very seldom do people get to do something they love to do
their whole life,” Nelson said, according to a story in the
Mercury News. “But I’m a lucky guy to stay in the business as
long as I did. This is just frosting on the cake. It doesn’t get
any better than going into the Hall of Fame.”  An official announcement from the Springfield,
Massachusetts, Hall of Fame is expected to come today, the paper
said.  Nelson had a  1,335-1,063 record  over 31 seasons with the
 Milwaukee Bucks ,  Golden State Warriors ,  New York Knicks  and
 Dallas Mavericks , taking teams to the playoffs 18 times. Nelson
was the oldest active coach at 70 when he was fired by the
Warriors in September 2010 following a second stint with the
franchise.  “Even though I’ve been nominated a lot, I had a good
feeling about it this time, I don’t know why,” Nelson told the
newspaper. “I thought maybe that now that I’m retired, it could
happen.”  Nelson also played in the NBA from 1962-1976, averaging
10.3 points a game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
