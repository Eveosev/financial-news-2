The Formula One race scheduled for
next month in Bahrain will create more than 3,000 temporary jobs
and generate $500 million for the economy, the Information
Affairs Authority said.  Sheikh Salman bin Isa  Al Khalifa , chief executive officer
of the Bahrain International Circuit, said more employment will
be created from other events held at the track, the IAA said in
an e-mailed statement from the capital Manama yesterday.  “The F1 generates huge returns for Bahrain by regenerating
interest in Bahrain as a friendly and hospitable environment,”
Sheikh Salman said.  Bahrain canceled last year’s race because of mass protests
by mostly Shiite demonstrators demanding democracy and equal
rights from the Sunni monarchy. Small-scale protests are still
taking place daily in Shiite villages and sometimes spill over
to Manama.  Opposition groups are calling on supporters to step up
rallies before the April 20-22 event and have begun a campaign
called Boycott the Bahrain Formula 1 on Twitter.  Sheikh Salman said security at the event will be managed in
coordination with the  Federation Internationale de l’Automobile ,
according to the IAA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
