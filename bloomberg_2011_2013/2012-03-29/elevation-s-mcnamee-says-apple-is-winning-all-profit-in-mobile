Technology investor Roger McNamee
said all of the profit in mobile right now is being gobbled up
by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , while  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  are losing
money in the business trying to keep up.  “There is no profitability at either Microsoft or Google
from these devices,” McNamee said in an interview yesterday
with Bloomberg Television’s Margaret Brennan. “I don’t think
these guys are going to roll over and let Apple own things
forever.”  In order for other companies to compete with Apple’s iPad
and iPhone, they have to go outside of the application model and
use the HTML5 programming language to “create a new Web,” said
McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners in Menlo Park,
California. Elevation is an investor in  Facebook Inc., (FB)  another
company that McNamee said has failed to make money in mobile.  The advantage Facebook has is that so many other websites
are signing on users through the social-networking service, and
that will eventually gravitate to mobile devices, McNamee said.
Another advantage is that Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg,
is the “best I’ve ever known” as far as entrepreneurs go,
McNamee said. That includes the late Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-
founder, and Microsoft’s Bill Gates, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
