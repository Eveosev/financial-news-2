French sugar beets were 94 percent
planted as of yesterday, growers federation CGB reported.  This year’s sugar-beet area is forecast to be 385,000
hectares (951,335 acres), the Paris-based CGB wrote on its
website today.  The crop was 50 percent planted on March 23, six days
behind last year’s planting pace and three days ahead of the
five-year average, according to the group.  “The soil is very dry, it virtually hasn’t rained for
three weeks,” the CGB wrote. “Now water is needed for the crop
emergence.”  In the Seine-Maritime department, about 30 percent of the
crop remained to be planted, while in the Eure and Nord Pas-de-
Calais departments 15 percent of the area was still unseeded,
according to the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
