The British architect David Chipperfield will oversee a major renovation of Berlin’s Neue
Nationalgalerie, a concrete, steel and glass landmark at
Potsdamer Platz completed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1968.  Chipperfield has worked extensively in Berlin, finishing
work on the war-ravaged Neues Museum on the Museum Island
complex in 2009.  Hermann Parzinger, president of the Prussian Cultural
Heritage Foundation, said in a statement today that the  Neue
Nationalgalerie  would be “in safe hands’’ with Chipperfield.  The renovation will start in 2015 and last three years,
during which time the museum will be closed, the foundation said
in the statement. The building, Mies van der Rohe’s only work in
 Germany  after World War II, has had no thorough modernization
since its inauguration 40 years ago.  The glass facade, stone terrace and concrete and steel
structure need to be restored, the foundation said. The museum
requires new security and fire technology and the shop and cafe
will be renovated.  (Catherine Hickley writes for Muse, the arts and leisure
