The International Monetary Fund
approved the disbursement of about $132.9 million to  Angola 
after completing the sixth and final review under a stand-by
arrangement for  Africa â€™s second-biggest oil producer.  The Washington-based lender said yesterday in a  statement 
on its website it provided a total of about $1.33 billion in
loans to the southern African nation under the program, which
began in November 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
