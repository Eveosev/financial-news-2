Gulf Coast  gasoline and diesel
strengthened after  BP Plcâ€™s (BP)  Texas City refinery reported
emissions from a fluid catalytic cracker.  The BP unit exceeded the permitted opacity limit early
yesterday, the company said in a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. The release is being
investigated.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGR87P)  rose 1.37 cents to 3.75 cents a gallon over May
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:15 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Texas City refinery can process 475,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel at the  hub  rose 0.5
cent to 5.63 cents a gallon over Nymex heating oil futures.  The fuel rose in the hub after inventories decreased in
Europe, raising the value of exports from the U.S.  Gasoil inventories in independent storage in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp decreased 3.2 percent to 2.69 million tons as
cargoes were sent to the Mediterranean and the U.K., PJK
International BV, data shows. Supplies of the fuel, which
includes diesel and heating oil, arrived from Norway, Russia and
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
