Peru’s  Supreme Court  denied a
request by an Argentine court to extradite a former Peruvian
military leader in connection with the kidnapping and torture of
opponents to his regime.  General Francisco Morales Bermudez, who ruled Peru from
1975 to 1980, is accused of being involved in the kidnapping and
torture of 13 Peruvians who were deported to Argentina in May
1978, the Supreme Court said in an e-mailed statement.  The court rejected the extradition request as Peruvian
legislation at the time didn’t cover torture or conspiracy to
commit a crime, it said. There is nothing stopping the relevant
Peruvian authorities from investigating the charges of
kidnapping, the court said.  Morales Bermudez, who ended a 12-year military regime by
calling elections, has denied any involvement in the crackdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
