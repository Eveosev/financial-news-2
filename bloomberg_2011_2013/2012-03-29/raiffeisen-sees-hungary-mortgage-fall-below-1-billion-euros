Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) 
expects its Hungarian mortgage book in foreign currencies to
shrink to less than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) this year,
Chief Executive Officer Herbert Stepic said.  Foreign-currency mortgages, most of which are in Swiss
francs, have declined to 1.07 billion euros by the end of
February, compared to 1.47 billion euros at the end of 2010,
after clients repaid about 400 million euros at a discount last
year, Raiffeisen said. That number will decline further by the
end of the year, Stepic told analysts in Vienna today.  The Austrian lender, eastern  Europe â€™s third-biggest, had an
after-tax loss of 355 million euros in the neighboring country,
where it started business before the Iron Curtain fell in 1989.
That was driven by currency losses it was forced to swallow on
the mortgages, as well as by other bad debt charges, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
