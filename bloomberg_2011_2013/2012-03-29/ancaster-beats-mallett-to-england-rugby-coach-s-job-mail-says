England is set to hire  Stuart
Lancaster  as head coach of the national rugby team after his
name was put forward to the Rugby Football Union’s board for
final approval, the Daily Mail reported.  RFU Chief Executive Officer Ian Ritchierecommended that
Lancaster, who was England’s interim coach for the Six Nations,
be appointed to the role permanently after he was interviewed
for the post last week along with South African Nick Mallett,
the Mail said, without saying where it got the information.  An announcement is likely to be made today or tomorrow, the
newspaper added.  The 42-year-old Lancaster, who took over for the Six
Nations after  Martin Johnson  quit Nov. 16 following the World
Cup in  New Zealand , guided England to second place in the
championship behind Grand Slam winner Wales. England won three
away matches in the tournament for the first time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
