Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the U.K.’s third-
largest insurer, paid Chief Executive Officer Julian Roberts 1.9
million pounds ($3.1 million) in total compensation for 2011.  He received 850,000 pounds in base salary and 297,500
pounds in benefits, the company said in its  annual report  today.
He received 610,000 pounds as a cash bonus and 130,000 pounds
from an earlier short-term incentive plan. Roberts’s base salary
climbed 2.4 percent from January to 870,000 pounds.  “Basic salary increases for executive directors effective
in 2012 were below inflation and in line with, or below, average
increases provided to other employees across the group,”
Russell Edey, chairman of London-based Old Mutual’s remuneration
committee, wrote in the annual report.  The shares rose 31 percent in Johannesburg trading last
year, making Old Mutual the best performer on the five-member
FTSE/JSE Africa Life Assurance Index. The insurer said on March
9 full-year operating profit after tax climbed 12 percent to 855
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
