The Swedish Finance Ministry
proposed to raise the tax on some income from carried interest
on owners in private equity funds, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  According to a draft, income up to about 5 million kronor
($750,000) will be from Jan. 1, 2013 taxed as normal income
while earnings above will be taxed as  capital gains  at the rate
of 30 percent.  The changes will affect 100 to 200 individuals and raise
income tax intake by about 100 million a year, the ministry said
in the proposal.  The Swedish private equity sector is the second-biggest in
 Europe  as a share of GDP, the ministry said, with 180,000 people
employed in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
