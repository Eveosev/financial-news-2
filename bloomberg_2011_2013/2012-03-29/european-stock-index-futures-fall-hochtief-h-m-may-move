European stocks  declined the most
in more than three weeks as  Standard & Poor’s  said Greece may
have to restructure its debt again and more Americans than
forecast filed claims for jobless benefits.  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , Europe’s second-largest clothing
retailer, dropped the most in six months as earnings missed
estimates. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, Italy’s third-
biggest bank, tumbled 11 percent after posting a record loss.
 FirstGroup Plc (FGP) , Britain’s biggest train operator, sank 14
percent amid “challenging trading conditions” at its bus unit.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  dropped 1.3 percent to 260.74 at
the close, the biggest decline since March 6. The gauge has
still climbed  6.6 percent  in 2012, the best start to a year
since 2006, as the  European Central Bank  lent about $1.3
trillion to the region’s financial institutions. The number of
shares changing hands was 16 percent more than the average over
the last 30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “After the strong gains through the first quarter, it’s
very reasonable that trading is soft as investors consider their
positions in the wake of some soft data recently,” said Michael Droescher Joergensen, an equity strategist at Nykredit Bank A/S
in Copenhagen.  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets, except Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped
1.2 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index declined 1.4 percent
and Germany’s DAX slumped 1.8 percent.  Greek Restructuring  Greece  will probably have to restructure its debt again and
this may involve bailout partners such as the  International
Monetary Fund ,  Moritz Kraemer , head of sovereign ratings at S&P,
said at an event in  London  late yesterday.  There may be “down the road, I’m not predicting today
when, another restructuring of the outstanding debt,” he said.
“At that time maybe the official creditors need to come into
the boat.”  Speaking at the same event at the London School of
Economics,  Poul Thomsen , the IMF mission chief to Greece, said
while the country has made an “aggressive” fiscal adjustment,
it will take at least a decade to fully complete the country’s
restructuring.  European governments are preparing for a one-year increase
in the ceiling on rescue aid to 940 billion euros ($1.25
trillion) to keep the debt crisis at bay, according to a draft
statement written for finance ministers before they meet in
Copenhagen tomorrow. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  this week
gave her first indication that she is prepared to allow an
increase in the firewall.  Euro-Area Confidence  An indicator of  economic confidence  in the euro region
unexpectedly declined in March. An index of executive and
consumer sentiment in the 17-nation euro area dropped to 94.4
from a revised 94.5 in February, the European Commission said.  In the U.S., initial jobless claims fell 5,000 in the week
ended March 24 to 359,000, the Labor Department reported today.
The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey
called for 350,000 claims.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 3 percent annual rate in the
last three months of 2011, the same as previously estimated,
while corporate profits climbed at the slowest pace in three
years, raising the risk that business investment and hiring will
cool.  H&M Slides  H&M dropped 4.9 percent to 238.1 kronor in Stockholm, the
largest decline since September, after reporting first-quarter
profit that missed  analysts’ estimates  as textile costs and
markdowns weighed on profitability.  Inditex SA (ITX) , Europe’s biggest clothing retailer, slipped 1.7
percent to 70.87 euros in Madrid trading.  Monte dei Paschi di Siena lost 11 percent to 32.1 euro
cents. The bank posted a record loss in the fourth quarter after
4.5 billion euros of writedowns related to acquisitions
including Banca Antonveneta in 2007.  Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl  slid 10 percent to 39.88
euro cents, the largest drop in three months, and Banco Popolare
SC retreated 7.4 percent to 1.41 euros.  FirstGroup plunged 14 percent to 247.4 pence, the biggest
drop since January 2009, after the company said its facing
“challenging trading conditions” in its U.K. bus business
because of the economy.  Rival U.K. bus operators also retreated.  Stagecoach Group
Plc (SGC)  and  National Express Group Plc (NEX)  dropped 3.8 percent to 253
pence and 5.1 percent to 239.2 pence, respectively.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the biggest maker of cancer drugs, fell
1.8 percent to 157 francs after raising its hostile takeover
offer for Illumina Inc. by 15 percent to about $6.7 billion.  Automakers Fall  Daimler AG, the maker of Mercedes luxury cars, dropped 3.3
percent to 44.27 euros while shares of Volkswagen AG, Europe’s
largest automaker, decreased 2.5 percent to 129.65 euros as a
gauge of European carmakers was the second-worst performer among
all 19  industry groups  in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   International Power Plc (IPR)  rallied 5.6 percent to 405 pence as
it received an indicative offer from GDF Suez SA of 6 billion
pounds ($9.5 billion) for the 30 percent stake it doesn’t
already own.  3i Group Plc (III)  rose 2.8 percent to 209.7 pence after the
London-based private equity firm said it reaped 764 million
pounds from asset sales in the 11 months through Feb. 29, up
from 491 million pounds. Separately, Chief Executive Officer
Michael Queen will step down after 25 years at the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
