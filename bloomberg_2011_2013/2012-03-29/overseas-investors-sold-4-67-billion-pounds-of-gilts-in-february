Overseas investors sold a net 4.67
billion pounds ($7.4 billion) of U.K. government bonds last
month as a rally in higher-yielding assets reduced demand for
haven assets.  The sales compared with net purchases of 9.41 billion
pounds in January, according to data published today on the Bank
of England’s  website . It’s the second time in three months that
non-U.K. bondholders were net sellers of the securities.  Gilts made a 1.8 percent loss this year, underperforming
Treasuries, which dropped 1.2 percent during the same period,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The FTSE-100 Index of U.K. shares rose 3.3 percent in
February, after a 2 percent gain the month before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
