Carmelo Anthony and Iman Shumpert
each scored 25 points as the New York Knicks beat the  Orlando
Magic  108-86 to gain a winning record for the first time in 11
weeks.  The victory takes the Knicks to 26-25, the first time
they’ve been above .500 since Jan. 12.  Steve Novak  came off the bench to score 16 points for the
Knicks, who had a 57-41 halftime edge at Madison Square Garden
in New York last night.  The Knicks, who are now 8-1 under interim coach Mike Woodson, played without Amar’e Stoudemire, who will be out for
two to four weeks with a bulging disk in his lower back, and
Jeremy Lin, who has missed two games with a sore left knee.  New York holds the eighth and final playoff spot in the
 National Basketball Association ’s Eastern Division, 2 1/2 games
ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks. The Magic (32-19) are in third
place, 8 1/2 games behind the Chicago Bulls, who defeated the
Atlanta Hawks 98-77 last night.  Jameer Nelson  had 17 points and J.J. Redick added 15 for
the Magic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
