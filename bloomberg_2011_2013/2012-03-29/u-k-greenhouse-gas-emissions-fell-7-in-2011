U.K. output of the six  greenhouse
gases  covered by the Kyoto Protocol emissions-limiting treaty
fell 7 percent in 2011 as household electricity demand declined
and nuclear power accounted for a greater proportion of power
generation, the Department for Energy and Climate Change said.  Emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, fell
8 percent in 2011, the department said in a report published
today on its website, citing provisional data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
