Brazil, the world’s biggest coffee
producer, may stockpile beans to help farmers as production this
year climbs to a record, according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  Coffee output will probably rise to a record in the 2012-13
season starting in July as trees enter the higher-yielding half
of a two-year cycle, the government said. Production is expected
to be 49 million to 52.3 million bags, exceeding the high of
48.5 million bags in 2002, according to a Jan. 10 report from
Conab, the government’s crop forecasting agency. A bag of coffee
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  “What we can do to adjust the balance is take the product
off the market, find more markets to sell it, or utilize it in
the domestic market,” Mendes Ribeiro Filho, the country’s
agriculture minister, said in an interview in London today.  Brazil  may overtake the U.S. as the world’s top coffee
consumer, he said. The South American country consumed 18.9
million bags of coffee in 2010, up 4 percent from a year
earlier, according to the London-based International Coffee
Organization. That compares with 21.8 million bags used in the
U.S., the biggest consumer and an increase of 1.6 percent, ICO
data show.  Brazil, the world’s largest producer of sugar, will invest
in the industry after production in the Center South, the
country’s main sugar cane growing region, fell for the first
time in a decade, the minister said, without providing a figure.  Sugar cane output in the 2011-12 season through Feb. 15 was
494.3 million metric tons, down 11 percent from a year earlier,
industry group Unica estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
