Hong Kong ’s anti-corruption bureau
said it arrested a former government official and two company
executives, after Cable TV earlier reported that Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd.’s co-chairmen and consultant Rafael Hui were
assisting in an investigation.  Five other people were earlier arrested for their alleged
roles in the same suspected corruption case, the  Independent
Commission Against Corruption  said in an e-mailed statement,
without identifying anybody.  Sun Hung Kai, Hong Kong’s biggest developer by market
value, was suspended from trading today with Cable TV showing
co-chairman  Raymond Kwok  entering the commission’s headquarters.
The developer has been run by Thomas and Raymond since the
ouster as chairman in 2008 of their brother Walter, who alleged
they opposed his questions over corporate governance matters.  “This is dynamite,” said Francis Lun, managing director
at Hong Kong-based Lyncean Holdings Ltd. “It will not be good.
All the skeletons from the closet will be exposed.”  Hui, formerly Hong Kong’s No. 2 official, resigned as an
independent director of AIA Group Ltd. “to attend to other
commitments,” the insurance company said in a statement today.  Margaret Ng, a spokeswoman for Sun Hung Kai, declined to
comment, as did Alan Tse, spokesman for ICAC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
