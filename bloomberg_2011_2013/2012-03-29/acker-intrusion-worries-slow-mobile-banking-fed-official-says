U.S. consumer concerns that hackers
may gain access to private financial information are slowing use
of smartphones and mobile devices for personal banking, said
Sandra Braunstein, director of the  Federal Reserve ’s consumer
and community affairs division.  “Consumers expressed concerns about hackers gaining access
to their phones and exposing their personal financial
information,” Braunstein said in remarks prepared for testimony
today to the Senate Banking Committee in Washington.  More than a third of mobile phone users surveyed by the Fed
said they do not know how well the technology protects their
confidential information, and another third said that the
services are “unsafe,” according to Braunstein. Ten percent of
consumers with mobile phones who haven’t used mobile banking
expect to start within a year, she said.  Braunstein said at a July 13 House Financial Services
subcommittee that the Fed will play a role in supervising and
enforcing consumer regulations, even as many of its duties are
shifted to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Kenneth Montgomery, chief operating officer of the Boston
Fed, also testifying before the Senate committee, said in
prepared remarks that the central bank has formed a mobile
payments industry working group to study “how a successful
retail mobile payments ecosystem could evolve in the U.S.”  The group includes representatives of several large banks,
credit card networks, the two largest mobile carriers, payment
processors and members of the Fed Board of Governors and the
Treasury, Montgomery said. The group meets four times a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
