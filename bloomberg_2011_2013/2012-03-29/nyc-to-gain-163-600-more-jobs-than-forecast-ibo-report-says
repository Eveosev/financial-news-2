New York City ’s economy is
performing better than state Labor Department analysts had
projected and may generate 163,600 more jobs than forecast over
six years, the  Independent Budget Office  said.  The revision calls for job gains of 435,000 from 2011
through 2016, up from an original estimate of 271,400. The
employment growth will produce only a modest boost in tax
revenue because most new jobs will come from outside the
financial industry, said the budget office, a non-partisan
monitor of city finances.  The city will have a $1.35 billion surplus this fiscal
year, a $544 million surplus next year and a $2.18 billion
deficit in 2014, the IBO said today. The mayor had projected
balanced budgets this year and in fiscal 2013, with a $3 billion
deficit in 2014. The city’s fiscal year begins July 1.  Tax revenue may rise 4.3 percent this fiscal year to $41.4
billion. In 2013, tax collections may increase an additional 5.5
percent to $43.6 billion, and by 2016, it may reach $51 billion,
the IBO predicted. Bloomberg proposed a $68.7 billion budget for
the most populous U.S. city in February.  “Our projections are built off job numbers that were
substantially revised by the state Labor Department after the
mayor released his budget plan,” the budget office said.  Education, Health Care  Three-quarters of the new jobs will be in education;
health care and social assistance; professional and business
services; leisure and hospitality; and wholesale and retail
trade.  Wall Street  jobs will add about one of 37 new jobs
through 2016, the IBO said.  Tax collections from Wall Street-related activities
accounted for as much as 13 percent of city tax revenue before
the financial crisis of 2008, falling to less than 7 percent
last year, state Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli   said  in February.
They contributed about 20 percent to New York state’s tax
revenue, falling to about 14 percent last year, he said.  “We agree with the IBO’s assessment that the city’s
increase in job growth has been dramatic, but the revenue
picture from Wall Street remains murky and we need to maintain
our discipline in the budget to keep it balanced,” said  Marc LaVorgna , a mayoral spokesman.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
