Anglo American Plc (AAL) ’s  Namdeb Diamond
Corp. , a producer of the gems in  Namibia , approved 280 million
Namibian dollars ($36 million) of funding to build a new mine at
Sendelingsdrif on the Orange River.  “The project is currently in the detailed design phase,”
Chief Executive Officer Inge Zaamwani-Kamwi said today at a
press briefing in the capital, Windhoek. Construction will start
toward the end of 2013 and will take 18 months, she said.  Diamond producers are adding mines as prices for the stones
advance. Rough-diamond prices rose 24 percent last year after
climbing the two previous years as producers struggled to keep
pace with consumption. The use of diamonds may grow at double
the pace of supply through 2020 because of an expanding middle
class in China and India, according to consultants Bain & Co.  The Sendelingsdrif project will create about 200 jobs, the
CEO said. Namdeb, which plans to produce 600,000 carats in 2012,
expects the new mine to produce 45,000 carats a year, she said.
The diamond deposit at Sendelingsdrif is the Orange River’s
largest after Daberas, where mining is being scaled down before
workers and equipment are moved to the new operation, she said.  Namdeb is a venture between Anglo’s  De Beers  and the
government of Namibia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
