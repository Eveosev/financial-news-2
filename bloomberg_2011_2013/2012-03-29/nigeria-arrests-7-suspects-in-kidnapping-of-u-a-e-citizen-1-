Nigeria arrested seven people in
connection with the kidnapping of a  United Arab Emirates 
national who was lured to  Africa ’s top oil producer for a
“phantom business transaction,” a State Security Service
spokeswoman said.  Mohammed Khamis was abducted on Jan. 20 and held in the
town of Ikoyi in the southwestern state of Osun for 60 days,
spokeswoman Marilyn Ogar told reporters today in Abuja, the
capital. Khamis was released on March 19 in the city of Ibadan,
about 140 kilometers (87 miles) north of Lagos, the commercial
capital, and no ransom was paid, she said.  “Four other persons who have been identified as the
masterminds of the kidnapping of Mohammed Khamis are currently
at large,” she said.  The arrested suspects will be charged soon in court, Ogar
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
