Endurance International Group Inc.,
the web hosting and online service provider acquired by  Warburg
Pincus  LLC and GS Capital Partners last year, is seeking a $535
million  term loan  to refinance debt and fund future
acquisitions, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The six-year debt will pay interest at 6.25 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from
each other, will have a floor of 1.5 percent.  Endurance is proposing to sell the loan at 99 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the debt during the first year, the
person said.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the deal for the
Burlington, Massachusetts-based company and will host a lender
meeting April 2 at 2 p.m. in  New York , the person said.  The company’s existing $350 million buyout loan pays
interest at 6.25 percentage points more than Libor with a 1.5
percent floor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt
was sold to investors at 98 cents on the dollar.  Jeffrey Smith , a spokesman for Warburg Pincus, declined to
comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
