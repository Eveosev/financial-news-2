Japan ’s consumer prices
unexpectedly rose in February, a gain that may not be enough to
ease pressure on the central bank for bolder action to end
deflation.  Consumer prices excluding fresh foods climbed 0.1 percent
from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said today in　Tokyo.
The median estimate was for a 0.1 percent decline, in a
Bloomberg News survey of 29 economists.  Some members of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan say
they’re opposing the nomination of BNP Paribas SA economist
Ryutaro Kono to the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s policy board because they
doubt his commitment to ending deflation. Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa’s officials may need to enlarge a 30 trillion yen
($364 billion) asset-purchase fund, according to economists
including Kyohei Morita.  “The bar is high for ending entrenched deflation,’’
Morita, chief economist at  Barclays Capital  in Tokyo, said
before the report was released. ’’The BOJ is likely to introduce
more easing measures this year.’’  The gain in prices was the first in five months. January’s
decline was 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
