A federal report on the  BP Plc (BP/) 
spill, the worst U.S. offshore oil accident, may be delayed for
a third time as investigators complete the review, the Obama
administration said.  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement  and the U.S. Coast Guard had pushed back release of
the report to July 27 from March 27 after examination of
equipment used for the deep-water well took longer than
 anticipated . The government study was initially due on Jan. 27.  The investigation by the Interior Department unit and the
marine agency will identify the reasons for the April 20, 2010,
Deepwater Horizon rig explosion, which killed 11 workers and
spewed crude into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days.  “To ensure that all evidence is properly weighed and
considered, the Joint Investigation Team is taking additional
time to finalize the report,” Eileen P. Angelico, a spokeswoman
for the bureau, said today in an e-mail. “The team is in the
final stages of completing its report and expects to release it
in the near future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
