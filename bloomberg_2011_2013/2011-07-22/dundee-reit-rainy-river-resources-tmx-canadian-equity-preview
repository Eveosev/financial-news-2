Canadian stocks rose for a fourth
day, extending a weekly gain, as gold advanced after  Fitch
Ratings  said a new bailout of  Greece  will be considered a
“restricted default.”  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest producer of the
metal by market value, increased 2.6 percent as the euro fell
against 13 of 16 other major currencies, boosting precious-
metals prices. Contract manufacturer  Celestica Inc. (CLS)  soared 11
percent after beating analysts’ profit estimates. Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest fertilizer producer by
market value, rallied 2 percent on concern a flood at a mine in
 Belarus  may tighten world potash supplies.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index climbed 60.33
points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,494.63 to complete a 1.5 percent
weekly increase.  “Fitch Ratings, what they’ve said is the role of the
private sector in the Greek bailout plan will really constitute
a bit of a restricted default,” Luciano Orengo, who manages
C$1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) at Manulife Financial Corp., said
in a telephone interview. “People didn’t like the wording of
that. That’s why you’re seeing a rise in gold prices again.”  The Canadian stock benchmark advanced 1.4 percent in the
previous three sessions as banks and energy producers climbed on
speculation European leaders would reach an agreement to contain
the continent’s debt crisis. Euro-area leaders yesterday
announced 159 billion euros ($229 billion) in new aid for Greece
and an expansion of the role of their 440-billion-euro rescue
fund.  Debt Concern  Gold increased 0.9 percent and silver 3 percent as the euro
fell on concern the agreement won’t stop the crisis’s spread.  Goldcorp climbed 2.6 percent to C$51.47.  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest producer of the metal, rose 1.6
percent to C$47.62.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) ,  Canada ’s fourth-
largest precious-metals company by market value, gained 3.6
percent to C$37.45.  Lake Shore Gold Corp. (LSG) , which operates in Ontario, rebounded
15 percent from a 25-month low to C$2.39 after Marc Johnson, an
analyst at M Partners Inc., said in a note to clients the
company “has been unfairly punished by the market” after
cutting its 2011 production forecast on July 19. The shares sank
39 percent in the following three days.  First Uranium  Gold and uranium producer  First Uranium Corp. (FIU)  soared a
record 53 percent to 59 Canadian cents after AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. agreed to buy a 20 percent stake in the company for 60
Canadian cents a share.  Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , a mining company controlled by Moscow-
based ARMZ Uranium Holding, advanced 8.3 percent to C$3.51.
Uranium producer  Denison Mines Corp. (DML)  increased 10 percent to
C$2.06.  Celestica and  Precision Drilling Corp. (PD)  surged after
reporting second-quarter earnings that beat their average
analyst estimates in Bloomberg surveys.  Celestica, which makes electronics for companies including
Research In Motion Ltd. and Cisco Systems Inc., soared 11
percent to C$8.89 after surpassing the average of analyst
estimates by 12 percent, excluding certain items. The shares
haven’t jumped that much in a day since June 2009.  Precision Drilling, Canada’s largest drilling company by
market value, advanced for a ninth day, rallying 8.5 percent to
C$16.69. The company’s profit topped the average estimate by 18
percent, excluding certain items. Its streak of gains is the
longest since August 2006.  Oil Rises  Other energy companies advanced as crude oil climbed for a
fourth day to a six-week high.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , the owner of
the country’s largest pipeline system, increased 1.4 percent to
C$40.61.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) , which operates in  North America ,
the  North Sea  and  Indonesia , rose 2.1 percent to C$19.58.  Fertilizer producers gained after Joel Jackson, an analyst
at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to clients that flooding at
Belaruskali’s mine “could be more serious relative to initial
details that surfaced a few weeks back.”  Potash Corp. advanced 2 percent to C$58.50.  Agrium Inc. (AGU) ,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, increased 1.3
percent to C$87.92.  West Fraser Timber Co., Canada’s largest forestry company,
tumbled 10 percent, the most since 2008, to C$45.79 after its
second-quarter earnings trailed the average of analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg survey by 59 percent, excluding certain items.  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the forestry operator fighting a short
seller’s assertions of financial manipulation, rose 11 percent
to C$5.19 to extend its four-day climb to 47 percent. On July
20, New Zealand billionaire Richard Chandler disclosed he had
increased his stake in the company to 11 percent the previous
day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
