The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average rose by
the most this month as a bailout plan for Greece eased concern
Europe’s debt crisis will spread, reducing uncertainty over
earnings at financial companies and exporters.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,  Japan ’s second-
largest publicly traded bank, rose 3.6 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a
camera maker that gets more than 80 percent of its revenue
outside Japan, climbed 1.3 percent.  Terumo Corp. (4543)  advanced 1.3
percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the maker of medical
devices may post record first-quarter profit.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.2 percent to 10,132.11 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, the most since June 29. The broader Topix index
gained 1 percent to 868.81, with about three stocks rising for
each that fell. For the week, the Nikkei advanced 1.6 percent,
while the Topix added 1.1 percent.  “The European Union’s plan to enhance support for  Greece 
gives markets around the world a sense of security,” said
 Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $84
billion. “Strong corporate earnings in Japan and the U.S. are
also supporting stocks.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. The index rose 1.4 percent yesterday in  New York 
as European officials announced 159 billion euros ($230 billion)
in new aid for Greece to stop the region’s debt crisis from
spreading. Shares also advanced after companies from Morgan
Stanley to Microsoft Inc. reported profits that beat estimates.  Rescue Fund  Euro-area leaders gave their 440 billion euro rescue fund
the power to buy debt across stressed euro nations after a
market rout and spiking bond yields in Italy and Spain last week
sparked concern the crisis was widening.  Banks provided the biggest support to the Topix. Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group rose 3.6 percent to 2,530 yen.  Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , the country’s largest bank by market
value, jumped 3.3 percent to 407 yen.  “Confirmation there’s going to be more support for Greece
eases concern about the financial system,” said Juichi Wako, a
senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “It gives
investors a little more tolerance for risk.”  Shares of lenders also got a boost from a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. report yesterday that said lower credit costs and
increased overseas business will help Japanese banks report
“firm” first-quarter earnings. The report called Mitsubishi
UFJ a top pick.  Mitsubishi UFJ  The Nikkei newspaper reported today that Mitsubishi UFJ’s
net income may have more than doubled to about 400 billion yen
in the quarter ended June 30. Earnings were boosted by a $200
billion yen premium paid to the bank by Morgan Stanley in
exchange for converting preferred shares into common stock, the
report said.  The euro strengthened to the highest level against the yen
since July 11 as officials drew concessions from Germany, the
 European Central Bank  and investors for a strategy to support
Greece. A weaker yen helps Japanese exporters because it
increases the value of overseas sales.  Canon, which gets about 30 percent of its sales in Europe,
climbed 1.3 percent to 3,785 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s biggest carmaker, gained 0.8 percent to 3,335 yen.  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics by sales,
increased 1.1 percent to 2,100 yen.  ‘Major Budget Deal’  In the U.S., the S&P 500 extended gains yesterday after the
New York Times reported President Barack Obama and House Speaker
 John Boehner  were close to a “major budget deal,” boosting
optimism the government will avoid defaulting on its debt.  Jay
Carney , Obama’s spokesman, and Boehner responded to the story by
saying there is no deal.  Shares of Japanese companies also gained on reports
earnings are improving. Terumo, a maker of medical devices
including infusion pumps and oxygenators, rose 1.3 percent to
4,535 yen. Operating profit probably increased 7 percent to
about 17 billion yen ($216 million) in the April-June period, a
record for the quarter, the Nikkei newspaper said today. Terumo
reports first quarter results on July 28.  Nippon Shokubai Co. climbed 1.4 percent to 1,061 yen. The
maker of ethylene oxide and acrylic acid will likely generate a
20 percent gain in operating profit in the six months through
September because of sales of a polymer used in disposable
diapers, the Nikkei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
