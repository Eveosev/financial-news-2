Oil options decreased as the
underlying futures climbed to a six-week high on optimism that
the U.S. will increase its debt ceiling and as euro-region
leaders worked to convince investors that plans to contain the
debt crisis will be adequate.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 28.9 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for September delivery rose 74 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $99.87 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since June 14. The price rose
2.3 percent in the past five days, capping a fourth consecutive
weekly increase. They have climbed 26 percent in the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $85 puts, with 1,192 lots changing hands. They slipped
8 cents to 21 cents a barrel. September $95 puts, the next-most
active option, tumbled 26 cents to $1.35 a barrel with 1,122
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  September $80 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 4,821 lots changing hands. They fell 2 cents to
