Kenya Railways Corp. , the state-
owned transport company, said it plans to build 12 new commuter-
train stations in and around Nairobi, the capital.  Kenya Railways is building a 100-kilometer (62-mile)
commuter rail line in the city at a cost of 16 billion shillings
($178 million), Managing Director Nduva Muli told reporters
today. The stations, two of which will be completed by December,
are the first to be constructed since 1935, he said.  “This project is aimed at decongesting the city,” Muli
said during a tour of the first new station in Syokimau, about
15 kilometers south of Nairobi. The station will have the
capacity to handle 20,000 passengers daily and will be linked to
the  Jomo Kenyatta International Airport .  Kenya Railways is upgrading the railway line between the
Kenyan port of Mombasa and Kampala,  Uganda ’s capital, a project
likely to be completed in 2017, Muli said.  It’s also studying plans for a line connecting the proposed
port of Lamu on the Kenyan coast to Juba, the capital of newly
independent  South Sudan , and to Addis-Ababa, the Ethiopian
capital, he said. According to a preliminary design by Japan
Port Consultants, the railway line would cost $7.1 billion. It
would take a year to find financing and could be completed by
2018, Muli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
