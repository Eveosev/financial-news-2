Coffee production in  India , the
third biggest grower in Asia, may rise 6.7 percent to a record
next year aided by good rains, and likely boosting exports.  Output for the crop year starting Oct. 1 may rise to
322,250 metric tons from 302,000 tons a year ago, the state-
owned  Coffee Board  said today. Arabica production may gain 11
percent to 104,525 tons, while robusta output may advance 4.8
percent to 217,725 tons next year, it said.  A record crop in India, which exports almost two-thirds of
its output, may cool robusta coffee prices, which jumped 24
percent in the first five months this year, before sliding 4
percent in June. Arabica futures in  New York  jumped to a 14-year
high in May, raising costs for Nestle SA and Kraft Foods Inc.,
as smaller global crops and rising demand cut inventories.  Robusta coffee for September delivery gained 2.1 percent to
$2,044 a ton in  London . Arabica coffee for September delivery
was up 0.4 percent at $2.4165 a pound in New York.  “Good weather and crop condition, and relatively stable
prices encouraged better husbandry practices, helping to
invigorate production in Karnataka,” the board said. Karnataka
produces around 70 percent of the country’s total output.  Arabica beans are grown mainly in  Latin America  and brewed
by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta, used
in instant coffee, is harvested in  Asia  and parts of  Africa .  India’s coffee shipments during Oct. 1-July 21 jumped to
303,680 tons valued at $887.46 million, compared with 213,508
tons worth $454.53 million a year earlier, according to the
board. The country exported 268,989 tons in 2010-11.  Italy and Russia are among the buyers of Indian coffee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
