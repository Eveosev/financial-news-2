Vietnam ’s government bonds dropped
after yields climbed at a debt auction. The dong was steady.  The State Treasury sold 550 billion dong ($26.7 million) of
three-year bonds yesterday, less than the 2 trillion dong it
originally planned to auction, the Hanoi Stock Exchange said in
a statement on its website. The securities were sold at a coupon
of 12.34 percent, compared with 12.2 percent for 1.2 trillion
dong of similar-maturity notes auctioned last week.  “Bond yields in the secondary market will follow the trend
of the yields at auctions,” said Nguyen Hong Quang, a fixed-
income dealer at Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development in
Hanoi. “Banks are expecting the treasury to increase yields
further, especially as big lenders have not participated
actively yet.”  The yield on the three-year notes rose three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, this week and today to 12.41 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 20,580 per dollar as of 3:57
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency fell 0.1 percent this week. The central bank fixed the
 reference rate  at 20,608 today, unchanged since July 11,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
