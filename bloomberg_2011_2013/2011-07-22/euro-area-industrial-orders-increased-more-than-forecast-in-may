European industrial orders surged in
May as faster growth in France, Italy and  Spain  offset a
slowdown in  Germany , the region’s largest economy.  Orders in the euro area advanced 3.6 percent after a
revised 0.1 percent drop in April, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had
forecast a gain of 0.8 percent, the median of 18 predictions in
a Bloomberg News survey showed. Orders jumped 15.5 percent from
a year earlier.  European manufacturers are powering the region’s expansion
as booming Asian markets boost export demand. Volkswagen AG,
 Europe ’s biggest carmaker, said July 15 it expects to continue
outperforming the auto market in the second half of the year as
the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company benefits from growth in
emerging markets such as Brazil.  Industrial orders in Germany rose 2.2 percent in May after
a 2.5 percent increase a month earlier, today’s report showed.
France, Italy and Spain all reversed contractions, with demand
up 2.3 percent, 3.8 percent and 3 percent, respectively.  Euro-area orders for capital goods rose 3.2 percent in May
after rising 1.3 percent a month earlier. Orders for durable
 consumer goods  slipped 2.2 percent, while those for intermediate
goods gained 2.5 percent. Total orders excluding heavy transport
equipment such as ships and trains rose 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
