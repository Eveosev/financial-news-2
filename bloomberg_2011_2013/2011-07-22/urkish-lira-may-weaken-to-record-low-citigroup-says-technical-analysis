The lira, this year’s worst-
performing emerging-market currency, may weaken 9.3 percent to
an all-time low against the dollar, according to Citigroup
Inc.’s analysis of trading patterns.  The Turkish currency headed for its lowest close since
March 2009 and the  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  of stocks fell for a
seventh day in its longest declining streak in almost three
years after  Fitch Ratings  said  Turkey ’s record current-account
deficit is causing “uncertainty” on its outlook for an
investment-grade rating.  The lira, which hit a record low of 1.8066 per dollar in
March 2009, rallied and retreated three times, reaching 1.6784
today. This completes a “head-and-shoulders,” which occurs
when a price forms three consecutive peaks of valleys, the
middle being the largest, according to Citigroup.  “The completed reverse head-and-shoulders pattern on
dollar/lira continues to suggest further dollar strength and
eventual test of 1.85, which converges with the trend across the
major multi-year highs,” Citigroup said in a research note
received late yesterday.  The lira lost 0.5 percent to 1.6784 per dollar as of 1:45
p.m. in Istanbul, a drop of 1.5 percent this week. The ISE
National index slid 0.5 percent to 60,610.97, a retreat of 3.2
percent so far this week.  Any further declines could be exacerbated if the index
breaches the support level of 58,000, Citigroup said. A support
level indicates a price at which buy orders may accumulate and
help and asset rebound. The ISE 100 touched 58,664.24 March 2.  A breach of the 58,000 would take the gauge “outside of
its range-bound price action, opening the way for lower
levels,” according to the note.  The lira and Turkish stocks slumped today even as the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index and most developing-nation currencies
rallied after European leaders yesterday pledged more aid for
 Greece , bolstering demand for riskier, emerging-market assets.  Citigroup sees the lira depreciating to 1.71 per dollar in
the third quarter, versus a median estimate of 1.58 of 21 banks
polled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
