Kenyan Finance Minister  Uhuru
Kenyatta  may impose price caps on essential goods to cushion the
effects of accelerating inflation, Business Daily reported,
citing draft legislation.  A bill is expected to be presented to parliament next week,
the Nairobi-based newspaper said. If passed, the law would
enable the government to choose the list of essential goods to
be controlled, it said.  A similar bill last year, which proposed caps on the prices
of wheat flour, corn, cooking oil and diesel, was rejected by
President Mwai Kibaki, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
