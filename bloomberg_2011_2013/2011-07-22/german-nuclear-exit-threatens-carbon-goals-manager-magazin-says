Germany  may not reach its
greenhouse-gas reduction targets as it pursues plans to drop
nuclear power,  Manager Magazin  reported, citing Hans-Peter Keitel, head of the BDI federation of German industry.  Germany, which aims to reduce emissions 40 percent by 2020
from 1990 levels, will produce more carbon dioxide as it shuts
down its atomic reactors, Keitel told the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
