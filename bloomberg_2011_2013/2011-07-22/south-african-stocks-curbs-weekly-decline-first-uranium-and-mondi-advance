first in five weeks.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN)  , the largest maker
of generic medicines in the southern hemisphere, fell the most
in four months, dropping 2.44 rand, or 2.8 percent, to 84.06
rand. The company was rated “underperform” in new coverage at
Credit Suisse AG by equity analyst Mark Wadley, with a price
estimate of 82.50 rand.  First Uranium Corp. (FUM)  , a Toronto-based company that
mines gold as well as uranium, jumped the most in eight months,
rising 1.05 rand, or 36 percent, to 4 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. (ANG)   will buy a 19.79 percent stake in First Uranium

paper, closed at its highest in a week, increasing 1.10 rand, or
