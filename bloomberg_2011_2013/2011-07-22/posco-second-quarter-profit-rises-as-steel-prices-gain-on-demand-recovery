Posco (005490) , the world’s third-biggest
steelmaker, reported a 23 percent increase in second-quarter
profit as a recovery in demand allowed it to increase prices.  Group net income rose to 1.37 trillion won ($1.3 billion)
in the three months ended June 30 from 1.12 trillion won a year
earlier, the Pohang, South Korea-based company said today in a
statement. Sales gained 58 percent to 17.05 trillion won.  The steelmaker aims to produce 37.1 million metric tons of
crude steel this year and post 40 trillion won of sales,
unchanged from the targets announced in April. Posco raised the
prices of benchmark hot-rolled steel plates by about 18 percent
in April.  “Second-quarter results may be the best for this year on
increased values of inventories,” Kim Kang Oh, an analyst at
Hanwha Securities Co. in Seoul, said before the announcement.  Shares in Posco,  Asia ’s top steelmaker by market value,
have fallen 6 percent since March 31, compared with a 3.1
percent gain in the local benchmark  Kospi index. (KOSPI)  Baoshan Iron &
Steel Co., the world’s second-biggest steelmaker, has declined
17 percent, while ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest producer,
has dropped 8.2 percent since March 31.  Sales Outlook  Group sales are expected to rise to 66.4 trillion won this
year from 47.9 trillion won in 2010, according to Posco’s
presentation to investors in Seoul.  Posco plans to invest overall 9.7 trillion won this year,
according to the statement.  “To achieve the long-term growth momentum, Posco will go
ahead with investments in steel sectors as planned,” the
steelmaker said in an e-mailed statement today.  Posco paid miners 25 percent more for  iron ore  and about 47
percent more for coking coal for the quarter, compared with the
previous three months.  The company increased steel prices by 160,000 won per
metric ton on April 22, indicating an 18 percent gain in hot-
rolled steel plates and a 16 percent increase in cold-rolled
steel plates, according to a company presentation that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
