StanCorp Financial Group Inc. (SFG) , the
Portland, Oregon-based disability insurer, fell the most since
2008 as profit plunged, missing analysts’ estimates.  The insurer dropped $5.72, or 14 percent, to $35.50 at 4:03
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
had slipped 21 percent this year.  Second-quarter net income dropped 54 percent to $18.8
million, or 42 cents a share, from $41.1 million, or 87 cents,
as the cost of benefits increased, the company said in a
statement late yesterday. Operating earnings, which exclude some
investment results, were 61 cents a share, missing the average
$1.03 estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Higher-than-expected claims incidence in the company’s
group long-term disability insurance business” are weighing on
results,  Standard & Poor’s  said today as it lowered the
counterparty  credit rating  to BBB+ from A- for the firm.  The insurer has raised prices to “address the higher
claims in the current economic environment,” StanCorp Chief
Executive Officer Greg Ness said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
