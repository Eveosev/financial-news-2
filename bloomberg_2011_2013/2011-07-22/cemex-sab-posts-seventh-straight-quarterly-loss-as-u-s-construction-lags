Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, reported a loss for a seventh straight quarter
and wider than analysts’ expectations because of lagging U.S.
housing and public-works construction.  The second-quarter loss totaled $294 million, or 28 cents
per American depositary receipt, compared with a loss of $306
million, or 31 cents, a  year  earlier. Sales rose 8.7 percent to
$4.1 billion, the Monterrey, Mexico-based company said in a
statement today. Analysts predicted a loss of 6 cents per ADR,
the average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. was Cemex’s largest market by sales after it paid
$14.2 billion for Rinker Group Ltd. in July 2007, just as the
 construction industry  slipped into recession. After that, the
U.S. became Cemex’s second market behind Mexico and operating
 cash flow  has been negative in the U.S. for the last 11
quarters.  “The entire housing sector continues to be plagued, among
other things, by a high level of distressed mortgages across
most of the states in the U.S., and a large foreclosure
inventory,” Vanessa Quiroga, an analyst with Credit Suisse AG
in  Mexico  City, said in a report earlier this month.  One-time expenses totaling $202 million included severance
payments and impairment on the value of assets, according to the
statement.  Cash Flow  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization -- a measure of cash flow known as Ebitda -- fell
7.4 percent to $615 million from $664 million a year ago. In the
U.S. Ebitda was a loss of $22.3 million compared with a gain of
$16.6 million a year ago.  Free cash flow, or cash from operations after capital
expenses, was negative for a second consecutive quarter.
Cemex’s total debt plus its perpetual notes rose to $18.4
billion from $17.9 billion a year ago.  Sales in Mexico rose 4.9 percent to $968 million as cement
shipments climbed 3 percent and prices in dollars rose 11
percent because of a stronger  Mexican peso . In the U.S., sales
fell 9.5 percent to $619 million because of a 10 percent decline
in cement shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
