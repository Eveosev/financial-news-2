Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, reported a larger-than-expected jump in profit as
demand in  Europe  and North America rose and the Swedish company
held down costs. The shares rose the most in seven months.  Second-quarter net income gained 62 percent to 5.12 billion
kronor ($816 million) from 3.15 billion kronor a year earlier,
the Gothenburg, Sweden-based company said today in a  statement .
Profit beat the average estimate of 4.82 billion kronor in a
Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts. Revenue rose 15 percent to 79
billion kronor.  “There’s almost no signs of them slowing down, especially
in the truck division,” Morten Imsgard, an analyst at Sydbank
A/S in Aabenraa,  Denmark , with an “overweight” recommendation
on Volvo’s shares, said by phone. “They keep on going with a
very impressive cost control.”  The company’s operating margin widened to 9.7 percent of
sales from 6.9 percent a year earlier. Volvo reiterated its
industry forecast for heavy trucks sales this year of 230,000 to
240,000 vehicles in both  North America , where it said demand is
being driven by fleet replacements, and Europe. Truck orders in
the quarter increased 34 percent to 65,006 vehicles, led by the
two regions.  Volvo rose as much as 5.3 percent to 107.40 kronor, the
biggest intraday gain since Dec. 1, 2010, and was up 4.1 percent
as of 9:17 a.m. in  Stockholm .  Mack Trucks  “The improvement in earnings comes from higher sales
combined with improved efficiency of the industrial system as
well as higher gross margins attributable to competitive
products,” Chief Executive Officer Leif Johansson said in the
statement.  Volvo, the maker of Mack trucks in North America and
Renault trucks in Europe, recalled 700 workers at its plant in
New River Valley,  Virginia , in March to boost production.
Registrations of heavy commercial vehicles in the European Union
rose 62 percent this year through May compared with the same
period last year, the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association said last month.  The total market for heavy trucks in North America rose 45
percent to 93,088 trucks through June, Volvo said.  Market conditions for Volvo’s construction-equipment
business, its second-biggest unit, are “expected to remain
positive” through 2011, with North America set to grow by a
range of 25 percent to 35 percent, the company said. The Chinese
market has “slowed down” due to the government’s effort to
limit inflation, it said.  Swedish rival  Scania AB (SCVB)  reported yesterday that net income
rose 2.4 percent to 2.43 billion kronor as sales climbed 12
percent to 23 billion kronor.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest
truckmaker, will publish figures on July 27, and  MAN SE (MAN)  will
report results on July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
