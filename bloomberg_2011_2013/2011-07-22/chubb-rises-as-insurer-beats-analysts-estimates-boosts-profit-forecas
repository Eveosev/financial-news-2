Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
commercial property and high-end homes, rose the most since last
year in New York trading after profit beat analysts’ estimates
and the company boosted its forecast for 2011.  Chubb advanced $1.90, or 3 percent, to $64.46 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The insurer gained
8.1 percent this year, compared with a 6.4 percent drop in the
24-company KBW Insurance Index.  Second-quarter operating profit was $1.27 a share, the
Warren, New Jersey-based insurer said in a statement late
yesterday, beating by 28 cents the average estimate of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales advanced, led by gains
outside the U.S.  “Underwriting income was much better than we modeled and
the biggest reason for the beat,” said Steven Labbe, an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC’s Langen McAlenney division.
“Additionally, investment income and buyback activity were each
better than we modeled and guidance was increased.”  Chubb raised its forecast for 2011 operating earnings to a
range of $5.55 to $5.85 a share, compared with a January
forecast of $5.35 to $5.75.  Net income fell 19 percent to $419 million on increased
claims from catastrophes including U.S. storms. Competitor
Travelers Cos. posted its first loss in seven years yesterday on
losses from the natural disasters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
