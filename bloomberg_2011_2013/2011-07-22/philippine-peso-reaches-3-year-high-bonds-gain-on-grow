The Philippine peso rose to a three-
year high and bonds advanced on optimism overseas investors will
buy more of the nation’s assets to benefit from economic growth
and improving state finances.  The currency completed its biggest weekly gain since
September after the  International Monetary Fund  said on July 20
that the near-term outlook for the Philippines was favorable.
The peso climbed today after euro-area leaders announced 159
billion euros ($229 billion) in new aid for  Greece  yesterday.  “The fundamentals, growth prospects and the fiscal side
remain positive in the Philippines,” said Lito Biacora, vice
president for treasury at Bank of the Philippine Islands in
Manila. “There is improvement in sentiment for riskier assets
due to some resolution in  Europe .”  The peso strengthened 1.3 percent this week to 42.403 per
dollar at the 4 p.m. close in Manila, the strongest level since
May 2008, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It rose 0.5 percent
today.  The yield on the 7 percent bonds due April 2016 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week to 4.94
percent, according to prices from Philippine Dealing & Exchange
Corp.  The peso is trading in the “same band as our peer
countries” and the  exchange rate  is being determined by the
market,” Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said in an interview
with ABS-CBN News Channel today.  The economy expanded 7.6 percent last year, the fastest
pace since at least 1999, official data show. Growth may average
5 percent in 2011 and 2012, IMF mission chief Vivek Arora said
this week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
