U.S. corn and soybean crops will be
smaller than estimated by the government as hot, dry weather
reduces yields,  Lanworth Inc.  said.  Corn farmers will harvest 12.903 billion bushels, below the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s July 12 forecast of 13.47
billion, Lanworth said today in a statement. Production is
estimated at 12.599 billion to 13.271 billion, depending on
August weather, the Itasca, Illinois-based forecaster said. The
average yield was estimated at 153.6 bushels an acre, compared
with the USDA’s forecast of 158.7 bushels.  The soybean harvest will total 3.067 billion bushels, down
from the USDA estimate of 3.225 billion earlier this month. The
crop range was 2.982 billion to 3.195 billion, based on various
August weather conditions. The yield was forecast at 41.3
bushels  The USDA will update its estimates on Aug. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
