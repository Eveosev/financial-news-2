Almirall SA (ALM)  fell the most in almost
nine months in Madrid trading as  Spain ’s health ministry and the
country’s regions approved steps to increase use of generic
drugs to cut pharmaceutical spending.  Almirall, whose drugs include Actikerall and Sativex, fell
7.4 percent, or 51 cents, to 6.43 euros, the steepest decline
since October 2010, valuing the company at 1.07 billion euros
($1.53 billion).  “We think it’s the news about generics” that caused the
drop, said Luis Navia, an analyst at Espirito Santo Research in
Madrid. The company would be hurt if spending increases on
generic drugs, which it doesn’t manufacture, he said in a phone
interview.  Spain’s health ministry and the regions approved a policy
so patients will be able to ask for the cheapest generic drug
available in pharmacies, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. Steps to cut spending will allow cost
savings of 2.4 billion euros, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
