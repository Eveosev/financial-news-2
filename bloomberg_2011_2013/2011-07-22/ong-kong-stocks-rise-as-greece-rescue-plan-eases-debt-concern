it removed some overhang from the market on the deteriorating
sovereign debt situation,” said  Alex Au , managing director of
Richland Capital Management Ltd. in Hong Kong, which oversees
about $300 million of assets. “The concern isn’t gone
completely but at least it looks like all of Europe is working
hard together to solve the issue.”  The Hang Seng Index gained 2.1 percent to 22,444.80 at the

earnings, compared with about 14.4 times at the end of 2010. The
