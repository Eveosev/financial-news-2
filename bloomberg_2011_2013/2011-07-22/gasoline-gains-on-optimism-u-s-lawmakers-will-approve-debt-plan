Gasoline futures gained in  New York 
on optimism that U.S. lawmakers will agree on a plan to boost
the debt limit and avoid default.  Gasoline rose as much as 0.8 percent as President Barack Obama and House Speaker  John Boehner  pressed for a broad
agreement to raise the debt limit before the Aug. 2 deadline to
avoid default.  “What’s critical is whether or not the market thinks we’re
going to get a debt deal done in the U.S.,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “Yesterday,
people were buying oil. Today, they bought products as they wait
to hear the outcome.”  Gasoline for August delivery rose 0.68 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $3.1063 a gallon at 9:43 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have dropped 0.7 percent this week.  Obama met with top Democrats at the White House last night
after his party balked at a potential deal with Boehner that
would lower the long-term debt by about $3 trillion over 10
years through deep spending cuts without an immediate increase
in taxes.  Futures touched $3.123 before paring gains as the euro fell
against the dollar for the first time in four days. The euro
lost 0.5 percent to $1.4346 at 9:45 a.m. in New York on concern
European officials aren’t doing enough to forestall a regional
debt crisis.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.6
cent to $3.695 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for August delivery gained 1.37 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.1129 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
