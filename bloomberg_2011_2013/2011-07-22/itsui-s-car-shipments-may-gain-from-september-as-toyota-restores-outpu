Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., operator
of the world’s largest merchant fleet, said its car exports may
rise from September as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and other automakers
restore production disrupted after the March 11 earthquake.  “The recovery is faster than expected, and should pick up
to the same level as last year or even better in September,”
Chairman Akimitsu Ashida said in an interview yesterday.  The Tokyo-based company expects its car shipments may fall
10 percent in July and 15 percent in August as summer vacations
and efforts to conserve energy slow auto production, Ashida said.  Toyota’s output is rebounding ahead of schedule after the
earthquake and tsunami prompted the company to cut output,
President  Akio Toyoda  said June 30.  Vehicle exports by Japan’s 12 manufacturers plunged for the
third month in May. Exports dropped 26 percent in March, 68
percent in April and 41 percent in May, according to the  Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
