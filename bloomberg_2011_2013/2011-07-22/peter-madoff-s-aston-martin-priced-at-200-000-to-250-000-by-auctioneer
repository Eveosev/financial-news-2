An auctioneer said a vintage  Aston
Martin  sports car previously owned by Peter Madoff, brother of
Bernard L. Madoff, is worth $200,000 to $250,000, according to
an online sale catalog.  RM Auctions  will sell the 1958 Aston Martin MK III Drophead
Coupe at a Monterey, California, sale on Aug. 19 without a
minimum bid, said the company’s spokeswoman, Amy Christie. After
a restoration the car has a “factory correct” carriage green
finish and is trimmed in tan leather upholstery, according to
the catalog.  The proceeds will be used to help pay the jailed con man’s
former investors, who lost as much as $19 billion in the  Ponzi
scheme , according to  Irving Picard , the trustee liquidating
Madoff’s firm in  New York .  Madoff’s U.K. firm bought the car for  Peter Madoff  in 2008
for $267,000 and wasn’t reimbursed for the expense, Picard said
in a court filing.  The Madoff car, showing about 30,400 miles, is one of 84
Drophead Coupes built and has a “well-maintained older
restoration,” according to the catalog. It had a service and
“paintwork” in 2008 from Aston Workshop in the U.K. at a
recorded 30,184 miles, RM said. The restoration has held up and
the car performed well on a recent road test, it said in the
catalog.  ‘Madoff Provenance’  “If I was bidding, I’d bid on the merits of the car and
I’d not particularly want to brag about the Madoff provenance,”
James Knight, a car specialist at Bonhams, a London-based
auction house, said when the auction was announced.  As many as 3,500 people attend the vintage sports car event
in Monterey, Picard has said.  Featured lots for the Monterey sale include a 1970 Porsche
911S delivered to late actor Steve McQueen on the set of the
motorsport movie, “ Le Mans ,” according to RM’s website.  Charles Spada, a lawyer for Peter Madoff, has declined to
comment on the pending auction.  Peter Madoff, sued by U.K. liquidators in 2009 for
allegedly enriching himself unjustly by taking the Aston Martin,
transferred ownership of the car to Picard on May 4, the trustee
said in a filing. It is being auctioned with agreement from the
U.K. liquidators, Picard said.  Peter Madoff was chief compliance officer at Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC. He was among those to whom
 Bernard Madoff  confessed shortly before his arrest, according to
 Ira Sorkin , a lawyer for Bernard Madoff. Peter Madoff also co-
signed Bernard Madoff’s $10 million bond following the money
manager’s arrest.  The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
