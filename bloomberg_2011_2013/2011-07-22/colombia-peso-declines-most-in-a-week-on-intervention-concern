Colombia’s peso fell the most in a
week on concern the government of President  Juan Manuel Santos 
could step up efforts to curb the currency’s rally.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 1,756.9 per dollar at 10:33
a.m. New York time, from 1,753.75 yesterday, the steepest
decline since July 15. For the week, the currency gained 0.3
percent. It has jumped 9.4 percent since March 1, the best
performance among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “When the peso gets near 1,750, people get nervous at the
local level about government intervention and the currency tends
to drop,” said  Camilo Perez , head of research at  Banco de
Bogota SA. (BOGOTA)  “There has been all sorts of speculation about
measures the central bank or finance ministry might take.”  The peso yesterday neared the three-year high of 1,748.50
reached on July 14.  In a bid to ease the peso’s rally, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in April the government would create an
overseas fund with as much as $1.2 billion from dollars bought
in the local market through the end of 2011, and forgo
repatriating funds from abroad for the rest of the year. Since
Sept. 15, the central bank has bought a minimum of $20 million
daily in the  currency market , and plans to keep up the purchases
until at least Sept. 30.  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.82 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.180
centavo to 117.407 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
