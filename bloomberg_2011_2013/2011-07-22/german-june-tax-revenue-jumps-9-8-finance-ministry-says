German  tax revenue  climbed 9.8
percent in June from a year earlier, the  Finance Ministry  said,
even as it warned that the economy will show a “flatter growth
path” in the second half of 2011.  Tax revenue rose to 53.2 billion euros ($76.4 billion), the
ministry said today in its monthly report. The Berlin-based
ministry aims to collect 4.4 percent more tax this year as a
whole, compared with 2010.  “The current pattern of indicators suggests that economic
dynamism has clearly lessened compared with the start of the
year,” the ministry said. “The economic upswing in Germany
likely continued at a clearly slower pace in the second quarter.
Some sentiment indicators seem to have reached their cyclical
peaks already.”  German investor confidence dropped more and European
services and manufacturing growth weakened more in July than
economists forecast, reports published this week showed. The
benchmark DAX index has lost more than 1 percent this month amid
concern that the debt crisis, which has already engulfed  Greece ,
Ireland and Portugal, will spread to  Italy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
