Pork stockpiles in the U.S. rose 20
percent at the end of June from a year earlier, the government
said, as higher prices curbed demand.  Warehouses held 496.6 million pounds of pork on June 30, up
from 413 million a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories fell 9.4 percent
from the end of May.  “High prices limited usage of red meat during June,
thereby likely causing most inventory readings for June 30 to
exceed historical norms,”  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught
Futures Insights, said in an e-mailed note before the report.  Wholesale pork prices were up 19 percent from a year ago
through yesterday, reaching $1.0074 a pound on June 27, the
highest since at least October 1997, according to the USDA.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 1.925 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $92.575 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price has gained 21 percent in the past
year.  As of June 30, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, rose 33 percent from a year earlier to
47 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham rose 14 percent from a year ago to 66.6 million
pounds for the bone-in supplies, and stockpiles of boneless ham
increased 9.3 percent from a year earlier to 59.9 million
pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of June were 13 percent
larger than a year earlier at 750.5 million pounds, the USDA
said. Beef supplies rose 16 percent to 434.5 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
