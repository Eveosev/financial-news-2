Yogendra Modi, chairman of Indian
coal-bed methane producer Great Eastern Energy Corp., said he’s
not interested in selling the company for years.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Christophor Jost said in a
May 3 note that Great Eastern may be attractive for national  oil
companies  looking to gain access to the technology that
generates gas from coal fields. A potential investment in the
company could return 66 percent, he said.  Modi, who owns more than 60 percent of Great Eastern, wants
to continue to expand the company and bolster output, which
increased 100 percent in the past year, he said in an interview
in  London  today. The company may buy more exploration blocks,
including stakes in Oil & Natural Gas Corp.’s fields, he said.  “This could be a much bigger business in a few years,”
Modi said. “ I’m not interested in selling now.”  Great Eastern owns and operates an onshore block in Bengal
in western  India , where it has drilled 86 wells and plans 213
more in the next six years. It has also purchased a block in
 Tamil Nadu , southern India. Both areas have good access to
customers and margins will rise, Modi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
