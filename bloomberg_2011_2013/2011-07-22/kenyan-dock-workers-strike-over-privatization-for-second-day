A strike by workers at  Mombasa , East
Africa’s biggest port, entered its second day over demands that
the Kenyan government not sell the facility to private investors.  Workers prevented officials at the port from entering their
offices, Dock Workers Union Secretary-General Simon Sang said in
a phone interview today from Mombasa. Laborers began a so-called
go-slow yesterday to demand the state publish a notice in the
Government Gazette confirming that the sale of the port has been
stopped.  “The strike is in full swing until they hear us,” Sang
said.  The port of Mombasa handles shipments of black tea from
Kenya, the world’s largest exporter, as well as trade from
countries including Uganda, South Sudan,  Rwanda  and Burundi.
Kenya’s government announced in March it scrapped a plan to sell
the port, after Transport Minister Amos Kimunya said in February
that the country arranged a 26.5 billion-yen ($337.5 million)
loan from  Japan  to help finance the sale.  Sang said the sale of the port may result in more than
4,000 workers losing their jobs. The labor union is also
demanding that more than 3,000 workers who have been working as
contractors for more than three years should be employed on a
permanent basis, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
