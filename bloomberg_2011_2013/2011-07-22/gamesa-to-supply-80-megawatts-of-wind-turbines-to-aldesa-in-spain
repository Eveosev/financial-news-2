megawatts of turbines for two wind farms in southern  Spain .  Chief Executive Officer Jorge Calvet said in May that the
company might not sell a single turbine in Spain, it’s home
market, this year as the country’s economy is hammered by public
spending cuts.  The deal will include supplying 25 G-97 2-megawatt
