Turkish stocks fell for a seventh
day, capping the longest losing streak since  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  collapsed in September 2008, as concern deepened
the country’s current-account deficit may worsen.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  lost 1,080.01, or 1.8 percent,
to 59,802.32, bringing the week’s loss to 4.5 percent, the
biggest decline among the world’s 70 largest equity markets. The
lira weakened for a third day, depreciating 1.9 percent to
1.6976 per dollar. The currency has fallen 9 percent this year,
the worst performer among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Concern over  Turkey ’s current-account deficit swelling to
record levels and the lira’s rapid depreciation drove the
retreat in stocks, Bali Ekin, head of equity trading at Credit
Europe Bank NV in Amsterdam, said in e-mailed responses to
questions. “Fund managers are gun-shy on the Turkish market at
the moment, and you need some catalysts to inspire them,” he
said.  The banking index plunged 2.7 percent, its biggest drop in
a month.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the largest company by
market value in the index, dropped 24 kurus, or 3.3 percent, to
7 liras, the most in two months.  The market is losing faith that the government has a real
plan to deal with the current-account deficit, according to Isik Okte, a trader at Finans Invest in Istanbul.  “Locals are panicking so they are selling their stock
holdings,” Okte said in e-mailed comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
