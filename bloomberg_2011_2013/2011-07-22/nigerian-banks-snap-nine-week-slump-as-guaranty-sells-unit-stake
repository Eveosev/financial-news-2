Nigeria’s lenders rose for a third
day, gaining for the first week in 10, as  Guaranty Trust Bank
Plc (GUARANTY)  said it will sell a stake in an insurance unit and a bailout
for Greece boosted investor appetite for riskier assets.  The  Bloomberg NSE Banking (NGSEB10)  Index of the 10 biggest lender
rose 2.4 percent at the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. Today’s
advance extended this week’s rally to 2.7 percent, snapping a
nine-week decline, the longest losing streak since November
2008.  Guaranty’s shares rose 4.9 percent. The nation’s second-
biggest bank by market value agreed to sell its 67.68 percent
stake in Guaranty Trust Assurance Plc to Assur Africa Holding
for 11.9 billion naira ($78.1 million). Citigroup Inc. raised
its recommendation on Guaranty to “buy” from “hold,” citing
the company’s 2010 results and stock decline.  European leaders announced 159 billion euros ($228 billion)
in new aid for  Greece  late yesterday to try to contain the
region’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
