South Korea ’s won climbed to its
strongest level in almost three years after European leaders
agreed on a package to contain the region’s debt crisis,
reigniting interest in emerging-market assets. Bonds fell.  European officials announced 159 billion euros ($229
billion) of new aid for Greece late yesterday and empowered
their 440 billion euro rescue fund to buy debt across stressed
euro nations. Overseas funds bought more Korean shares than they
sold for the first time in nine days, purchasing a net $152
million today, according to data from Korea Exchange.  “We got quite encouraging news from embattled  Europe ,”
said Kim Jinju, a Seoul-based currency dealer with Korea
Exchange Bank. “There is some caution among traders ahead of
the psychologically important 1,050 level but the strong
momentum will likely continue.”  The won strengthened 0.3 percent to 1,051.98 per dollar as
of the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul , taking this week’s gain to 0.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,050.50 earlier, the strongest level since August 2008.  Accelerating inflation has reduced demand for  government
bonds . Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with 4.1 percent in May, according to data
from Statistics Korea released July 1. Inflation has exceeded
the official 4 percent target every month this year.  President  Lee Myung Bak  ordered the creation of a  task
force  to monitor prices this week and the government will
announce measures to ease price gains early next week, his
office said in a statement on July 20.  The yield on South Korea’s 4 percent bonds due March 2016
rose eight basis points this week to 4 percent, according to
prices from Korea Exchange Inc. The rate rose five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
