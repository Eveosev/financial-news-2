Ireland wants to avoid default and
return to debt markets as soon as possible as it begins talks on
extending a rate cut on part of its bailout to other loans,
European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton said.  A rate reduction of about 2 percent achieved as part of a
euro-area debt accord reached yesterday applies to Ireland’s
loans from the European Financial Stability Facility, Creighton
said in an interview with Dublin-based broadcaster RTE Radio
today. The government expects that the cut will also extend to
the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism and has already
begun talks with direct lenders, including the U.K., she said.  Euro-area leaders in Brussels agreed on 159 billion euros
($229 billion) of new aid for  Greece  and resolved to lower
interest payments and extend repayments for bailed-out nations,
including Ireland and  Portugal , in an effort to end the
sovereign-debt crisis. They also empowered the EFSF to buy debt
across stressed nations, even as they risked a temporary Greek
default by asking private bondholders to foot part of the bill.  Dublin-based fixed-income firm Glas Securities said the
interest-rate cut and bailout extension are “a welcome benefit
to Ireland and a major political victory for the government, but
this is not the ‘silver bullet.’”  “The fact remains that Ireland has a significant  budget
deficit  and returning to the bond markets within the 2013
timeframe will remain a challenge,” Glas said in a note today.
“We have previously argued that Ireland may need some form of a
second bailout package for 2013 and 2014.”  Ireland estimates a rate cut on all its European bailout
facilities would save it between 600 million euros and 800
million euros a year, paving the way for the country to “get
back into the markets as quickly as possible,” Creighton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
