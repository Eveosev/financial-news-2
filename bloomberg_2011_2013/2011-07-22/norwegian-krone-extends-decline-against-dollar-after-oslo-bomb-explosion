The Norwegian krone slumped versus
most of 16 major peers tracked by Bloomberg after an explosion
rocked central Oslo, shattering windows at the Prime Minister’s
office and injuring several people.  A bomb caused the blast, a police officer told Bloomberg
near the scene. Norway’s Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg is
safe, spokesman Oeivind Oestang said by phone.  “We still don’t know much about this bomb, how many have
been injured and so forth, but the knee-jerk reaction in the
market is to sell the Norwegian krone,” said  John Hydeskov ,
chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in  London . “It shouldn’t have
a huge foreign-exchange effect.”  The krone fell 1 percent to 5.4534 per dollar and was at
5.4103 to the greenback at 4:33 p.m. in London, snapping three
days of gains. It weakened 0.4 percent to 7.8179 per euro before
strengthening 0.2 percent to 7.7713 to the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
