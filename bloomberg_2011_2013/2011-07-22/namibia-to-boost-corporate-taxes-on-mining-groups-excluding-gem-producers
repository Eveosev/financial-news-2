Namibia plans to raise the corporate
 tax rate  on mining companies other than diamond producers in the
next financial year, Finance Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila
said.  The country plans to raise the tax on mines other than gem
operations to 44 percent from 37.5 percent, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila
said on state radio today. Diamond mines are taxed at a 55
percent level, she said. A capital gains tax will also be
imposed on the sale of mineral rights or operation, she said.  “I am hoping to have these changes introduced in the next
financial year,” she said. The amendments will need to be
tabled in parliament, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said.  Namibia is the world’s biggest miner of offshore diamonds,
the fourth-largest uranium producer and also has deposits of
gold, coal and copper.  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) , the world’s second-biggest
mining company,  Extract Resources Ltd. (EXT)  and De Beers have
operations in the southern African country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
