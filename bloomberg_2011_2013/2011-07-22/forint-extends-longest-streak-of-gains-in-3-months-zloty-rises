Hungarian shares fell for the first
time in four days as OTP Bank Nyrt. retreated.  The BUX equities index slid 0.2 percent to 21,890.70 by the
5 p.m. close in Budapest, bringing the weekâ€™s drop to 0.9
percent. OTP snapped three days of gains, slumping 0.3 percent
to 5,585 forint.  The forint strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 267.80 per
euro after earlier appreciating as much as 0.7 percent as
European leaders announced new aid for  Greece  in a plan designed
to stop contagion to other states. The zloty was little changed
at 3.9871 and the Czech koruna appreciated 0.4 percent to 24.368
against the European common currency.  Euro-area leaders announced 159 billion euros ($229
billion) in aid for Greece and risked temporary default to
lighten its debt burden. They also empowered their 440 billion-
euro rescue fund to buy debt across stressed euro nations as a
market rout last week sparked concern the crisis was spreading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
