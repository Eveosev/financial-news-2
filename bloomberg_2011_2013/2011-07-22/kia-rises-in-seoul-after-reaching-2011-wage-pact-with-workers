Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ,  South Korea ’s
second-biggest automaker, rose in Seoul trading after the
company reached a tentative pay agreement with workers to avert
a strike.  The Seoul-based advanced 1.3 percent to 76,000 won as of
9:01 a.m. on Korea Exchange, compared with the benchmark Kospi
index gain of 1 percent.  The tentative pact includes a 5.2 percent base monthly
salary hike, as well as an annual bonus, Kia said in an e-mailed
statement today. Workers will also get 80 Kia shares each.  The agreement is subject to a workers’ vote on July 27, the
