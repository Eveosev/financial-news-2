SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , the 10th
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, posted higher second-quarter profit
as credit-loss provisions declined and payments ended on a U.S.
bailout.  Net income rose to $178 million from $12 million in the
same period last year, Atlanta-based SunTrust said today in a
statement. Earnings per share were 33 cents compared with a loss
of 11 cents a share a year earlier, when the company paid
preferred dividends tied to repayment of the taxpayer-funded
bailout. The average estimate of 27 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 31 cents. Credit-loss provisions declined 41
percent to $392 million from $662 million in the year-earlier
period.  SunTrust is led by Chief Executive Officer William H. Rogers, 53, who took over the post June 1. Rogers succeeded
James M. Wells III, who returned the company to profitability
and repaid the $4.85 billion in funds from the Troubled Asset
Relief Program in March, which included payments of $66 million
in preferred dividends to the U.S. government in the second
quarter of 2010 and the first quarter this year.  “The certainty of a revenue increase probably has a longer
tail attached to it than we all thought,” Rogers said in
announcing a plan to cut expenses a total of $300 million by
2013. “What we want to ensure is that we go into that with the
most efficient organization that we can have.”  The company’s cost-cutting plan will involve “fewer
people” providing services, Rogers said without elaborating.  Personnel Costs  SunTrust’s second-quarter noninterest expenses were $1.54
billion, a 5 percent increase from $1.47 billion in the first
quarter on higher personnel and credit costs, according to the
statement. Expenses rose 3 percent from $1.5 billion in the
year-earlier period, driven by a $66 million increase in
employee compensation, the bank said.  SunTrust’s second-quarter revenue increased 1.8 percent to
$2.2 billion from $2.16 billion in the year earlier and from
$2.16 in the first quarter, according to the statement. Net
charge-offs fell 30 percent to $505 million from $722 million in
the same period last year.  SunTrust joins other major banks in cutting costs to
counter slow revenue growth. After reporting a record second-
quarter profit July 19,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  also announced a goal
of cutting $1.5 billion in quarterly costs by the end of next
year and $11 billion a quarter by the end of 2012.  SunTrust plans to ask its board to approve a “modest”
dividend increase during the second half, Chief Financial
Officer Aleem Gillani said.  Net interest income increased 6.5 percent to $1.29 billion
from $1.2 billion in the second quarter last year. Net interest
margin, the difference between what a bank pays on deposits and
charges for loans, widened to 3.5 percent from 3.3 percent last
year.  The Tier 1 common capital ratio narrowed to 11.1 percent
from 13.5 percent in the same period last year.  SunTrust fell 5 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $25.68 at 9:49
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had
fallen 13 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
