Serbia  put war suspect  Goran Hadzic 
on a plane to the Netherlands-based  United Nations war crimes
tribunal  to answer for his role in a 1990s Balkan conflict after
he dodged arrest for seven years.  Just days after being caught on Mt. Fruska Gora in northern
Serbia, he waived his right to appeal the extradition in
Belgrade and was flown to The Hague, Justice Minister Snezana
Malovic said in Belgrade today. Hadzic, 52, stands accused of
crimes against humanity, including murder, in the conflict that
began in 1991 with Croatia’s independence from Yugoslavia and an
attempt by ethnic Serbs there to create their own state within
Croatia.  “This closes the most difficult chapter in Serbia’s
cooperation with  The Hague  tribunal,” Malovic said and pledged
“continuing support to international justice.”  The capture of the last fugitive sought in connection to
the 1990s wars brings Serbia closer to its goal of becoming an
EU member. Three top suspects, Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic
and Goran Hadzic, have been arrested since the government led by
the pro-Western  Democratic Party  took office in 2008.  Malovic said Serbia will continue cooperating with the U.N.
tribunal by giving it access to documents in state archives and
witnesses.  The 14-point indictment against Hadzic includes accusations
of wanton destruction, torture and forced deportation in the war
that left 10,000 dead on both sides. He will also answer for
summary execution of more than 250 prisoners near Vukovar in
eastern  Croatia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
