Canadian natural gas rose as cooling
demand in the U.S. East jumped to combat the year’s hottest
weather.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , advanced 1
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, said
the East Coast would roast in temperatures of 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) or higher through tomorrow.  “That’s been the talk of the town, that heat,” Eric Bickel, a commodity analyst at Summit Energy in Louisville,
 Kentucky , said in a telephone interview. “You can see more
imports going up to the Northeast from Canada to meet some of
that peaking cooling demand that’s expected over the weekend.”  Alberta gas for August delivery gained 3.5 cents to C$3.47
per gigajoule ($3.47 per million British thermal units) as of 5
p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and
the U.S. and is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for August delivery rose 0.4 cent to settle at
$4.399 per million Btu on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  The high in New York today reached a record for the date of
104 degrees, 19 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of
 State College , Pennsylvania. That fell short of the all-time
 record  of 106 set on July 9, 1936, the  National Weather Service 
said.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according
to the Energy Department.  Air Conditioning  Consolidated Edison Inc. said power use reached a record at
4 p.m. New York time. Electricity demand peaked at 13,189
megawatts, breaking the record of 13,141 megawatts set in August
2006, the owner of New York City’s utility said in an e-mail.  “People typically deal fairly well with one day of heat,
but as the event continues, more and more people will turn up
the A/C to cope,” Travis Hartman, a meteorologist at MDA
EarthSat, said in a note to clients. “As that demand increases,
utilities will likely face increased demands to the already
stressed grid.”  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta  system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet as of 4 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.66 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  Gas Flows  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.28 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 841 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.92 billion cubic feet today, about 70 percent of its
capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 14.48 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $4.5566 per million Btu as
of 1:36 p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic
feet a day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas dropped 12.07 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $4.1502.  To contact the reporter on this story:
