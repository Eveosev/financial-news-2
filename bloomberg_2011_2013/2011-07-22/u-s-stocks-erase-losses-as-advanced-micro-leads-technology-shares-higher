U.S. stocks erased losses as
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. led technology shares higher after
posting better-than-estimated earnings, offsetting a drop in
industrial shares spurred by lower-than-projected results at
Caterpillar Inc.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,343.63 at 12 p.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.5
percent earlier. AMD surged 17 percent, leading technology
companies to the biggest gain among 10 groups. Caterpillar pared
losses, falling 5.4 percent after slumping as much as 7.7
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
