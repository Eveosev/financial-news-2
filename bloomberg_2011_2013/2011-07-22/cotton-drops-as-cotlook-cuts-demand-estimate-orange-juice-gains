Cotton dropped for a third straight
day after a researcher cut its demand outlook.  Orange juice 
climbed.  Global cotton use will total 23.864 million metric tons for
the year ending this month, or 1.7 percent less than a previous
forecast, researcher Cotlook Ltd. said today in a report. The
company also cut its forecast for next year by 3.5 percent to
24.558 million tons. Futures have plunged as much as 57 percent
from a record in March.  “We’ve spent the last two months worrying about the demand
side, and justifiably so,”  Jack Scoville , a commodities analyst
at Price Futures Group Inc., said by telephone from  Chicago .  Cotton for December delivery dropped 0.63 cents, or 0.6
percent, to 98 cents a pound at 11:05 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . A close at that level would leave the fiber down
1.5 percent this week, the seventh straight decline. The price
touched an all-time high of $2.197 on March 7.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.8 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $1.982 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
