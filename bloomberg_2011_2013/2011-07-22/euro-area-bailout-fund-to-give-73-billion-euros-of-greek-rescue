The euro area’s rescue fund will
contribute about 73 billion euros ($105 billion) to  Greece ’s
second aid package and may start selling bonds to raise the
funds as soon as September, European officials said.  The aid to be provided by the European Financial Stability
Facility is part of a 159 billion-euro program for Greece that
euro-area leaders approved yesterday. Of the rest of the total,
the  International Monetary Fund  will provide about 36 billion
euros and bondholders 50 billion euros, the officials told
reporters today in Brussels on the condition of anonymity.  Of the public support, 20 billion euros will be earmarked
for the recapitalization of Greek banks and another 20 billion
euros for a Greek debt buyback, said the officials. The buybacks
will account for a projected 12.6 billion euros of the private
sector’s planned 50 billion-euro contribution, they said.  The 440 billion-euro EFSF is already contributing a total
of 44 billion euros to the aid programs of Ireland and  Portugal .
Greece’s initial 110 billion-euro rescue is made up of loans
from euro-area governments and the IMF.  The new aid package for Greece excludes 45 billion euros
left over from the first program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
