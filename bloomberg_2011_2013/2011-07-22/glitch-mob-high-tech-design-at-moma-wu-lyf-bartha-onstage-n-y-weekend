Dance through the heat wave when Los
Angeles-based Glitch Mob lays down some heavy, squelching beats
at Terminal 5.  Get there early to take in Phantogram, the girl-boy band
with chilly vocals and addictive melodies.  At 610 W. 56th St. Information: +1-212-582-6600;

at the 5th Annual New York Antique Jewelry and Watch Show.  More than 100 international dealers -- from Aaron Faber
Gallery to YNY Jewels -- are showing off their vintage wares.  Expect to find items from  Harry Winston , Cartier, Tiffany &
Co., Van Cleef & Arpels, Rolex and Patek Phillipe, among others,
in all periods, from the Renaissance to Art Deco.  Through July 24 at the Metropolitan Pavilion, 123 W. 18th
St. Information: +1-212-463-0071;

world -- the inventive group recently worked with MIT’s Robotics
Lab, rock band OK Go, and a Japanese butoh company.  Check out their athletic performance style, requiring
strength, skill, timing and a keen understanding of the laws of
motion, as they present new works such as “Korokoro” together
with repertory faves.  They’ve been at it for 40 years, not bad for a troupe named
after a  fungus  that lives in cow dung.  Runs until Aug. 6 at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Ave.
Information: +1-212-691-9740;  http://www.joyce.org .  Stroll over to Jim Lahey’s Co. and order a refreshing glass
of prosecco. Try the watermelon gazpacho for starters, followed
by a perfectly-crusted Margherita pizza.  230 Ninth Ave. Information: +1-212-243-1105.  Saturday Night  Media-mute yet super-hyped band WU LYF plays the Knitting
Factory tonight.  Their particular brand of expansive guitar-based rock
elicits a confused euphoria, mainly due to the totally
unintelligible crowing of lead singer Ellery Roberts. It really
doesn’t matter that you can’t decipher his words -- your body
will recognize every single note.  Plunge in.  At 361 Metropolitan Ave.,  Brooklyn . Information: +1-347-
529-6295;  http://bk.knittingfactory.com .  Sunday  Say hi to “Talking Carl” as you enter the  Museum of
Modern Art ’s new tech show. He’s an iPhone and iPad app that
will respond to sound and touch, repeating what visitors say.
Play it cool -- like any creature, Carl can also get very jumpy.  Play a  video game  called “Tentacles,” where you control a
squid emerging from the ooze looking for food. Eat or be eaten
by other players as you make existential decisions.  There are more than 200 projects focusing on the design
interface between people and technology, ranging from
 information systems  on a global scale to tiny Tweenbots asking
for directions to a different gallery.  Tech-phobic? There’s also a Wifi Dowsing Rod designed to
comfort people overwhelmed by digital innovation.  “Talk to Me” runs until Nov. 7 at MoMA, 11 W. 53rd St.
Information: +1-212-708-9400;  http://www.moma.org .  Sunday Matinee  Justin Bartha, the sanest member of the “Hangover” crew,
takes the stage in “All New People.”  In the world premiere of Zach Braff’s raunchy comedy, he
plays a brokenhearted man looking for solitude. Directed by
Peter DuBois, the cast also includes TV actors Krysten Ritter
and Anna Camp.  The action is set in an empty New Jersey beach town during
the depths of winter -- given the heat wave, you may have to
work a bit at suspending your disbelief.  In previews at the Second Stage Theatre, 305 W. 43rd St.,
opening July 25. Information: +1-212-246-4422;
