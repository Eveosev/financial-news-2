A  Georgia  man who hacked or bought
more than 675,000 credit card numbers used in about $36 million
of fraudulent transactions was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Rogelio Hackett Jr., 25, of Lithonia, Georgia, was
sentenced today in Alexandria, Virginia by U.S. District Judge
Anthony J. Trenga, who also imposed a fine of $100,000, the
 Justice Department  said in an e-mailed statement.  Hackett was a “full-time identity thief who expanded his
business worldwide, affecting hundreds of thousands of people,
banks and merchants,” U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride in
Alexandria said in the statement.  In 2009, federal agents searching Hackett’s home found the
stolen credit card numbers in computers and e-mail accounts,
prosecutors said. He obtained the numbers by hacking into
business computer networks or buying the information over the
Internet, according to the statement.  Hackett, who pleaded guilty in April, admitted that he also
sold credit card information, and manufactured and sold
counterfeit cards, according to the statement.  Whitney Minter, a federal public defender representing
Hackett, declined to comment.  The case is U.S. v. Hackett, 11-cr-96, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of  Virginia  (Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
