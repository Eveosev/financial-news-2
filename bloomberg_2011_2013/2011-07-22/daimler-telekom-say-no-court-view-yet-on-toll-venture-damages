Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,
which are being sued for damages by the German government over
their Toll Collect venture, said there is no court opinion yet
on whether they will be held liable.  The arbitration court reviewing the claim over a delay to
the truck-toll operation hasn’t yet formed a view, the carmaker
and the phone company said today in a joint statement, citing
Guenter Hirsch, who chairs the panel. A Financial Times
Deutschland  report  on July 18 suggesting the court had told the
pair they wouldn’t be able to avoid damages is false, they said.  The Toll Collect venture, set up in 2005 to charge trucks
on German highways, was 16 months late, resulting in penalties
and interest payments. The government is claiming 5.1 billion
euros ($7.3 billion), according to the FTD, which said Daimler
and Deutsche Telekom haven’t set aside reserves for damages.  None of the panel members have communicated the content of
their deliberations to third parties, today’s statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
