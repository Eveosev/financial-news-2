Greece  led a decline in the cost of
insuring against a default on European  government bonds  after
politicians agreed on an aid package to end the 21-month-old
sovereign crisis and prevent contagion to  Spain  and Italy.  Swaps on Greece plunged 500 basis points to a six-week low
of 1,500 as of 12:15 p.m. in London, dropping the most on
record. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index of default
swaps tied to 15 governments fell 20 basis points to 243.  Europe’s leaders announced 159 billion euros ($229 billion)
of new aid for Greece, including a pledge by banks to exchange
and buy back the nation’s debt which may result in a short-term
default. Even so, the International Swaps & Derivatives
Association told Bloomberg News the plan “should not trigger”
insurance contracts on Greece because the exchange would be
“expressly voluntary.”  “We have been pulled back from the abyss,” said Simon
Ballard, a strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “Euro-
zone Armageddon does thankfully seem to have been avoided.”  Contracts insuring Italian debt fell 29 basis points to
224, Spain was down 24 basis points to 284, Portugal declined
108 basis points to 836 and Ireland dropped 97.5 basis points to
810, CMA prices show. All fell from records set July 18.  Swaps on Greece are down from an all-time high of 2,568
basis points on that same day, and still signal a 72 percent
chance the nation will default within five years, according to
CMA. That was approaching a 90 percent probability earlier this
month. A decline signals an improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Corporates, Banks  “Since this is expressly voluntary, it should not trigger
CDS,” David Geen, ISDA’s general counsel in  London , said in an
e-mailed response to questions. “Also, since it is at this
stage simply a proposal, there is nothing yet to raise to the
determinations committee -- though that may not stop someone
trying.”  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 European companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 11 basis points to
408, while the Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers dropped 5 basis points to 159,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The bank pledge will provide financing of 54 billion euros
to Greece by mid-2014, building to a total of 135 billion euros
through the end of 2020, the  Institute of International Finance 
said in a statement.  Fitch Ratings  said Greece faces “restricted default''
following the agreement.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
