Peruvian bonds posted their biggest
weekly increase in a month as President-elect Ollanta Humala
appointed officials to his cabinet that eased investors’
concerns about how he’ll manage the economy.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.23 percent at 4:04 p.m.  New York  time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The yield has
declined six basis points this week, the most since the period
ended June 24.  Humala, a former army rebel who takes office July 28, is
seeking to reassure investors that his plans won’t erode
economic growth. This week Humala named Miguel Castilla, who
served as outgoing President Alan Garcia’s deputy finance
minister, as his finance minister, and tapped central bank
President Julio Velarde to remain in his post.  “The economic portfolio appointments were all market-
friendly,”  Michael Roche , an emerging-market strategist at MF
Global in New York, said by telephone.  Peru’s sol was little changed at 2.7360 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
