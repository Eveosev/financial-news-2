Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, fell to the lowest since April 2009 in Mexican
trading after posting a wider second-quarter loss than analysts
estimated because of slumping U.S. construction.  The net loss was $294 million, or 28 cents per American
depositary receipt, compared with $306 million, or 31 cents, a
year earlier, according to a statement today. Analysts expected
a loss of 6 cents, the average of seven estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Cemex hasn’t had a profit since 2009’s third quarter.  The U.S. was the Monterrey, Mexico-based company’s largest
market by sales after it paid $14.2 billion for Rinker Group
Ltd. in July 2007, as the  construction industry  slipped into
recession. After that, the U.S. slipped behind  Mexico  among
Cemex’s markets. For the past 11 quarters, its U.S. operating
 cash flow  has been negative.  Profit was hurt “by still weak U.S. operations as well as
a margin decline in Mexico,” Benjamin Theurer, an analyst at
 Barclays Capital  in Mexico City who rates the company’s ADRs
“equal weight,” said in a report today. “Cemex’s key markets
are still far away from recovery.”  Cemex fell 40 centavos, or 4.4 percent, to 8.71 pesos in
Mexico City trading at 4:10 p.m. New York time, the lowest close
since April 1, 2009. The shares have declined 31 percent this
year. Cemex’s 9.5 percent bonds due in 2016 rose 0.22 cent to
100.75 cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Sales Gain  Quarterly sales rose 8.7 percent to $4.1 billion, Cemex
said. One-time expenses totaling $202 million included severance
payments and impairment on the value of assets, according to its
statement.  “We believe most markets in our portfolio will exhibit
volume growth and increased profitability in 2011,” Chief
Financial Officer  Fernando Gonzalez  told analysts on a
conference call.  He said he was “encouraged” that Cemex’s U.S. prices for
cement, ready-mix concrete and aggregates all rose from the
previous three-month period for the first time in 11 quarters.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization -- a measure of cash flow known as Ebitda -- fell
7.4 percent to $615 million from $664 million a year ago. In the
U.S. Ebitda was a loss of $22.3 million compared with a gain of
$16.6 million a year ago.  Cash Flow  Free cash flow, or cash from operations after capital
expenses, was negative for a second consecutive quarter. Cemex’s
total debt plus its perpetual notes rose to $18.4 billion from
$17.9 billion a year ago.  Cemex reached a $15 billion financing agreement with banks
in August 2009 after the recession reduced profit. The company
has paid about half the loan, which comes due in 2014, by
selling shares, bonds and assets.  The company’s ratio of net debt to Ebitda was 7.16 times at
the end of June, and a covenant under the financing agreement
calls for it to be lower than 7 times by year’s end, Mike Betts,
an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd. in  London , said in a
note today. He rates Cemex ADRs “buy.”  “We are confident that we will comply with our covenants
in 2011,” Gonzalez said.  Sales in Mexico rose 4.9 percent to $968 million as cement
shipments climbed 3 percent and prices in dollars increased
11 percent because of a stronger  Mexican peso . In the U.S.,
sales fell 9.5 percent to $619 million because of a 10 percent
decline in cement shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
