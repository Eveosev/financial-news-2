Glencore International Plc sold a
cargo of naphtha to Koch Industries Inc. for delivery in
northwest  Europe .  Gasoil futures dropped on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Heating oil barges dropped relative to the front-month
ICE gasoil contract.  Light Products  Glencore sold 12,500 metric tons of naphtha to Koch at
$1,006 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. That cargo is
for delivery to the port of Rotterdam from Aug. 12 to Aug. 16.
The previous cargo deal took place on July 20 at $996 a ton.  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $1,048 to $1,057 a metric ton,
according to the same survey of trades on the Argus and Platts
pricing window. That’s little changed from yesterday.  Those deals are for Eurobob grade fuel, to which ethanol is
added before being sold to motorists. So-called barge deals are
for lots of about 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , rose to $8.24
a barrel, the highest level in three days, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined products broker in London.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for August declined $2.25, or 0.2 percent, to $981 a
ton on ICE as of 5:04 p.m. London time. Gasoil is mainly used in
heating.  Heating oil barges traded at a discount of $3.50 to $4 to
the August ICE gasoil contract, the survey showed. That’s less
than deals at a $2 discount yesterday.  Air France-KLM Group bought jet fuel on the barge market at
a premium of $79 a ton to August futures, the survey showed. BP
Plc also bought on today’s barge market at $1,064 a ton.  Jet fuel barges traded yesterday at premiums from $79 to
$81 a ton.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at premiums from $32
to $33 a ton to ICE August gasoil, the survey showed. That’s
little changed from yesterday.  Residues  Low-sulfur  fuel oil  barges traded at $704.50 a ton, while
high-sulfur fuel oil traded from $661.50 to $663 a ton, the
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
