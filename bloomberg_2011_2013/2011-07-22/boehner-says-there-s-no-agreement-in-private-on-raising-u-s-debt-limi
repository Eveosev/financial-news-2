House Speaker  John Boehner  said
today that “there is no agreement in private” on raising the
U.S. debt ceiling.  Negotiators are “not close to an agreement,” the Ohio
Republican told reporters after a meeting of the House
Republican caucus. A “serious down payment” will be needed to
reduce the debt, he said.  The White House and congressional leaders have been meeting
to find a compromise on raising the federal debt ceiling before
the government’s borrowing authority is exhausted on Aug. 2.  Representative Steve LaTourette, an Ohio Republican, said
Boehner wasn’t optimistic about reaching a deal.  “The speaker was the most sort of melancholy I’ve seen
him,” LaTourette said after the caucus meeting. “He wanted to,
I think, report to the conference that substantial progress was
being made, we’re moving in the right direction -- and he
couldn’t give that report.”  LaTourette said “he’s feeling that he’s getting nowhere
fast” and “I don’t even think there’s anything productive
happening.”
