Taiwan ’s dollar snapped a two-week
decline and government bonds fell after European officials
agreed on more financial aid for  Greece , bolstering demand for
emerging-market assets.  The currency climbed to a one-week high and stocks rose
after the 159 billion euro ($229 billion) package was announced
in Brussels yesterday. Taiwan sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of
five-year securities on July 15 at a yield of 1.18 percent, more
than the 1.155 percent forecast by traders in a Bloomberg survey.  “Sentiment lifted as the problems in  Europe  seem to have
eased,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “The market was surprised by how
uninterested the buyers, including banks and securities houses,
were at the last auction. That drove up yields.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent this week and
today to NT$28.830 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m.
local time close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
reached NT$28.810 earlier, the strongest level since July 14.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded government debt, rose three basis points this week to
1.21 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The
rate climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.375 percent from
0.374 percent at the end of last week, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
