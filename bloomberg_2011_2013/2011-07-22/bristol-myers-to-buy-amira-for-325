Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) , the maker
of the blood thinner Plavix, said it would acquire Amira
Pharmaceuticals Inc. for $325 million, adding experimental drugs
to treat inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.  Bristol-Myers may pay an additional $150 million to closely
held Amira if certain milestones are met, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. San Diego-based Amira’s lead
medicine, AM152, for a  lung disease  that robs patients of their
ability to breathe, has completed one phase of the three trials
generally required for U.S. regulatory approval, the companies
said in the statement.  The deal is part of Bristol-Myers’s “string of pearls”
strategy to buy companies or reach partnerships to expand its
roster of experimental drugs, said Jennifer Fron Mauer, a
Bristol-Myers spokeswoman. The acquisition of Amira is the fifth
since 2007 when the strategy was put in place, she said. The
largest deal was the $1.98 billion purchase of Medarex Inc. in
2009, according to Bloomberg data.  “This is our entrance into fibrotic diseases, an area of
high unmet need,” Mauer said in an interview.  Bristol-Myers has said it plans to introduce five new
drugs, including treatments for cancer, diabetes and  heart
disease , by 2012, as Plavix its top-selling medicine, loses
patent protection next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
