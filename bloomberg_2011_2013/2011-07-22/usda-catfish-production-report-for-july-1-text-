Following is the text of the U.S. Catfish 
Production 
report from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture :  Foodfish Inventory Numbers Down 25 Percent from a Year Ago  Catfish operations in the three major producing States (Alabama, Arkansas, 
and Mississippi) had 159 million foodsize fish on hand on July 1, 2011, down 
25 percent from the July 1, 2010 total of 212 million foodsize fish. The 
breakouts of foodsize fish inventory numbers on July 1, 2011, with their 
respective percent change from the previous year were: large foodsize, 2.57 
million fish, down 60 percent; medium foodsize, 33.8 million fish, down 45 
percent; and small foodsize, 122 million fish, down 15 percent.  The three major States also had 430 thousand broodfish on hand on 
July 1, 2011, down 5 percent from last year's 455 thousand broodfish.  The number of large stockers on hand on July 1, 2011, totaled 176 million 
fish, up 6 percent from the 166 million fish on hand a year ago. There were 
173 million small stockers, up 2 percent from last year. Producers had 
732 million fingerlings and fry on hand on July 1, 2011.  The water surface area to be used for catfish production during July 1 
through December 31, 2011, totaled 81.4 thousand acres, down 14 percent from 
a year ago. Acres used for foodsize fish totaled 65.5 thousand acres, down 
17 percent from the same time period in 2010. Acres for broodfish decreased 
13 percent to 1.60 thousand acres, and acres used for fingerling production 
decreased 8 percent to 11.5 thousand acres. Acres taken out of production 
during the January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011 period totaled 4.54 thousand 
acres, while 2.23 thousand acres of the total in production were scheduled to 
be renovated from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. The number of operations 
on July 1, 2011 in the three major States totaled 389, down 14 percent from 
last year's total of 454 operations.   Number of Catfish Operations and Water Surface Acres Used for Production -

(X)  Not applicable.                                                              Statistical Methodology  Survey Procedures: All known catfish producers in the three published states 
are surveyed to collect production data. Individual NASS field offices 
maintain a list of all known catfish producers and use known sources of 
producers to update their lists. Operators are mailed a questionnaire as 
close as possible to July 1 and given time to respond by mail. Those that do 
not respond by mail are telephoned or possibly enumerated in person during 
the middle of July.   Estimating Procedures: Sound statistical methodology is employed to derive 
the estimates from reported data. All data are analyzed for unusual values. 
Data from each operation are compared to their own past operating profile and 
to trends from similar operations. Missing data for large operations are 
estimated based on similar operations or historical data. Summary expansions 
account for the remaining non-response operations. NASS field offices prepare 
these estimates by using a combination of survey indications and historic 
trends. Individual State estimates are reviewed by the Agricultural 
Statistics Board for reasonableness.  Revision policy: Estimates for the previous year are subject to revision when 
current estimates are made. Revisions are the result of late or corrected 
data.  Reliability: In the three published states, catfish production estimates are 
based on a census of all known active producers and therefore, have no 
sampling variability. However, estimates are subject to errors such as 
omissions, duplication, and mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing 
the data. While these errors cannot be measured directly, they are minimized 
through strict quality controls in the data collection process and a careful 
review of all reported data for consistency and reasonableness.  Terms and Definitions Used for Catfish Production Estimates  Broodfish: Fish kept for egg production, including males. Broodfish produce 
the fertilized eggs, which go to hatcheries. The most desirable size is 3 to 
10 pounds or 4 to 6 years of age.  Fingerlings: Fish weighing 2 to 60 pounds per 1,000 fish or 2 to 6 inches in 
length.  Foodsize (large): Fish weighing over 3 pounds.  Foodsize (medium): Fish weighing over one and one-half pounds to 3 pounds.  Foodsize (small): Fish weighing over three-fourths of a pound to one and one-
half pounds.  Fry: Fish weighing less than 2 pounds per 1,000 fish or less than 2 inches in 
length.  Stockers (large): Fish weighing over 180 pounds to 750 pounds per 1,000 fish.  Stockers (small): Fish weighing over 60 pounds to 180 pounds per 1,000 fish 
or over 6 inches in length.  To contact the reporter on this story:
