Russian poultry imports may fall to
330,000 metric tons next year as production increases, Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  said today.  Inbound pork shipments may come to 350,000 tons, the prime
minister told reporters outside Moscow today, according to a
transcript posted on the government  website .  Russia will probably consume about 3.5 million tons of
poultry this year while producing 3.15 million tons, Putin said.
Pork consumption and production are estimated at 3 million and
2.4 million tons, respectively, he said.  The prime minister said he will approve proposals for meat-
import quotas by the economy and agriculture ministries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
