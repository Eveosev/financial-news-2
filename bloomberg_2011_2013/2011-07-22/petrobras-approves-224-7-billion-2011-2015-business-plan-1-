Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil producer, approved a $224.7-billion
business plan for 2011 to 2015 as the company develops the
largest discoveries in the Americas in more than three decades.  The total amount of the approved plan was little changed
from the original proposal of $224 billion. The company
increased the allocation for exploration and production by 4
percent to 57 percent, according to a regulatory filing today.
Some 95 percent of the total funds will be used to develop
operations in Brazil. The company cut this year’s budget to 84.7
billion reais from 93 billion reais.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based oil producer is
known, has boosted investments ninefold since 2003 to 88.5
billion reais last year as it focuses on discoveries in deep
waters and expanding gasoline production.  The new spending program, the largest in the global oil
industry, includes funding to develop 5 billion barrels of oil
reserves acquired from the government last year. Petrobras aims
to increase its output to 4 million barrels of oil and
equivalents a day by 2015, and to 6.4 million barrels a day by
2020.  To contact the reporters on this story:
