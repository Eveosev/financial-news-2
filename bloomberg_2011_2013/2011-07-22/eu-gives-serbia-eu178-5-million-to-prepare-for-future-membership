The European Union donated 178.5
million euros ($257 million) to  Serbia  for 23 projects aimed at
preparing the country for eventual EU membership.  The grant has 39 million euros earmarked for environmental
protection, including 15 million euros for water treatment at
the Nikola Tesla B thermal plant, and 38 million euros for
strengthening public administration and the rule of law. Another
18.5 million euros is aimed to help Serbia deal with the
economic crisis and to improve competitiveness of its private
sector, the EU office in Belgrade said in e-mailed statement.  With the latest support, the EU has donated 2.2 billion
euros to Serbia since the country emerged from international
isolation more than a decade ago, the office said as EU
ambassador to Serbia, Vincent Degert, and Deputy Prime Minister
Bozidar Djelic signed the donation agreement today.  Serbia hopes to become a candidate for EU membership by the
end of the year. It arrested Goran Hadzic this week, the last of
war crimes fugitives indicted in connection with the 1990s,
clearing an obstacle for the countryâ€™s further integration with
the bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
