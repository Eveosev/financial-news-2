Romania failed to sell a 9.8 percent
stake in  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  after the issue was undersubscribed, the
Economy Ministry said.  The country will continue with its plans to sell shares in
other state-owned companies, the ministry said today. The
government is “determined” to meet pledges made to the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union, it said,
adding it will monitor market conditions for a new Petrom sale
timetable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
