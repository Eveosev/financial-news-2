England reached 217-3 at lunch on
day two of the first cricket Test against India at Lordâ€™s in
London.  Kevin Pietersen is 71 not out and Ian Bell has 28 for the
host, which began the day 127-2.  Jonathan Trott  scored 70 before
being caught leg before wicket by Praveen Kumar.  Zaheer Khan , who took 2-18 yesterday before leaving the
field clutching his right leg, will not bowl the rest of the
first innings after being diagnosed with a hamstring strain.  The match is the 2,000th in the 134 years of elite Test
cricket. England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
