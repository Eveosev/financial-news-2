Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Groupon Inc. were
among the companies that agreed to pay more than $25 million
combined to settle patent suits filed by Walker Digital LLC, a
developer of e-commerce technology, according to people with
knowledge of the matter.  The litigation involved about a dozen patents and the
settlement included licensing and a sale of some patents, said
the people, who declined to be named because terms are private.  Many of the patents cover online commerce and marketing,
areas the companies are pursuing to add features and lure users.
Daily-deal purveyor Groupon is facing more lawsuits in the run-
up to its planned initial public offering, while patents are
taking on added currency as a way for technology companies to
safeguard intellectual property.  “This is the next place for patent wars,” said Ron
Laurie, managing director of patent consulting firm  Inflexion
Point Strategy LLC.  in  Palo Alto ,  California , in an interview,
referring to social-media companies.  Steven Hofman, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-based
Walker Digital, said the company has settled cases with three
companies, while declining to identify them.  Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, and Julie Mossler, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based
Groupon, declined to comment on whether outstanding cases
involving Walker were settled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
