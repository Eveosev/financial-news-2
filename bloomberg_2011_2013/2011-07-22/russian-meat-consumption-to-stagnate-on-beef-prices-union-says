Meat consumption in  Russia  will be
unchanged this year after beef prices climbed in the country and
worldwide, the  National Meat Association  said.  Consumption was about 67 kilograms (148 pounds) per capita
last year, Sergey Yushin, head of the groupâ€™s executive
committee, said today by phone, citing state statistics service
figures. While Russians will eat less beef after 18 months of
price gains, consumption is set to gain by 2 percent to 3
percent for pork and remain stable for poultry, he said. Yushin
gave no figures for absolute consumption.  National output may rise 4 percent to 5 percent this year
for pork, drop 2 percent to 3 percent for beef and gain 7
percent to 8 percent for poultry, Yushin said. Russia produced
739,000 metric tons of pork last year, 199,000 tons of beef and
2.74 million tons of poultry, according to Rosstat, as the
statistics service is known.  To contact the reporter on this story:
