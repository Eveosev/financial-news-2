The U.K. is setting up a fund to
help Scottish coastal communities using marine revenues from the
Crown Estate, the Herald newspaper said, citing Treasury Chief
Secretary  Danny Alexander .  The money will be administered by the Big Lottery Fund,
rather than the Scottish government, the Glasgow-based newspaper
said. The Scottish National Party government is campaigning for
all the Crown Estate revenues in  Scotland  to be controlled by
the Scottish administration. The Crown Estate administers the
monarchy’s assets.  Charities and community organizations will benefit from the
new fund that will receive 50 percent of the Crown Estate’s
marine revenues in Scotland, the Herald said. That is currently
4 million pounds a year and is set to rise to 40 million pounds
a year by 2021.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
