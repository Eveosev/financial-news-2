A $46.4 million loan backed by  Los
Angeles ’ Capitol Records building, where  Frank Sinatra , the
Beach Boys, Nat King Cole and Judy Garland recorded, was sent to
a special servicer today, Fitch Ratings said.  The master servicer is Midland Loan Services and the
special servicer is CT Investment Management, according to the
debt-rating company. The loan, sponsored by Millennium Partners
and Argent Ventures, is scheduled to mature on Oct. 15, Fitch
said in a June 23 report. Mortgage servicers specialize in
restructuring troubled debt.  The loan is backed by the 13-story building, which
resembles a stack of vinyl records and was the world’s first
circular office tower, along with two parcels of land being used
for parking, Fitch said. Capitol Records built the property,
near the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, in
1956, and “Walk of Fame” stars for  John Lennon  and Garth
Brooks are in front of it, according to  Smithsonian.com .  Capitol is leasing the entire 106,000-square-foot (9,800-
square-meter) tower through 2016 and has two five-year extension
options, Fitch said. It’s paying $23.68 a square foot, less than
the average fourth-quarter asking rent of $36.35 in the area,
according to the rating company.  “At issuance, it was expected that ownership would up-zone
and redevelop the two development parcels,” Fitch said.
“However, this plan stalled due to the economic downturn.”  Voicemails left for Millennium and Argent weren’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
