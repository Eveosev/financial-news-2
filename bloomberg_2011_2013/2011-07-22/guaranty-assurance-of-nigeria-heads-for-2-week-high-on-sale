Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria’s
second-biggest lender by market value, rose the most in four
months after saying it would sell its stake in  Guaranty Trust
Assurance Plc (GTASSURE)  for 11.9 billion naira ($78.1 million).  The stock gained 69 kobo or 4.9 percent to 14.79 naira, the
biggest gain since March 22, at the 2:30 close of trading in
Lagos. Guaranty Trust Assurance shares rose as much as 4.9
percent and closed 2.8 percent higher at 1.47 naira.  Guaranty Trust Bank agreed to sell its 67.68 percent stake
in the insurer to Assur Africa Holding, with completion of the
sale expected by the end of the third quarter, it said in a
regulatory filing yesterday.  “This may just be the most profitable bank subsidiary
divestment we’ll see in this current round of subsidiary
sales,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based banking analyst with
 Renaissance Capital , wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
