Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its
forecast for U.S. corn production to 13.104 billion bushels for
the 2011-2012 season. The bank lowered its estimate for yields
to 156 bushels an acre.  On July 12, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said the
crop would total 13.47 billion bushels with yields of 158.7
bushels. Corn inventories before the 2012 harvest may fall to
694 million bushels, Goldman said. That compares with the
government’s estimate of 870 million.  “Temperatures in July in the U.S. Midwest have been very
elevated,” Damien Courvalin and  Allison Nathan , New York-based
Goldman analysts, said today in a report. “We see clear upside
risk to our” three-month corn-price forecast of $5.90 a bushel,
the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
