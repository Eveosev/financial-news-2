Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  said
second-quarter profit advanced 43 percent, bolstered by demand
for coolants at its chemical specialty unit and spare parts in
the aerospace division. The company raised its full-year
earnings forecast.  Net income rose to $810 million, or $1.02 a share, from
$566 million, or 73 cents, in the year-earlier period, the
 Morris Township , New Jersey-based company said in a statement
today. Excluding the impact of a unit that’s being sold, profit
of $1 a share topped the 98-cent average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Results were helped as an increase in global air traffic
boosted customers’ need for aerospace parts and services, and as
the company benefited from demand for environmentally friendly
coolants and chemicals used to make clothing. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  David Cote  in June agreed to buy  EMS
Technologies Inc. (ELMG)  for about $491 million to add wireless
communications equipment used to track cargo, which may increase
2012 profit.  Revenue rose 15 percent to $9.09 billion in the quarter,
excluding $234 million from the Consumer Products Group unit the
company is divesting.  Honeywell raised its full-year profit forecast to $3.85 to
$4 a share from an April estimate of as much as $3.95. Analysts
predicted $3.97 on average.  The EMS acquisition may add as much as 5 cents a share in
profit next year, analysts including Shannon O’Callaghan of
Nomura Equity Research in  New York  estimated at the time of
purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
