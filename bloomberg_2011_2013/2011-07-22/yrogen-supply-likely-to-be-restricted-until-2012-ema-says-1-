Supplies of Sanofi’s Thyrogen
treatment will be in short supply until 2012, longer than
originally expected, European authorities said.  No new patients should be given the thyroid-stimulating
hormone, the European Medicines Agency said today in a  statement 
on its website. In countries where Thyrogen is still available,
patients who can’t tolerate hormone withdrawal should get first
priority, the London-based agency said.  The Paris-based drugmaker acquired Thyrogen in its purchase
of U.S. biotechnology company Genzyme Corp., completed in April.
The shortage, which resulted from manufacturing problems at a
Genzyme plant, was originally expected to be over by this month.  Used in the treatment of thyroid cancer, the treatment had
sales of $182 million last year, or 4.5 percent of Genzyme’s
revenue. The shortage won’t be material to earnings based on
2010 sales, Marisol Peron, a Sanofi spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
