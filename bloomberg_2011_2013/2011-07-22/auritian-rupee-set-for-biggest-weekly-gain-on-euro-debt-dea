Mauritius’s rupee strengthened the
most in three weeks as the new agreement on Europe’s debt crisis
eases pressure on the country’s euro-centric exporters.  The currency appreciated 2 percent to 28.0750 per dollar by
6 p.m. in  Port Louis , the biggest jump since June 30 on a
closing basis and bringing the week’s increase to 1.2 percent.
Against the euro, the rupee strengthened 1.1 percent to 40.7238.  Euro-area leaders eased the terms for loans for cash-
strapped nations yesterday and empowered a 440 billion-euro
($631 billion) rescue fund to buy debt across financially
stressed nations, protecting Spain and  Italy .  “The rupee has the influenced by the euro-dollar seesaw on
the international front,” said Fabien Gebert, treasurer at GML,
which says it is the country’s biggest company by assets and
revenue, in a phone interview today. “The new bailout might be
of comfort for our exporters who are mostly euro-centric.”  Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million, derives 41
percent of its revenue in euros, according to Bank of Mauritius
data, as  Europe  is the main buyer of exports and accounts for
almost two-thirds of arriving tourists.  “The trend is yet to be confirmed next week with more
activity on the local front, as companies should proceed with
foreign-currency conversions to meet with their end of month
obligations such as import bills and wages,” Gebert said.  The buying price for the dollar was 27.3748 rupees to
27.5329 rupees with a selling price of 28.8252 rupees per
dollar, according to indicative rates on the Bank of Mauritius’s
website,  Mauritian stocks snapped four days of declines, advancing
0.2 percent to 2,048.19 at the 1:30 p.m. close of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
