Sugar jumped, heading for the
biggest two-day gain since October, on concern that the cane
crop may fall short of estimates in  Brazil , the world’s top
producer. Cocoa and coffee declined.  Cane output in Center South, the country’s main producing
region, may be about 520 million metric tons, according to Sao
Paulo-based Canaplan, a consultant. That compares with an
estimate of 533.5 million tons from Unica, an industry group.
Before today, prices jumped 34 percent since the end of April on
supply concerns.  “Everything that we’re reading is saying that supply is
going to be a little bit low,” Louis Barbera, a broker with VIP
Commodities in New York, said by telephone.  Raw sugar for October delivery climbed 1.31 cents, or 4.4
percent, to 31.16 cents a pound at 10:43 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . A close at that price would leave the
sweetener up 7.7 percent in two days, the biggest such gain
since Oct. 8.  Cocoa futures for September delivery dropped $112, or 3.5
percent, to $3,060 a metric ton on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery slumped 2.05
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.3875 a pound in New York.  In  London , refined sugar gained, cocoa fell and robusta
coffee rose on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
