New World Resources Plc, a central
European miner, said average coking coal prices negotiated for
the third quarter fell 9 percent, reflecting a decline in
international prices. The shares lost as much as 5.3 percent.  Prices slid to 192 euros a metric ton from 210 euros a ton
in the previous quarter, the Amsterdam-registered company said
today in a statement. Prices of thermal coal remained unchanged
at 71 euros a ton, it said.  NWR reiterated its 2011 production and sales targets. The
company expects to produce 11 million tons of coal and 800,000
tons of coke. It plans to sell 10.3 million tons of coal evenly
split between coking and thermal coal, as well as 720,000 tons
of coke this year.  The miner produced 3.25 million tons of coking and thermal
coal in the second quarter, as well as 198,000 tons of coke,
according to the statement. The company will publish first-half
earnings on Aug. 24.  NWR retreated 23.5 pence to 853 pence as of 8:23 a.m. in
 London . The shares are down 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
