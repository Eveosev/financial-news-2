Cash premiums for U.S. corn shipped
in July to export terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to
Chicago futures as harvesting across the South boosted supplies.
The soybean basis narrowed.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 80 cents to 86 cents a bushel above September futures,
compared with $1.02 to $1.03 yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean premium declined to 74 cents
to 84 cents a bushel above August futures from 75 cents to 84
cents.  “The southern harvest is just beginning to flow into the
supply pipeline” for corn,  Dave Marshall , a farm-marketing
adviser at Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “Exports have been
slowing, and commercial buyers can wait for cheaper cash
supplies.”  Corn futures for September delivery rose 10.75 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $6.90 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price fell 1.6 percent this week.  Soybean futures for August delivery were unchanged at
$13.8025 a bushel. The price fell 0.4 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
