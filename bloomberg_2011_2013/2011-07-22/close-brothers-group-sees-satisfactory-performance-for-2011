Close Brothers Group Plc (CBG) , the
British investment bank founded in 1878, said 2011 earnings will
be “satisfactory” on strong performance of its banking
division.  The loan book rose to 7 percent to 3.4 billion pounds ($5.6
billion) as of June 30 from 3.2 billion pounds five months
earlier, the investment bank said in a statement today. Assets
under management increased 18 percent to 9.7 billion pounds.
Winterflood, its securities division, had a slower performance
on weaker trading conditions, the company said.  “Although there has been a slowdown in the securities
division, the group expects to deliver a satisfactory
performance for the 2011 financial year,” Close Brothers said
in the statement. The company will report its full-year results
on Sept. 27.  The company made a cash offer for Cavanagh Group,
financial-advisory service in Cuckfield,  England , on May 16. It
also announced in May the sale of its U.K. offshore and Cayman
Islands businesses.  Close Brothers shares were down 1.4 percent at 8:45 a.m. in
 London  trading, giving the company a market value of 1.1 billion
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
