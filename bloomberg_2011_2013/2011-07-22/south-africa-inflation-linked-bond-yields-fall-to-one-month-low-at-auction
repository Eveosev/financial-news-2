South African inflation-linked bond
yields fell to the lowest levels in more than a month at a
weekly government auction of the debt after the central bank
said inflation will rise above its target level this year.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 600 million rand ($89
million) of linkers, as the bonds are called, with investors
bidding for 2.7 times the amount, according to the central
bank’s data on Bloomberg. The average yield on the 2.6 percent
securities maturing in 2028 fell to 2.6 percent, the lowest
since the auction of June 3, from 2.65 percent at last week’s
auction.  The consumer price index of  Africa ’s largest economy rose
to 5 percent in June, the highest in 15 months, from 4.6 percent
in April, the Pretoria-based statistics agency said on July 20.
The rate will breach the 6 percent target in the fourth quarter,
and average 6.3 percent in 2012, Central Bank Governor Gill
Marcus said yesterday.  “Given the 5 percent CPI print this week, we expect the
auction to clear at market levels or slightly stronger,” Rand
Merchant Bank analysts led by Theuns de Wet said in a research
note before today’s auction.  In addition to 170 million rand of 2.6 percent linkers due
2028, the central bank sold 280 million rand of 2.75 percent
notes due 2022 at an average yield of 2.55 percent down from
2.58 percent at the previous auction, and 150 million rand of
3.45 percent bonds due 2033 at 2.585 percent, from 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
