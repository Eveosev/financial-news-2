Gold approached a record high on
demand for an investment haven amid persistent debt concerns in
the U.S. and Europe.  Greece faces a “restricted default,”  Fitch Ratings  said,
after European leaders agreed yesterday to an additional
bailout. U.S. lawmakers are still debating on raising the $14.3
trillion debt ceiling before the government runs out of cash on
Aug. 2. Gold reached a record $1,610.70 an ounce on July 19.  “There’s a clamor for gold as the printing presses go off
around the world,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.
“The U.S. and Europe have structural problems, and there’s a
camp of investors that are willing to buy until these problems
are fixed.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $14.50, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,601.50 at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after reaching $1,607.70. The price is up 0.7 percent this
week, the third straight weekly gain.  On July 20, total open interest in Comex futures climbed to
a six-month high of 546,601 contracts.  Europe’s leaders yesterday announced 159 billion euros
($229 billion) of new aid for Greece, including a pledge by
banks to exchange and buy back the nation’s debt, which may
result in a short-term default.  President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker  John Boehner  are
pressing for a broad accord to boost the debt limit while
cutting spending by trillions of dollars and overhauling the  tax
code .  ‘Contagion Risks’  “Real contagion risks remain, as do currency risks,”
GoldCore Ltd., a broker in Dublin, said in an e-mail. “The
dollar and the euro remain vulnerable to further debasement and
depreciation.”  Silver futures for September delivery rose $1.175, or 3
percent, to $40.122 an ounce on the Comex, capping a 2.7 percent
increase for the week. The metal has gained for three straight
weeks.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell $2.60, or 0.3
percent, to $806.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was up 3.3 percent this week. Platinum futures for
October delivery rose $10.60, or 0.6 percent, to $1,798.40 an
ounce, capping a 2.4 percent gain for the week. Both metals have
rallied for four straight weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
