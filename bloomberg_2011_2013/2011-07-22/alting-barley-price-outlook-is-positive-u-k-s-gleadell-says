The outlook for malting-barley
prices in 2012 is “very positive” because of reduced supply,
U.K. grains trader Gleadell Agriculture Ltd. said.  “Malting barley supply is set to remain very tight and
prices and premiums are so high that anyone growing feed barley
should look at switching to a malting variety,” Gainsborough,
England-based Gleadell said in a  weekly report  on its website.  Barley is turned into malt by germinating and drying, and
the malted grain is used to make beer and whisky. Maltsters set
limits on nitrogen levels in the grain, an indication of protein
content, to better control the malting process.  First indications are for average nitrogen levels of 1.9
percent in the U.K.’s winter malting-barley crop this year,
“much higher” than in 2010, Gleadell said. The company said
it’s in talks with malting and brewing customers about the
nitrogen content.  “We are expecting a positive response in the next few
days,” Gleadell said. “Most malting barley will find a home at
some point at what is likely to be a very good premium.”  Nitrogen levels of 1.5 percent to 1.7 percent are needed to
achieve “desired levels” of malting and extraction yields,
according to  research  at the International Centre for Brewing
and Distilling in Edinburgh,  Scotland .  The NYSE Liffe malting-barley contract traded in Paris
calls for maximum protein content of 11.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
