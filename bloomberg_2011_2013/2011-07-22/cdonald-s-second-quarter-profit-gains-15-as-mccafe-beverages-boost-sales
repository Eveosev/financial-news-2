McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
largest restaurant chain, said second-quarter profit rose 15
percent, topping analysts’ estimates, as more consumers dined
out and McCafe beverages boosted sales.  Net income climbed to $1.41 billion, or $1.35 a share, from
$1.23 billion, or $1.13, a year earlier, the  Oak Brook ,
Illinois-based company said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.28 a share.  Chief Executive Officer James Skinner began selling McCafe
coffee in the U.S. in May 2009 to lure customers during non-peak
dining hours and has since added cold drinks such as smoothies.
Second-quarter McCafe sales in the U.S. rose 29 percent from a
year earlier, the company said today on a conference call.  “With the heat wave, a lot of people are going in and
getting frozen drinks,” Steve West, an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. in  St. Louis , said today in an interview.
“McCafe is doing very well.” West recommends buying the stock.  McDonald’s rose $2.02, or 2.3 percent, to $88.56 at 4:15
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 15 percent this year.  The chain’s sales at stores open more than 13 months
advanced 5.6 percent globally during the quarter. Analysts had
predicted a gain of 4.1 percent. Comparable, or same-store
sales, are an indicator of growth because the numbers include
only older restaurants.  Same-Store Sales  In June, comparable store  sales  rose 7.7 percent worldwide,
the largest monthly increase since November 2008. In the U.S.,
same-store sales climbed 6.9 percent in June, the biggest gain
since February 2008.  “The results were outstanding -- June obviously went
extremely well for them around the world,”  Mark Kalinowski , an
analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in New York, said in an
interview. “They continue to take market share.” He advises
buying the shares.  Second-quarter revenue climbed 16 percent to $6.91 billion.
The average estimate of 19 analysts was $6.65 billion.  McDonald’s repeated a forecast that 2011 food inflation
would be as much as 4.5 percent for the U.S. and  Europe . Yum!
Brands Inc., owner of the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, said
earlier this month it expects U.S. food costs to rise 7 percent
this year.  The profit margin at McDonald’s company-operated
restaurants narrowed to 19 percent in the second quarter from
19.9 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
