Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals
Ltd. (MRPL)  is seeking to buy low-sulfur crude for loading in
September, the company said in a document e-mailed to potential
suppliers late yesterday.  Mangalore Refinery,  India ’s biggest buyer of Iranian crude,
is in talks with Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co. to reduce the risk of a supply cut because of a payment
dispute with  Iran , according to its annual report posted on its
website.  Iran has told customers in India that they won’t receive
shipments next month unless outstanding bills are paid, four
people with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Indian
refiners have said global sanctions against Iran over its
nuclear program have made banks unwilling to transfer oil
payments.  Details of Mangalore Refinery’s tender are as follow:  To contact the reporters on this story:
