Wheat futures rebounded from a one-
week low on speculation that demand will increase from U.S.
livestock producers for a feed substitute as corn costs gain.  Corn, the main feed ingredient, climbed as much as 1.9
percent today as adverse weather threatened yields in the
Midwest. Wheat and corn futures for September delivery traded
near parity. On average, wheat has been $1.93 a bushel above
corn in the past year. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
expects wheat  feed  and residual use to jump 63 percent this year
to 220 million bushels.  “The only positive thing for wheat is corn,”  Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit Commodity Brokerage in  Des
Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “If the corn
market starts to head up, that will pull wheat along with it.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 15 cents, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $6.9225 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after touching $6.6925, the lowest since
July 13. The most-active contract is up 16 percent in the past
year, while corn has jumped 76 percent.  Wheat still fell 0.4 percent this week, snapping two
straight weeks of gains.  The U.S. is the world’s leading wheat exporter. The grain
is the nation’s fourth-largest crop, valued at $13 billion in
2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
