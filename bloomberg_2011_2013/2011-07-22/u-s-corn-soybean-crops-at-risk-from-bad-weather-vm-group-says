U.S. corn and soybeans that are at
or near critical development stages are at risk from hot, dry
weather, said Gary Mead, a London-based analyst for VM Group, in
a report today.  Both were planted late after flooding kept farmers out of
fields in May and June, meaning they will be harvested later in
the year, heightening the risk of frost damage, according to the
report.  In  Brazil , Argentina and  Paraguay , the corn and soybean
harvests are complete and farmers collected “bumper crops for
both,” VM Group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
