Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, the
owner of  Latin America ’s largest convenience-store chain, said
second-quarter profit from continued operations rose 8.3 percent
on new Oxxo locations and same-store sales gains.  Net income increased to 2.75 billion pesos ($236 million)
from 2.54 billion pesos a year earlier, excluding the 26.6
billion peso gain from the sale of its beer unit last year to
 Heineken NV (HEIA) , the company said today in a statement.  Sales advanced 16 percent to 48.4 billion pesos, excluding
the beer unit, said Femsa, as the Monterrey, Mexico-based
company is known.  Jose Yordan, an analyst with Deutsche Bank AG in  New York ,
forecast net income at 3 billion pesos in a July 21 report.
Yordan, who has a “buy” rating on the shares, predicted sales
of 47.3 billion pesos.  Oxxo, Femsa’s convenience store chain, is attracting
customers with new products including fast food, and has avoided
the price competition from supermarkets such as Wal-Mart de
Mexico SAB, said Rodrigo Echagaray, an analyst with the Mexican
brokerage of Bank of Nova Scotia, in a July 14 report.  “Oxxo will continue to outperform its supermarket
competitors,” he wrote in the report. The chain’s “convenient
locations allow it to charge higher prices,” wrote Echagaray,
who has a “sector outperform” rating on the shares.  Coca-Cola Femsa  Femsa’s earnings have benefited from Coca-Cola Femsa SAB,
its publicly traded soft-drink company. Femsa sold its beer
company last year -- in a transaction valued at more than $7
billion including $2.1 billion of assumed debt -- in exchange
for a 20 percent stake in Amsterdam-based Heineken.  Oxxo’s sales rose 20 percent to 19 billion pesos, driven by
an 11 percent increase in same-store sales. The chain opened 342
new stores in the quarter for a total of 8,963. Sales from Coca-
Cola Femsa, which reported earnings July 20, increased 13
percent to 28.4 billion pesos.  Femsa’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization -- a measure of  cash flow  known as Ebitda -- rose
19 percent to 8 billion pesos. Net income included 551 million
pesos from the Heineken stake compared with 508 million pesos a
year earlier.  At the end of June, Femsa’s cash and cash equivalents were
31.2 billion pesos, higher than total debt of 28.1 billion
pesos.  The company’s shares rose 82 centavos, or 1 percent, to
78.96 pesos in Mexico trading at 10:10 a.m. New York time.
Before today the shares were up 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
