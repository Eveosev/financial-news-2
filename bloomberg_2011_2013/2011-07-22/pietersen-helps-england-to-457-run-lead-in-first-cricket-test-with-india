Kevin Pietersen ’s double century led
England to a 457-run lead over India after day two of their
opening cricket Test at Lord’s in London.  Pietersen finished 202 not out, his 18th career century and
first in England since August 2008, as the hosts declared on
474-8. India reached 17-0 at stumps.  Matt Prior scored 71 and Jonathan Trott had 70 for England.
Praveen Kumar took five wickets for India in the absence of
injured fast-bowler  Zaheer Khan .  England added 32 runs onto its overnight total of 127-2
before Trott was out leg before wicket off of Kumar. Ian Bell
and Eoin Morgan were then lost within four balls, leaving the
hosts at 270-5.  Petersen and Prior had a 120-run partnership before Kumar 
got Prior and  Stuart Broad  on consecutive balls.  Pietersen continued adding to his total and a four brought
him to 173, making him 12th English batsman to reach 6,000 runs
in his career. After a final four gave him 202, captain  Andrew Strauss  declared.  Khan took 2-18 in yesterday’s rain-shortened play before
leaving with a hamstring strain. He received treatment during
play today and may be available for the second innings.  The match is the 2,000th in the 134 years of elite Test
cricket. England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
