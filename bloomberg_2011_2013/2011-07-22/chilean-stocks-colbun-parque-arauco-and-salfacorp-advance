The following companies had unusual
price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:13 p.m. New York time.  The Ipsa index climbed 0.2 percent to 4,627.80.  Colbun SA (COLBUN)   gained 0.2 percent to 129.64 pesos,
reducing a loss this week. Chile’s second-largest electricity
generator by market value had its share price estimate raised at
Banco de Credito & Inversiones, which cited a more
“conservative” commercial policy and long-term contracts.  Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR)   dropped 7.2 percent to a
record low of 426.46 pesos. The retailer, which set aside $900
million last month to cover consumer-lending irregularities,
lost 23 percent this week after regulators gave it until the end
of October to submit financial statements that incorporate the
provisions. A planned $200 million share sale that Chairman
Cesar Barros said would help make the company viable hinges on
those revised statements.  Parque Arauco SA (PARAUCO)   fell 0.2 percent to 993
pesos. The Santiago-based shopping mall developer plans to sell
90 million new shares at 950 pesos each to help finance  capital
expenditures , it wrote in a regulatory filing yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
