The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index decreased 2.75 basis points
to 118.25 basis points as of 9:36 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank
AG prices show. Thatâ€™s on course for the lowest close since
March 22, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in privately negotiated
markets.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 4.5 basis points to
114.5 basis points as of 10:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan dropped 5 basis points to 115
basis points as of 8:36 a.m. in  Hong Kong , prices from the
Frankfurt-based bank show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
