Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
first day in three against the dollar as importers raised demand
for the U.S. currency.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 0.1
percent to 90.08 per dollar in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital,
bringing its decline this week to 0.4 percent.  “The shilling has weakened slightly due to increased
demand for the greenback and we expect it to trade within the
89.70-90.30 band as the European crisis eases off following
yesterday’s decision to offer further support to Greece,”
Wilson Mutai, a trader at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp.,
said in a phone interview today.  Yesterday, European leaders in Brussels announced 159
billion euros ($229 billion) of new aid for  Greece . They also
empowered their 440 billion-euro rescue fund to buy debt across
stressed euro nations after a market rout last week sparked
concern the crisis was spreading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
