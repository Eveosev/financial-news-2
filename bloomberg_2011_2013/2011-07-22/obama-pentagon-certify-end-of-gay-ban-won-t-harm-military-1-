President  Barack Obama  and the
Pentagon’s top two leaders today signed the required
certification attesting that the Defense Department is prepared
for repeal of the military’s ban on gays serving openly.  According to a law passed in December, the ban should be
lifted “once and for all” 60 days after the certification,
Obama said. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  and Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also signed the
certification, which was sent today to lawmakers in Congress.  “As of Sept. 20th, service members will no longer be
forced to hide who they are in order to serve our country,”
Obama said in a White House statement. “Today, we have taken
the final major step toward ending the discriminatory ‘Don’t
Ask, Don’t Tell’ law that undermines our military readiness and
violates American principles of fairness and equality.”  The change represents a political victory for Obama, who
campaigned on a pledge to repeal the 17-year-old prohibition,
which dates to the administration of President  Bill Clinton .  The shift is among a number of changes the administration
has made, including at the State Department, to ease rules and
regulations on government employees that discriminate based on
sexual orientation.  Obama earlier this month appointed an openly gay Army
veteran, Brenda S. “Sue” Fulton, to the Board of Visitors at
the U.S. Military Academy at  West Point ,  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
