At least 47 women in  Democratic
Republic of Congo  were victims of sexual violence during two
days of attacks around the start of year, the United Nations
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said today.  Armed men raided the villages of Bushani and Kalambahiro in
North Kivu province beginning on New Year’s Eve, according to a
report released on the agency’s website. The attackers were
allegedly part of the Congolese army, according to the report.  In February, nine soldiers were convicted of ordering or
participating in the rapes of more than 50 people in the South
Kivu town of Fizi on New Year’s Day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
