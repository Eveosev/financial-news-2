Late harvests for crops such as corn
and buckwheat will suffer in European Russia in the rest of July
because of heat, the  Federal Hydrometeorological Center  said on
its website.  Weather will be “mainly favorable” for reaping matured
crops such as wheat in the area, the center said, adding the
climate will be “predominantly satisfactory” for crops in the
country’s Asian part.  The center said grains in the northern parts of the Central
and Volga federal districts were lodged by heavy rain in the
first 20 days of July, while in the southern parts of the
districts, corn and buckwheat crops suffered from a lack of
precipitation.  Reduced moisture also damaged spring grains to various
degrees in certain parts of western Altai, southern parts of
Kurgan and the Novosibirsk regions in Siberia during July 1-20,
the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
