Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s biggest oil
company, confirmed an Ansa newsire report that it has signed a
memorandum of understanding with  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp (600028) , Asia’s largest oil refiner known as Sinopec.  The Rome-based company is interested in shale gas
opportunities in China, while Sinopec is seeking to grow in
areas like Africa with Eni’s help, Chief Executive Officer Paolo Scaroni told Ansa in an interview in Beijing. The newswire

China National Petroleum Corp that included cooperation in
Africa and on shale gas and the possible purchase of stakes in
Eni assets by the Chinese company, known as PetroChina.  Eni has been active in China since 1984 and is seeking to
grow in the  Far East . The Rome-based company is the largest oil

been buying resources to feed their growing economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
