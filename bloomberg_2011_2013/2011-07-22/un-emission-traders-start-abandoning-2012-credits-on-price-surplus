Interest in United Nations emission
credits for 2011 and 2012 has waned after prices dropped to a
two-year low and traders began to transfer positions into
later years to avoid an oversupply exacerbated by the recession.  Open interest, a measure of trading positions that have not
closed, dropped 8.1 percent for so-called Certified Emission
Reductions for December 2011 to 69.4 million metric tons through
July 20 from its peak on May 9, according to data from the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London . December 2012 interest for
CERs has dropped 5.2 percent, while interest in 2011 European
Union carbon permits has risen 15 percent since May 9.  Utilities in the bloc that need credits after 2012 are
shifting their focus to that period because the market is so
oversupplied in the second phase, the five years starting in
2008, said Matthew Gray, an analyst at IdeaCarbon in London,
which rates credits. “Get past phase two and the market is a
lot tighter,” he said July 20 in an interview.  CERs for December dropped to 9.56 euros ($13.77) a metric
ton on July 13, the lowest level since March 2009 on ICE, the
biggest exchange for carbon trading. They closed at 10.17 euros
yesterday, down 11 percent this year and still close to the cost
of producing the credits in developing nations, currently about
9.54 euros, said Gray.  Industrial-Gas Ban  The overhang of carbon permits and credits in phase two is
exacerbated by a ban on some industrial-gas credits starting May
2013, which means these offsets have to be used for compliance
before the third phase. “We have masses of industrial-gas CERs
to get rid of,” Gray said July 20 in an interview. Buyers
include utilities  RWE AG (RWE)  and  Enel SpA. (ENEL)   The surplus is estimated at 954 million tons of allowances
and credits in the five-year period, according to an estimate by
Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London. That’s 9 percent of the
EU-permit cap of 10.7 billion tons in the period.  With UN credit prices in the secondary market at close to
cost, some traders may have made money this month and last by
buying back hedges for about 10 euros a ton after selling them
earlier this year for as much as 13.50 euros, Gray said. That
would lower the volume of open positions.  The ban on the most plentiful hydrofluorocarbon-23 offsets
and potential plans by EU lawmakers to change the program’s
rules has accelerated the exodus from phase two, said Jan Pravda, director of Dublin-based CO2 brokerage Carbon Warehouse
and investor. “I’ve looked into hundreds of securities and I
can’t see anything that’s more vulnerable to regulatory risk,”
he said July 20 in a telephone interview from  Prague .  2013 Premium  Prices and open interest after 2012 have fared better. The
premium of 2013 CERs over those for this year widened by 41
percent to 89 euro cents a ton since June 27, when it was at its
narrowest since February. Open interest in December 2013 credits
has jumped 19 percent since then to 14.5 million tons. Interest
in December 2014 credits has more than doubled.  UN credit prices will rise to 11.58 euros by December 2015,
according to ICE data. UN regulators have granted 170 million
tons of offsets this year, already a record for a year,
according to data from the Bonn-based UN Framework Convention on
 Climate Change . EU factory and power station carbon-dioxide
output fell 11 percent in 2009 during the economic recession and
recovered 3.2 percent last year.  “We get approaches often” for credits that will be
delivered after 2012, Scott McGregor, Camco International Ltd.’s
chief executive officer, said by telephone July 12. London-based
Camco develops greenhouse-gas credit projects in nations
including China and  Vietnam .  The proposed Australian and California carbon markets will
probably add to demand, McGregor said. “We’ll wait for the
price to come up. We’re not forced to sell credits” at current
levels, he said.  Camco has a window of about 18 months in which the company
can lock in prices of its credits while the projects gain
regulatory approval and begin to reduce  greenhouse gases ,
McGregor said. The approval process, governed by the Clean
Development Mechanism executive board based in Bonn, can take
more than a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
