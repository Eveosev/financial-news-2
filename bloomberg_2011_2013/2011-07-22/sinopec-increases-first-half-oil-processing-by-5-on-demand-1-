China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ,
Asia’s largest oil refiner, increased oil processing by 5
percent in the first half from a year earlier to meet rising
domestic demand.  Refining increased to 108.53 million metric tons, or 4.4
million barrels a day, according to a statement on its parent’s
website today. The company aims to raise the volume by 5 percent
to 222 million tons this year, according to its annual report.
The nation’s total  refining  gained 7 percent to 223 million tons
in the first half, according to the government.  China ’s demand for major oil products climbed 7.2 percent
in the first half, bolstered by record consumption in March
after a drought cut power generation, the National Development
and Reform Commission said July 19. Sinopec’s processing growth
slowed from 13 percent last year and 6.7 percent in 2009 after
fewer new plants were built.  Sinopec’s domestic fuel sales gained 10.2 percent from a
year earlier to 75.1 million tons during the period, its parent
said. Gasoline production rose 2.3 percent to 18.18 million tons
and diesel output gained 4.7 percent to 38.44 million tons.
Kerosene output increased 12.3 percent to 6.77 million tons.  Crude oil output fell 6 percent to 156.9 million barrels in
the first half, after production in  Africa  dropped 62 percent to
6.71 million barrels. Natural gas output surged 26.6 percent to
253.9 billion cubic feet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
