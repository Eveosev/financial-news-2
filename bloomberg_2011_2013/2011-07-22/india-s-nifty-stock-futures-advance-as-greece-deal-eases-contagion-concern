India’s benchmark stock index rose
this week as European leaders agreed on aid for  Greece , easing
concerns the region’s debt crisis may spread and threaten global
growth and as some earnings boosted sentiments.  Infosys Ltd., the country’s second-biggest software maker,
paced gains among peers. India’s largest software companies get
about a quarter of their orders from  Europe . After eight hours
of talks in Brussels, leaders announced $229 billion in new aid
for Greece late yesterday, risking temporary default in their
efforts to prevent the crisis spreading.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the
largest mobile-phone operator, jumped to a 22-month high after
reports it raised tariff.  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  and Jet Airways (India)
Ltd. gained after their earnings report.  “We have decided to increase allocations to India in the
past three to four weeks,” said Sam Mahtani, who helps oversee
$6 billion in assets as director of emerging-market equities at
U.K.-based F&C Asset Management Plc. “There could be weak days
as we navigate markets with news flow from Europe and the U.S.,
but we don’t see a significant downside to India and emerging
markets. The market has pretty much bottomed out.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 286.11, or 1.6 percent, to 18,722.30 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The gauge gained 0.9 percent this week. The
index has declined 8.7 percent this year, the second-worst
performer among key indexes in the world’s 10 biggest markets,
amid rate increases.  Monetary Tightening  The  Reserve Bank  of India meets on July 26 to set policy
after raising rates 10 times since March last year to rein in
accelerating prices. Inflation quickened to 9.44 percent in June
from 9.06 percent in May, the government said last week. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.3 percent, erasing its loss for
the year, on the new aid plan for Greece. The gauge added 2.4
percent this week.  “High inflation and the possibility of another 25 to 50
basis point increase in rates is pretty much discounted,” said
Mahtani. “We are looking to position the portfolio back into
rate-sensitive areas. The two themes are banking and autos.”  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , India’s second-biggest lender, added 2.6
percent to 1,068.05 rupees.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) ,
the nation’s biggest mortgage lender, gained 1.3 percent to
707.85 rupees.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the nation’s biggest
maker of sport-utility vehicles and tractors, jumped 3.1 percent
to 724.35 rupees, and  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the No.2 motorcycle
maker, added 2.1 percent to 1,448.55 rupees.  Mahtani said he favors the companies among domestic banks
and automobile companies.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index rose 1.7 percent to 5,633.95 and
its July futures settled at 5,641.60. The BSE 200 Index climbed
1.6 percent to 2,321.19.  Sensex Weighting  Infosys surged 2.2 percent to 2,828.25 rupees and rival
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  gained 1 percent to 1,133.4
rupees.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest, gained 1.2 percent to
405.85 rupees and its July futures settled at 407 rupees.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , which has the biggest weighting
on the Sensex, increased 1.5 percent to 873.35 rupees and its
July futures traded at 876 rupees. The company may say July 25
profit in the quarter ended June increased 16.5 percent to 56.5
billion rupees, according to the median estimate of 14 analysts
in a Bloomberg News Survey.  Bharti rallied 4.1 percent to 411.15 rupees, its highest
since October 2009. The stock is the best performer this week
and the second-best on the Sensex this year. The company raised
call tariffs to 1.2 paise a second from 1 paise in some zones,
Bloomberg UTV reported today, citing NewsWire18, sparking
investor optimism the move will boost its earnings.  Airline Loss  Axis Bank jumped 4.6 percent to 1,296.9 rupees after its
first quarter profit rose 27 percent to 9.42 billion rupees,
more than the 9.11 billion rupees estimated by analysts.  Jet Airways, the biggest airline, climbed 2.4 percent to
499.45 rupees after reporting a loss of 1.23 billion rupees,
less than 2.24 billion rupees estimated by analysts.  Companies on the Sensex may report a profit growth of 12
percent to 14 percent in the year ending March 2012, less than
the consensus estimate of 17 percent, Rakesh Arora, head of
research at Macquarie Capital Securities ( India ) Pvt., said in a
July 18 interview. Bank of America Merrill Lynch reduced its
profit estimate to 17 percent from 21 percent, Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, head of India research, said July 19.  Three out of seven Sensex companies that have posted
earnings for the June quarter have missed estimates as rising
borrowing costs damped demand. Some 33 percent of the companies
in the Sensex missed analysts’ profit estimates in the March
quarter, compared with less than a quarter that did so last
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Companies on the Sensex are valued at 15 times estimated
earnings, down from 21.5 times in March 2010, and compared with
11 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Overseas funds sold a net 311 million rupees of Indian
equities on July 20, paring their investment in stocks this year
to 96.2 billion rupees, according to data on the  website  of the
 Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
