French banks plan to participate in
the new package of aid for  Greece , the French Banking Federation
said.  “The main French banks will propose very quickly to their
governance bodies to contribute to the announced plan,” the
Paris-based group, which has some 430 members including BNP
Paribas SA and  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, said in a statement today.
“An exceptional contribution of the whole of financial
investors is possible and desirable.” The federation didn’t
give any details on how the country’s banks will contribute.  The Institute of International Finance said yesterday that
banks pledged to participate in a bond exchange and debt buyback
program. The role of banks, insurers and other private investors
will provide financing of 54 billion euros ($77.6 billion) to
Greece from mid-2011 to mid-2014, building to a total of 135
billion euros through 2020, the Washington-based IIF said.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  and Societe Generale, France’s largest banks by
market value, are among financial firms supporting the EU’s
second rescue of Greece, the IIF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
