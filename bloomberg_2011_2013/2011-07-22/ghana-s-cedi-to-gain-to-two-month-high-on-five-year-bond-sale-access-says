Ghana ’s cedi is set to appreciate to
a two-month high against the dollar over the next week as
offshore investors buy the West African nation’s currency to
invest in its first sale of five-year bonds since 2007.  The cedi will gain to 1.5060 per dollar, Kwabena Owusu, a
currency trader at the local unit of Access Bank Plc said in a
telephone interview today. That would be the strongest closing
level since May 31, according to Bloomberg data. The currency
appreciated as much as 0.2 to 1.5070 per dollar before trading
0.1 percent down at 1.5115 by 1:14 p.m. in Accra, the capital.  “Our expectation is that dollar sales by offshore
investors before next Thursday’s auction of five-year bonds will
push the cedi up a little bit,” Owusu said. “We think the cedi
will gain about 0.3 percent by the close of the auction, from
yesterday’s close.”  The  Bank of Ghana  will offer 300 million cedis ($198.5
million) of five-year bonds on July 28, it said in a prospectus
on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
