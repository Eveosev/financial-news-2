Rubber declined for a second day on
concern demand from  China , the biggest user, may fall after a
preliminary report showed manufacturing contracted for the first
time in a year.  December-delivery rubber declined as much as 2.3 percent to
376.10 yen a kilogram ($4,784 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, extending yesterday’s 1 percent fall. It
closed at 381.1 yuan, to gain 0.6 percent this week.  “China is the biggest consumer of rubber, so TOCOM rubber
is increasingly affected by the Chinese market,” Guo Cheng, an
analyst at Yongan Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing. “The
immediate reaction to the manufacturing report may be bearish,”
even as the longer-term outlook on tire consumption is positive,
Guo said.  Preliminary data for the purchasing managers’ index in
China fell to 48.9 for July from a final reading of 50.1 for
June, HSBC Holdings Plc and Market Economics said yesterday,
lending to evidence that growth in the world’s second-largest
economy is slowing on Premier Wen Jiabao’s campaign to tame
consumer and property prices. A reading below 50 indicates
contraction.  Natural rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange for January
delivery rose 0.4 percent to 36,110 yuan ($5,601) per ton,
reversing a decline of as much as 1.4 percent.  China’s auto market may triple over the next 10 years to 50
million units a year in a “conservative” estimate, the  China
Daily  reported July 11 citing Liu Shijin, deputy director of the
Development Research Center of the State Council.  Sales for the industry could reach as much as 60 to 70
million vehicles a year by 2021, Liu said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
