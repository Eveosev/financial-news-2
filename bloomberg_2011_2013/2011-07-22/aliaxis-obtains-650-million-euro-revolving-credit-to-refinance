Aliaxis SA (ALIVP) , a Belgian construction-
plastics manufacturer, signed a 650 million-euro ($933 million)
loan to refinance maturing debt.  The five-year revolving credit facility will be used for
general corporate purposes and will replace a 936 million-euro
loan signed in 2005, according to an e-mailed statement from
Crédit Agricole CIB. The proceeds will be used for Aliaxis
Finance SA and Aliaxis North America Inc. units.  Credit Agricole CIB, BNP Paribas’s Fortis Bank SA/NV,
Commerzbank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, KBC Bank NV, Natixis SA and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc arranged the financing, and
were joined by eight banks in syndication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
