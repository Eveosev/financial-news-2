Asian currencies advanced to a 14-
year high after European leaders pledged more aid for  Greece ,
easing concern the debt crisis will worsen and bolstering demand
for emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, reached
the highest level since August 1997 and completed a weekly gain
after the 159 billion euro ($229 billion) package was announced.
 China ’s yuan rose to a 17-year high yesterday, the Philippine
peso reached a three-year peak and South Korea’s won touched the
strongest level since August 2008.  “It’s quite clear that the risk environment has improved
significantly as the European summit agreement has helped to
calm fears over the debt problems in Europe,” said Moh Siong Sim, a currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd.  The peso strengthened 1.3 percent this week to 42.403
versus the dollar in  Manila , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Malaysia ’s ringgit appreciated 1 percent to 2.9755,
Thailand’s baht climbed 0.8 percent to 29.83, Singapore’s dollar
added 0.8 percent to S$1.2091 and the won rose 0.6 percent to
1,051.98.  The ringgit reached a two-month high on speculation the
central bank will raise borrowing costs after Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said curbing inflation is a priority. Consumer
prices in Malaysia rose to a two-year high of 3.5 percent in
June, according to official data released July 20.  Philippine Fundamentals Positive  “The ringgit could hold on to its strength as there are
growing expectations that the Malaysian central bank will raise
its policy rate,” said Calbert Loh, head of treasury at Bangkok
Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .  The peso gained the most this week since September 2010
after the  International Monetary Fund  said on July 20 that the
near-term outlook for the Philippines was favorable.  “The fundamentals, growth prospects and the fiscal side
remain positive in the Philippines,” said Lito Biacora, vice
president for treasury at Bank of the Philippine Islands in
Manila.  The baht had a third weekly advance as overseas investors
added to their holdings of the nation’s stocks. Global funds
bought $370 million more Thai equities than they sold this week
through July 21, taking this month’s net purchases to $762
million.  Indonesia’s rupiah appreciated 0.3 percent this week to
8,523 per dollar after  Fitch Ratings  said on July 19 that the
country may achieve an investment-grade credit rating before the
end of next year. Fitch rates Indonesia BB+, one step below
investment grade.  The yuan posted its biggest weekly gain in three months
after the central bank signaled it favors a stronger currency to
curb inflation. The currency advanced 0.27 percent to 6.4455 per
dollar.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent this
week to NT$28.83 against its U.S. counterpart and  India ’s rupee
