The euro dropped for the first time
in four days against the dollar on concern measures announced by
European Union officials yesterday to contain  Greece ’s debt
crisis won’t be enough to quell regional turmoil.  The 17-nation currency pared its first weekly gain since
July 1 as  Fitch Ratings  said Greece faces “restricted default’’
after euro-area leaders agreed on a new bailout for the nation
that would involve contributions from bondholders. The dollar
rose from a four-month low against the yen on speculation the
U.S. is approaching a deal to raise its debt ceiling.  “There’s still key uncertainty ahead until the
implementation of the Greek deal,” said  Lena Komileva , head of
Group of 10 strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  London .
“The EU summit has marked a landmark in the approach to the
solvency crisis by presenting a solution for Greece and
introducing more active management for contagion risk across the
rest of the euro periphery, but there are still risks.”  The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.4378 at 8:33 a.m. in  New
York , from $1.4425 yesterday, after reaching $1.4439, the
highest since July 6. The shared currency dropped 0.4 percent to
112.55 yen, from 112.94. The dollar was little changed at 78.31
yen after touching 78.22, the lowest level since the day before
the Group of Seven intervened to weaken  Japan ’s currency
following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  After eight hours of talks in Brussels, euro-area leaders
announced 159 billion euros ($229 billion) in new aid for Greece
yesterday, with bondholders agreeing to contribute to the
package. They also expanded the role of the 440-billion euro
rescue fund to buy debt across distressed nations, assist
troubled banks and offer credit lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
