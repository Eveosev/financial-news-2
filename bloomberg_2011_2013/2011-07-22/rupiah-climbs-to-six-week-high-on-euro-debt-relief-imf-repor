Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced to a
six-week high after European leaders agreed on a new aid package
for Greece, increasing appetite for emerging-market assets.  The currency headed for a weekly gain after officials
announced the 159 billion euro ($229 billion) rescue plan in
Brussels yesterday. Overseas investors boosted  holdings  of
Indonesian government debt by 23 percent to 241.76 trillion
rupiah ($28 billion) this  year  through July 18. The
 International Monetary Fund  said yesterday economic growth will
remain around 6.5 percent in 2011-2012, after 6.1 percent
expansion last year.  “The statement coming out of  Europe  last night looks
positive,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange
research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “The official
financing will cover what is required for  Greece  to survive in
the interim. Locally, Indonesia’s strong fundamentals will
attract capital inflows.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.2 percent to 8,528 per dollar as
of 5:07 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 8,513 earlier, the highest level since June
9, and gained 0.2 percent this week.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds advanced today and for
the week. The yield on the 8.25 percent securities due July 2021
dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week to
7.26 percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. The rate fell two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
