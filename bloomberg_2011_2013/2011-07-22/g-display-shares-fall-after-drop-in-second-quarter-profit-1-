LG Display Co., the world’s second-
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, fell in Seoul trading
after reporting a 96 percent plunge in second-quarter profit.  The shares declined 2.6 percent to 29,450 won as of the 3
p.m. close of trading, the biggest drop since July 12.  South
Korea ’s benchmark Kospi index gained 1.2 percent.  Today’s move follows LG’s announcement yesterday that net
income tumbled on slowing demand. The company forecast that a
slowdown in display sales will continue in the second half as
television makers delay purchases after failing to lure
consumers with models equipped with features such as 3-D.  “The market for 3-D TVs didn’t take off as they
expected,” Lee Seung Chul, a Seoul-based analyst at Shinyoung
Securities Co., said by telephone. “The situation won’t change
much for the rest of this year for sure, and it’s hard to say
with confidence it’ll start getting better next year.”  Net income fell to 21.3 billion won ($20 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 554.8 billion won a year
earlier, the company said. Profit missed the 49.9 billion won
average of 25 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
fell 6.3 percent, and the operating loss was 48.3 billion won.  LG Display plans to cut this year’s capital spending by
more than 1 trillion won from a previous plan of 4 trillion won
to 4.5 trillion won, company Chief Financial Officer James Jeong
said at a briefing in  Seoul  yesterday. A “meaningful recovery”
in demand is unlikely at least until early next year, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
