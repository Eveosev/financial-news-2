Yemenis marched in 17 provinces to
demand the immediate resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh
and protest dwindling supplies of fuel and electricity.  Tens of thousands of demonstrators packed onto al-Siteen
Street in Sana’a, chanting “Where is the petrol? Where is the
gas? You bloody bandits! You crisis-makers!” Government
supporters also marched near the presidential palace in the
capital, carrying pictures of Saleh, who is in  Saudi Arabia 
recovering from an attack on his palace last month.  In Taiz in southern Yemen, a girl was killed and two of her
brothers injured when their home was hit by a shell fired by the
Republican Guard, said Hani Ali, a resident of the city, in a
phone interview.  Anti-government protests erupted in Yemen in January as
part of the movements sweeping the Arab world, calling for more
jobs and freedom. Violence escalated after Saleh refused to sign
an Arab Gulf-brokered deal that would grant him immunity if he
left office within 30 days and turned leadership over to Vice
President Abed Rabbo Mansur Hadi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
