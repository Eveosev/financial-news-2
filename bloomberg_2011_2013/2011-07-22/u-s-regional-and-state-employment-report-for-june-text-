The following is the text of the U.S.
state employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Regional and state unemployment rates were little changed
in June. Twenty-eight states and the  District of Columbia 
registered unemployment rate increases, 8 states recorded rate
decreases, and 14 states had no rate change, the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics reported today. Thirty-nine states posted
unemployment rate decreases from a year earlier, eight states
and the District of Columbia reported increases, and three
states had no change. The national jobless rate was little
changed at 9.2 percent, but was 0.3 percentage point lower than
a year earlier.  In June, nonfarm payroll employment increased in 26 states
and the District of Columbia and decreased in 24 states. The
largest over-the-month increase in employment occurred in Texas
(+32,000), followed by California (+28,800), Michigan (+18,000),
and  Minnesota  (+13,200). Alaska experienced the largest over-
the-month percentage increase in employment (+1.7 percent),
followed by  North Dakota  (+1.2 percent), Vermont (+0.9 percent),
and  South Dakota  (+0.8 percent). The largest over-the-month
decrease in employment occurred in  Tennessee  (-16,900), followed
by Missouri (-15,700),  Virginia  (-14,600), and  North Carolina  (-
9,500). Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee experienced the largest
over-the-month percentage declines in employment (-0.6 percent

the year, nonfarm employment increased in 40 states and

10.4 percent, while the Northeast had the lowest rate, 8.1
percent. Over the month, two regions experienced statistically
significant jobless rate changes: the Midwest (+0.2 percentage
point) and South (+0.1 point). Three of the regions registered
significant rate changes from a year earlier: the Midwest (-1.1
percentage points) and Northeast and West (-0.6 point each).  Among the nine geographic divisions, the Pacific continued
to have the highest jobless rate, 11.0 percent in June. The West
North Central again registered the lowest rate, 6.8 percent.
Over the month, two divisions experienced statistically
significant unemployment rate changes: the East North Central

which were decreases. The largest decrease was in the East North
Central (-1.5 percentage points).  State Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Nevada continued to register the highest unemployment rate

and South Dakota, 4.8 percent. In total, 26 states posted
jobless rates significantly lower than the U.S. figure of 9.2
percent, 6 states and the District of Columbia recorded
measurably higher rates, and 18 states had rates that were not
appreciably different from that of the nation.  Nine states reported statistically significant over-the-
month unemployment rate increases in June. South Carolina
experienced the largest increase (+0.5 percentage point),
followed by Alabama, Arkansas, and  Illinois  (+0.3 point each)
and Maryland, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin
(+0.2 point each). The District of Columbia also experienced a
significant over-the-month rate increase (+0.6 percentage point).
The remaining 41 states registered jobless rates that were not
measurably different from those of a month earlier, though some
had changes that were at least as large numerically as the
significant changes.  Nevada recorded the largest jobless rate decrease from June
2010 (-2.5 percentage points). Two other states had rate
decreases of at least 2.0 percentage points-- Michigan  (-2.1
points) and  Indiana  (-2.0 points). Eleven additional states had
smaller but also statistically significant decreases over the
year. The remaining 36 states and the District of Columbia
registered unemployment rates that were not appreciably
different from those of a year earlier.  Nonfarm Payroll Employment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Over the month, 16 states recorded statistically
