Wirsol Solar AG signed a sponsorship
contract with TSG 1899 Hoffenheim, becoming the third solar
energy company to sign deals with German Bundesliga soccer clubs
in less than two weeks.  Wirsol, a privately owned photovoltaic retailer, bought the
name rights to Hoffenheim’s Rhein-Neckar Arena for the coming
three seasons for an undisclosed amount, the company said in a
statement today.  China ’s Suntech Power Holdings Co. and Yingli
Green Energy Holding Co. as well as Germany’s  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  and
 Solarworld AG (SWV)  have signed agreements with Bundesliga clubs in
past months.  “Soccer sponsoring increases brand awareness and may lead
to new customers,” Henning Wicht, a solar analyst at researcher
IHS Isuppli, said in a telephone interview from Munich. “It
also shows that solar energy companies are entering the
mainstream.”  At Hoffenheim, Wirsol joins jersey sponsor Suntech. Q-
Cells, once the world’s largest producer of solar cells, said
July 14 it signed a 5-year sponsorship deal with league champion
 Borussia Dortmund  that includes a plan to deck the roof of the
club’s stadium with solar panels. Yingli has been a “premium
sponsor” for  Bayern Munich  since March, and Solarworld,
Germany’s largest module maker, began sponsoring Cologne in
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
