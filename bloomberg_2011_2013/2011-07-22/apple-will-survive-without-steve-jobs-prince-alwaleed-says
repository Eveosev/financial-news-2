Apple Inc. (AAPL)  “will survive” without
Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs , who has been on medical
leave since January, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al Saud
said in a CNN interview.  Apple is a “role model” for U.S. businesses and the
company’s board clearly has been discussing succession, Alwaleed
said on “Piers Morgan Tonight.”  “No company should depend on one person,” said Alwaleed,
the nephew of the Saudi monarch. “I hope that he will continue
there as long as possible but nevertheless plans have to be put
in motion.”  Apple, on the brink of bankruptcy when Steve Jobs returned
as chief executive in 1997, is now the world’s second-largest
company behind  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  Jobs is on his third medical
leave since 2004 and has left day-to-day leadership of the
company to Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook.  Apple this week reported third-quarter profit that more
than doubled to $7.31 billion on record sales of the iPhone and
iPad.  Alwaleed, ranked the richest Arab businessman by Arabian
Business magazine for seven consecutive years, built his fortune
by investing in brand-name companies he considered undervalued,
including Apple,  News Corp. (NWSA)  and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
