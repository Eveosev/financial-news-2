Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  sold $2.75
billion of bonds after reporting second-quarter earnings that
lagged behind analysts’ estimates.  The bank issued 5.25 percent, 10-year notes that yield 230
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The offering, which was increased by
$250 million, follows  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s $2 billion sale yesterday
that included $1.5 billion of 5.5 percent, 10-year notes that
were priced at a 250 basis-point spread.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest bank in the U.S. by
assets, said on July 19 its net income in the quarter was $1.09
billion, or $1.85 per share, short of the $2.30 per-share
average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bond
investors shouldn’t be fazed by the disappointing quarter, said
 Marilyn Cohen , who oversees $320 million as chief executive
officer of Envision Capital Management in  Los Angeles .  “They’re still Goldman and they still have an uncanny way
of making money,” said Cohen, who bought some of the bank’s
bonds after the earnings report. “Even though they are reviled
by the media and by most people on Main Street, the
institutional investor knows that Goldman has the ability to
crank it out every year.”  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment.  The sale was the bank’s first U.S. debt offering of at
least $500 million since April.  Bonds Fall  The bank’s $3.85 billion of 3.625 percent notes due
February 2016 fell to 100.3 cents on the dollar on July 20 after
the earnings announcement, from 101.2 cents at the beginning of
the week, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities rose
to 100.5 cents at 10 a.m. today in  New York .  Goldman Sachs is joining banks raising money in the U.S.
bond market even as relative yields on their debt climb. Banks
issued at least $24.9 billion of debt this month through
yesterday, almost triple the $8.95 billion of sales in the same
period in June, Bloomberg data show.  Average spreads on bank bonds have increased 10 basis
points to 213 basis points, or 2.13 percentage points, since
June 30, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
The average yield has dropped to 3.78 percent from 3.83 percent
during the same period.  Goldman Sachs last issued 10-year notes in a size of at
least $500 million in July 2010, selling $750 million of
securities with a 5.2 percent yield, Bloomberg data show. The
bank issued $1.35 billion of five-year notes on April 28 in an
add-on to an existing offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
