Kevin Pietersen  was 202 not as
England declared on 474-8 against India on day two of their
opening cricket Test.  Matt Prior added 71 runs at Lord’s in London and Jonathan
Trott scored 70. Praveen Kumar took five wickets in the absence
of fast-bowler  Zaheer Khan , who strained his hamstring
yesterday.  The match is the 2,000th in the 134 years of elite Test
cricket. England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
