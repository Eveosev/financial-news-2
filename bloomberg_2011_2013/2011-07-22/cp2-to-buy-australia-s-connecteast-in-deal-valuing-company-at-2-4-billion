CP2 Ltd., an Australian
infrastructure  fund manager , agreed to buy the rest of
 ConnectEast Group (CEU)  in a deal valuing the toll-road operator at
A$2.17 billion ($2.4 billion).  Shareholders should accept the cash offer of 55 Australian
cents a share unless there’s a higher bid, ConnectEast’s
independent directors said in a statement today. The offer from
Horizon Roads, an investment vehicle managed by CP2, is 22
percent higher than the stock’s close yesterday. CP2 owns 35
percent of ConnectEast.  A takeover would hand CP2, which manages about A$2 billion
in funds, ownership of the EastLink toll road in  Melbourne  after
the fund manager’s offer for rival highway operator  Transurban
Group (TCL)  was rejected in May 2010. Today’s agreement may trigger a
counterbid, said analysts at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia .  The offer may “flush out other potential buyers,” Paul Johnston, a Melbourne-based analyst at Commonwealth Bank, said
in a note. Transurban “is in a unique position” to cut costs
after a takeover and could offer as much as 60 cents for each
ConnectEast share, he said.  ConnectEast shares jumped 20 percent to 54 cents at 1:10
p.m. in Sydney, set for a record daily gain. Transurban rose 2.5
percent to A$5.36, the largest gain since April 13.  “Before today, we’ve said ConnectEast was fully valued,”
said Wesley Ballantine, a spokesman for Transurban. “Today’s
actions don’t change that view.”  Average Premium  The average premium offered by similar-sized public
thoroughfare deals in the past five years is 21 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ConnectEast said it’s
being advised by Macquarie Group Ltd. and Blake Dawson.  After failing to buy Transurban, CP2, which owns 13 percent
of the company, said last year that it planned to quadruple funds
under management by betting on growth in infrastructure assets.  Peter Doherty , the Sydney-based company’s late managing
director, said in June 2010 he was focused on “long-term,
boring assets” and he was investing with a 40-year time horizon.
Doherty, who died in March this year, said he saw no need to buy
out ConnectEast. ConnectEast has now reported four years of
consecutive losses.  ‘Patient’ Investors  “ConnectEast is a good asset for patient, long-term
investors,” CP2 Managing Director Syd Bone said in a separate
statement. “From a customer, management and employee
perspective, the operations of EastLink will be business as
usual.”  The EastLink toll road runs through the eastern suburbs of
Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city.  To fund the offer, CP2 has raised A$1.4 billion from its
investor group, which includes National Pension Service of  Korea 
and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, the
fund manager said. That matches the amount CP2 would need to buy
the remaining 65 percent of ConnectEast at 55 cents a share.  Shareholders who don’t accept the cash offer from Horizon
Roads may opt for securities in an unlisted registered
management investment plan, allowing them to keep an indirect
investment in ConnectEast, Melbourne-based ConnectEast said.  Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in August 2010 agreed
to buy Intoll Group for A$3.44 billion to gain stakes in toll
roads in Toronto and Sydney.  To contact the reporter for this story:
