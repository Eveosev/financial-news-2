Indonesia ’s central bank is speeding
up a plan to use  government bonds  as a monetary-policy
instrument to manage liquidity in the financial markets,
Governor Darmin Nasution said.  Bank Indonesia, which currently uses central bank notes to
manage funds in the system and issues bills with maturities of
up to nine months, will sell securities with longer tenors,
Nasution told reporters in Jakarta today, without providing a
timeframe.  Asian policy makers are using tools other than benchmark
 interest rates  to rein in liquidity that may fuel price
increases. Bank Indonesia has extended the one-month holding
period on central bank notes, or SBIs, to six months while
policy makers from  China  to Malaysia have ordered banks to set
aside more cash as reserves to manage the excess cash in their
systems.  “We are preparing to speed up our plan to use government
bonds as monetary instruments, not just to issue long-term
central bank notes,” Nasution said.  Bank Indonesia  has left borrowing costs unchanged at its
past five meetings and said it will use a “policy mix of
monetary and macroprudential measures with the focus on managing
domestic liquidity, capital inflows and exchange rate
appreciation.”  “SBIs are the central bank’s instrument to maintain
liquidity” although some investors buy SBIs for investment, said
David Sumual, a Jakarta-based economist at PT Bank Central Asia.
“That makes Bank Indonesia want to speed up their plans to use
government bonds as monetary instruments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
