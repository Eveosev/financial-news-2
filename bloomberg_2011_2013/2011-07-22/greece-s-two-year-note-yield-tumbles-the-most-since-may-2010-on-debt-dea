Greek two-year note yields tumbled
the most since May 10, 2010, after European policy makers eased
the terms of loans for cash-strapped nations and expanded aid
for  Greece .  The 10-year yield dropped 589 basis points to 27.92 percent
as of 9:52 a.m. in  London . The spread, or yield difference, over
benchmark German bunds narrowed to the least in over two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
