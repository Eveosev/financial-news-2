OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,  Russia â€™s
largest mining company, said full-year profit rose 27 percent to
$3.3 billion, missing the $5.12 billion mean estimate of 15
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Net income from continuing operations was $5.2 billion,
while Norilsk recorded a $2.1 billion loss from discontinued
operations after agreeing to sell its  Stillwater Mining Co. (SWC)  unit
in the U.S. and the OAO OGK-3 utility, it said in a  statement 
today.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization were $7.2 billion in 2010 versus $4.2 billion a
year earlier, Norilsk said. This was below analyst estimates of
$7.4 billion, Bloomberg data shows.  Debt fell to $2.8 billion as of Dec. 31 from $5.3 billion a
year earlier, while cash and cash equivalents advanced to $5.4
billion versus $3.6 billion in 2009, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
