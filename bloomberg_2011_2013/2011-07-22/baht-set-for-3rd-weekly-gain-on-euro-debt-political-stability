Thailand’s baht was poised for a
third weekly advance as overseas investors added to their
holdings of the nation’s stocks on optimism  Europe ’s debt crisis
will be contained.  Government bonds  rose.  Global funds bought $370 million more Thai equities than
they sold this week through yesterday, taking this month’s net
purchases to $762 million. Investor confidence in  Southeast
Asia ’s second-largest economy was buoyed by a successful
election on July 3, won by Yingluck Shinawatra’s Pheu Thai party,
which was not marred by any political violence. Euro-area
leaders agreed to new aid for Greece yesterday and empowered
their rescue fund to buy debt from stressed nations.  “It’s quite clear that the risk environment has improved
significantly as the European summit agreement has helped to
calm fears over the debt problems in Europe,” said Moh Siong Sim, a currency strategist at Bank of  Singapore  Ltd.  The baht strengthened 0.3 percent to 29.84 per dollar as of
8:34 a.m. in Bangkok, taking its weekly gain to 0.8 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
29.81 today and yesterday, the strongest level since May 2. The
Bank of Singapore predicts the baht will advance to 29.60 by
year-end, Sim said.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, declined three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.59 percent. The rate rose
1.5 basis points this week.  Government bonds are headed for their first weekly gain
since the period ended on May 20. The yield on  Thailand ’s 5.25
percent bonds due May 2014 slid two basis points today and five
basis points during the week to 3.79 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
