Jean-Pierre Bemba, the runner-up in
Democratic Republic of Congo’s 2006 elections who is being held
at the  International Criminal Court , will run again for
president in November, the head of his party said.  “Bemba announced in a letter to the party conference today
that he would propose himself as a candidate,” Thomas Luhaka,
secretary-general of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo,
said by phone today from Kinshasa, the capital. “We are in
agreement, but we need to work out the practical problems.”  The MLC will decide tomorrow at a conference in Kinshasa
whether Bemba will represent the party, Luhaka said.  Bemba is in jail at the court in The Hague, charged with
 war crimes  and crimes against humanity. He is alleged to have
led militias that murdered and raped civilians in the
neighboring Central African Republic in 2002 and 2003. He has
pleaded not guilty. Supporters of the former rebel leader
clashed with President  Joseph Kabila ’s soldiers in the streets
of Kinshasa in 2007, leaving hundreds dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
