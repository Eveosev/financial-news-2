Meikles Ltd (KMAL) , a Zimbabwean tourism
and retail company, has submitted a plan to the government to
comply with laws requiring black ownership of business.  Meikles plans to offer employees shares in the Harare-
listed company in order to give black Zimbabweans greater
control, Executive Chairman John Moxon said in an annual report.  Meikles owns 5-star hotels in Zimbabwe and  South Africa , as
well as Zimbabwe’s biggest supermarket chain, TM Supermarkets.
It also owns tea and coffee estates, department stores and
pharmacies.  Zimbabwe’s Indigenization and Empowerment Act requires all
companies owned or controlled by foreigners or white Zimbabweans
to transfer 51 percent of their shares to black Zimbabweans or
state-designated entities. The law doesn’t specify what those
entities are, or how the transfers should happen.  Mining companies have been given until the end of September
to submit plans for meeting the requirements, and are currently
negotiating with the government on implementation. No other
industry has received a deadline for compliance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
