During the reign of Pope Alexander
VI, the Vatican hosted “bunga bunga” parties each evening when
more than 25 young women would be brought to the palace. Unlike
other Popes, the lusty Alexander openly acknowledged his many
children, the oldest of whom was Cesare Borgia.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In 1493, at the age of 18, Cesare was elevated to the
College of Cardinals, but he chafed at the limitations of his
scarlet robes. What he wanted was secular power, more like his
brother, Juan, the Pope’s favorite son.  After the two brothers dined together one evening, Juan
disappeared -- his body was later dredged up from the bottom of
the Tiber. Turning in his vestments, Cesare succeeded Juan as
commander of the Papal armies, killing with characteristic
brutality and efficiency, and so conquering one territory after
another.  For Niccolo Machiavelli, here, finally, was a “real man.”
The model for “The Prince,” Cesare represented the pure will
to power that drives the engines of history. Machiavelli was
smitten and had a “man crush” on him.  I spoke with Miles Unger, author of “ Machiavelli: A
Biography ,” on the following topics:  1. Turmoil & Violence  2. Cesare Borgia  3. Political Realism  4. Finger of Satan  5. Attack on the Church  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
