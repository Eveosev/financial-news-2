Chile’s peso rose for a fourth week,
its longest winning streak since February, as copper prices
gained this month, increasing optimism for economic growth.  The peso rose 0.2 percent for the week to 461.57 pesos per
 U.S. dollar  at 2 p.m. New York time, from 462.52 on July 15. It
was down 0.1 percent today.  “Copper has been rising quite strongly, which obviously
helps our currency because we are a country that exports the
metal on a grand scale,” Cristobal Doberti, an economist at
Bice Inversiones, said in a phone interview from Santiago.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, rose three basis points today,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.61 percent.  The central bank paid an average of 461.81 pesos per U.S.
dollar for $50 million today as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gain, according to data posted on its website
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
