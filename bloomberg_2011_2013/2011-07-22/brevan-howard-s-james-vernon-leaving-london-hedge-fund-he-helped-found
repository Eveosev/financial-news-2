James Vernon, co-founder of  Brevan
Howard  Asset Management LLP, is leaving the $32.6 billion hedge
fund, the second founding partner to quit in less than two
years.  Vernon, who represented the “V” in Brevan Howard, decided
to leave to pursue “other interests,” the London-based firm
said in a July 19 letter to investors. The first part of the
firm’s name is made up of the initials of founding partners
Jean-Philippe Blochet, Christopher Rokos, Vernon and Trifon Natsis.  Blochet left the firm last year to join Moore Capital
Management LLC as a senior portfolio manager. He quit the New
York-based hedge fund in May to focus on philanthropy.  Max Hilton, a spokesman for Brevan Howard, declined to
comment on Vernon’s departure, which was reported yesterday by
the Financial Times.  Vernon will remain a non-executive board member of Brevan
Howard’s non-UCITS funds, according to the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
