The international role of the euro
remained stable last year even as the sovereign-debt crisis
shook financial markets, the  European Central Bank  said.  “The euro has remained in 2010 an important store of value
for central bank reserves outside the euro area, acting as the
second most important international reserve currency,” the ECB
said in its annual report on the international role of the euro
published in  Frankfurt  today.  The share of euro-denominated instruments increased by 0.3
percentage points in global reserve holdings in 2010 compared
with 2009 and by one percentage point in foreign-exchange
transactions, the central bank said. The euro’s share in the
outstanding amount of international debt securities declined by
around 2 percentage points, while increasing by one percentage
point in the outstanding amount of cross-border loans.  “Changes of that order of magnitude are fully in line with
fluctuations observed in past years,” the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
