Hulamin Ltd. (HLM) , Africa’s biggest maker
of fabricated aluminum products, said it will be able to provide
for its own raw material needs even if  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  halts
its supply of so-called rolling-slabs in June next year.  Hulamin, which is based in the South African town of
Pietermaritzburg, buys about 90,000 metric tons of aluminum slab
from BHP to produce aluminum sheet, foil and plate. In 2008 BHP
said it would close part of its Bayside aluminum smelter in the
town of  Richards Bay , cutting its ability to supply Hulamin.  “We buy two formats of aluminum from BHP Billiton; rolling
slabs and extrusion billet,” Richard Jacobs, the company’s
chief executive officer, said in an interview in
Pietermaritzburg yesterday.  “Two thirds of our rolling slabs
come from our own facility. Billiton will discontinue supply in
June 2012, but by then we will be starting up our own additional
facility.”  Hulamin will still seek further talks with BHP to try and
extend the agreement, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
