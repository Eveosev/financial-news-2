The average bribe paid in  Russia  to
a government or corporate official rose to 293,000 rubles
($10,573) in the first half, the Interior Ministry said.  Officials at the ministry’s economic crimes and corruption
department undertook “large-scale operations to prevent crimes
related to the procurement of medical equipment, corruption and
theft of state funds,” the Moscow-based  ministry  said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The anti-corruption drive pushed up the average bribe, the
ministry said, without giving a figure for comparison or the
total number of bribes uncovered.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  is trying to clean up Russia’s
image as what Transparency International’s 2010 Corruption
Perceptions Index calls the world’s most corrupt major economy.
The index, issued in October, ranked Russia 154th among 178
countries, alongside Tajikistan and  Kenya . This week, Russia
detained Yevgeny Yevstratov, a former deputy head of state
nuclear holding Rosatom Corp., on suspicion of embezzling 110
million rubles in state funds.  Russian citizens paid at least 164 billion rubles in bribes
last year to settle everyday issues such as fixing a traffic
ticket, avoiding the military draft or entering a kindergarten,
up from 84.8 billion rubles in 2001, according to an Economy
Ministry report presented in June.  The “everyday” bribes, which exclude commercial and
official corruption, averaged 5,285 rubles last year, Deputy
Economy Minister Oleg Fomichev said on June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
