Shares of the following companies

parentheses and prices are as of 10:34 a.m. in Bangkok.  The SET Index rose for a seventh day, climbing 13.76
points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,117.91. The gauge has gained 3.5
percent this week and is heading for the highest close since
August 1996.  Banpu Pcl (BANPU)  , Thailand’s biggest coal producer,
added 1.1 percent to 738 baht. The company expects profit from
operations to exceed 9 billion baht ($302 million) this year on
a combination of revenue from an Australian unit and higher coal
prices, Chief Executive Officer Chanin Vongkusolkit told
reporters in Bangkok.  Glow Energy Pcl (GLOW)  , the nation’s largest private
power producer by market value, climbed 1.9 percent to 52.5
baht, set for the highest close since Nov. 10. Credit Suisse
Group AG lifted its share-price estimate for the company by 6.6
percent to 65 baht, citing a higher power tariff for industrial
users.  Kasikornbank Pcl (KBANK)  , the third-largest lender by
assets, jumped 3.7 percent to 140.5 baht on speculation economic
expansion and new government policies will fuel earnings growth.
Kasikornbank will continue to “perform well in light of the
healthy Thai economy,” Stephen Lowy, an analyst at Kim Eng
Securities (Thailand) Pcl, wrote in a note today. Increased
 government spending  will further spur economic growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
