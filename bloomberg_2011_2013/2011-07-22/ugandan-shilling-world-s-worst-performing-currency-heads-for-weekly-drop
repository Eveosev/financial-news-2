Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency over the past month, was set for a
weekly decline against the dollar amid increased demand for the
U.S. currency from domestic banks.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer
fell 0.6 percent to 2,600 per dollar at 2.56 p.m. in Kampala,
the capital, bringing its decline so far this week to 1.9
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It closed at
2,585 yesterday.  “The shilling weakened slightly because of demand in the
 interbank market ,” Benon Okwenje, a currency trader at Stanbic
Bank Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. The buying of
dollars may be linked to “customer demand or to close up their
positions.”  The shilling has depreciated 11 percent this year, ranking
it as the world’s third-worst performing currency, as inflation
accelerated to a 17-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
