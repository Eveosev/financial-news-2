U.S. technology stocks rallied on
improving earnings, sending the Nasdaq-100 Index to a 10-year
high and extending a weekly gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, while lower-than-estimated results at  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
dragged the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lower.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  rose 19 percent, the most since
November 2009, after the chipmaker forecast more sales than
analysts estimated. Technology stocks in the S&P 500 gained 1.2
percent, the most among 10 industries. Caterpillar slid 5.8
percent as profit trailed projections because of  Japan ’s record
earthquake and slower demand from  China . C.R. Bard Inc. declined
12 percent, the biggest loss in the S&P 500, after sales missed
projections.  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,345.02 at 4 p.m. in New
York and gained 2.2 percent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped 43.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,681.16.
Gains in technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq-100 Index up 1.1
percent to the highest level since February 2001.  “You’re seeing fast money gravitate to the large-cap tech
names, viewing them as better able to withstand slower economic
growth,” said  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage $26 billion at
Security Global Investors in Irvington,  New York  in a telephone
interview. “There are a couple stocks weighing on the Dow where
the earnings came out a little less than expected but overall,
earnings have been pretty good.”  Aid for  Greece   Stocks surged yesterday after euro-area leaders eased the
terms of loans for cash-strapped nations and announced the
latest aid for Greece after eight hours of talks yesterday.
Officials empowered their 440-billion euro ($635 billion) rescue
fund to buy debt across stressed nations, helping to erect a
firewall around Spain and  Italy  even as they risked temporary
default to lighten the Greek debt burden.  “Policy makers have made an important step,” Jeffrey Palma, global equity strategist at UBS AG, said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop.” “Is this the be-all,
end-all package? No, and I think we need to be concerned still
that there are medium-term challenges, but I do think it
eliminates some of those tail risks.”  The  S&P 500  has declined 1.4 percent from an almost three-
year high in April amid speculation that the sovereign debt
crisis in  Europe  is spreading and concern that U.S. lawmakers
will fail to reach a deal on raising the nation’s debt limit
before the Aug. 2 deadline.  Quarterly reports from corporations have helped boost U.S.
stocks this week. Among 122 S&P 500 companies that have reported
earnings since July 11, 83 percent exceeded the average analyst
estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chipmakers Rise  Technology companies rallied, with semiconductor makers
rising 1.6 percent for the biggest S&P 500 gain among 24
industries. AMD jumped 19 percent to $7.75, the largest gain in
the index. The second-largest producer of processors for
personal computers forecast third-quarter sales that exceeded
analysts’ estimates, citing new chip orders.  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  added 9.6 percent to $45.57 as the maker of
flash-memory cards also reported per-share earnings for the
second quarter that topped estimates.  Caterpillar, which accounted for the second-biggest
proportion of the Dow at the start of trading, fell 5.8 percent
to $105.15. The world’s largest maker of construction and mining
equipment posted profit, excluding $204 million in costs related
to the acquisition of Bucyrus International Inc., of $1.72 a
share, trailing the $1.75 average of 20 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘A Bellwether’  “Caterpillar’s clearly a bellwether,” said Robert Carey,
chief investment officer at First Trust Portfolios LP, in a
telephone interview. The Wheaton, Illinois-based firm oversees
about $50 billion. “Given the overwhelming number of companies
that have beat estimates, anybody that comes up short is not
going to be treated well.”  C.R. Bard declined 12 percent, the most since March 1993,
to $99.58. The maker of medical devices such as catheters and
drains forecast third-quarter adjusted earnings of no more than
$1.61 a share, less than the average estimate of $1.62 a share
by 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  jumped 2.3 percent, the biggest gain in
the Dow, to $88.56. The world’s largest restaurant chain said
second-quarter profit rose 15 percent, topping analysts’
estimates, as more consumers dined out and McCafe beverages
boosted sales.  Skyworks, AMD  Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS)  jumped 19 percent, the second-
biggest gain in the Russell 1000 Index behind AMD, to $26.98.
The wireless semiconductor company forecast fourth-quarter
revenue of $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of
$371.3 million.  Industrial shares declined 1 percent collectively, the
worst performance out of 10 groups in the S&P 500.
Telecommunication companies erased 0.5 percent, led by  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)   Verizon Wireless , the wireless carrier that’s co-owned by
Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc, said today it activated 2.3
million Apple Inc. iPhones in the second quarter, trailing AT&T
Inc.’s 3.6 million devices in the period. Verizon shares fell
2.2 percent to $36.74.  To contact the reporter on this story:
