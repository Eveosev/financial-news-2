Asian stocks rose, with the regional
benchmark index erasing its loss for the year, as a new aid plan
for Greece eased concern Europe’s debt crisis will spread,
reducing uncertainty about bank earnings.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest lender by market value,
climbed 2.8 percent in  Hong Kong .  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s largest bank by market value, jumped 3.3 percent
in  Tokyo  after the Nikkei newspaper said the lender’s profit may
have more than doubled. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s
biggest maker of computer memory chips, rose 1 percent after
Microsoft Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. posted profits
that beat estimates.  “Europe seems to have prevented the Greek sovereign-debt
issue from escalating into something bigger,” said Ng Soo Nam,
the Singapore-based chief investment officer at Nikko Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $154 billion. “There’s a
case for a decent rebound for the market from these levels.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.3 percent 138.94 as of
7:16 p.m. in Tokyo, its biggest advance this month and headed
toward its highest close since May 5. About four stocks rose for
each that fell on the gauge, which is headed for a 2.3 percent
advance this week. The measure dropped last week for the first
time in four weeks after European finance ministers declined to
rule out a temporary default for Greece and as Moody’s Investors
Service put the U.S. under review for a possible credit-rating
downgrade.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average and South Korea’s Kospi
Index both increased 1.2 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index gained
0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 2.1 percent,
the most among regional benchmark indexes.  China ’s Shanghai
Composite Index added 0.2 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
climbed 1 percent.  ‘Risk Tolerance’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. The index rose 1.4 percent yesterday in  New York 
as European officials announced 159 billion euros ($230 billion)
in new aid for Greece to stop the region’s debt crisis from
spreading.  Europe’s steps to support Greece and safeguard other euro-
area nations will allow markets to move past contagion fears,
Institute of International Finance Managing Director  Charles Dallara  said.  “Confirmation there’s going to be more support for Greece
eases concern about the financial system and it gives investors
a little more tolerance for risk,” said Juichi Wako, a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)   Esprit Surges  Companies reliant on Europe advanced. HSBC climbed 2.8
percent to HK$78 in Hong Kong.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the Hong
Kong-based clothier that counts Europe as its biggest market,
jumped 5.2 percent to HK$24.15. Cosco Pacific Ltd., which
operates container facilities at Greece’s Piraeus port,
increased 3.3 percent to HK$13.14.  U.S stocks also rose after the New York Times reported that
President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner were close
to a “major budget deal,” boosting optimism the government
will avoid defaulting on its debt.  Jay Carney , Obama’s
spokesman, and Boehner responded to the story by saying there is
no deal.  A gauge of finance companies led the advance among the 10
industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index after  Morgan
Stanley (MS) , the world’s largest brokerage, posted a second-quarter
loss that was smaller than analysts estimated.  Yuanta Financial Holding Co., the Taiwanese financial
services company, advanced 4.2 percent to NT$21.20. Nomura
Holdings Inc., Japan’s No. 1 brokerage, gained 3.2 percent to
393 yen in Tokyo. Smaller rival Daiwa Securities Group Inc. rose
2 percent to 355 yen.  Commonwealth Bank  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial advanced 3.3 percent to 407 yen.
The Japanese bank may post net income of about 400 billion yen
($5.1 billion) in the quarter ended June 30, compared with 166.3
billion yen a year earlier, the Nikkei newspaper reported.
Mitsubishi UFJ said in a statement it is still in the process of
compiling its earnings reports.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s No. 1 lender
by market value, advanced 1.6 percent to A$50.52 in Sydney. The
bank appointed Ian Narev to replace Chief Executive Officer
Ralph Norris in December as competition intensifies in the
country’s weakest mortgage market in three decades.  Information technology companies climbed after Microsoft,
the largest software maker, and Advanced Micro Devices, the
second-biggest manufacturer of processors for personal
computers, both reported profits that beat estimates.  Samsung Electronics rose 1 percent to 850,000 won.  Quanta
Computer Inc. (2382) , the world’s largest laptop computer maker by
sales, added 0.7 percent to NT$68.90. Lenovo Group Ltd., China’s
biggest maker of personal computers, gained 1.8 percent to
HK$5.15 in Hong Kong.  Oil Rigs  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index erased its loss for the year as
companies reported positive earnings. Among the 47 companies in
the gauge that posted results since July 11, 29 beat the average
profit estimate, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Keppel Corp., the world’s biggest builder of oil platforms,
advanced 3.1 percent to S$11.16 in Singapore. The company said
net income climbed 9 percent from a year earlier to S$384.9
million ($318 million), exceeding the S$341.5 million average of
four analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The regional benchmark index lost 0.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 6.9 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 1.9 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 13.6 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the
S&P 500 and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
