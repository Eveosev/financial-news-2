Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the biggest
investor in South African mining, releases first-half earnings
at 8 a.m. Johannesburg time.  So-called underlying earnings are expected to be $2.63 a
share, according to the median estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg news.  A strike over pay by at least 130,000 workers at gold-
mining companies including  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Gold Fields
Ltd. (GFI)  and Harmony Gold Mining Co. enters its second day. About
30,000 workers at South African coal mines owned by companies
including Anglo and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  are also on strike.  To contact the reporter on this story:
