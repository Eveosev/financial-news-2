A U.S. trade agency said it will
consider  AU Optronics Corp. (2409) ’s patent-infringement claims against
Samsung Electronics Co. over liquid-crystal displays used in
televisions, computer monitors and mobile phones.  The U.S. International Trade Commission has the power to
block imports of Samsung LCDs if the products are found to
infringe any of the six AU patents in the case.  Notice  of the
investigation was posted on the Washington-based agency’s
website yesterday.  AU,  Taiwan ’s second-biggest maker of LCDs, is seeking to
block products including Samsung’s 46-inch (117-centimeter) LCD
television, Captivate smartphone and 10.1-inch laptop screen.
The complaint also names companies that use or sell those
products, including  AT&T Inc. (T) , Best Buy Co. and BrandsMart USA
Inc.  Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung, the world’s biggest maker
of TVs and flat-screen panels, has its own case against Hsinchu,
Taiwan-based AU Optronics over LCD monitors that’s being
reviewed by the ITC. The semi-judicial agency typically
completes its investigations in 15 to 18 months.  The companies also have filed civil lawsuits against each
other, seeking cash compensation. The ITC doesn’t have the
authority to order monetary damages.  The AU case is In the Matter of Certain Flat Panel Display
Devices and Products Containing the Same, 337-793, and the
Samsung case against AU is In the Matter of Liquid Crystal
Display Devices, 337-782, both U.S. International Trade
