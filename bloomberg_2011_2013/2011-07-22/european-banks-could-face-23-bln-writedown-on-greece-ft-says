European banks would need to write
down as much as 16 billion euros ($23 billion) on holdings of
Greek debt should they have to take a 20 percent haircut on the
bonds, the Financial Times reported, citing its own analysis of
the 90 banks recently subjected to stress tests.  Auditors have warned banks to make provisions for losses on
Greek bonds in their second-quarter results, the FT said,
arguing lenders should absorb losses now because almost any
proposals for dealing with Greek restructuring would lessen the
value of their bondholdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
