Malaysia’s ringgit rose to a two-
month high and  government bonds  fell on speculation that the
Southeast Asian nation’s policy makers will raise  interest rates 
to damp inflation after European leaders took steps to contain
the region’s debt crisis.  The currency gained the most in eight months after leaders
announced 159 billion euro ($229 billion) in new aid for  Greece 
and cajoled bondholders into footing part of the bill. Malaysian
consumer prices rose to a two-year high of 3.5 percent in June,
stoking speculation that the central bank may be inclined to
raise borrowing costs after Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said on
July 18 curbing inflation was a priority.  “The $229 billion euro-zone plan is boosting demand for
emerging-market assets,” said Calbert Loh, head of treasury at
Bangkok Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The ringgit could hold on
to its strength as there are growing expectations that the
Malaysian central bank may raise its policy rate after saying
inflation is still a concern.”  The ringgit strengthened 1.0 percent to 2.9750 per dollar
this week as of 4:13 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier reached 2.9715, the strongest
level since May 2. The currency fell 0.5 percent last week.  Malaysia will raise interest rate by 25 basis points, or
0.25 percentage point, to 3.25 percent this quarter, according
to a Bloomberg survey of eight economists. The next review is on
Sept. 8.  Bonds declined as the treasury prepares to sell 4 billion
ringgit ($1.3 billion) of 10-year Islamic debt maturing April
2021 on July 28. The yield on the government’s 4.16 percent
notes due July 2021 increased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.89 percent this week, according to Bursa
Malaysia Bhd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
