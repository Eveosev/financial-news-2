Saudi Arabia ’s commercial banking
industry continues to be one of the world’s most profitable as
high oil prices and vast  government spending  help lenders pursue
prudent strategies, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services said.  “Through a unique combination of supportive features, the
Saudi banks we rate continue to demonstrate their ability to
generate solid, sustainable core earnings, in turn fuelling high
profits,” analyst Nicolas Hardy said in an e-mailed statement
today. “Prospects for sound earnings and profits are bright.”  Saudi bank lending had slowed in the previous two years
after two family-owned businesses defaulted on at least $15.7
billion of loans and the economy was hurt by the global credit
crunch.  High  oil prices  and vast spending plans under the aegis of
the Saudi government have driven the banks’ performance, along
with low cost of funding, good pricing power high efficiency and
a tax-free environment, according to the statement.  The Saudi Monetary Agency has led the banks to revise their
strategies in “favor of plain vanilla domestic banking
activities, and to strengthen their risk management practices,”
S&P said.  “They have allocated their robust operating revenues both
to build up capital positions and to increase provisions for
coverage of bad loans to conservative levels above 100
percent,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
