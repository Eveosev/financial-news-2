HNA Group Co. , controlled by  China ’s
Hainan provincial government, said it will invest in a Turkish
cargo airline as it seeks to expand in Europe.  The investment in  ACT Airlines Inc.  will help the Istanbul-
based carrier more than double its fleet to 10 freighters within
two years, HNA said in an e-mailed statement today, without
disclosing financial details.  The Chinese company plans to invest as much as $250 million
in Turkey, Xinhua News Agency reported today without citing
anyone. HNA Group spokesman Tong Fu didn’t answer four calls to
his mobile phone seeking comment. Calls made to ACT Airline’s
public relations office in Instanbul weren’t answered.  HNA, which runs airlines, airports, hotels and department
stores, said July 18 that it may bid for Essen, Germany-based
Hochtief AG’s airport-operating unit. Acquisition of the
business will give the buyer control of main airports serving
Hamburg, Sydney, Budapest and  Athens .  To contact the reporter on this story:
