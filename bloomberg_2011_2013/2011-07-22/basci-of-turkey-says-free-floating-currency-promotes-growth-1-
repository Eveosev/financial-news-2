Turkish central bank governor Erdem Basci said a free-floating currency helps economic growth and
countries have benefited from such regimes since Lehman Brothers
collapsed in 2008.  Turkey can have “a more comfortable free-floating
currency” because consumers and businesses don’t have the kind
of open foreign currency positions that some other countries
have, Basci said in a speech in the southwestern city of Denizli
today. Nations with free-floating currencies can also control
 interest rates  more effectively, he said.  Basci’s comments “suggest almost a green light for further
lira weakness/underperformance,” Tim Ash, head of emerging
market research at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London ,
said in e-mailed comments to investors today.  The lira dropped 1.6 percent to 1.6928 per dollar at 5:42
p.m. in Istanbul, extending the lowest level since March 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
