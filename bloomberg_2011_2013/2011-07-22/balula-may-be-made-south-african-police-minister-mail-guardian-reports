Fikile Mbalula may be moved to the
post of South African police minister from his current role as
sports minister, the Johannesburg-based Mail & Guardian
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  Nathi Mthethwa, who currently holds the post, could be
moved to the post of co-operative governance and traditional
affairs, replacing Sicelo Shiceka, who is sick, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
