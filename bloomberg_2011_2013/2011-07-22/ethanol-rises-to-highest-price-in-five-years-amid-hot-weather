Ethanol futures rose to their
highest price in more than five years in  Chicago  as hot weather
in the corn-rich Midwest threatens to raise production costs.  The grain-based additive jumped 1.6 percent on concern that
temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) will slow
ethanol production at distilleries and on speculation that the
weather could hinder corn crop yields. Corn is the primary
ingredient in the biofuel in the U.S.  “The weather is a big part of it,” said  Dan Flynn , a
trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “They’re looking at the weather
and stress on the corn crop. You put all that in the bucket and
that’s what’s fueling the market.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 4.7 cents to
settle at $2.942 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest settlement since July 18, 2006. Futures are up 24
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.95 a gallon and in  New York  the additive plunged 8.5
cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.98, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast dipped 4 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to $3.05 a gallon and in Chicago the renewable fuel increased 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.995.  Corn futures for December delivery advanced 12.5 cents, or
1.9 percent, to settle at $6.855 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
