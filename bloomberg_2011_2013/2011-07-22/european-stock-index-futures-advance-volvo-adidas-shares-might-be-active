Most European stocks rose as the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index headed for its first weekly gain in
three, after euro-area leaders announced a new aid package for
Greece and measures to prevent sovereign bond yields increasing.  Greek banks climbed with the Mediterranean nation’s four
largest lenders all surging more than 9 percent.  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD)  gained 1.9 percent after posting better-than-estimated
service revenue growth.  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  jumped 3.3 percent as the
world’s second-biggest truckmaker reported second-quarter
results that beat expectations.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.2 percent to 271.12 at
3:33 p.m. in  London  as two stocks gained for every one that
slipped. The gauge has rallied 1.6 percent this week amid
optimism that the new aid package will stop the sovereign-debt
crisis spreading to the larger economies of Spain and Italy. The
benchmark measure has still retreated 6.9 percent since this
year’s peak on Feb. 17.  “The general view is that it appears to be a comprehensive
deal that exceeded market expectations,” said  James Knightley ,
senior economist at ING Bank NV in London. “Consequently, we
are seeing something of a relief rally. However, the underlying
economic fundamentals remain concerning.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 10 of the 18 western
European countries today. France’s CAC 40 Index gained 0.3
percent. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  increased 0.2 percent, and
 Germany ’s DAX Index slid less than 0.1 percent. Greece’s ASE
Index rallied 5.9 percent for its biggest gain in 14 months.  Greek Aid Package  Euro-area leaders announced 159 billion euros ($228
billion) in new aid for Greece late yesterday and cajoled
bondholders into footing part of the bill. Officials empowered
their 440-billion euro rescue fund to buy the debt of stressed
nations to help erect a firewall around Spain and Italy.  The Greek financing package will consist of 109 billion
euros from the euro area and the  International Monetary Fund .
Financial institutions will contribute 50 billion euros after
agreeing to bond exchanges and buybacks that will also cut
Greece’s debt load, the leaders’ communique said.  “This meeting came at a difficult time,” German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  told reporters. “I’m satisfied with
the outcome because the euro countries showed today that we are
up to the challenge; we can take action.”  Merkel said the German parliament will probably debate the
new austerity package once the country’s lower house of
parliament, the Bundestag, reconvenes on Sept. 5.  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
the ECB may accept Greek collateral if the country defaults
because euro-area states will guarantee the debt.  Greek Banks Surge  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  rallied 9.4 percent to 5.36
euros, while  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  soared 12 percent to 1.02 euro. EFG
Eurobank Ergasias jumped 12 percent to 3.15 euros and Alpha Bank
SA surged 19 percent to 3.60 euros, its biggest rally since at
least 1992.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  climbed 1.3 percent to 2.62 euros
in Lisbon and Dexia SA gained 3 percent to 2.12 euros.  The euro-area agreement to swap privately held bonds into
15- and 30-year debt where the principal is “almost completely
collateralized” will remove the risk of the single currency
collapsing, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. led by Dirk Hoffmann-Becking said in a note to clients today.  European banks were raised to “market weight” from
“underweight” by  Edmund Shing , an equity strategist at
Barclays Plc.  “The beaten-up bank and insurance shares can now heave a
short-term sigh of relief,” said Benno Galliker, a trader at
Luzerner Kantonalbank AG in Lucerne. “There is some
restructuring going on from rather defensive stocks to more
volatile ones.”  Vodafone, Volvo Gain  Vodafone rose 1.9 percent to 164.4 pence after Europe’s
third-largest phone company by sales reported that fiscal first-
quarter organic service revenue climbed 1.5 percent as demand
for smartphones bolstered data sales. Analysts had predicted
sales growth of 1.4 percent. Data revenue jumped 25 percent as
customers made more use of Apple Inc.’s iPhone and handsets
running Google Inc.’s Android phone operating system.  Volvo climbed 3.3 percent to 105.40 kronor after the
company said second-quarter net income rose to 5.12 billion
kronor ($803 million) from 3.15 billion kronor a year earlier,
as demand in Europe and  North America  increased. The results
beat the average analyst estimate of 4.82 billion kronor.  Scania
AB (SCVB)  jumped 5 percent to 133.70 kronor.  Adidas AG (ADS)  advanced 3.2 percent to 54.82 euros after its
Chief Executive Officer Herbert Hainer said that the company
will have “high single-digit” revenue growth in 2011,
rejecting “rumors” of a slowdown in second-quarter sales.  EasyJet Shares Rally  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  surged 17 percent to 366.5 pence, its biggest
gain since 2004, after Europe’s second-biggest discount carrier
said full-year earnings will beat analysts’ estimates following
a 20 percent surge in business bookings. The stock was raised to
“add” from “reduce” at Numis Securities Ltd.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , Europe’s largest discount carrier,
jumped 5 percent to 3.47 euros in Dublin.  Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) ,
Europe’s second-biggest tour operator, rallied 4.8 percent to
71.3 pence.  SSAB AB (SSABA)  soared 8 percent to 93.45 kronor, its biggest gain
in almost three months, after the world’s largest supplier of
high-tensile steel said that second-quarter net income rose to
885 million kronor from 369 million kronor a year earlier,
beating analysts’ estimates.  Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN) , the biggest maker of solar
panel manufacturing equipment, slumped 6.6 percent to 30.95
Swiss francs.  Roth & Rau AG (R8R)  withdrew its full-year earnings
forecast because of the “deterioration in the overall industry
climate,” the company’s Vice President of Sales and Marketing
said today. Meyer Burger agreed to acquire Roth & Rau on April
11. Roth & Rau’s shares slid 2.4 percent to 21.90 euros.  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  dropped 2.4 percent to 267.70 Swiss francs
after the world’s largest maker of agricultural chemicals said
it plans to raise prices for the 2012 planting season to counter
soaring raw-material costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
