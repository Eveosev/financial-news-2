China , the world’s biggest metals
consumer, and Russia can begin searching for minerals on the
deep  Pacific Ocean  seabed after gaining approval from an
international regulatory body.  The  International Seabed Authority , based in Kingston,
Jamaica, this week approved applications from Nauru, a Pacific
island nation, and Tonga as well as the exploration requests
from China and Russia.  While mining of seabed deposits so far hasn’t proved
economical, companies including Canada’s  Nautilus Minerals Inc. (NUS) ,
are working to advance deep sea projects. Russia’s OAO
Metalloinvest owns a 21 percent stake in Nautilus, which is
developing technology to mine gold- and copper-rich ore on the
seabed.  The four applicants want to explore the Clarion-Clipperton
Fractured Zone in the eastern central Pacific, which lies mostly
at a depth of between 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) and 6 kilometers,
the Authority said on its web site in a July 19 statement. The
International Seabed Authority, which the  United Nations 
established in 1982, promotes development of mineral resources
of the international seabed.  Prices of copper and gold are trading close to records as
demand from China grows. Ocean miners will have to overcome
concern that excavation will harm the environment and prove too
expensive to make the ventures profitable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
