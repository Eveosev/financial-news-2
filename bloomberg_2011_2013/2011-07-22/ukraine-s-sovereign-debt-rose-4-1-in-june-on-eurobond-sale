Ukraine’s debt, including state
guarantees, jumped 4.1 percent last month as the government sold
Eurobonds, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Sovereign debt increased to $60.18 billion as of June 30
from $57.81 billion a month earlier, the ministry said today in
a  statement  on its website.  Domestic debt rose to $20.24 billion from $19.2 billion at
the end of May, according to the ministry, based in the capital,
Kiev. Obligations to foreign creditors climbed to $25.46 billion
from $24.12 billion.  Ukraine’s state debt increased by almost 11 percent in the
first six months of 2011 as the government sold Eurobonds and
domestic bonds to cover the budget deficit and the hryvnia
weakened against foreign currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
