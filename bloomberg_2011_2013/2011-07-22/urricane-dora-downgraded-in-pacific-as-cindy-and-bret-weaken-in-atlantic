Dora was downgraded to a Category 3
hurricane off  Mexico ’s Pacific coast and is expected to lose
strength today, U.S. meteorologists said. In the Atlantic,
Tropical Storm Bret became a depression and Cindy weakened.  Dora’s top winds fell to 120 miles (193 kilometers) per
hour from 140 mph late yesterday, the  U.S. National Hurricane
Center  said in an advisory at 2 a.m. New York time. The
hurricane, about 210 miles southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico,
and heading northwest at 9 mph, is forecast to remain offshore,
 the agency said .  The government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning
from Agua Blanca to Buenavista including  Cabo San Lucas , the
center said.  In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Cindy was about 910 miles
west-northwest of the Azores and moving “rapidly” northeast,
the center said in an  advisory  issued at 11 p.m. New York time
yesterday. Maximum winds dropped to 50 mph and the system may
dissipate in the next couple of days, posing no threat to land.  Bret , the second named storm of the  Atlantic hurricane
season , weakened to a tropical depression and is forecast to
dissipate over the next day or so, the center said in another
advisory yesterday. It was 295 miles northwest of  Bermuda  and
was moving northeast at 14 mph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
