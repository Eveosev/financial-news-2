India ’s rupee rose to its highest
level in 11 days, after European leaders agreed on more
financial aid for  Greece , reducing concern about the region’s
debt crisis and bolstering demand for emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, reached
the highest level since August 1997 after the 159 billion euro
($229 billion) plan was announced in Brussels yesterday. The
Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index rose 1.6 percent today.
Overseas investors bought $75 million more local stocks than
they sold in the first three days of the week, according to
exchange data.  “We are seeing foreign flows into equities after the
positive news in  Europe ,” said Sudarshan Bhatt, chief currency
trader at Mumbai-based  Corporation Bank . “The dollar’s weakness
against major global currencies is also helping the rupee.”  The rupee advanced 0.4 percent this week to 44.35 per
dollar at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The highest since July 11.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.83 in
three months, compared with expectations of 45.04 yesterday.
