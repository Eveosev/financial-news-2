The following is the text of
 Canada 's consumer price index report for June released
by  Statistics Canada .  Consumer prices rose 3.1% in the 12 months to June,
primarily the result of higher prices for gasoline and
food purchased from stores.  This follows a 3.7% increase
posted in May.  The 0.6 percentage point difference between the year-
over-year increases posted in June and May was largely the
result of lower prices for the purchase of passenger
vehicles and traveller accommodation. In particular,
prices for the purchase of passenger vehicles fell 3.1% in
the 12 months to June, following a 0.7% increase in May.
The smaller year-over-year increase in gasoline prices in
June compared with May was also a factor.  Prices for food purchased from stores rose 4.8% in the
12 months to June after increasing 4.2% in May.  Energy prices advanced 15.7% during the 12 months to
June, following a 16.6% increase in May.  On a year-over-
year basis, gasoline prices rose 28.5%, slightly less than
the 29.5% gain in May.  Prices for fuel oil and
electricity also rose, while natural gas prices fell 4.6%.  Excluding food and energy, the  Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) increased 1.4% in the 12 months to June.  Seasonally adjusted monthly CPI falls  On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, consumer prices
fell 0.4% from May to June, the first decrease since March
2010. The decrease follows a 0.2% gain posted the previous
month. The transportation index, which includes gasoline
and the purchase of passenger vehicles, declined 2.4%
following a 0.1% rise in May.  The seasonally adjusted food index went up 0.2% in
June, after gaining 0.5% in May. The household operations,
furnishings and equipment index rose 0.5%, while the
shelter index increased 0.2%.  12-month change: Prices increase in all major components  On a year-over-year basis, prices increased in all
eight major components in June. However, except for two
components (food as well as household operations,
furnishings and equipment) the rate of increase in June
was slower than it was in May.  The cost of transportation increased 7.0% in the 12
months to June, following a 9.1% gain in May.  In addition
to paying more for gasoline, consumers paid 4.4% more in
passenger vehicle insurance premiums and 7.6% more for air
transportation.  Prices for the purchase of passenger vehicles fell.
This decline was mainly a result of larger discounts given
by some manufacturers this year compared with June of last
year.  Food prices rose 4.3% in the 12 months to June, after
increasing 3.9% in May.  There were broad-based price
increases for food purchased from stores. Meat prices

products with the cost of bread rising 10.1%. Prices for
fresh vegetables increased 8.4%. Prices for food purchased

interest portion of payments on outstanding mortgage debt,
decreased 1.9%. Prices for natural gas also fell.  Prices for recreation, education and reading went up

0.3% in June, after rising 0.2% in May.  Note to readers  The special aggregate "Energy" includes: electricity;
natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels; gasoline; and fuel,
