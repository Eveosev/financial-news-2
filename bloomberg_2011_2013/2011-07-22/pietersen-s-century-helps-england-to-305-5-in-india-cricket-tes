Kevin Pietersen ’s unbeaten century
helped England reach 305-5 at tea on day two of the opening
cricket Test against India.  Pietersen has scored 115 at Lord’s in London for his 18th
career century and his first in England since August 2008.
Praveen Kumar took three wickets, including those of Ian Bell
and Eoin Morgan within four balls in the 93rd over.  Zaheer Khan , who took 2-18 yesterday before leaving the
field clutching his right leg, will not bowl the rest of the
first innings after being diagnosed with a hamstring strain.  The match is the 2,000th in the 134 years of elite Test
cricket. England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
