Minerva SA  advanced to a five-year
high after Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of the Brazilian
meatpacker with the equivalent of a buy recommendation.  Shares gained 3.1 percent to 13.39 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the highest since December 2007. The
 Bovespa small cap index , of which Barretos-based Minerva is a
member, fell 0.1 percent.  Animal protein stocks should benefit from cyclical growth
in 2013, with Brazilian beef being the “highlight” of the
year, Morgan Stanley analysts including  Javier Martinez de Olcoz Cerdan  wrote in a research note on Brazilian meatpackers’
stocks. They listed Minerva as their “top pick” in the
industry and set a price target of 16.50 reais.  Marfrig Alimentos SA  rose 1.3 percent to 10.01 reais after
the analysts raised it to the equivalent of buy. The company
should show cyclical and structural growth in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to the
report.  Minerva shares have advanced 104 percent in the past year,
while Marfrig has gained 9.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
