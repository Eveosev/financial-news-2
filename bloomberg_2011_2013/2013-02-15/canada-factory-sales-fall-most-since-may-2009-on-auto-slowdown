Canadian  factory sales  fell 3.1
percent in December, the most since May 2009, as car assembly
plants experienced longer-than-usual seasonal shutdowns,
government figures showed.  Sales dropped to C$48.0 billion ($47.9 billion) from C$49.6
billion the previous month, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. The decline was larger than the most pessimistic
forecast in a Bloomberg News  survey  of 17 economists that had a
median estimate of a 0.8 percent decline.  The need to raise borrowing costs to head off inflation is
less urgent than policy makers previously thought because the
economy will take longer to reach full output, Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney said Jan. 23. Employers cut 21,900 workers
from payrolls in January, Statistics Canada said Feb. 8, as a
tepid global recovery crimps exports and record household debt
levels curb consumer spending.  Sales declined in 16 of 21  categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada, accounting for 82 percent of production.  More than half the decrease was due to a drop in
transportation equipment, according to Statistics Canada. A
majority of the decline came in Ontario, where sales dropped 4.6
percent.  Statistics Canada said that while car plants are often shut
in December, “the reduction in production was greater than
usually observed.”  Excluding automobiles, factory sales fell 1.8 percent to
C$42.3 billion in December, Statistics Canada said.  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales fell
3.8 percent in December, the most since May 2009 when the
country was in recession.  From a year earlier, sales dropped 3.9 percent. New orders
declined in December by 4.4 percent from a month earlier to
C$49.7 billion.  Canadian factory inventories fell 1.0 percent to C$64.5
billion in December, with the ratio of factory stockpiles to
sales increasing to 1.34 from a revised 1.32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
