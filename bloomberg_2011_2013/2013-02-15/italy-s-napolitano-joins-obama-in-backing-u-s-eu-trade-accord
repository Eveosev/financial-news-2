President  Barack Obama  and Italian
President  Giorgio Napolitano  expressed support for a U.S.-
European free trade accord that would expand the world’s largest
economic relationship.  Neither leader gave details about the prospect of a trade
deal, which Obama highlighted in his State of the Union address.
The U.S. and the European Union plan to complete negotiations
within two years.  Napolitano said the accord would contribute to “a new wave
of development” on both sides of the Atlantic.  Talks with the 27-nation EU may help Obama meet his goal of
 doubling exports  by the end of 2014. The trading relationship
was valued at $4.5 trillion in 2011.  The 27-nation EU says the accord will seek to lower
tariffs, ease regulatory barriers and expand access in
investment, services and public procurement.  Obama welcomed Napolitano to the White House as a farewell
to the 87-year-old Italian president, whose seven-year term ends
in May. Obama called him a “visionary leader” and a “good
personal friend.”  The Italian president is the head of Italy’s armed forces
and has powers to veto legislation, disband parliament and call
elections.  To contact the reporters on this story:
