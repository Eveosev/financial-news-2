The economy of Nigeria, sub-Saharan
Africa’s second-largest, expanded an estimated 7.1 percent in
the fourth quarter, the Central Bank of Nigeria said.  Growth was 6.9 percent in the previous three months and 7.7
percent in the same period the previous year, the Abuja-based
bank said in a  report  on its website, citing estimates by the
National Bureau of Statistics. Official figures for fourth-
quarter growth are due Feb. 28.  The pickup was largely driven by industrial growth, with
the non-oil sector expanding 8.2 percent and accounting for 87
percent of all output, the bank said. Agricultural “areas
adversely affected by the floods during the second half of 2012
were yet to recover fully from the impact.”  The fiscal deficit of Africa’s largest oil producer rose to
420.8 billion naira ($2.7 billion), or 3.9 percent of economic
output, in the fourth quarter. That compares with a targeted
deficit of 284.1 billion naira for the period and a gap of 489.5
billion naira in the previous three months, the bank said.  “The deficit was financed mainly from domestic sources,
particularly through the issuance of additional Federal
Government of Nigeria Bonds,” it said.  The naira gained 0.7 percent to 156.15 a dollar in the
interbank market in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
