Runaway Ukrainian dancer Sergei
Polunin returns (briefly) to the Royal Opera House.  Polunin -- who quit the house in 2011 after becoming its
youngest-ever principal the year before -- joins fellow departee
 Tamara Rojo  (the new head of English National Ballet) in the
one-act “Marguerite and Armand.”  That’s the piece  Rudolf Nureyev  and  Margot Fonteyn  made
memorable. Also on Feb. 21. Information:  http://www.roh.org.uk 
or +44-20-7304-4000.  In  Simon Gray ’s “Quartermaine’s Terms,”   Rowan Atkinson 
plays a lonely, tweed-suited teacher whose pleasant demeanor
conceals an utterly joyless life. His peers at a Cambridge
language school are no better off, each struggling with a
problem parent, spouse, or child.  An excellent cast and deft directing from  Richard Eyre  make
this a show to see. At the Wyndham’s Theatre. Information:
 http://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk .  Koya, a short walk from Wyndham’s Theatre, is a great place
for noodles, though you may need to stand in line. Information:

street urchins who won’t share their pie -- are a highlight of
“Murillo & Justino de Neve: The Art of Friendship” at the
Dulwich Picture Gallery, whose central enfilade has temporarily
been turned into a dim Sevillan church interior.  Murillo’s patron Justino paid him to do religious images
such as a giant “Immaculate Conception” (1660-65). Yet his
portraits of youngsters are much more endearing, and here’s why:
According to the curators, the street urchins could be his own
sons posing for dad, and the smiling flower girl in “Spring”
(1665-70) may well be his deaf-and-dumb daughter.  Information:  http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk  or
+44-20-8693-5254.  Saturday Night  John Prine  brings his guitar and poetic songs to the
Barbican. The U.S. singer has spent 40 years examining
overlooked ironies of everyday life with songs such as “Speed
of the Sound of Loneliness.”  Barbican Centre, Silk Street, EC2Y 8BS. Information: +44-
7638-8891,  http://www.barbican.org.uk .  Rock fans seeking a louder, faster dance alternative can
head over to Koko’s in Camden where Mr. Scuff is playing. Born
Andy Carthy, the one-time supermarket shelf stacker is now a
producer and musician known for his DJ sets, which often run for
five hours or more.  Koko, 1A Camden High Street, NW1 7JE. Information: +44-870-
432-5527 or  http://www.koko.uk.com/  or  http://www.mrscruff.com/   Sunday  Piano’s best-known duo, the French sisters Katia and
Marielle Labeque, perform Debussy and Ravel at the Southbank.  They’re part of the yearlong “Rest is Noise” festival --
inspired by  Alex Ross ’s book on 20th-century music -- which in
February focuses on Paris between 1910 and 1930.  There’s also a Saturday night performance of Stravinsky’s
“Rite of Spring” by the London Philharmonic Orchestra,
conducted by  Yannick Nezet-Seguin .  The festival’s next segment: Berlin in the 1920’s and
1930s, with  Liza Minnelli  revisiting “Cabaret” on March 1.
