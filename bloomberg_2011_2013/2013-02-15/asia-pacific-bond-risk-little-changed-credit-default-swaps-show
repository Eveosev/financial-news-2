The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
was little changed, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan held at 110.5 basis points as of 8:08
a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The gauge last closed at a lower level on Jan. 29, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was at 112.5 as of 11:07
a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The
benchmark closed at the same level yesterday, the lowest since
Jan. 10, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 1.5 basis points to
121.5 basis points as of 9:17 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Citigroup Inc. prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
