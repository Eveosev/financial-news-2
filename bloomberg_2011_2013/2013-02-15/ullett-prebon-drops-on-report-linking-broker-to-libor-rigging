Tullett Prebon Plc , the British
inter-dealer broker run by  Terry Smith , fell the most in three
months after the Financial Times reported that one of its
employees has been implicated in the Libor-rigging scandal.  The unidentified employee agreed to relay requests from a
 UBS AG  derivatives trader asking employees at others banks to
make favorable submissions to the London interbank offered rate,
the FT reported, citing filings released as part of the Swiss
bank’s settlement with regulators and two people with knowledge
of the matter. Tullett also received “corrupt payments” from
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  as the lender tried to boost
its influence over the brokers, the FT said.  The stock  fell  5.9 percent to 282.80 pence in London
trading, its steepest decline since Nov. 9. The shares are up 12
percent so far this year, for a market value of 615 million
pounds ($955 million).  “Tullett Prebon has never been informed by the Financial
Services Authority or any other regulatory authority that
Tullett Prebon or any of its brokers are under investigation in
relation to Libor,” the firm said in a statement today.  Interdealer brokers, the middlemen who line up buyers and
sellers of securities for banks, are emerging as key enablers in
the Libor scandal after RBS, UBS and Barclays Plc paid total
fines of $2.6 billion for rigging global interest rates.  Employees at ICAP Plc, the world’s biggest interdealer
broker, and RP Martin Group Ltd., a smaller British competitor,
are being probed over their alleged involvement in the
manipulation of benchmark interest rates, three people with
knowledge of the matter said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
