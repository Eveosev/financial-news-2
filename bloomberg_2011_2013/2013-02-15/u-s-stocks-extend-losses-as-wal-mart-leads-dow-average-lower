U.S. stocks retreated, with the
Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index retreating from a five-year high, as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plunged after e-mails showed the company
had the worst sales start to a month in seven years.  The S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent to 1,516.43 at 2:22 p.m. in
New York and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 38.09 points
to 13,935.3.  Wal-Mart sank 3.4 percent after e-mails obtained by
Bloomberg News showed company executives believe payroll-tax
increases hit shoppers already battling a slow economy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
