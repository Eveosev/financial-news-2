The New York Rangers sent  Chris Kreider  to the Connecticut Whale of the American Hockey League,
less than a year after he became the first player in more than
two decades to win a college title and debut in that year’s
National Hockey League playoffs.  The 21-year-old forward had a goal and an assist with four
penalty minutes in seven games for the Rangers this season. His
five postseason goals last year tied an NHL record for playoff
scoring by a rookie without participating in a regular-season
game.  Kreider won the National Collegiate Athletic Association
championship with Boston College in April 2012 and then signed
with the Rangers, who selected him in the first round of the
2009 entry draft in time to participate in the playoffs.  Kreider was the first player to jump from a college
championship win to the NHL postseason since 1987, when  Tony Hrkac  won a college title with the University of North Dakota
before playing for the St. Louis Blues.  The Rangers announced Kreider’s assignment to the Whale in
a news release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
