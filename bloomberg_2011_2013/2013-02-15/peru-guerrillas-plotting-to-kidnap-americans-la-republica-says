The U.S. State Department’s decision
to bar travel by officials to Cuzco in Peru’s southern Andes was
prompted by intelligence reports that Shining Path guerrillas
plan to abduct Americans in the area, La Republica  reported .  Members of the armed group discussed kidnapping foreigners
in Cuzco once the rainy season ends, the Lima-based newspaper
reported, citing military officials it didn’t name.  The guerrillas, who kidnapped a group of about 40 Peruvians
including employees of Skanska AB in April, use abductions to
gain international attention and put pressure on the government,
which last year stepped up efforts to disband the group, La
Republica said.  A criminal organization may be planning to kidnap U.S.
citizens visiting Cuzco, including the Machu Picchu Inca
sanctuary, Peru’s top tourist destination, the U.S. embassy said
in a Feb. 13  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
