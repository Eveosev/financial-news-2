Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the
largest social network with more than 1 billion members, is
working with the U.S.  Federal Bureau  of Investigation to probe a
malware attack, people with knowledge of the matter said.  Facebook  said  yesterday that it was subjected to a
“sophisticated attack” by hackers last month, without saying
where the attack originated. Investigators haven’t found any
evidence that user data was compromised,  Menlo Park , California-
based Facebook  said  on its website. The people who discussed the
FBI’s involvement asked not to be identified, citing the
sensitive nature of the probe.  Facebook, which stores information on users, often grapples
with attempted breaches. It has a team dedicated to detecting
and responding to attack attempts, pays bounties to outside
programmers who help identify malfeasance and said it
successfully prevents attacks the “vast majority of the time.”  “As soon as we discovered the presence of the malware, we
remediated all infected machines, informed  law enforcement , and
began a significant investigation that continues to this day,”
Facebook said.  Malware infected laptops used by Facebook employees when
they visited a mobile developer’s website, the company said.  Facebook fell less than 1 percent to $28.32 at yesterday’s
close in  New York , and it has risen 6.4 percent this year.  The attack also affected other companies, Facebook said,
without identifying them. It’s collaborating on the incident
through an informal working group.  Incident Prevention  “We are working continuously and closely with our own
internal engineering teams, with security teams at other
companies, and with law enforcement authorities to learn
everything we can about the attack, and how to prevent similar
incidents in the future,” Facebook said.  Twitter Inc., the microblogging site with more than 200
million active users, said Feb. 2 that it was subjected to
unauthorized attempts to hack into its systems and that
attackers may have obtained access to information for about
250,000 people. It said the perpetrators were “extremely
sophisticated.”  Representatives of Twitter and Facebook declined to comment
on whether the attacks were linked. Julianne Sohn, a spokeswoman
for the FBI in  San Francisco , said she couldn’t comment on
whether the agency is working with Facebook.  The New York Times Co.  reported  Jan. 30 that its computer
network was hacked repeatedly by attackers in  China . For four
months, the newspaper’s computer systems were infiltrated and
Chinese hackers accessed some passwords for its reporters and
other employees, the publisher said.  Oracle’s Patch  The Wall Street Journal also  detailed  similar attacks on
its systems, while Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News ,
said there have been unsuccessful attempts to infiltrate its
network.  Facebook, as part of its monitoring efforts, flagged a
suspicious domain in its corporate logs and tracked it back to
an employee computer. After examining the laptop, the company
found a malicious file and then uncovered several other
compromised laptops after a companywide search.  By first hacking a mobile developer’s site, the attackers
had ensured that they would infect the computers of engineers
working for several companies, said Anup Ghosh, founder of
Invincea Inc, a security firm based in Fairfax, Virginia.  “There is a range of developers that might visit that site
and they would infect them all,” Ghosh said of the attack.  The malicious software bypassed built-in protections to
install malware. Facebook immediately reported the exploit to
 Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , which owns the Java software that was compromised.
Oracle provided a patch Feb. 1 to address the vulnerability.  Deborah Hellinger , a spokeswoman for  Redwood City ,
California-based Oracle, declined to comment on the Java
software hack.  To contact the reporters on this story:
