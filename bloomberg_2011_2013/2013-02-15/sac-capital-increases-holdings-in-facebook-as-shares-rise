SAC Capital Advisors LP, the $14
billion hedge fund run by  Steven A. Cohen , joined other
investors in boosting stakes in  Facebook Inc.  during the fourth
quarter, as the company took steps to bring in more revenue.  SAC Capital increased its holding in Facebook by 7.99
million shares, bringing its stake to 8.5 million shares, worth
$242.1 million, according to a filing yesterday. D.E. Shaw &
Co., the New York-based hedge fund that uses computer models to
pick trades, increased its stake by 7.58 million to 7.8 million,
or $222.3 million.  Facebook has  climbed  more than 50 percent from a record low
in September, as the company assuaged concerns over revenue
growth and weak mobile advertising that sent the shares to half
of their May initial offering price of $38 apiece. Mobile-ad
sales made up 23 percent of ad  revenue  during the fourth
quarter, up from 14 percent in the previous period.  Other investors had sold out by the end of the year.  John A. Thaler ’s JAT Capital Management LP reduced its holdings by
5.64 million shares to 532,312, according to a filing.  Facebook rose 2.1 percent to $28.50 at yesterday’s close in
New York. Shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company are
down 25 percent from last year’s IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
