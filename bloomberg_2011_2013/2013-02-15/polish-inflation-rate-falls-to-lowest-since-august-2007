Polish inflation slowed in January
to the weakest pace since 2007 after domestic demand plummeted,
boosting pressure on the central bank to keep cutting borrowing
costs to spur the economy.  The  inflation  rate declined to 1.7 percent, the lowest
since August 2007 and compared with 2.4 percent in December, the
statistical office in Warsaw said today. That was less than the
2 percent median estimate of 30 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Prices rose 0.1 percent from the previous month.  Struggling with inflation above its 2.5 percent target
since October 2010, Poland’s central bank was the only one in
the European Union to raise rates last year. The Narodowy Bank
Polski has reduced the  benchmark  since November a combined 100
basis points to 3.75 percent as the EU’s largest eastern economy
slowed to a three-year low of 2 percent last year.  “There’s definitely more room to ease monetary policy,”
policy maker  Anna Zielinska-Glebocka  said in an interview on TVN
CNBC after the data, adding that she would support a rate cut in
March. “I don’t think there’s huge scope because we expect the
economy to improve in the second half and perhaps some inflation
pressure could appear at the end of the year.”  Currency Moves  The zloty weakened to as low as 4.1959 per euro in Warsaw
after the inflation report and traded at 4.1889 at 2:45 p.m.,
down 0.3 percent on the day. The yield on the government’s 10-
year zloty bonds fell 7 basis points to 4.01 percent.  Individual consumption added 0.5 percent to Poland’s gross
domestic product last year, the least since comparable data were
introduced in 1995.  Retails sales  dropped the most since 2005 in
December and the jobless rate rose to 13.4 percent, the highest
in almost a year.  “We may expect that the lowest CPI could be in April,”
between 1 percent and 1.2 percent,  Jaroslaw Janecki , a Warsaw-
based economist at Societe Generale, said by phone after the
report, adding that he expects the central bank to cut its
benchmark by 25 basis points next month.  Because the statistical office changes the price basket at
the start of each year, the January inflation rate is subject to
revision, which will be released next month along with the
February report on price growth.  Poland’s central bank should stop lowering borrowing costs
now and keep its benchmark rate unchanged, “possibly” for the
rest of 2013, to ensure stable prices as economic growth
recovers, central banker  Adam Glapinski  said in an interview in
Warsaw on Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
