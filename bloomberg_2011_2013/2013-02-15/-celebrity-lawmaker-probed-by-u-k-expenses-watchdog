Nadine Dorries , a lawmaker from
Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative Party, is being
investigated over claims for taxpayer-funded expenses.  Dorries is under investigation over her accommodation and
travel expenses, the Independent Parliamentary Standards
Authority in London said in a  statement  on its website today.  She was suspended from the Tory parliamentary party last
year for appearing in the reality-television show “I’m a
Celebrity... Get Me out of Here” while serving as a member of
Parliament, missing 11 days of work.  “The compliance officer for the Independent Parliamentary
Standards Authority has reason to believe that Ms. Nadine
Dorries MP may have been paid an amount under the MPs’ Scheme of
Business Costs and Expenses that should not have been allowed,”
IPSA said. “In accordance with the legislation and the
procedures for investigation made thereunder, no further
information shall be published until the investigation has been
concluded.”  The claims being investigated fall under “accommodation
expenditure” and “travel and subsistence,” the watchdog said.  Dorries has clashed with Cameron and Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  over policy in the past, criticizing
them as “arrogant posh boys who don’t know the price of milk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
