TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. , the
world’s biggest vehicle-safety equipment maker, rose to a two-
year high after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  gained 0.8 percent to $60.32 in New York, the
highest closing price since Feb. 15, 2011.  Quarterly profit excluding some items was $1.55 a share,
the Livonia, Michigan-based company said in a statement today.
That beat the $1.34 average of 10 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. TRW’s net income fell 1.4 percent to $419 million, or
$3.26 a share, from $425 million, or $3.27, a year earlier.  TRW, like other suppliers of car and truck parts, is
grappling with lower demand from automakers operating in Europe,
where vehicle sales reached a 19-year low in 2012. The company
today forecast that industry production this year will increase
3 percent in North America and slide 4 percent in Europe.  The auto-parts maker said it expects its own full-year
sales to be $16.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including about $4.1
billion this quarter.  Revenue  in 2012 rose 1.2 percent to $16.4
billion.  TRW shares have climbed 13 percent this year, as the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has risen 6.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
