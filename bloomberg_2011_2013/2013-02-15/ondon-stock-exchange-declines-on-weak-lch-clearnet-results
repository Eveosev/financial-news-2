London Stock Exchange Group Plc ,
Europe’s oldest independent bourse, slumped the most in more
than four months after LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., the
clearinghouse it is taking a majority stake in, reported full-
year results that disappointed analysts.  LCH.Clearnet underlying revenue rose 2 percent, less than
the 8 percent increase in operating expenses,  Peter Lenardos , an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets with an outperform rating on the
stock, wrote in a note to clients. As a result, underlying
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
fell 10 percent, he said.  “We are surprised, and not pleasantly,” Lenardos said.
“We believe that integration and turnaround of LCH.Clearnet
could be lengthy and complicated.”  London Stock Exchange has agreed to pay 15 euros a share
for a 60 percent stake in LCH.Clearnet. It originally offered 20
euros, lowering its offer on concern that European regulations
will force the clearinghouse to boost capital by 300 million
euros to 375 million euros. The transaction is awaiting approval
from the U.K. regulator.  The shares dropped as much as 7.4 percent, the biggest
intraday fall since Sept. 28, and were 94 pence, or 7 percent,
lower at 1,247 pence at 10:30 a.m., paring the gain in the last
six months to 24 percent. The volume of shares traded was 30
percent higher than the three-month daily average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
