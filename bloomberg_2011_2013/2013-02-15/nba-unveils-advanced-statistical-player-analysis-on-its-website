The National Basketball Association
added advanced statistical categories to its  website , joining a
movement toward increased use of sports data to help teams, fans
and media members analyze player performance.  The website now includes every box score in NBA history,
shooting charts that help visualize offensive and defensive
performances and statistics that break down player attributes
such as efficiency and how clutch they are, the league said in a
statement.  “Sports fans have a passion for statistics because it
brings them closer to the game, their favorite teams and
players,” said  Steve Peck , senior vice president of global
strategic initiatives at  SAP AG , which partnered with the NBA to
power the website.  The NBA’s entire official statistics history now will be
offered free after previously being made available only to teams
and league officials. Content found on the site can be shared on
social media platforms Twitter, Facebook and Google+.  Using advanced data to analyze player performance has
become common in Major League Baseball since  Bill James  used
statistics to help make the Boston Red Sox World Series
champions in 2004. The movement was popularized by  Michael Lewis ’s book “Moneyball,” which chronicled Oakland Athletics
General Manager  Billy Beane ’s use of statistics to build his
roster. Lewis is a Bloomberg News columnist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
