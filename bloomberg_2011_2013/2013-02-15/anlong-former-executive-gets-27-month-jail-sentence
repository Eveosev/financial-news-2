A former  Sichuan Hanlong Group  unit
executive was sentenced to 27 months in jail after pleading
guilty to three counts of insider trading, Australia’s stock
exchange regulator said in a statement today.  The Australian Securities & Investments Commission also
said on its  website  that it’s investigating other people
associated with  Hanlong Mining Investment Pty  and won’t make any
further comments on that probe.  Calvin Zhu , former vice president at Hanlong Mining,
admitted to trading on insider information between Dec. 8, 2006
and March 30, 2007 when Pacific Equity Partners Pty planned a
takeover of Veda Advantage Ltd., while he was an executive at
Caliburn Partnership Pty, according to the regulator. Zhu used
inside information in trades worth A$1.3 million ($1.35
million), with his own share of the transactions amounting to
about A$370,000, ASIC said.  The second count related to insider trading on a proposed
takeover of  Funtastic Ltd.  by Archer Capital Pty in 2008 and
another transaction in 2009, while Zhu was an associate at
Credit Suisse Management (Australia) Ltd. The third was while he
was employed at Hanlong Mining and traded in relation to
proposed takeovers by the company of  Bannerman Resources Ltd. 
and  Sundance Resources Ltd.  in 2011.  The Bannerman and Sundance insider trading charge carried a
maximum penalty of a A$495,000 fine, or three times the profit
made, and/or 10 years in jail. The earlier offenses each carry a
maximum fine of A$220,000 and/or five years in jail. Zhu wasn’t
fined.  Sichuan Hanlong agreed in October 2011 to buy Sundance in a
deal that valued the owner of the Mbalam iron project in Africa
at A$1.65 billion. The transaction hasn’t closed yet.  The Australian regulator investigated Zhu and other
individuals on allegations they took A$1 million from Hanlong
Mining, created a company where the money was deposited, and
traded shares and contracts of Bannerman and Sundance before
Sichuan Hanlong offered to buy them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
