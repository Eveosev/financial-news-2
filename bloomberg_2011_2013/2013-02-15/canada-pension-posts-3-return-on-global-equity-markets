Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, the country’s biggest public pension manager, posted a
return of 3 percent in the fiscal third quarter after gains in
global equity markets.  Investment income for the three months ended Dec. 31 was
C$5 billion ($4.97 billion), the Toronto-based fund manager said
today in a statement. Assets rose to C$172.6 billion from
C$170.1 billion on Sept. 30.  “This quarter’s results reflect the strength and
capabilities of our diversified global platform,” Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Wiseman  said in the statement.  Canada Pension’s results exceeded the 2.5 percent median
return of the country’s pension funds over the three months,
according to RBC Investor Services. Canada’s equity  benchmark 
Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 0.9 percent and the
 MSCI World Index  advanced 2.1 percent in the quarter.  Canada Pension covers every Canadian province except
Quebec.  To contact the reporters on this story:
