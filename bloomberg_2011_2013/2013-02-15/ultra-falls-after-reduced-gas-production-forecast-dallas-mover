  Ultra Petroleum Corp. , the natural
gas producer with properties in Wyoming and Pennsylvania, fell
after saying this year’s production decline will be deeper than
previously forecast.  Ultra, based in Houston,  dropped  4.8 percent to $16 at the
close in New York. The stock earlier plunged as low as $15.26,
the lowest intraday price since May 28, 2004.  Production will be the equivalent of 228 billion to 238
billion cubic feet of gas in 2013, with a capital spending plan
of about $415 million, Ultra said in a statement today. The
company said in November that output would be about 240 billion
cubic feet equivalent this year, with a capital program of about
$450 million.  Also today, Ultra said fourth-quarter profit excluding one-
time costs and gains was 51 cents a share, 3 cents  less  than the
average of 20 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
company also had a $496.5 million non-cash writedown related to
lower gas prices.  The company ended 2012 with proved reserves equivalent to
about 3.1 trillion cubic feet of gas, compared with about 4.98
trillion at the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
