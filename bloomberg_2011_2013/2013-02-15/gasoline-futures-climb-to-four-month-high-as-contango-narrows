Gasoline reached the highest level
in more than four months, rising a fifth consecutive week, and
the March contract’s discount to April futures narrowed for a
second day.  Futures for March delivery climbed 0.6 percent to the
highest settlement since Sept. 28. The spread to April shrank
2.05 cents to 17.93 cents, the smallest in eight days,
indicating traders consider March winter-grade fuel undervalued.
April represents summer-grade fuel, more costly to refine and
blend.  “The March-April spread had gone down to 24 cents, 25
cents under after being around 15 cents the last couple of
years,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies
Bache LLC in New York. “Clearly, it was undervalued. The
summer-winter grade was way too wide.”  March gasoline advanced 1.79 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $3.1345 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange
on volume that was 58 percent above the 100-day average. Prices
rose 2.5 percent this week, the fifth consecutive weekly gain.  Prices rallied after the 2:30 p.m. close of floor trading,
touching $3.1567 at 3:26 p.m. after reports that Royal Dutch
Shell Plc’s Deer Park, Texas, refinery will shut units beginning
March 4 for planned work and Phillips 66 pulled feed from a
fluid catalytic cracker at its Sweeny plant yesterday after an
electrical disruption.  The motor fuel has been the top performer this year on the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI  index  of 24 commodities with an 11
percent gain.  ’Anticipation’  “We’ve got anticipation of tight supply,” said  Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-
based energy consultant. “Prices could go higher.”  Heating oil for March delivery fell 1.33 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $3.2104 a gallon. It was the lowest
settlement in six days. Prices sank 0.9 percent this week, the
first decline in five weeks.  Crude for March delivery on the Nymex slid $1.45 to $95.86
on the Nymex. Heating oil followed crude lower as output at U.S.
factories, mines and utilities fell 0.1 percent after a 0.4
percent gain in December, figures from the Federal Reserve
showed today in Washington. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey called for a 0.2 percent rise.  “The indicator is that demand won’t grow as much as
anticipated,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  The  retail  price for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 1.5 cents to $3.643 a gallon, the highest level since Oct.
22, AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
