German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  cautioned the Group of 20 nations against engaging in
currency manipulation to buoy their economies, saying there is
no alternative to committing to deep-rooted reform.  Schaeuble, the minister at the helm of Europe’s biggest
economy, called on fellow G-20 nations to adopt the European
Union’s fiscal rules obliging members to bring debt below 60
percent of gross domestic product. He proposed the rule also be
applied to all “industrial, developing and emerging nations.”  “While Europe is successfully repairing itself, the G-20
as a whole is standing at a crossroads,” Schaeuble said in the
op-ed, according an English version of his comments provided by
his ministry. “The temptation to take a short cut on the way to
economic recovery and financial repair by relying on monetary
policy or competitive devaluations has become as real as it is
dangerous.”  Schaeuble comments were posted on the newspaper
Kommersant’s website today as G-20 finance ministers and central
bank governors begin a two-day meeting in Moscow. The officials
of the world’s leading economies meet amid concerns voiced in
Germany and elsewhere that Japan and others might push for
weaker exchange rates to make their exports more competitive.  “Competing efforts to weaken our exchange rates -- what
some have dubbed a ‘currency war’ -- would leave only casualties
in its wake and no victors,” Schaeuble said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
