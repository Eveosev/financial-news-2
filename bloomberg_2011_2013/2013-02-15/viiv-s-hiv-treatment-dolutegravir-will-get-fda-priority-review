ViiV Healthcare Ltd., a joint
venture of  GlaxoSmithKline Plc  and two other drugmakers, said
its experimental HIV medicine dolutegravir will get a speedier
review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  A regulatory decision is scheduled for Aug. 17 after Viiv
submitted an application on Dec. 17, the London-based company
said in a  statement  today. The FDA gave dolutegravir priority
review status, which is granted to drugs that have the potential
to offer significant improvement over existing therapies or
where no adequate treatment exists, the company said.  Dolutegravir may challenge the world’s best-selling AIDS
medicine, made by Gilead Sciences Inc. The drug, combined with
one of ViiV’s older treatments, reduced the HIV virus to
undetectable levels in more people than Gilead’s Atripla in a
clinical trial released in July. ViiV also submitted an
application for European Union approval on Dec. 17.  If approved, dolutegravir would be the second in a new
class of HIV medicines called integrase inhibitors that work by
blocking HIV’s ability to replicate.  ViiV is Glaxo’s joint-venture with New York-based Pfizer
Inc. and Japan’s Shionogi & Co. In October, the companies said
Shionogi will get a 10 percent stake in ViiV, with London-based
Glaxo owning 76.5 percent and Pfizer 13.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
