Telefonica SA , updating its finances
after the currency devaluation in Venezuela, said last year’s
results were hurt by a pretax loss of 438 million euros ($585
million) from its foreign-currency position in bolivars.  Because the devaluation decision was made after the end of
2012, there was no other impact on last year’s results, the
Madrid-based phone carrier said yesterday in a  statement . The
value of Telefonica’s net assets in Venezuela dropped by 1
billion euros because of the government’s decision this month to
lower the bolivar to 6.3 per dollar from 4.3, Telefonica said.  Consumers rushed to stores in the days before the Feb. 13
devaluation to buy airline tickets and TVs on concern the weaker
bolivar would fuel the fastest inflation rate in Latin America.
It’s the fifth time in nine years that President Hugo Chavez has
weakened the exchange rate.  Telefonica’s reports of cash flow and financial results
from Venezuela will reflect the new exchange rate as of Jan. 1,
2013, the company said. Its shares  fell  2 percent to 9.75 euros
yesterday in Madrid.  The company is scheduled to report its full-year 2012
results on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
