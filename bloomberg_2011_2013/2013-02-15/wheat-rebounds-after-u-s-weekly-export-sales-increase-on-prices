Wheat futures rose the most in two
weeks on indications that U.S. livestock are feeding on more of
the grain. Corn advanced, ending the longest slump in 47 years,
and soybeans gained.  Yesterday,  wheat  at terminals in Kansas City sold at a
premium of 5 cents a bushel versus  corn , down from 9 cents a day
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. In the
southern Great Plains, wheat is added to animal feed when the
premium narrows because the grain has a higher content of
protein. The government on Feb. 8  forecast  that 375 million
bushels will be fed to livestock in 2013, more than double the
prior year.  “There’s significantly more wheat being fed than I
thought,”  Darrell Holaday , the president of Advanced Market
Concepts in Wamego, Kansas, said in a telephone interview.
“Wheat feeding is moving from Oklahoma into west Texas. We’re
starting to see that in the USDA reports.”  Wheat futures for May delivery climbed 1.1 percent to
settle at $7.485 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Jan.
30.  Export sales  by the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper, more
than doubled to 706,252 metric tons in the week ended Feb. 7
from a week earlier, the USDA said yesterday. Egypt, the top
importer, bought U.S. grain in both of its tenders this year.  Corn futures for May delivery advanced 0.6 percent to $6.97
a bushel in Chicago. The price dropped in the previous 10
sessions, the longest slump since July 1965.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$14.1475 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
