Finland needs to enact measures that
lengthen careers to achieve balanced public finances in the long
term, the country’s auditor said.  The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  is
“unlikely” to reach its targets to stop debt growth by 2015
and keep the budget deficit in check, the Helsinki-based
National Audit Office said in a report to lawmakers today. The
government is committed to extra austerity if the central
government’s deficit exceeds 1 percent of gross domestic
product.  The readiness to cut public spending more than previously
agreed on improves fiscal credibility, the organization said.
Policy makers must find ways to boost competitiveness, encourage
more competition especially in the service industries and
restrain the growth of municipal spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
