Hines, an international real estate
developer, is seeking to sell two Manhattan skyscrapers, the
 I.M. Pei -designed 499 Park Ave. and 425 Lexington Ave., home of
the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.  The Midtown  office  buildings may be acquired individually
or as a package,  Douglas Harmon , senior managing director of
brokerage Eastdil Secured LLC, said in a statement e-mailed by
Hines. Harmon is marketing the towers along with  Darcy Stacom ,
vice chairman of CBRE Group Inc.  “We have had outstanding success with these two assets
over the last 10 years in terms of investment performance,”
said Tommy Craig, director of Houston-based Hines’s New York
office. The properties should attract both domestic and foreign
bidders, he said.  The offerings follow three deals this year for Midtown
office towers. Last month, Chetrit Group agreed to acquire the
37-story Sony Building for $1.1 billion, while RXR Realty LLC
reached a deal to buy a 99-year leasehold interest in 75
Rockefeller Plaza. Earlier this week, RXR said it and Walton
Street Capital LLC will purchase 237 Park Ave. from Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The price was about $800 million, said a
person with knowledge of the sale.  The 28-story, 300,000-square-foot (28,000-square-meter) 499
Park Ave., known as the Black Diamond because of its dark glass
facade, houses the headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald LP, the
financial firm led by  Howard Lutnick . The property at the corner
of 59th Street was completed in 1980 and was formerly home to
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  The 31-story tower at 425 Lexington, built in 1987, has
750,000 square feet, according to Hines. It is fully leased to
Simpson Thacher and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
