CVR Energy Inc . restarted the
catalytic cracker at a refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas, after
shutting it last week for unplanned maintenance, a person
familiar with the work said.  The cracker was idled for repairs Feb. 5, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the information isnâ€™t
public.  Angela Dasbach , a spokeswoman for Sugar Land, Texas-based
CVR, did not immediately respond today to an e-mail requesting
comment.  The Coffeyville plant can process 120,000 barrels of crude
a day and has 36,000-barrels-a-day of catalytic cracking
capacity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
