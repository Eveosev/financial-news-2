Continental oils weakened against
offshore and imported crude on the spot market as U.S.
industrial production unexpectedly shrank, dimming the outlook
for fuel demand.  U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate lost $1.32 a barrel
 relative  to overseas Brent oil as of 2:15 p.m. New York time.
U.S. factory output declined 0.1 percent last month.  WTI delivered in  Midland , Texas, weakened by 10 cents to a
80 cent discount to the same grade delivered in Cushing,
Oklahoma, while  West Texas Sour  slid $1 to a $5.50 discount at
2:16 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude oil produced offshore in the Gulf of Mexico
strengthened as WTI lost ground to Brent. Stronger prices for
the European benchmark tend to boost U.S. offshore domestic
oils, which compete with overseas imports.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil advanced $1.20 to a $21.60 a
barrel premium to WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased $1.00 to
a premium of $21.50.  Mars Blend , a sour offshore grade, added $1.10 to $16.00
over WTI. Southern Green Canyonâ€™s premium gained $1.25 to
$14.25.  Western Canada Select , a heavy bitumen blend, rose 50 cents
to a $24.25 discount, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
