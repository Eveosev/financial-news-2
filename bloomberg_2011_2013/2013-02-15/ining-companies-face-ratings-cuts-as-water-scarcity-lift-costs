Global mining companies may see
increased pressure on their credit ratings as environmental
issues including water scarcity add to capital and operating
costs, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  Smaller, less-diversified mining companies in water-scarce
regions such as South America are most vulnerable, Moody’s said
in a report dated yesterday. Larger producers including  BHP
Billiton Ltd. , Rio Tinto Group and Anglo American Plc will also
be adversely affected given their global operations and
willingness to operate in remote and arid regions, it said.  “Water scarcity is already changing the mining landscape
as environmental legislation becomes more stringent,” Andrew
Metcalf, a Moody’s analyst, said in the report. “Operating in
some countries increases political risk as mining companies’
water supplies can be restricted if the needs of communities
increase.”  Mining companies are already competing with local
communities for limited water resources, and environmental rules
and permit requirements are adding to the cost of new mines and
project time-lines, Moody’s said.  Rio, BHP and Anglo have the expertise and financial
strength necessary to build complex water procurement systems
for large-scale projects and are likely to become preferred
partners in water-scarce countries seeking to benefit from their
natural resources as a result, the rating company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
