WellPoint Inc ., the second-biggest
U.S. health insurer, said  James Carlson  will leave the company,
three days after losing the competition to be the carrier’s next
chief executive officer.  Carlson, the former CEO at Medicaid insurer Amerigroup
Corp., will leave Indianapolis-based WellPoint on Feb. 28,
according to a statement e-mailed by  Kristin Binns , a company
spokeswoman. He had joined the company in December, after
WellPoint closed its $4.9 billion acquisition of Amerigroup.  WellPoint said Feb. 12 that it had chosen  Joseph Swedish ,
CEO of the nonprofit hospital system Trinity Health Corp., to be
its next leader, ending a six-month search. Carlson, 60, was
among the other candidates under consideration, a person
familiar with the process told Bloomberg News last month.  “After helping close the Amerigroup transaction and
assisting over the past six weeks with the integration of the
two companies,  Jim Carlson  will be leaving WellPoint effective
February 28,” WellPoint said in the statement. “We wish Jim
well, and thank him for his many contributions.”  While Carlson had signed a contract to remain with
WellPoint for two years, the pact allowed the two sides to part
under “changed circumstances,” said  Carl McDonald , a Citigroup
analyst, in a Feb. 13 note to clients. The WellPoint statement
didn’t mention Carlson’s contract.  Binns declined to comment when asked how Carlson’s contract
would be handled. WellPoint said last month that  Richard Zoretic , Amerigroup’s former chief operating officer, would run
its Medicaid business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
