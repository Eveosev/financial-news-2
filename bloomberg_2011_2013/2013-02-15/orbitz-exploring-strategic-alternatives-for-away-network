Orbitz Worldwide Inc. , the online
travel agency, said it’s exploring strategic alternatives for
its Away Network, including a possible sale of the group of
websites.  A sale of some or all of the assets wouldn’t have a
material impact on earnings for 2013, the Chicago-based company
said today in a statement. Away Network includes the websites
Away.com, Trip.com and AdventureFinder.com.  Orbitz is struggling to keep up with Priceline.com Inc. and
 Expedia Inc. , which have more sucessfully expanded out of the
lower-margin airline business into hotel reservations. Orbitz
has lost more than half its market value in the past three
years, and reported  a loss  of more than $300 million in the
fourth quarter because of an impairment charge.  “As we assess the prioritization of investments in
different areas of our business, in particular in the context of
the encouraging trends that we’re seeing in hotel, we’ve made
the determination that the elements of the Away Network, either
collectively or individually, are likely to be more valuable to
other parties,”  Sam Fulton , senior vice president of product
strategy at Orbitz, said in the statement.   Orbitz rose as much as 5.1 percent to $3.50 in extended
trading after the announcement. As of the close, Orbit had a
stock market value of $349.8 million, compared with $35 billion
for Priceline and $8.8 billion for Expedia.  Away is one of the five brands Orbitz lists on its
 corporate site ’s homepage. In addition to its flagship brand,
they include CheapTickets, ebookers.com and HotelClub.  To contact the reporter on this story:
