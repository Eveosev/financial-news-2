Mexico will reduce the weighting of
energy and farm items in its inflation basket, according to a
preliminary report by the national statistics institute, a move
that could lower its consumer price index.  Core prices, which exclude agriculture and energy costs,
would account for 78.5 percent of the total basket in April, up
from 76.7 percent, based on the report published on the agency’s
website today.  The new weightings would help bring down the inflation
rate, said  Alonso Cervera , an economist at Credit Suisse Group
AG because it puts more weight on prices that are increasing at
a slower pace. Mexican  core consumer prices  increased 2.88
percent in January from the year earlier, below the central
bank’s target of 3 percent and less than the 3.25 percent
 overall inflation rate . Core inflation has trailed headline
inflation for most of the past four years.  “In principle, people should be bringing down their
forecast for headline inflation under the new weightings,”
Cervera said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. “We
know that the driver for a rate cut will be that inflation stays
low, stable and approaches 3 percent.”  Mexico’s adjustment in the inflation calculation is being
made based on a periodic survey of household spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
