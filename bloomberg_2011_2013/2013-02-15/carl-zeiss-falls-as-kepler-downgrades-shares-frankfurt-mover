Carl Zeiss Meditec AG  dropped the
most since May in Frankfurt trading after Kepler Capital Markets
said analyst estimates are too high for the maker of
ophthalmological equipment.  Carl Zeiss fell 6 percent to 22.49 euros at 4 p.m., giving
the Jena, Germany-based company a market value of 1.83 billion
euros ($2.4 billion). The stock dropped as much as 6.4 percent,
the biggest intraday decline since May 16, in trading that was
three times the average for the past three months.  Salesand earnings before interest and tax for the fiscal
first-quarter, reported yesterday, rose less than estimated,
 Maja Pataki , a Zurich-based analyst for Kepler, wrote in a note
to investors today. That means analysts will cut estimates for
the full year, she said. Investors had expected Carl Zeiss to
beat its 2015 earnings target in 2014,  Pataki wrote.  “We see very limited upside to our estimates and target
over a 12-month period,” she wrote. “We advise to take
profits.” She cut her rating to reduce from hold.  Sales were disappointing because of the introduction of new
products that caused some customers to delay orders, and because
of increased competition, she wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
