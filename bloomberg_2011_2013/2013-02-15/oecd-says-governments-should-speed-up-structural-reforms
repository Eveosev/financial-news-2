Governments should accelerate the
pace of economic reforms to support the global recovery, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  “Structural reforms can boost long-term growth and welfare
but also underpin confidence and take some of the pressure off
monetary and fiscal policies to buttress the recovery,” OECD
Secretary-General  Angel Gurria  said in an e-mailed statement
today. “The road to a strong recovery remains fraught with
challenges, but measures taken in Europe and the U.S. have
reduced the likelihood of a worst-case scenario.”  The OECD made the comments as Group of 20 finance ministers
and central bankers begin talks in  Moscow  seeking common ground
on currencies after an effort to calm tensions between rich
governments backfired.  Euro-area members hit the hardest by the region’s debt
crisis, such as Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain,
accelerated reforms last year, while the highest-income
countries like Norway, Switzerland and the U.S. have shown
“more limited progress,”  the OECD said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
