PPR SA,  the French owner of Gucci,
predicted another year of growth in 2013 amid an increasing
focus on luxury goods and reported profit that beat estimates,
lifting the  shares  to the highest price in more than 11 years.  The company expects to continue “significantly improving
our operating and financial performances” this year, Paris-
based PPR said today.  Earnings  in 2012 increased 19 percent,
while sales advanced 21 percent.  PPR rose as much as 8.1 percent to 172.75 euros in Paris
trading, the highest intraday price since July 2001 and leading
advances in France’s  CAC 40 Index . The company said it’s
sticking to a goal to lift annual revenue to 24 billion euros
($32 billion) by 2020 even after its Puma SE sportswear unit
said yesterday that reaching its 2015 sales target is no longer
a priority.  “The beat was driven by the luxury division, which
sustained strong sales momentum,” in particular at the Bottega
Veneta brand, said  Melanie Flouquet , an analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. with an overweight  recommendation  on the stock.  The  shares  were up 7.3 percent at 171.40 euros as of 12:13
a.m. The shares have climbed 20 percent this year.  PPR, which has acquired Chinese jeweler Qeelin in December
and British fashion label  Christopher Kane  in January, said so-
called recurring operating income rose to 1.79 billion euros in
2012, exceeding the 1.75 billion-euro average  estimate  of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose to 9.74 billion
euros, gaining 11 percent excluding acquisitions and exchange-
rate movements.  Handbag Growth  PPR’s customer base will more than quadruple to 4 billion
people in three years, CEO Pinault said at a presentation in
Paris. “This is going to underpin growth in all of our brands
in both divisions, making it possible to reach our targets,” he
said, adding that PPR remains committed to Puma.  Puma yesterday shifted away from its target to reach 4
billion euros of revenue by 2015 and made improving profit a
priority after earnings slid. Puma’s comments don’t change PPR’s
ambition to reach its 2020 revenue goal, PPR Chief Financial
Officer  Jean-Marc Duplaix  said today on a call with reporters.  “Once Puma is back on track for growth, we will seek to
strengthen in particular the outdoor segment to build a
portfolio,” Pinault also said.  PPR may raise prices on a case-by-case basis if currency
fluctuations continue to penalize growth, Duplaix said.  Disposals  PPR’s sale of Redcats’s Cyrillus and Vertbaudet brands to
Alpha Private Equity Fund 6 for 119 million euros should be
finalized in the coming months, the company said. Talks have
started to sell Redcats’s Nordic brands and that disposal should
be completed in the first half of 2013, Duplaix said. PPR aims
to sell La Redoute this year, probably in the second half of
2013, the CFO also said.  Fourth-quarter revenue climbed 18 percent on a reported
basis, or 12 percent excluding acquisitions and currency swings,
buoyed by demand for Bottega Veneta handbags, PPR said.  Luxury sales climbed 14 percent in the quarter on a
comparable basis. Sales advanced 8.2 percent at Gucci, 33
percent at Bottega Veneta, 13 percent at Yves Saint Laurent and
20 percent at other brands including  Stella McCartney .  “Gucci is not very impressive,”  Thomas Mesmin , an analyst
at Credit Agricole Cheuvreux, wrote in a note to investors.  The figures exclude online retailer Redcats and the Fnac
media and consumer-electronics chain that PPR plans to dispose
of as it focuses on luxury and sporting goods.  The company said its proposing a cash payment for the 2012
 dividend  of 3.75 euros a share, up 7 percent on the prior year.
PPR also said it will distribute Fnac shares to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
