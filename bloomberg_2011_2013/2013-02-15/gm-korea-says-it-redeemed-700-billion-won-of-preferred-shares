General Motors Co .’s South Korean
 unit  said it redeemed about 700 billion won ($649 million) of
preferred shares to avoid higher dividend payments.  GM Korea bought back the securities from creditors
including  Korea Development Bank  late last year after the
dividend payout escalated to 7 percent of the preferred stock’s
$4,000 price from 2.5 percent, according to a company e-mail
today. The increase in the dividend is part of a deal in 2002,
when the GM unit agreed to redeem all the preferred shares from
creditors by 2017.  The latest purchase indicates the company redeemed half of
the 325,414 preferred shares it had outstanding at the end of
2011, though GM Korea declined to say how many preferred shares
it bought back.  “The transaction was purely based on a decision to improve
the financial status of the company,” the company said in an e-
mailed response to a Bloomberg query. “GM Korea will continue
to buy back preferred shares according to the contract.”  GM’s factories in South Korea produce Chevrolet vehicles
for the domestic market and for export to markets including
Europe and South America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
