The world’s largest heavy transport
vessel loaded the biggest semi-submersible offshore platform
hull for its maiden voyage, ship owner  Dockwise Ltd . said.  The Dockwise Vanguard completed its first float-on
operation this week at the Silli-Do deep hole near the Samsung
Heavy Industries yard in Geoje, South Korea, the Breda,
Netherlands-based company said in a statement today. After
almost two days of fastening, the vessel departed on Feb. 12 and
will sail to the Kiewit yard in Ingleside, Texas. It is expected
to arrive mid-April, according to the statement.  The ship is carrying the Jack/St. Malo platform hull,
weighing 56,000 metric tons, according to the statement. The
Dockwise Vanguard can load as much as 110,000 tons, the company
said.  “Companies in the oil and gas industry can now specify
much larger and heavier offshore structures, and these can be
integrated at a single fabrication site,” Dockwise said in the
statement. “These mega-structures can then be transported on-
board the vessel to remote offshore locations, even in harsh
climates where no commissioning facilities are available.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
