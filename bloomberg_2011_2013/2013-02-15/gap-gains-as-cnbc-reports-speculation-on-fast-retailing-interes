Gap Inc.  advanced the most in more
than six months on a report that the largest U.S. specialty-
apparel retailer hired an adviser following interest from
Japan’s  Fast Retailing Co.   The shares rose 4.8 percent to $32.88 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day  gain  since Aug. 2.  CNBC cited a report by StreetAccount, a financial news
service owned by FactSet Research Systems Inc., which said it
had heard speculation about Fast Retailing’s interest in Gap.  Fast Retailing, the owner of the Uniqlo clothing chain, has
expanded outside of Japan to reduce reliance on its home market.
 Tadashi Yanai , Fast Retailing’s billionaire chief executive
officer, said in an interview in November 2011 that he’s seeking
acquisitions to expand in the U.S. and boost global sales
sixfold to more than $60 billion within the decade.  Edie Kissko , a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Gap,
said in an interview that the company doesn’t comment on rumor
or speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
