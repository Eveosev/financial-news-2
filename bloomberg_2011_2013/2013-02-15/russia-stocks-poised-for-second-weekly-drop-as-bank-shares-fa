Russian  equities declined for a
second weekly retreat as the nation’s largest lenders sank and
crude oil, the nation’s chief export earner, slid.  The  Micex Index  lost 0.7 percent to 1,508.17 by the close
in Moscow, for a 0.8 percent drop in the week. Of the 50 stocks
on the gauge, 27 fell and 23 rose. The dollar-denominated  RTS
Index  also decreased 0.7 percent to 1,577.26.  Financial shares 
lost 2.2 percent on average, the most of nine industry groups.  OAO Sberbank , Russia’s largest lender and the biggest stock
in the index with a 15 percent weighting, slipped 2.5 percent to
105.10 rubles, the biggest drop since Nov. 13.  VTB Group , the
nation’s second-largest bank, slumped 0.9 percent to 5.59 kopeks
following a 1.5 percent advance yesterday after the Telegraph in
London reported Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund is in advanced
talks to invest between $3 billion to $3.5 billion into the
bank. Crude oil fell 1.8 percent in New York, headed for a
second weekly decline after eight weeks of gains.  “Sberbank and VTB rose significantly earlier in the week,
now they’re reversing course, dragging the market down,”  Alexei Yazikov , head of research at Aton Capital LLC, said by phone
from Moscow. “People are fleeing the Russian market.”  Sberbank has rallied 13 percent this year, while VTB has
added 4.3 percent.  Exchange IPO  The  Moscow Exchange , which was created out of a merger
between competing bourses in 2011 and operates the Micex and RTS
indexes, raised $498 million in the biggest initial share sale
in Russia since 2007, pricing at the bottom of its target range.  The deal values the bourse at 126.9 billion rubles ($4.2
billion), according to an e-mailed statement today. The shares,
which are scheduled to start trading today under the MOEX RX
ticker, were priced at 55 rubles each.  The exchange’s shares closed unchanged in Moscow.  Inflows into Russian equity funds increased to $127 million
in the week ended Feb. 13, according to an e-mailed note from
VTB Capital, which cited EPFR Global data.  Stocks extended declines as Russia’s industrial output
unexpectedly contracted in January for the first time in more
than three years, while industrial production in the U.S. also
shrank last month.  OAO Pharmstandard  was the biggest gainer on the index,
jumping 5.9 percent to 2,090.80 rubles. Russia’s largest
drugmaker surged as much as 6.7 percent as it announced a
buyback of up to 8 billion rubles of shares.  Commodities Retreat  The Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Index  of commodities lost 0.9
percent to 673.01.  Ten-day price swings  on the Micex dropped to
13.328 and the number of shares traded on the gauge was 7.9
percent below the gauge’s 10-day average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The  Russian Depositary Index  dropped 1 percent, led by
depositary receipts of Sberbank.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg. The Micex trades at about 5.7 times  estimated
earnings  and has added 2.3 percent this year. That compares with
a multiple of 10 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,
which has gained 1.1 percent over the same period.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, decreased 1.1 percent to $30.32
yesterday. The  RTS Volatility Index , which measures expected
swings in futures, dropped 1.4 percent to 21.11 points. The
 Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index  of the most-traded Russian
stocks in the U.S. declined 0.9 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
