The following is the text of
Canadaâ€™s manufacturing shipments report for December released
by Statistics Canada.  Manufacturing sales declined 3.1% in December to $48.0
billion, the largest decline since May 2009. Just over half of
the decrease reflected lower sales in the transportation
equipment industry. Sales were also down in the chemical,
petroleum and coal product as well as the fabricated metal
product industries.  Sales decreased in 16 of 21 industries, representing 82% of
the manufacturing sector. Durable goods sales were down 4.2%
while non-durable goods sales declined 2.0%.  Constant dollar sales decreased 3.8%, indicating that the
decline in manufactured goods sold was a result of lower volumes.  Sales drop in the transportation equipment industry  Manufacturing sales fell 9.1% in the transportation
equipment industry to $7.8 billion, the largest percentage
decrease since February 2011. A 15.4% decline in the motor
vehicle assembly industry was the main reason for the decline in
transportation equipment sales. Motor vehicle assembly plants
are often shutdown in December for a portion of the month.
However, in December 2012, the reduction in production was
greater than usually observed.  Sales in the motor vehicle parts industry were down 2.7% to
$1.9 billion, the fourth decrease in five months.  In the chemical manufacturing industry, sales declined 4.2%
to $3.9 billion. Most manufacturers in the industry reported
lower sales.  Petroleum and coal product sales decreased 2.2% to $7.2
billion, reflecting lower volumes of product sold.  In the fabricated metal product industry, sales were down
4.0% to $2.8 billion. The drop largely stemmed from lower sales
volumes.  Sales declines concentrated in Ontario  More than two-thirds of the decline in Canadian
manufacturing sales was concentrated in Ontario. In total, six
provinces posted lower sales in December.  In Ontario, sales fell 4.6% to $21.9 billion, the largest
drop in percentage terms since May 2009. The decline mostly
reflected decreases in the motor vehicle assembly industry (-
15.9%). The aerospace product and parts (-41.2%), chemical, (-
4.3%), computer and electronic product (-9.8%), and motor
vehicle parts (-2.7%) industries were also down.  In Alberta, sales fell 4.5% to $5.8 billion, the third
consecutive monthly decrease. The drop reflected declines in the
machinery (-16.0%), fabricated metal product (-14.5%) and
chemical (-4.8%) industries.  Sales were down in New Brunswick (-6,7%) and British
Columbia (-3.3%). In New Brunswick, lower sales in the non-
durable goods industries were mostly responsible for the decline.
In British Columbia, sales were down in 18 of 21 industries.  In Quebec, sales were up 0.7% to $11.6 billion, offsetting
a small portion of the overall national decline. Higher
production in the aerospace product and parts industry was
responsible for the provincial gain.  Inventories decline  Inventories decreased 1.0% to $64.5 billion, primarily
reflecting declines in the transportation equipment as well as
the petroleum and coal product industries.  In the transportation equipment industry, inventories were
down 2.7% to $9.1 billion. Lower inventory levels in the
aerospace product and parts, motor vehicle assembly, and motor
vehicle parts industries were responsible for most of the
decrease.  In the petroleum and coal product industry, inventories
declined 4.6% to $4.9 billion. The decline largely reflected
lower inventory volumes for all three stages of fabrication held
by manufacturers.  The inventory-to-sales ratio rose to 1.34 in December from
1.32 in November. The ratio is a measure of the time, in months,
that would be required to exhaust inventories if sales were to
remain at their current level.  Unfilled orders rise  Unfilled orders rose 2.6% to $65.8 billion. The increase
stemmed from a 5.0% gain in the aerospace product and parts
industry. Unfilled orders in the aerospace industry stood at
$35.9 billion in December. A 3.2% decline in the machinery
industry offset a small portion of the gain.  New orders declined 4.4% to $49.7 billion in December.  Manufacturing at a glance: Slower sales growth in 2012  For 2012 as a whole, Canadian manufacturing sales reached
$590.5 billion, up 3.4% from 2011. This was less than half the
rate of growth of 7.8% in 2011 and 8.9% in 2010.  The largest contributor to the 3.4% increase in 2012 was
the transportation equipment industry, where sales rose 12.6%
during the year to $102.5 billion. Over two-thirds of the annual
gain stemmed from higher sales in the motor vehicle assembly
industry -- a result that contrasts with the decrease in sales
for the industry in December 2012. Another major contributor to
the annual sales increase in 2012 was the petroleum and coal
products industry, where sales were up 6.6%.  The slowdown in growth for the manufacturing sector in 2012
was the result of sales trends in some key industries. In the
primary metals industry, annual sales fell 3.4% to $46.9 billion
in 2012, following a 15.6% increase the year before. Sales in
the petroleum and coal products industry increased 6.6% in 2012,
compared with a 17.0% gain in 2011. Sales in the food industry
fell 0.8% in 2012, following a 4.0% advance in 2011. Finally,
sales gains in the machinery and chemical industries in 2012
were less than half those in 2011.  Note to readers  Monthly data in this release are seasonally adjusted and
are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified.
Preliminary data are provided for the current reference month.
Revised data, based on late responses, are updated for the three
previous months. The annual data in this release are not
seasonally adjusted.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and
tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing,
leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support
activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics
and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation
equipment, furniture and related products and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the aerospace industry and shipbuilding industries, the
value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly
sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories
of goods in process and finished products manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute
to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the current
month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for
the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the
previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
