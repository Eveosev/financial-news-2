The zloty fell for a second day, set
for its biggest weekly retreat in a month, on speculation an
 inflation  report will show the slowest pace in 29 months,
spurring the central bank to cut interest rates.  The currency edged lower amid signs the euro area, Poland’s
biggest export market, is mired in its deepest contraction since
2009. Polish consumer price growth probably slowed to an annual
rate of 2 percent in January, according to the median of 30
economist forecasts on Bloomberg ahead of the statistics office
report at 2 p.m. in Warsaw. The central bank has cut rates four
times since November to bolster the economy.  “Inflation will signal to investors what the central bank
is going to do next,” Joanna Bachert, an analyst at PKO Bank
Polski SA in Warsaw, said in an e-mailed comment today.  The zloty eased 0.1 percent to 4.1825 per euro at 1:18 p.m.
in Warsaw. It lost 1.1 percent this week for the steepest loss
after the Indian rupee among more than 20 emerging-market
tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on 10-year notes fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
