Ringgit forwards fell for the first
time in four days as speculation Prime Minister Najib Razak will
call an early general election increased the risk of holding
Malaysian assets. Government bonds were steady.  Parliament will be dissolved “very, very soon,” news
agency Bernama reported yesterday, citing Najib. The Southeast
Asian nation’s  economy  expanded 5.5 percent in the last three
months of 2012 from 5.2 percent in the preceding quarter,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before
data due on Feb. 20.  “News that the premier may dissolve parliament may have
raised the currency risk premium,” said  Yeah Kim Leng , chief
economist at RAM Holdings Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The ringgit
could see volatile movements in the short term, even though its
positive fundamentals remain intact.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.1 percent
to 3.1532 per dollar as of 4:38 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts to buy or sell the
ringgit in a year advanced 0.2 percent this week and were at a 2
percent discount to the spot rate, which climbed 0.2 percent to
3.0915. Non-deliverable forwards are settled in dollars.  One-month implied volatility in the ringgit, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 10 basis
points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 7.25 percent today and
declined 35 basis points this week.  The yield on the 3.418 percent government bonds due August
2022 was steady at 3.48 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.
The rate rose one basis point this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
