Palm oil fell to a two-week low
after Malaysia, the second-largest producer, said that exports
in March will be taxed for the first time in three months.  The contract for April delivery fell as much as 0.6 percent
to 2,481 ringgit ($802) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest price since Jan. 30, and was last at 2,482
ringgit. Futures are set for the first weekly loss in five.  The tax on crude palm oil exports will be 4.5 percent for
March after shipments were allowed at zero duty in January and
February, according to a Customs Department  statement  on the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board website today. That’s less than the 9
percent tax set by Indonesia for this month.  “The tax is perceived as a negative factor that would
reduce competitiveness,” said  Ryan Long , vice president of
futures and options at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“We’re still competitive if you compare with the Indonesian
export duty.”  Exports from Malaysia climbed 18 percent to 673,555 tons in
the first 15 days of February from the same period a month ago,
surveyor  Intertek  said today.  Inventories  in Malaysia slid 1.9
percent to 2.58 million tons last month from a record 2.63
million tons in December, the palm oil board said Feb. 13.
 Output  fell 10 percent to 1.6 million tons, while exports slid
1.6 percent to 1.62 million tons.  Soybean oil for May delivery was little changed at 52.07
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil is
about 1.43 times costlier than palm oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
