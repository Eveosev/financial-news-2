West Texas Intermediate oil fell,
trimming its ninth weekly gain in 10 weeks. Open interest for
the U.S. benchmark grade rose to a record while a report
signaled OPEC will cut crude shipments this month.  WTI fell as much 0.7 percent in New York, paring its
advance this week to 1.2 percent. Prices gained 0.3 percent
yesterday as the number of contracts outstanding rose to the
highest level since the futures began trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in March 1983. OPEC will cut exports by 0.9
percent this month, according to a tanker tracker. Data on U.S.
industrial production later today is forecast to show a third-
straight month of expansion.  “Fundamentals are acceptably balanced for now,” said
 Michael Poulsen , an analyst at Global Risk Management Ltd. in
Middelfart, Denmark.  Crude for March delivery declined as much as 70 cents to
$96.61 a barrel in electronic trading in New York and was at
$96.83 at 12:52 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures
traded was 32 percent above the 100-day average. Prices are 5.5
percent higher this year.  Brent for April settlement fell 38 cents to $117.62 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
volume of all futures traded was 25 percent below the 100-day
average. The European benchmark grade was at a premium of $20.19
to WTI futures for the same month. The difference was $20.10
yesterday, the narrowest since Feb. 5.  OPEC Cuts  The number of WTI contracts outstanding on Feb. 13 climbed
to 1,665,014,  Chris Grams , a Chicago-based spokesman for Nymex-
owner CME Group Inc. said yesterday. That surpassed the previous
high of 1,664,400 on May 12, 2011, when prices dropped on the
death of Osama Bin Laden.  Open interest for Brent set a record of 1,547,943 contracts
on Feb. 8. The “path of least resistance” for Brent is higher,
 Michael Wittner , head of oil-market research at Societe Generale
SA in New York, said in a report e-mailed today.  Prices are nearing levels that may prompt lawmakers in the
U.S. and Europe to raise the possibility of releasing stockpiles
from emergency reserves, according to  Olivier Jakob , managing
director of Zug, Switzerland-based consultant Petromatrix GmbH.  “We are definitely getting back to the price levels where
politicians will start to be under increasing pressure to do
something,” Jakob said in an e-mailed report.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will ship
23.51 million barrels a day of crude in the four weeks to March
2, down 220,000 from 23.73 million in the previous period, Oil
Movements said in a report yesterday. The decline shows
“restraint on the supply side” rather than solely a seasonal
drop in demand, Roy Mason, the company’s founder, said by phone
from Halifax, England.  Saudi Output  WTI may decline in coming days as futures approach a
“double-top” formation on the daily technical chart, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Crude halted advances near $98 a
barrel on Jan. 31 and Feb. 13, creating two peaks separated by a
trough around $95. The lower price signals an area where buy
orders may be clustered, and losses tend to accelerate with a
breach of the double-top’s support level.  Futures may decline in New York next week on an increase in
U.S. crude supplies as refineries cut operating rates to perform
maintenance, according to a Bloomberg survey of 40 analysts and
traders. Nineteen respondents, or 48 percent, forecast crude
will decline through Feb. 22. Thirteen, or 33 percent, predicted
an increase and eight forecast little change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
