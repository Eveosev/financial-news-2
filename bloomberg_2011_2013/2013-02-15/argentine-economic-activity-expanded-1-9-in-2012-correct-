(Corrects headline to say Economic Activity)  Argentina’s economic activity
expanded 1.9 percent in 2012 from the previous year, the
national statistics institute said today in Buenos Aires.  Activity rose 1.1 percent in December from a year earlier
and 0.4 percent from November  December year-on-year activity trailed the 1.9 percent
median estimate of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  South America’s second-biggest economy probably grew 1.9
percent last year, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said
Feb. 13, down from 8.9 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
