Canadian Aboriginal Affairs Minister
 John Duncan  resigned over a letter he wrote to the Tax Court of
Canada.  Duncan said in a statement that he wrote a “character
reference letter” in June 2011 to the court, which hears
appeals on income-tax assessments and other matters. The letter
was written “on behalf of an individual to whom my constituency
staff was providing casework assistance,” he said.  “While the letter was written with honorable intentions, I
realize that it was not appropriate for me, as a Minister of the
Crown, to write to the Tax Court,” Duncan said.  Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore will serve as acting
Aboriginal Affairs Minister until a new minister is named, Prime
Minister  Stephen Harper  said in a statement.  Duncan said he will continue to serve as a Conservative
member of parliament for the district of Vancouver Island North
in British Columbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
