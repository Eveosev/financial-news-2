The Czech public-finance  deficit 
will narrow to 2.7 percent of economic output this year, a
smaller shortfall than the government’s 2.9 percent target,
according to the central bank’s forecast.  Public debt  will rise to 48 percent of gross domestic
product this year from an estimated 44 percent in 2012, the bank
said in its latest inflation report published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
