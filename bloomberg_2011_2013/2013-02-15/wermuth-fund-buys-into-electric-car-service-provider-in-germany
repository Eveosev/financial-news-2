Wermuth Asset Management GmbH ’s
Green Gateway Fund bought a stake in German electric-car
services company  The Mobility House  to tap rising demand for
cleaner vehicles in Europe.  Green Gateway, which helps companies market their
technologies in eastern Europe, will hold a minority share,
Wermuth senior fund partner  Casper Heijsteeg  said today by
phone. Green Gateway’s investments are typically 5 million euros
($6.7 million) to 25 million euros, according to Wermuth.  Wermuth, based in Mainz, Germany, is investing in electric-
car services as European governments promote low-emissions
transport. There were 114,000 electric vehicles sold globally in
2012, according to preliminary estimates from Bloomberg New
Energy Finance. That compares with about 51,000 sold a year
earlier, data from the London-based researcher show.  Mobility House, based in Munich, provides charging
equipment and energy-management services for electric vehicles
to homes and businesses. It has partnerships with companies
including Bayerische Motoren Werke AG to supply charging points
and maintenance to owners of BMW electric cars.  “There’s a very clear trend towards electric mobility in
Europe and in our view this is the leading company in this
environment,” Heijsteeg said. “That’s why we want to invest in
them right now and not wait several years before it becomes a
mature market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
