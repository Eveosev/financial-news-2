Crude palm oil exports from
Malaysia, the world’s largest producer after Indonesia, will be
taxed in March for the first time in three months. Futures in
Kuala Lumpur dropped.  Shipments will be taxed at 4.5 percent next month as the
reference price was set at 2,306.11 ringgit ($745) a metric ton,
which is in the minimum band for a levy to be applied, according
to a Customs Department statement on the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board  website .  Malaysia said in October it would cut the export tax to
between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent, from about 23 percent, to
help trim record stockpiles and compete with Indonesia. The
tariff was set at zero in January and extended to this month as
the base price was below the threshold of 2,250 ringgit a ton
that triggers the tax. Indonesia has set an export duty of 9
percent this month.  “As long as the duty in Indonesia is higher than in
Malaysia, I think we have the competitive edge,”  Mohammad Jaaffar Ahmad , chief executive officer of the Palm Oil Refiners
Association of Malaysia, said by phone. “I don’t think it’s
going to be detrimental to the plantations as well as refiners
because there is ample supply of CPO,” he said, referring to
crude palm oil by its initials.  The contract for delivery in April fell as much as 0.4
percent to 2,485 ringgit on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange,
erasing gains of as much as 1 percent. Futures rallied 4.9
percent in January, extending a 2.9 percent advance in December.  Palm oil shipments from Malaysia increased 18 percent in
the first 15 days of this month to 673,555 tons from 570,510
tons in the same period in January, Intertek said today. A
separate estimate of 15-day shipments from Societe Generale de
Surveillance is due later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
