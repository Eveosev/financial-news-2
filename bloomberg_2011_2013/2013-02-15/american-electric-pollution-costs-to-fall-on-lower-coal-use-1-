American Electric Power Co. , the
largest U.S. coal consumer, expects to spend $4 billion to $5
billion on pollution controls at its coal-fueled plants through
2020, less than the $6 billion to $8 billion it had estimated in
2011.  Spending needed to comply with Environmental Protection
Agency regulations was lowered by rule changes and  American
Electric ’s plans to reduce its coal consumption as it burns more
natural gas,  Nicholas Akins , chief executive officer of the
Columbus, Ohio-based power company said in a meeting with
analysts today.  American Electric expects its coal plants to generate about
half of its power by decade’s end, down from 65 percent, Akins
said.  The company has modified coal plants to operate efficiently
at lower output when demand drops, or supply increases from
other generation such as gas-fueled plants or wind farms, Akins
said in an interview after the meeting.  Gas-burning plants previously idle or little-used in winter
have been modified to prevent equipment from freezing up, he
said.  Output by existing gas-fueled plants probably peaked last
year, limited by pipeline capacity, Akins said.  Switching between the fuels will continue this year, he
predicted. AEP burns gas when the fuel costs $3.25 per million
British thermal units or less and coal when it costs more, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
