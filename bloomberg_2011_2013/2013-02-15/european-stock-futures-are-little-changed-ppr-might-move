European stocks  were little changed
as companies from PPR SA to Aker Solutions ASA reported earnings
and finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20
nations met in Moscow.  PPR surged to an 11-year high after the French owner of
Gucci reported profit that topped estimates. Aker Solutions
dropped the most since April 2009 as fourth-quarter net income
missed analyst estimates. London Stock Exchange Group Plc
tumbled 4 percent as RBC Capital Markets LLC said LCH.Clearnet
Ltd.’s 2012 results were weak.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  slipped 0.2 percent to 287.34 at
the close of trade in London. The  benchmark measure  has rallied
2.7 percent so far this year after U.S. lawmakers reached a New
Year budget compromise and closed unchanged for the week.  “After reaching the highs we have seen for European and
U.S. markets, it seems that we’re due for a period of digestion
where politics begin to bounce back to the center of
attention,” said  John Plassard , vice president at Mirabaud
Securities LLP in Geneva, which oversees about $28 billion.
“Investors are watching the G-20 meeting in Moscow amid recent
talks of a currency war.”  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600-listed
companies was 23 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Currency War  G-20 finance ministers and central bankers begin talks in
Moscow today with investors seeking clarity on how comfortable
they are with a sliding yen.  Japan is in the spotlight after the yen tumbled about 12
percent in the past three months on the bet that new Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe will pursue a more aggressive monetary
policy. That has led to concern that he’s chasing a cheaper yen,
potentially triggering a currency war with other countries.  A report showed American consumer confidence increased more
than estimated this month. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary February  index  of sentiment rose to 76.3
from 73.8 the prior month. The gauge was projected to rise to
74.8, according to the  median  forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  National benchmark indexes rose in eight of the 18 western-
European markets today. France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.3 percent,
while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was little changed. Germany’s DAX fell
0.5 percent.  PPR, Eni  PPR jumped 7.6 percent to 172 euros, the highest price
since July 2001. The company’s so-called recurring operating
income climbed 19 percent to 1.79 billion euros. The average
estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey called for 1.75
billion euros. The company said it expects its performance to
improve further in 2013.  Eni SpA rose 2.1 percent to 17.69 euros. Italy’s biggest
oil company proposed a 2012 dividend of 1.08 euros a share, up
from 1.04 euros the previous year, even as Eni reported a 3.6
percent decline in fourth-quarter adjusted net income to 1.52
billion euros ($2 billion).  Anglo American Plc gained 1.3 percent to 2,039 pence. Full-
year earnings per share amounted to $2.26, topping the average
analyst projection for $1.92, Ebitda was $8.69 billion, more
than the $7.99 billion analysts had estimated.  Gerresheimer AG  advanced 3.9 percent to 43.17 euros, the
highest price since it sold shares to the public in June 2007,
after CA Cheuvreux and Kepler Capital Markets raised their
recommendations for the stock.  Aker, LSE  Aker Solutions fell 11 percent to 107 kroner. The oil-
services provider controlled by billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke
reported fourth-quarter net income of 504 million kroner ($91
million), missing the average analyst projection that called for
678.6 million kroner.  LSE lost 53 pence to 1,288 pence. The exchange operator
which has agreed to buy as much as 60 percent of LCH.Clearnet
under renegotiated terms, tumbled the most since September after
the clearinghouse posted earnings that RBC called “weak.”  “We are surprised, and not pleasantly,” RBC said, adding
LCH’s underlying revenue grew 2 percent and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined 10
percent last year.  Darty Plc, the owner of France’s biggest consumer-
electronics chain, tumbled 7.5 percent to 46 pence after saying
it is in danger of missing annual profit estimates.  Sales weakened toward the end of the three months through
January, while high levels of promotional activity are harming
profitability, the London-based company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
