Facebook Inc. scored a court victory
in Germany in a dispute with a local data regulator over which
nation’s laws apply to its European operations.  The administrative court for Schleswig-Holstein suspended
enforcement of an order saying Facebook must let users register
under a pseudonym. The order is most likely illegal and
shouldn’t apply while Facebook fights it, the court said on a
 statement  on its website today.  “The regulator wrongfully based its order on German data
protection law,” the judges said. “Irish data protection law
exclusively applies,” because Facebook handles the data in
Ireland.  Facebook has been fighting orders from German regulators,
arguing it’s only subject to Irish law which is generally less
strict then German privacy rules. Facebook Ireland, in Dublin,
is responsible for all the Palo Alto, California-based company’s
users outside the U.S. and Canada.  Thilo Weichert, the state regulator who issued the
pseudonym order, said he will appeal the ruling. German law
clearly backs his order, he said in a  statement  on his website.
Companies shouldn’t be allowed to withdraw to a European member
state with “low data protection standard,” according to his
statement.  European rules say German law doesn’t apply if the data is
processed by a branch in another EU member state, the court
said. Facebook’s German unit only works in marketing and sales
and thus can’t trigger the application of German data protection
law, the judges said.  --. Editors: Heather Smith, Anthony Aarons  To contact the reporter on this story:
