GFI Group Inc.  named Colin Heffron
chief executive officer, replacing Michael Gooch who will remain
the company’s executive chairman of the board.  The company reported a $11.4 million net loss in the fourth
quarter last year, compared with a $22.1 million loss in the
year-earlier period, GFI said yesterday in an earnings
statement. Revenue fell 11.5 percent to $207.3 million from
$234.3 million. GFI arranges trades between banks in fixed-
income, equity and commodity markets.  “Regulatory, market and economic uncertainty combined with
seasonally slow trading resulted in difficult trading conditions
in the fourth quarter,” Gooch said yesterday in the statement.  Heffron joined GFI in 1988 as a foreign currency options
broker, the New York-based company said today in a statement. He
helped the company create its London office and in 2004 was
named president of the company.  The company’s shares rose 0.6 percent to $3.27 as of 11
a.m. in New York. They’ve fallen 28 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
