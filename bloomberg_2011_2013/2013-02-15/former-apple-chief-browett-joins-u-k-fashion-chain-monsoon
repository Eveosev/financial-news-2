John Browett , the former  Apple Inc .
retail business executive who was dismissed after six months,
will become chief executive officer of U.K. fashion retailer
Monsoon Accessorize Ltd.  Browett, 49, will lead the closely held retailer from March
4, according to an e-mailed statement from the London-based
chain. Monsoon, which sells mid-market clothing and home wares,
was established by  Peter Simon  in 1973, while its accessories
brand was started in 1984.  Browett left Apple in October after his moves to reduce
staff, cut hours and limit store transfers were dubbed a mistake
by management and reversed. Prior to that, he was CEO at  Dixons
Retail Plc , the U.K.’s largest consumer-electronics chain, where
he was credited with turning around the retailer’s fortunes by
improving service and adding new store formats. He also spent
several years at  Tesco Plc , the U.K.’s largest grocer,
progressing to chief of its online operations.  Monsoon & Accessorize has 1,053 stores in 74 markets,
including 380 U.K. and Irish outlets, and online operations in
the U.S, Europe and Russia.  Simon founded Monsoon to import hand-printed clothes from
India. The retailer’s stock market listing was canceled in 2007
after he regained full control of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
