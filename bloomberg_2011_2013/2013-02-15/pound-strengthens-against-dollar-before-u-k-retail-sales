The pound strengthened against the
dollar, snapping a two-day decline, before a report that
economists said will show U.K. retail sales rose last month.  Sterling trimmed its weekly drop versus the euro.  Sales 
including fuel climbed 0.5 percent from December, when they fell
0.1 percent, according to the median estimate of 24 analysts in
a Bloomberg News survey. Sterling was poised for a drop of at
least 1.3 percent since Feb. 8 against all 16 of its major peers
after the Bank of England released its quarterly Inflation
Report on two days ago and Governor  Mervyn King  said Britain
faced a muted economic recovery.  “We had weak retail sale numbers in December and the
market is expecting some kind of bounce today,” said  Gavin Friend , a foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank
Ltd. in London. “It’s about whether they surprise versus
consensus. If the numbers disappoint, then the pound will get a
bit of a knock.”  The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.5530 at 9:07 a.m. London
time, after sliding to $1.5475 yesterday, the lowest since July
26. It still headed for a 1.7 percent drop this week, the
biggest decline since the period ended June 1. Sterling
appreciated 0.4 percent to 85.86 pence per euro, paring its
weekly slide to 1.6 percent.  The pound has depreciated 4.5 percent this year, the
second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 0.5 percent and the euro rose 1.7 percent.  Gilts rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year security down
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.16 percent.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 gained 0.295, or
2.95 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.48.  U.K. government bonds handed investors a loss of 2.7
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German bunds dropped 1.6 percent and
Treasuries fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
