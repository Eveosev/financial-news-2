Kazuo Okada failed to persuade a
federal judge to halt a shareholders meeting Wynn Resorts Ltd.
had scheduled for Feb. 22 to vote the Japanese billionaire off
its board of directors.  U.S. District Judge James C. Mahan, at a hearing today in
Las Vegas, tentatively denied Okadaâ€™s request for a preliminary
injunction to prevent the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
