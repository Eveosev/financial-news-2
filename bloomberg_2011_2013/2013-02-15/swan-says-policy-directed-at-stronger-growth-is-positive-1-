Australian Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said
global policy makers have recently been debating developments in
monetary policy, adding he backs measures aimed at bolstering
economic growth.  “What there is is a debate going on about the deployment
of monetary policy across a number of developed economies,”
Swan told reporters today in Moscow where he will be attending a
meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers.
“In so far as that monetary policy is directed towards getting
stronger growth in the domestic economy, that’s a good thing for
the global economy.”  While Swan declined to comment specifically about Japanese
policy, he said steps by the European Central Bank and the
Federal Reserve have “been fundamental to the emerging
confidence, a greater degree of confidence, in the global
economy in the last four or five months.”  Swan said developing countries concerned about spillover
effects from loose monetary policy in the major industrialized
countries can take steps to mitigate the impact.  Asked if G-20 officials will change language in their
communique on currencies, he said the group has always advocated
moving toward market-based exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
