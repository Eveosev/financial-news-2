Eni SpA  said fourth-quarter profit
fell 3.6 percent, missing analysts’ estimates, because of higher
taxes even as the company increased output for the year.  Adjusted net income dropped to 1.52 billion euros ($2.03
billion) from 1.58 billion euros a year earlier, the Rome-based
company said today in a statement. That was below the 1.6
billion-euro average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Output increased 7 percent to 1.701 million barrels a
day in 2012 compared to a year ago on the recovery of Libyan
production.  Eni said it aims to increase production this year thanks to
new projects in Kashagan, Angola, and Algeria. The extra
production will offset financial charges and lower performance
of the company’s natural gas business.  “Management expects continuing weak conditions in the
European gas, refining and marketing of fuels and chemicals
sectors,” the company said today in a statement. “Demand for
energy commodities is anticipated to remain sluggish due to the
economic stagnation.”  Natural gas sales fell 1.5 percnt to 95.3 billion cubic
meters in the year. The company said today it proposed a full
year dividend of 1.08 euros per share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
