Russia, the world’s biggest energy
exporter, will probably increase  duties  on most oil shipments
abroad by 4.3 percent on March 1 to the highest level since May
after Urals crude prices rose.  The standard export duty is set to increase to $420.60 a
metric ton, or about $57.38 a barrel, from $403.30 a ton this
month, according to Bloomberg calculations based on oil price
data from the Finance Ministry. The duty was $448.60 a ton in
May 2012.  The government is reviewing the export duty structure and
may propose changes by the end of next month to stimulate output
and help producers meet President  Vladimir Putin ’s goal of more
than 10 million barrels a day. Production was 10.47 million
barrels a day in January, near a post-Soviet high, according to
preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. Oil
and gas provide about half of Russia’s budget revenue.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades may grow to $211.40 a ton from $198.50 this month.
The levy on extra-heavy crude, set at 10 percent of the standard
duty, would be $42 in March.  Russia bases the export taxes on the average  Urals  blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged about $114.38 a barrel
during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said today by phone. In the previous
monitoring period, it averaged $110.43, according to the
ministry.  Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  must sign off on the levies
before they take effect.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as fuel oil, may increase to $277.60 a ton from
$266.20. A gasoline tax, set at 90 percent of the crude oil duty
since May 2011 to counter domestic shortages, may grow to
$378.60 a ton in March from $363 this month.  The government may lower the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $131.40 a ton from $200.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
