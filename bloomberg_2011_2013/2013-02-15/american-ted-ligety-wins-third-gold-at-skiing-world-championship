Ted Ligety of the U.S. won his third
gold medal at the skiing World Championship by defending his
giant slalom title in Schladming, Austria.  Ligety, the first American and fifth man ever to win three
golds at a championship, outdistanced Austria’s Marcel Hirscher
by 0.81 second and Italy’s Manfred Moelgg by 1.75 seconds over
the two runs.  Ligety won the super-G and super-combined during the
current competition in Austria. France’s Jean-Claude Killy won
four golds in 1968 and Toni Sailer of Austria took four in 1956,
both when the Winter Olympics doubled as the world
championships. At world championships, France’s Emile Allais won
three in 1937, Norway’s Stein Eriksen had three in 1954 and
Sailer had three at 1958.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
