North Dakotaâ€™s Bakken , one of the
shale formations boosting U.S. oil production to a 20-year high,
saw output grow in December after slipping in November for the
first time in 20 months.  Production increased 5 percent to 704,360 barrels a day,
the highest level ever, according to the North Dakota Industrial
Commission.  Output declined 2.2 percent in November from the previous
month after a Nov. 10 blizzard dumped 8 inches (20 centimeters)
of snow on Williston, breaking the previous record for the day
of 2.2 inches.  Increased production out of the Bakken, the Eagle Ford
formation in southern Texas and the Permian Basin in western
Texas helped  U.S. oil output  exceed 7.06 million barrels in the
week ended Feb. 8, the highest level since December 1992.  North Dakota production could grow to as much as 1.2
million barrels a day by 2015,  Ed Morse , head of global
commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said in a
report Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
