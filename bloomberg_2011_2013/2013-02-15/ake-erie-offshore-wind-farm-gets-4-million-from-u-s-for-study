Lake Erie Energy Development Corp.,
a nonprofit group planning an offshore wind farm in the Great
Lakes region, received $4 million from the U.S. Energy
Department to fund initial planning.  Partners in the group, which includes Siemens AG,
 Freshwater Wind LLC , local governments and Case Western Reserve
University, plan to contribute an additional $1 million to the
Icebreaker project, they said today in an e-mailed statement.  Icebreaker, the first planned freshwater offshore wind farm
in the U.S., will have five to nine turbines with 20 megawatts
to 30 megawatts of capacity, about seven miles (11.2 kilometers)
off the coast of Cleveland.  The award was one of seven offshore wind projects that were
awarded Energy Department funds in December, and as many as
three of them will be eligible for additional funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
