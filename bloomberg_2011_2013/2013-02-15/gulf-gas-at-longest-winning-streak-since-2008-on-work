Refining maintenance and turnaround
season in the U.S. Gulf Coast boosted spot gasoline for an
eighth day, its longest winning streak since August 2008.  Plants  in the region processed 7.4 million barrels of crude
and other feedstock in the week ended Feb. 8, 1.2 percent less
than the year-earlier period, Energy Information Administration
data show. Refining dropped for a second week as maintenance was
said to be under way at plants operated by  Phillips 66 , Alon USA
Energy Inc. and  Exxon Mobil Corp.   “Gulf gasoline has been strong as more people realize that
refinery maintenance is a reality,”  Carl Larry , president of
Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston, said today. “We’re
going to be losing over one million barrels a day of production
by March, and February is already half over.”  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  on the Gulf strengthened 4
cents to 2 cents below futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 2:07 p.m., the highest level since Oct. 15.  In addition to refinery maintenance, Phillips 66 yesterday
reported a compressor loss because of an equipment malfunction
at its 247,000-barrel-a-day  Alliance plant  in Louisiana.  Rich Johnson , a company spokesman, declined to comment on day-to-day
operations today in an e-mail.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the  Gulf , a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, advanced $2.2077 to $36.4018 a barrel, while the same
spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil gained $1.0077 to $14.8018
a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
