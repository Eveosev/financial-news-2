Spot gasoline in San Francisco
gained against futures for a second day on speculation that an
unplanned hydrocracker shutdown at  Tesoro Corp .’s Golden Eagle
refinery tightened supplies in the region.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, inventories and
blendstocks in Northern California dropped last week to the
lowest level since Jan. 4, Alison Roberts, a spokeswoman for
the state Energy Commission, said by telephone from Sacramento
today. Stockpiles in Southern California, meanwhile, increased
for the first time in four weeks, she said.  The 170,000-barrel-a-day  Golden Eagle  plant shut a
hydrocracker, which converts heavy hydrocarbons into lighter
fuels such as high-octane gasoline, on Feb. 2 for unplanned
repairs and was bringing the unit back to full rates this week,
a person with direct knowledge of the work said Feb. 12.  San Francisco Carbob strengthened 7.5 cents to a premium of
6.5 cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 4 p.m. East Coast time, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt delivery jumped 9.29 cents to
$3.1995 a gallon, the highest price since Oct. 11.  Tina Barbee , a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s headquarters in San
Antonio, said by e-mail yesterday that the Golden Eagle refinery
had finished planned maintenance. She declined to specify which
units were involved.  The premium for Carbob in  Los Angeles  gained 0.5 cent
against futures to 31.5 cents a gallon. Prompt delivery rose
2.29 cents to $3.4495 a gallon, the highest level since Oct. 9.  BP Plc  said yesterday its  Carson  refinery, the second-
largest in California, plans to flare gases through Feb. 25
related to maintenance that began in early January on a fluid
catalytic cracker and an alkylation unit.  Valero Work  Valero Energy Corp .’s  Wilmington  refinery near Los Angeles
will keep its catalytic cracker and alkylation unit shut for
about another week of repairs, a person familiar with the work
said Feb. 13.  The spread between Los Angeles and San Francisco Carbob
 narrowed  7 cents to 25 cents a gallon, the smallest gap in four
days. San Francisco traded a record 32.5 cents a gallon below
Los Angeles on Jan. 14.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  Los Angeles  rose 0.25
cent against Nymex heating oil futures to an 11-cent-a-gallon
premium. The same fuel in  San Francisco  slipped 0.5 cent versus
futures to a premium of 12 cents a gallon.  In  Portland , Oregon, the premium for low-sulfur diesel
against futures was unchanged at 4.5 cents a gallon.
 Conventional , 84-octane gasoline gained 1 cent versus gasoline
futures to a premium of 3 cents a gallon.  The spread between Portland 84-octane gasoline and Los
Angeles Carbob  narrowed  0.5 cent to 28.5 cents a gallon.
Portland traded at a record 75.5 cents a gallon below Los
Angeles on Oct. 4.  The 3-2-1 refinery crack spread of Alaskan North Slope
crude, Carbob in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles
widened a fourth day, gaining $1.94 to $28.462 a barrel at 4:03
p.m. New York time, the highest level since Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
