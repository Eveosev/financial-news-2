General Motors Co. , the largest U.S.
automaker, said it paid $119 million to  Shanghai Automotive
Industry Corp.  for a 1 percent stake in a joint venture with the
company, taking its overall share of the business to 50 percent.  GM Chief Financial Officer  Dan Ammann  said yesterday,
during a conference call with reporters about the automaker’s
fourth-quarter earnings, that the Chinese government had
approved the deal. The purchase price and the completion of the
deal in September were disclosed today in an annual regulatory
filing.  The joint venture was originally established with 50-50
ownership. GM sold a 1 percent stake to Shanghai Automotive in
February 2010, according to the filing, following the company’s
bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. GM ceded control of the
venture with the sale.  China is the world’s largest automotive market and the
biggest for Detroit-based GM. Chief Executive Officer Dan
Akerson is seeking to increase sales in China by 75 percent by
2015.  GM was little changed at $27.76 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
