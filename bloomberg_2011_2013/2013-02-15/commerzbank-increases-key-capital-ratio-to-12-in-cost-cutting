Commerzbank AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Blessing  gave up his bonus for last year and cut
the payouts by an average 17 percent across the firm, warning of
higher costs and more pressure on revenue.  The pay reductions, which included lowering the investment
banking bonus pool by 20 percent, helped decrease personnel
expenses to 3.96 billion euros ($5.3 billion) from 4.18 billion
euros in 2011, Commerzbank said in an e-mailed statement today
from Frankfurt. The low interest-rate environment and non-core
asset reductions are curbing revenue, it said.  “We have succeeded in strengthening the capital base and
reducing our costs by a significant amount,” said Blessing, 49.
“There is a long way to go.”  Commerzbank, in which the government owns 25 percent after
an 18.2 billion-euro bailout in 2009, is restructuring its
consumer banking unit and cutting as many as 6,000 jobs over the
next four years, as it closes its shipping and real estate
financing arms. The bank was put on review last week for a
possible downgrade by Standard & Poor’s because of concern about
the impact of the restructuring on earnings.  The company said as many as 3,400 jobs may go in consumer
banking and it will probably set aside more funds for risky
loans this year after almost 1.7 billion euros in 2012. There
will be a “slight” increase in total costs after they fell to
7 billion euros in 2012 from 8 billion euros the previous year,
Chief Financial Officer  Stephan Engels  said on a conference call
with analysts.  Shares Climb  Commerzbank climbed as much as 4.8 percent to 1.545 euros
in Frankfurt. The share rose 1.2 percent to 1.491 euros at the
5:30 p.m. close of trading, paring three days of losses and
valuing the firm at 8.7 billion euros. The 38-member  Bloomberg
Europe Banks and Financial Services Index  fell 0.7 percent.  “Investors buying the shares are making a call on the
wider economy,” said  Dirk Becker , an analyst with Kepler
Capital Markets in Frankfurt, who recommends investors purchase
the stock. Today’s news on costs and loan-loss provisions “made
for a complete disaster,” he said.  The government in Berlin is not very disappointed with the
performance of Commerzbank, Blessing said at a news conference.  Blessing’s fixed compensation was 1.3 million euros last
year, he said. The 2012 bonus would have been “a substantial
amount,” he said. Blessing earned 569,000 euros in 2011, when
his salary was capped due to the bailout, including a basic wage
of 500,000 euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Bank AG co-CEO  Anshu Jain  received 5.8 million
euros in 2011, when he was head of the investment banking unit.
The bank hasn’t published his wage for 2012.  Capital Ratio  The bank’s core Tier 1 capital ratio under current Basel
rules increased to 12 percent in December from 9.9 percent in
2011. The ratio according to more stringent Basel III capital
rules was 7.6 percent, it said.  “Their fully-loaded Basel III ratio was rather
disappointing as a series of European banks have been able to
exceed capital targets,” Rehn said.  The bank revised its fourth-quarter loss to 716 million
euros compared with the 720 million euros it reported last week
in a preliminary earnings statement. It posted a profit of 316
million euros a year previously.  Commerzbank said it expects 500 million euros in charges in
the first quarter related to job reductions.  Non-Core Assets  The firm’s non-core assets unit, where it bundles public
and commercial real estate and ship financing, had a loss of 447
million euros, more than the 385 million-euro median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts. The unit accounted for 151
billion euros in assets weighted by their risk, it said. The
company will reduce “non-core assets” by more than 40 percent
by 2016, Blessing said in November.  “We expect 2013 to be rather weak with the risk of
additional losses for negative surprises in non-core business,”
 Christoph Bast , analyst at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt, said in an
e-mailed report to clients today.  Operating profit at the corporate clients unit, known as
the Mittelstandsbank, rose to 376 million euros from 271 million
euros a year earlier. Earnings at the unit, the biggest
contributor to Commerzbank’s profit, compared with a median
estimate of 345 million euros of seven analysts.  The “strong state of the German economy” led to a
decrease in loan-loss provisions and contributed to the increase
in net income for corporate banking, the bank said.  Operating profit at Commerzbank’s private clients unit
slumped to 30 million euros from 109 million euros as interest
and commission income and customer activity declined. That
compared with a median analyst estimate of 19 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
