The premiers of Croatia and Slovenia
will meet next month to finalize an accord on a 270 million-euro
($360 million) bank dispute that will clear the last hurdle for
Croatia’s entry into the European Union.  Janez Jansa  and his Croatian counterpart  Zoran Milanovic 
will meet March 10, Slovenia’s Cabinet said in an e-mailed
 statement  today. Jansa named Tone Kajzer, a junior minister, to
prepare details of an agreement. The two sides last met on Feb.
6 to resolve the dispute dating back to the split-up of Yugoslav
bank assets. Croatia wants to join the EU in July.  The meeting will focus on solving the issue of deposits,
“as well as on advantages and opportunities that the upcoming
membership of Croatia will bring to economic cooperation,”
according to the statement. “With the naming of Mr. Kajzer, we
will ensure uninterrupted continuity and a needed credibility in
seeking a solution.”  Slovenia and Croatia have been haggling for years over
claims of former deposits owed to Croatian savers by the
Yugoslav predecessor of Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. The
government of Slovenia, an EU member that controls NLB, has
threatened to veto Croatia’s accession to the bloc if the claims
are not withdrawn.  Leaders of Slovenian political parties met President  Borut Pahor  in Ljubljana yesterday and pledged to pave the way for the
ratification of Croatia’s EU entry. Economists, including  Tim Ash  from Standard Bank Plc in London, have said Slovenia’s
deepening political crisis may cause a delay its southern
neighbor’s membership in the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
