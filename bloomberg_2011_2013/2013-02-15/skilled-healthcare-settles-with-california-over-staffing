Skilled Healthcare Group Inc .
reached a settlement with the state of California over staffing
levels and the quality of care at its nursing homes.  California Attorney General  Kamala Harris  said the
agreement will require Skilled Healthcare to make improvements
to its 20 facilities, and that the changes will be monitored and
enforced by a court if necessary, according to an e-mailed
statement.  The agreement stems from a case “ about neglect and abuse
of California’s elders,” Harris said in the statement. “This
agreement ensures that the elderly occupying Skilled’s 2,360
beds will receive better and higher quality care” at a time
when California’s elderly population is growing twice as fast as
the general population, Harris said in the statement.  An independent monitor will make surprise inspections of
nursing homes for two years at a cost of about $350,000 annually
to be paid by Skilled Healthcare, according to the statement.  The settlement stems from 76 citations and 209 deficiencies
issued by the California Department of Public Health to
Skilled’s nursing facilities from 2008 to 2012, including a
failure to prevent pressure ulcers, dehydration, malnutrition,
over-medication and medication errors, deficient catheter care,
urinary incontinence, and naso-gastric feeding care practices,
according to the statement.  Skilled Healthcare and its units operate nursing homes in
California counties of Fresno, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside,
and Santa Barbara, according the statement.  Melody Chattal, a spokeswoman for Skilled Healthcare,
didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
