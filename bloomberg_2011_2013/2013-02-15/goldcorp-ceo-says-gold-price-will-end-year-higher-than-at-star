 Goldcorp Inc. Chief Executive
Officer  Chuck Jeannes  said gold will end 2013 at a higher price
than where it was at the start of the year.  “I do definitely believe that the macroeconomic factors
that have supported the move in the gold price in the last 10
years are even more in place today than they have been,” he
said today in a telephone interview. “I expect the bull market
for gold to continue.”  Jeannes said he believes the price will rise to $2,000 an
ounce at some point. Gold futures in New York dropped below
$1,600 today for the first time since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
