Spending cuts included in  budget
plans  Spain sent to the European Commission last year won’t be
made in time to reduce the  deficit  in 2013 as a public-sector
overhaul meant to be implemented in 2012 runs late.  Spain’s Cabinet examined a second draft plan of the law on
the rationalization and sustainability of local administration
today, Deputy Prime Minister  Soraya Saenz de Santamaria  said in
Madrid. The law was to have been approved in the last quarter to
generate 3.5 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in savings this year.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  wants euro finance ministers
to relax Spain’s budget goals as it fails to tackle the second-
largest shortfall in the region amid a sixth year of an  economic
slump . The European Commission will make recommendations in May
after it updates growth forecasts next week.  The public-sector revamp will generate 7.13 billion euros
of savings over three years, Budget Minister  Cristobal Montoro 
told reporters. He didn’t provide a per-year breakdown. The
plan, which must be sent to the highest administrative body
before approval by the Cabinet and parliament, will redefine how
power is shared between regions and town halls, he said.  “This way we’ll obtain more savings as well as more
voluntary participation in politics without compensation,”
Montoro said. A modified version of the text introduces a one-
year transition period before regions’ and town halls’ powers
are redistributed and cuts local politicians’ pay rather than
reducing their number, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
