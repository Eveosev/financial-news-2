AAA Auto Group NV  tumbled the most
in 18 months after the chain of used-car dealerships in central
Europe announced plans to delist its shares.  The stock slumped as much as 31 percent, its biggest
intraday retreat since August 2011, and traded down 17 percent
to 20.50 koruna by 10:11 a.m. in Prague. Turnover at more than
183,000 shares so far today compares with 275,133 for the whole
of January, the bourse’s data compiled by Bloomberg show.  AAA Auto, the smallest member of the 13-strong  PX  index
with a 0.1 percent weighting, proposed to remove all of its 67.8
million shares from trading in Prague and Budapest in an
invitation to an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on March 29
published on the company’s website late yesterday. Founder and
former Chief Executive Officer  Anthony Denny , who owns about 77
percent of the shares, said six months ago he plans to sell his
stake. The stock surged 41 percent last year.  “The withdrawal of shares from trading limits the ability
of shareholders to realize the value of their shares,” analysts
led by  Milan Vanicek  at J&T Banka AS in Prague wrote in a report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
