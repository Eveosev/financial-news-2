Katusha, whose rider Joaqium
Rodriguez finished second in last year’s Giro d’Italia, will be
able to compete in the Tour de France and other top races after
sport’s highest court overruled a decision by cycling’s
governing body.  The Russian team’s appeal of a decision by the
International Cycling Union, or UCI, was overruled by a three-
person panel from the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the
team will be given a license for the elite 2013 season, the
court said today in an e-mailed statement.  UCI refused the team an elite license in December after a
probe by an auditor, giving it a second-tier license that would
have limited Katusha to lower-profile races. A CAS hearing was
held Feb. 8, and the panel decided to overturn the UCI position.
It didn’t immediately release its reasoning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
