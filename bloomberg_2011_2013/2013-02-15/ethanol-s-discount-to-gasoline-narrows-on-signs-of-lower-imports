Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on speculation that a second weekly decline in the
biofuel will make it more competitive with Brazilian products
and reduce imports.  The spread narrowed 0.61 cent to 78.15 cents a gallon,
based on settlement prices.  “We’re competitive with Brazil right now,” said  Mike Blackford , a consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines, Iowa.
“We’re getting a little bit of a bounce right here. We beat it
up pretty good.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery rose 2.4 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.353 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
rebounding from the lowest level since Jan. 17. Prices have
risen 7.4 percent this year.  Gasoline for March delivery rose 1.79 cents to $3.1345 a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is blended with ethanol.  Imports  in the week ended Feb. 8 averaged 11,000 barrels a
day, down 84 percent from 2013’s high of 67,000 in the week
ended Jan. 18, according to data from the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical agency.  Brazil is the largest supplier of ethanol to the U.S. The
country uses sugarcane to make the fuel and a U.S. biofuels
mandate weighs that nation’s variety of ethanol as superior to
the domestic grade made from corn.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.29 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, 2.3 percent cheaper
than futures in Chicago.  Brazilian Ethanol  That compares with the week ended Feb. 1, in which
Brazilian ethanol was $2.21 a gallon, or 10 percent cheaper than
the $2.469 a gallon futures price.  Corn for March delivery climbed 4 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$6.9875 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, is minus 19 cents today,
down from minus 20 cents yesterday.  Production  slumped 18 percent to 789,000 barrels a day in
the week ended Feb. 8 from a record 963,000 barrels a day in
December 2011, according to EIA data.  Ethanol is down 14 percent from the 2012 high of $2.725 and
the price decline may help make the fuel more attractive for
export to countries like Canada and Mexico, Blackford said.  Falling Exports  Exports of the fuel in November, the most recent month for
which EIA data is available, totaled 965,000 barrels, the
smallest amount since November 2010.  Demand is capped in the U.S. as production capacity exceeds
the amount with which it is currently mixed into gasoline, a
phenomenon known as the blend wall, Blackford said.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted
approval for filling stations to sell gasoline that includes as
much as 15 percent ethanol from 10 percent previously for
vehicles made after 2001.  Eleven retailers, concentrated in the corn-rich and
ethanol-heavy Midwest, are currently selling the fuel, according
to the Renewable Fuels Association.  “We’re at the blend wall,” Blackford said. “The only
thing the lower price might encourage is from an export
standpoint.”  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, little changed from the previous
week, according to EIA.  Spot Trading  In cash market trading, ethanol fell in the regional
trading hubs, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in New York sank 6 cents to $2.43 a gallon; 4.5
cents to $2.335 in Chicago; 3 cents to $2.40 in the U.S. Gulf;
and 3 cents to $2.52 a gallon on the West Coast, the nation’s
highest price.  New York Harbor ethanol’s premium to Chicago narrowed to
9.5 cents, the tightest level since Feb. 4, while the Gulf
Coast’s discount to the West Coast held steady at 12 cents, up
from 14 cents Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
