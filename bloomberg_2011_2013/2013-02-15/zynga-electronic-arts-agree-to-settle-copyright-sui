Electronic Arts Inc.  and  Zynga Inc.  agreed to settle claims in a lawsuit alleging Zynga’s “The Ville” game copied “The Sims Social,” an EA game that runs on  Facebook Inc.’s social network.   “EA and Zynga have resolved their respective claims and have reached a settlement of their litigation in the Northern District of California,” Zinga spokeswoman Kelly Kunz and  John Reseburg , an EA spokesman, said in separate e-mailed statements.  Electronic Arts, the second-biggest U.S. video-game publisher, filed suit in San Francisco in August, claiming Electronic Arts said in its complaint that senior executives who left for Zynga had details about “The Sims Social” strategy and development.  Zynga, the biggest developer of games played on Facebook, had countersued, seeking to bar Electronic Arts from threatening litigation or interfering with its hiring. It called the copyright claims meritless and said Electronic Arts’ suit breached the terms of an earlier settlement.  The settlement was first disclosed in a court filing in the lawsuit. Neither company would provide details of the accord.  The case is Electronic Arts v. Zynga, 12-4099, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).
