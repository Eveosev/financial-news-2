Banco Santander Brasil SA , the
Brazilian Unit of Spain’s biggest lender, jumped the most in
five weeks after Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  signaled that
policy makers can increase interest rates to fight inflation.  Shares rose 2.8 percent to 14.56 reais at 12:25 p.m. in Sao
Paulo after earlier gaining as much as 3.5 percent in the
steepest intraday advance since Jan. 10. The  MSCI
Brazil/Financials Index  rose 1.2 percent, the most among 10
industry groups on bets that higher benchmark rates will allow
lenders to increase the rates they charge customers.  Mantega said that Brazil will do what it takes to fight
inflation, adding that interest-rate increases are an option to
rein in consumer prices. Swap rates, a gauge for rate
expectations, jumped, with contracts due January 2014 rising the
most since Dec. 7.  “The interest rate isn’t fixed. If you have more worrying
inflation, it can move, but this is up to the central bank to
decide,” Mantega said in an interview from Moscow today. “The
government will do what it takes to keep inflation under
control.”  Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Latin America’s biggest bank by
market value, rose 1.6 percent to 34.17 reais.  Banco Bradesco SA 
advanced 1.7 percent to 35.42 reais. State-controlled  Banco do
Brasil SA  added 1 percent to 24.04 reais.  Brazil’s central bank board, led by  Alexandre Tombini , kept
the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 7.25 percent for a
second straight meeting on Jan. 16.  Consumer prices in the country will rise 5.71 percent this
year, according to the median estimate in a weekly central bank
survey of about 100 economists published on Feb. 13, up from
5.68 percent the previous week. That was the sixth weekly
increase to the estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
