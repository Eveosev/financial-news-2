Dow Chemical Co. , the largest U.S.
chemical maker by sales, said its board approved a program to
buy back as much as $1.5 billion of shares.  “Our three priorities for uses of cash will remain
consistent: further deleveraging, returning value to our
shareholders and investing for attractive, high-margin organic
growth in our downstream businesses,” Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Andrew Liveris  said today in a statement.  Dow is awaiting payment of $2.16 billion in damages from
Kuwait’s Petrochemical Industries Co. for canceling a 2008
agreement to buy a stake in Dow’s plastics business. A final
award, increasing the payment to $2.5 billion with interest and
costs, should be released in February, Dow said Jan. 31. The
cash will be used to improve the balance sheet, it said at the
time.  Dow dropped 1 percent to $32.16 in New York. The Midland,
Michigan-based company has risen 0.5 percent this year while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has climbed 6.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
