India’s rupee headed for the biggest
weekly loss of 2013 as provisional data showed the trade deficit
widened last month.  Merchandise shipments climbed 0.8 percent from a year
earlier and imports advanced 6.1 percent, leaving a trade gap of
$20 billion, Director General of Foreign Trade Anup Pujari said
Feb. 13. Central bank Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said Feb. 11 the
current-account shortfall in the year through March may be
“significantly higher” than a record 4.2 percent of gross
domestic product in the previous 12 months. A continued rise in
the deficit will be negative for the nation’s credit profile,
according to Moody’s Investors Service, New York-based analyst
Atsi Sheth said in a statement yesterday.  “The pressure on the rupee is going to continue until the
monthly trade deficit drops to about $15 billion or $16
billion,” said  Samiran Chakraborty , an economist at Standard
Chartered Plc in Mumbai.  The rupee declined 0.8 percent this week to 53.92 per
dollar as of 9:51 a.m. in Mumbai, the biggest drop since the
five days through Dec. 21, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency, which was little changed from yesterday,
touched 54.1075 on Feb. 12, the lowest level since Jan. 18.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, fell 30 basis points,
or 0.30 percentage point, to 9.05 percent this week. The rate
dropped four basis points today.  Wholesale prices  rose 6.62 percent last month from a year
earlier, official data showed yesterday, compared with 7.18
percent in December and 6.98 percent predicted in a Bloomberg
survey. Industrial production fell 0.6 percent in December after
a revised 0.8 percent drop the previous month, a government
report showed Feb. 11.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.94 per
dollar, compared with 54.92 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.83 versus 54.76. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
