Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which
supplies 95 percent of South Africa’s power, said work at its
Medupi plant remains suspended, heading for a one-month stoppage
because of labor unrest.  Building work at the plant in Limpopo province stopped on
Jan. 16 when Eskom, South Africa’s main power utility, sent home
13,000 workers after protests involving members of the National
Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and employed by Hitachi
Kaefer and a unit of Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd.  “The labor unrest and violent behavior are a material risk
to delivery” of the project, Hilary Joffe, a spokeswoman for
Eskom, said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The project
is on a tight schedule to deliver first power to the grid by the
end of 2013.”  Africa’s biggest economy is expanding its electricity-
generation base to avoid a repeat of power shortages that halted
mines for at least five days in January 2008. Medupi, which is
due to start producing electricity at the end of the year, will
be the world’s fourth-biggest coal-fired plant.  “We have not revised our timelines,” Joffe said.  Medupi will produce about 4,800 megawatts of electricity
once completed. Capital expenditure for the plant was estimated
at 91.2 billion rand ($10.1 billion), excluding capitalized
borrowing costs, in Eskom’s annual report for the year through
March 2012. The utility is seeking a 16 percent increase in
average electricity prices each year until 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
