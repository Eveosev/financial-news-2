 Kenya’s shilling strengthened for a
third day, giving the currency its biggest weekly gain in more
than four months, as the central bank removed the largest amount
of money from the market in more than a week.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
less than 0.1 percent to close at 87.28 per dollar, pushing the
weekly rally to 0.4 percent, the most since the five days ended
Oct 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted all 8.7 billion
shillings ($99 million) of bids for seven-day repurchase
agreements, according to a central bank official, who asked not
to be identified in line with policy, the most since Feb. 6. The
bank, which uses the repos to reduce money supply and support
the shilling, has absorbed 127 billion shillings from the market
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The local unit’s gains against the dollar have been helped
by the central bank “mopping up liquidity,”  Bernard Matimu ,
chief dealer at Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd. said in a note to
clients.  Uganda’s currency closed unchanged at 2,640 per dollar,
while the Tanzanian shilling was unchanged at 1,617 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
