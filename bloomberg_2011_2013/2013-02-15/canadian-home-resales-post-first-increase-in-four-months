Canadian existing home sales rose
for the first time in four months in January on gains in Toronto
and Vancouver, a realtor group said.  Sales rose 1.3 percent to 35,878 units from December, the
Canadian Real Estate Association said in a statement from Ottawa
today. Toronto sales gained 5.6 percent to 7,011 units and in
Vancouver they increased 4.7 percent to 1,998 homes.  The economy is at risk from a long period of rising
consumer debt and low interest rates even with recent signs
housing has moderated, Bank of Canada Deputy Governor  Timothy Lane  said in a Feb. 11 speech. The central bank kept its key
rate at 1 percent last month, where it’s been since September
2010, and said the case for an increase is “less imminent” as
it forecast housing would weigh on economic growth through 2014.  Sales fell 5.2 percent in January from a year earlier and
the average price rose 2 percent to C$354,754 ($352,358),
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
