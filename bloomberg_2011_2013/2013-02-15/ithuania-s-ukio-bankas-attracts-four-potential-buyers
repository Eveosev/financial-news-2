Four banks in Lithuania are
interested in acquiring the assets of  Ukio Bankas AB , which was
the nation’s sixth-largest lender by assets until its operations
were suspended this week, the central bank said.  Siauliu Bankas AB  is already negotiating with Ukio’s
temporary administrator and three more lenders are seeking to
start talks, the Bank of Lithuania in the capital Vilnius said
in an e-mailed statement today. It didn’t name the other
institutions.  The central bank suspended Ukio’s operations on Feb. 12 and
said the lender was insolvent after risky lending to related
companies. The Bank of Lithuania said yesterday it was seeking
to avoid the bankruptcy of Ukio to limit the potential impact on
public finances.  The potential bidders for Ukio’s assets are the local units
of Scandinavian banks  SEB AB  and  DNB ASA , and the Finasta
investment banking unit of defunct  Snoras Bankas AB , which the
Lithuanian government took over in 2011, Baltic News Service
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  “The Bank of Lithuania wants to determine the prospects
for Ukio Bankas’s operations with great rapidity,” the central
bank said in its statement. “The temporary administrator must,
no later than Feb. 18, offer conclusions and proposals regarding
whether and how the bank’s activities can be renewed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
