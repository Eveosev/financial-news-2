Roger Goodell ’s pay more than
doubled to about $29.5 million in 2011 after the National
Football League commissioner led the most popular U.S. sports
league to decade-long contracts with players and broadcasters.  Goodell, 53, made most of his compensation through a $22.3
million bonus, on top of a base salary of about $3.1 million,
according to tax documents filed with the Internal Revenue
Service. He was paid a total of about $11.6 million in 2010.  “The NFL is the most successful and best-managed sports
league in the world,” Atlanta Falcons owner and NFL
Compensation Committee Chairman Arthur Blank said yesterday in a
news release. “This is in no small part due to Roger’s
leadership and the value he brings to the table in every facet
of the sport and business of the league. His compensation
reflects that.”  The NFL, which said in its filing that it had 1,546
employees in 2011, has annual revenue of about $9 billion.
Goodell’s compensation for 2011 was equal to about 24 percent of
the NFL’s ceiling on each team’s payroll.  Goodell helped the NFL reach a 10-year labor agreement with
players in July 2011, ending a four-month lockout in time to
avoid missing regular-season games.  The NFL that year also signed nine-year contract extensions
with  CBS Corp ., News Corp’s Fox unit and Comcast Corp.’s NBC
that will generate about 60 percent more television revenue
through 2022.  ESPN also extended its agreement with the NFL in 2011 for
eight years, giving the  Walt Disney Co . unit “Monday Night
Football” through the 2021 season in a deal valued at $1.9
billion, or about 73 percent more than the network had been
paying, according to the New York Times.  Goodell signed a five-year contract extension in 2009. He
joined the NFL in 1982 as an intern and rose to chief operating
officer in 2001. He became commissioner when  Paul Tagliabue 
retired in August 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
