Electricity for delivery on Saturday
in Poland rose from last week amid unplanned power-plant
outages.  Electricity  for tomorrow advanced 0.2 percent from a week
ago to 165.58 zloty ($52.85) a megawatt-hour, exchange data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the highest price for
Saturday delivery since Jan. 26.  PGE SA , Poland’s largest utility, delayed the start of a
380-megawatt unit at its Belchatow power plant to 6 p.m.
tomorrow. A 222-megawatt unit at the Dolna Odra plant will halt
tomorrow for five days.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia fell 6.3 percent to 38.97 euros ($52.02) a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
market operators.  Hungarian day-ahead power  settled 6 percent
lower, at 39.62 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
