Serena Williams  came back from a 4-1
third-set deficit to beat  Petra Kvitova  and reach the semifinals
of the Qatar Open, ensuring that she’ll become the oldest player
to hold the No. 1 ranking in women’s tennis.  The 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory in Doha means Williams, currently
ranked No. 2 behind  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus on the WTA
tour, will take the top spot for the 124th week in her career on
Feb. 18.  At 31, she’s older than  Chris Evert  was (30) when Evert
topped the WTA rankings in 1985. Williams last led the rankings
for 49 weeks from Nov. 2, 2009, to Oct. 10, 2010.  After winning 58 of her previous 61 matches, Williams
dropped the first set and trailed Kvitova, the No. 7 seed from
the Czech Republic, by a service break in the third. The
American fought back to advance to tomorrow’s semifinal against
No. 3 seed  Maria Sharapova  of Russia, who beat Australia’s
 Samantha Stosur  6-2, 6-4.  Williams has led the WTA Tour rankings longer than all but
six others:  Steffi Graf  (377 weeks),  Martina Navratilova  (322),
Evert (260),  Martina Hingis  (209) and  Monica Seles  (178).  To contact the reporter on this story:
