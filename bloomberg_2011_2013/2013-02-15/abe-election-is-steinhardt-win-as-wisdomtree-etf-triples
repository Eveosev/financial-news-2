Shinzo Abe’s election as prime
minister of Japan is creating a windfall for  Michael Steinhardt ,
the former hedge-fund manager turned exchange-traded fund
executive.  WisdomTree Investments Inc. , the firm where Steinhardt is
both chairman and the largest shareholder, has seen assets in
its  Japan Hedged Equity Fund  triple to $3.67 billion since the
start of 2013 as Abe’s pledge to revive the economy sent
investors searching for a way to benefit from the country’s
stock-market rally while avoiding the currency’s decline. The
fund took in more money than all but one U.S. ETF this year,
helping to drive a 48 percent rally in WisdomTree’s stock.  “When the stars align, funds like this can take off,”  Ugo Egbunike , an ETF specialist at IndexUniverse LLC, said in a
telephone interview.  Assets swelled as money managers including  Jeffrey Gundlach 
of DoubleLine Capital LP said Japanese stocks are set to rise as
the country takes steps to weaken its currency, which helps
exporters such as  Toyota Motor Corp.  by boosting the value of
overseas sales. Japanese stocks have  rallied  18 percent and the
yen has slumped 12 percent against the dollar since Nov. 30,
shortly before Abe won election in December pledging to take an
aggressive approach to ending deflation and reviving the
economy.  Short-Term Trades  The rapid growth of the fund highlights investors’ embrace
of ETFs as vehicles for short-term trades in a way traditional
mutual funds, with their higher fees and trading restrictions,
haven’t been used. Investors poured a record $188 billion into
U.S. ETFs in 2012, according to San Francisco-based
IndexUniverse. ETFs, which hold $1.4 trillion in assets,
generally track indexes and trade throughout the day like
stocks.  WisdomTree gained 1.5 percent to close at $9.06 in New York
time.  WisdomTree created its Japan fund when it entered the ETF
business in 2006. It changed the fund in 2010 to neutralize the
impact of currency swings, after research director  Jeremy Schwartz  noticed that the Japanese currency and stock market
often moved in opposite directions.  “We thought one day the yen would weaken and stocks,
especially the big exporters, would benefit,” Schwartz said
this week in a telephone interview. WisdomTree tweaked the
product again in November by putting more emphasis on global
companies rather than those that rely heavily on the domestic
economy. Like most of WisdomTree’s products, the Japan ETF
focuses on dividend-paying stocks.  Gundlach’s Conviction  Gundlach, whose $38.7 billion DoubleLine Total Return Fund
beat 96 percent of peers over the past year, said in a Dec. 18
interview with Bloomberg Television that his “most high-
conviction investment idea” was that the yen would weaken while
Japan’s stock market would improve.  Gundlach said currency “debasement” was the only policy
tool left in Japan, where the economy is expected to grow 0.9
percent this year, the average prediction of 59 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The Japanese economy unexpectedly shrank an
annualized 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter as falling exports
and a business investment slump outweighed improved consumption,
a report showed yesterday.  George Soros  made almost $1 billion since November from
bets that the yen would tumble, and is also wagering on an
increase in Japanese stocks, a person close to the billionaire’s
$24 billion family office said this week.  Soros’s Bet  Soros, known for netting $1 billion in 1992 by betting
against the British pound, has 10 percent of the money managed
internally by his $24 billion Soros Fund Management LLC in
Japanese stocks, said the person close to his firm, asking not
to be named because the information is private.  WisdomTree’s ETF gained 20 percent since Nov. 30, compared
with 6.3 percent for the $5.6 billion  iShares MSCI Japan Index
Fund , which tracks Japanese stocks without hedging the currency.  Investors have noticed the difference. Since the end of
November, the WisdomTree ETF received $2.76 billion in deposits
and the iShares fund, run by BlackRock Inc., got $1.23 billion,
according to IndexUniverse. In 2013, another BlackRock fund, the
$52.2 billion IShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index, attracted
$3.43 billion, the most among U.S. ETFs, and WisdomTree’s Japan
fund pulled in $2.26 billion.  ETF ‘Migration’  WisdomTree Investments , based in New York, was founded in
1985 by the current chief executive officer,  Jonathan Steinberg .
In 2004 the company signed up  Jeremy Siegel , professor of
finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, as
senior investment strategy adviser, and raised money from
investors including Steinhardt, whose hedge fund Steinhardt
Management Co. produced returns averaging 24 percent a year for
28 years until it was wound down in 1995.  Steinhardt owns 15 percent of WisdomTree, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. WisdomTree is the second-best performer
this year in the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, behind real estate
research firm Zillow Inc.  “We are seeing a migration to ETFs,”  Macrae Sykes , an
analyst from Gabelli & Co., said in an interview last week.
Sykes raised his recommendation on the stock to buy from hold in
November.  WisdomTree offers 47 of the funds across a range of asset
classes. The firm managed $18.3 billion at year-end, about 3
percent of the ETF assets run by the largest U.S. provider,
BlackRock, which is also based in New York. WisdomTree attracted
$4.7 billion from investors in 2012, the company reported
earlier this month.  Popular Trade  Because the money flowing into WisdomTree’s  Japan fund  is
the result of a popular trade, it could disappear if sentiment
changes, said  Patricia Oey , an analyst at Chicago-based
Morningstar Inc.  “If the yen strengthened, money could come out pretty
quickly,” she said in a telephone interview.  WisdomTree lost 37 percent of its market value between the
end of August 2011 and early October that year, when one
institutional investor pulled money, contributing to a 5.9
percent decline in the firm’s assets.  WisdomTree’s Schwartz isn’t worried about redemptions yet.  “The Japanese market moved in one direction for a long
time,” he said. “This new trend could last a considerable
period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
