Japanese shares  fell, with the  Topix
Index  halting a 13-week winning streak, amid disappointing
earnings and on concern Group-of-20 leaders will pressure Japan
to curb its currency depreciation. The yen strengthened a fourth
day and yields on government bonds fell.  Toyota Motor Corp. paced declines among exporters, sliding
1.9 percent. Trend Micro Inc. tumbled 6.1 percent after the
anti-virus software maker’s net income fell 23 percent.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest lender,
slid 2.9 percent. Tokyo Electric Power Co. led gains among
utilities on a report Japan plans 1 trillion yen ($10.7 billion)
in loan guarantees for lower-cost energy supplies.  The Topix lost 1.3 percent to 942.41 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, closing 1.6 percent lower this week and
halting its longest weekly win streak since 1973. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average lost 1.2 percent to 11,173.83.18, gaining 0.2
percent on the week.  “If the G-20 countries start increasing their criticism
about how Japan is weakening the yen, then it means they’re
rebuking the country’s monetary easing policies,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments
Ltd., which manages the equivalent of about 6 trillion yen ($65
billion). “That’s going to not only be negative for exporters
but also reflationary stocks like banks. That’s the biggest
negative impact on stocks today.”  The  Topix  has surged more than 30 percent since elections
were announced on Nov. 14 on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
and the central bank will act to stimulate the economy and lead
the country out of deflation. The measure is trading at 1.1
times book value, compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Currency Concern  The yen rose to as much as 92.25 to the dollar today after
weakening against all 16 of its major peers this year. A
stronger Japanese currency cuts the overseas earnings outlook
for exporters.  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said his country
wanted more “specific” language opposing exchange-rate
interference in a communique to be issued after a G-20 meeting
starting today in Moscow. The country’s Deputy Finance Minister
Sergei Storchak said they won’t make a separate statement about
Japan. The yen’s recent sharp decline has stoked concerns of a
currency war.  Yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds fell 1.5  basis
points to 0.75 percent as stocks declined.  Exporters slid. Toyota dropped 1.9 percent to 4,725 yen.
 Honda Motor Co. , which gets over 80 percent of its sales outside
of Japan, slid 1.6 percent to 3,455 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest camera maker, declined 1.5 percent to 3,265 yen.  Banks Slump  Banks were the biggest drag among the Topix’s  33 industry
groups . Mitsubishi UFJ slumped 2.9 percent to 508 yen. Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. had
their investment ratings lowered at UBS AG, which said their
recent gains were an overreaction to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
plans for easing. Sumitomo Mitsui dropped 3.2 percent to 3,640
yen, while Mizuho tumbled 5.8 percent to 196 yen.  Trend Micro slumped 6.1 percent to 2,581 yen, its biggest
drop since August. The software designer reported net income of
13.4 billion yen for the year ended Dec. 31, a 23 percent
decline from a year earlier.  Kirin Holdings Co. slumped 4.9 percent to 1,171 yen after
the beverage maker forecast operating profit of 155 billion yen
this year, less than a third of its five-year average. The
company said net income will probably rise 60 percent to a
record this year after booking a gain from selling a stake in
Fraser & Neave Ltd.  Power Producers Climb  Utilities were the only group to advance among the Topix’s
industry sub-indexes on the Topix. Tokyo Electric Power jumped
4.4 percent to 192 yen, the second-biggest gainer on the Nikkei
225. Kansai Electric Power Co. advanced 3.6 percent and Chubu
Electric Power Co. rose 3 percent.  The Japanese government will guarantee 1 trillion yen in
loans for lower cost energy supplies, with shale gas projects
including those run by Chubu Electric to be the first
beneficiary, the Nikkei newspaper reported today.  Futures on the S&P 500 slid 0.2 percent. The gauge
yesterday climbed 0.1 percent to a five-year high as a drop in
jobless claims and Warren Buffett’s $23 billion purchase of H.J.
Heinz Co. outweighed concern over shrinking economies in Europe
and Japan.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index  gained 4.9
percent to 26.83, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.7
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on
the measure was about 34 percent higher than its 30-day average
at the close of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
