Rubber futures slid the most in
three months and headed for the worst weekly performance since
November as Japan’s currency recovered against the dollar and
reduced the appeal of the yen-denominated contracts.  The contract for delivery in July fell as much as 3.1
percent to 320.7 yen a kilogram ($3,458 a metric ton) before
trading at 322.8 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 11:53
a.m. The largest drop since Nov. 5 extended losses for the most-
active contract to 2.2 percent this week, the worst since the
week through Nov. 9.  The yen traded at 92.75 per dollar, rebounding from an
almost three-year low of 94.46 reached on Feb. 11. Exchange
rates top the agenda for the finance ministers and central
bankers of the Group of 20 nations as they begin two days of
talks today. Policy makers from Canada to Germany have
questioned how central the currency is to Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s attempt to end deflation.  “Speculation grew that the G-20 meeting may express
concerns about the weak yen, spurring sales of futures in
Tokyo,” Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co.,
said by phone today.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange is closed this week for Lunar
New Year. Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.6 percent to 97.70
baht ($3.28) a kilogram yesterday, according to the country’s
Rubber Research Institute.  Thailand has spent 22 billion baht buying 198,000 tons from
farmers above market rates to boost local prices, Yuttapong
Charasathien, deputy farm minister, said yesterday. The National
Rubber Policy Committee approved spending a further 5 billion
baht and has no immediate plan to sell stockpiles, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
