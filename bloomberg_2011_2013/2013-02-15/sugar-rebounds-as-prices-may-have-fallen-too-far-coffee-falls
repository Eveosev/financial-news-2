Cocoa futures fell to the lowest in
seven months, entering a bear market, on signs of abundant
supplies from Ivory Coast, the world’s top producer. Coffee,
orange juice and sugar also dropped, while cotton rose.  Cocoa exports from the western Ivorian port of San Pedro
climbed 54 percent in January from a year earlier, harbor data
showed. On Feb. 13,  inventory  at warehouses monitored by the ICE
Futures U.S. jumped 4.6 percent, the most in a year, the latest
figures showed. Prices are down 20 percent from a 10-month high
reached in September, marking the start of a bear market.  “Bulls have been discouraged by the ample supply in Ivory
coast,”  Hector Galvan , a senior commodities broker at Chicago-
based RJO Futures said in an e-mail. “There are still ideas
that more cocoa needs to be sold.”  Cocoa futures for delivery in May declined 0.6 percent to
settle at $2,144 a metric ton at 2:30 p.m. on ICE in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $2,135, the lowest for a most-active
contract since June 26.  West African crop prospects are supporting prices while
capped by uncertain global demand, especially as eurozone growth
remains a concern, Societe Generale’s analysts, led by Hong
Kong-based  Jeremy Friesen ,  said  in an e-mailed report.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1.402 a pound. Trading volume at this time was double the
average in the past 100 days.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery slipped 0.9 percent
to $1.298 a pound, the first loss in a week.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery declined 0.2 percent to
17.74 cents a pound, after touching 17.67 cents, the lowest
since August 2010. Also in New York, domestic sugar touched
20.33 cents a pound, the lowest since April 2009.  Cotton futures for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to 83.19
cents a pound, the highest closing price since May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
