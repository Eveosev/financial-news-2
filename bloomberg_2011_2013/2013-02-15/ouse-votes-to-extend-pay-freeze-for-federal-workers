The U.S. House voted 261-154 to
freeze the pay of government workers for a third consecutive
year.  “We have to make tough choices,” said Representative
 Darrell Issa , a California Republican and chairman of the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee. “But let’s remember
these are civil servants who are paid pretty darn well.”  The bill would block a 0.5 percent raise scheduled to take
effect in April, overturning a Dec. 27 executive order from
President Barack Obama.  Republican  Frank Wolf , whose northern Virginia district
includes the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency,
yelled on the House floor that the bill would target agents who
tracked Osama bin Laden, astronauts, border patrol agents,
cancer researchers and Veterans Affairs hospital nurses treating
wounded soldiers returning from Afghanistan.  “I recognize the good intentions of what the gentleman is
trying to do,” Wolf said of Issa, who led the debate. “It’s
not justice, it’s not fair and I urge a no vote.”  The pay freeze wouldn’t apply to military personnel.
Lawmakers already froze their own pay through Sept. 30. The bill
now goes to the Senate, where its outcome is uncertain.  The White House opposes the bill, H.R. 273.  To contact the reporter on this story:
