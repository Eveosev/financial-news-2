(Corrects Sensex’s year-to-date gain in first paragraph in
story published Feb. 15.)  Indian  stocks dropped for a third
week as earnings at some of the country’s biggest companies
missed analysts’ estimates.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index , or Sensex, lost 0.2 percent
to 19,468.15 at the close. The gauge declined 0.1 percent this
week, paring its year-to-date advance to 0.2 percent.  Reliance
Industries Ltd. , owner of the world’s largest refining complex,
retreated to a one-month low.  Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  slid
after earnings missed estimates.  Tata Steel Ltd.  and  Bajaj Auto
Ltd.  fell more than 1 percent each.  Profits at 43 percent of the 30 Sensex companies trailed
forecasts in the December quarter, compared with 40 percent in
the previous two quarters, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
statistics office on Feb. 7 said growth this year would be the
weakest in a decade and data this week showed industrial output
fell for a second month in December. The Sensex trades at 13.5
times  estimated earnings  for the year to March 2014, compared
with a multiple of 10.4 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  “Valuations are not cheap and you have a slowdown which
will continue to hurt,”  Anand Shah , chief investment officer at
BNP Paribas Asset Management India Pvt., which manages $590
million in assets, said in an interview to Bloomberg TV India.
“One should not expect last year’s rally to sustain given the
macro headwinds.”  The Sensex rallied 26 percent in 2012, its  biggest annual
gain  since 2009, as the government boosted measures to revive
the economy. Gross domestic product will expand 5 percent this
fiscal year ending March, below last year’s 6.2 percent and the
least since the 4 percent growth in 2002-2003, data showed Feb.
7.  Consumer-price index  reached 10.79 percent in January, the
second highest in the Group of 20 major nations, data showed
this week.  ‘Very Vulnerable’  Inflation remains “high,” investment has declined and the
“external sector is very vulnerable,” the Reserve Bank of
India said Feb. 11. These risks limited the central bank to a
quarter-point reduction in  interest rates  to 7.75 percent in
January, the first cut since April last year.  Net income at Dr. Reddy’s fell 29 percent to 3.63 billion
rupees, lagging behind the 4.29 billion rupees estimated by
analysts. The stock decreased 3 percent to 1,818.9 rupees.  Overseas funds have still remained net buyers,  plowing  a
net $7.85 billion into local shares this year, a record for the
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They purchased $24.5
billion of stocks last year, the highest among 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg. Asian equity funds attracted $535 million
in the week to Feb. 13, a 23rd week of inflows, Citigroup Inc.
said in a report today.  ‘Misplaced Hopes’  “A massive deluge of liquidity can take the market higher
in the short term, but to make a fundamental bet on the market
based on the economy you would run ahead of yourself,”  Prabhat Awasthi , head of equity research at Nomura Holdings Inc., told
Bloomberg TV India in Mumbai today. “If the argument has been
based on economic recovery, then those hopes are misplaced.”  Reliance Industries lost 1.2 percent to 845.8 rupees. Tata
Steel, the biggest producer of the alloy, decreased 1.3 percent
to 376.1 rupees. Bajaj Auto, India’s second-largest motorcycle
maker, lost 1.6 percent to 1,970.35 rupees.  Volume on the Sensex was 16 percent less than the 30-day
average at the close. The 50-stock  CNX Nifty Index  of the
National Stock Exchange declined 0.2 percent to 5,887.4. India
VIX, which measures the cost of protection against losses in the
Nifty, rose 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
