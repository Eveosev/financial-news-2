The ruble weakened, retreating from
the level at which traders say the central bank may intervene to
curb gains, as crude oil slid.  The Russian currency fell 0.2 percent against the basket to
34.6891 after closing stronger than 34.65 yesterday, the first
time since Jan. 24. The ruble dropped 0.1 percent against the
dollar to 30.1235 as of 11:59 a.m. in Moscow, declining for the
third day.  Crude dropped 0.3 percent to $117.69 a barrel in London,
the second day of losses. Bank Rossii bought about $600 million
and 48 million euros ($64 million) to slow the currency’s
advance in January, the regulator said  on its website .  “So far there are no specific interventions, but everybody
knows they start below 34.65, so nobody is rushing there,”
 Dmitry Sinitsyn , head of forex operations at  Credit Suisse 
Moscow, said by e-mail.  The monthly taxation period, when exporters sell foreign
currency to pay ruble taxes, starts today with obligatory
contributions to the pension fund. High oil prices and support
from taxpayers should push the ruble to 34.45-34.50 against the
basket,  Alexander Myulberger , head of foreign exchange and
interest rates trading at BCS Financial Group, said by e-mail.  Taxes will support the ruble at the 30 dollar level, while
the euro’s decline against the greenback will push the Russian
currency higher against the basket, said  Dmitry Polevoy , an
analyst at  ING Groep NV .  “The central bank doesn’t buy a lot, this is more a mental
level for the market rather than a real hurdle,” Polevoy said
by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
