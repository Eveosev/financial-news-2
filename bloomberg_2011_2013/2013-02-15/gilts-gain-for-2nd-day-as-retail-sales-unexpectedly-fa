The pound had its steepest weekly
drop versus the dollar since June after data showed U.K. retail
sales unexpectedly fell in January, adding to evidence the
economic recovery is faltering.  Sterling slid to the lowest level in six months against the
greenback. It lost at least 0.7 percent this week against all 16
of its major peers tracked by Bloomberg after the Bank of
England released its quarterly Inflation Report two days ago and
Governor  Mervyn King  said Britain faced a muted recovery.
Britain’s currency trimmed its decline since Feb. 8 as better-
than-forecast U.S. manufacturing data boosted optimism that
global growth is on track. Gilts were little changed.  “The data from the U.K. has disappointed once again,”  Ian Stannard , London-based head of European foreign-exchange
strategy at Morgan Stanley told Guy Johnson on Bloomberg
Television. “Sterling can go quite a bit lower from here.
Sterling will be one of the underperformers.”  The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.5518 at 5 p.m. London time
after sliding to $1.5462, the lowest since July 25. It dropped
1.8 percent this week, the biggest decline since the period
ended June 1. Sterling appreciated 0.1 percent to 86.13 pence
per euro, paring its weekly slide to 1.8 percent.  Investors should sell the pound against the dollar, betting
it will fall to $1.52, Stannard recommended. Sterling last
traded at that level in July 2010.  BOE Policy  Sales  including fuel fell 0.6 percent from December, when
they dropped a revised 0.3 percent, the Office for National
Statistics said in London. The median forecast of 24 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of 0.5 percent.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Empire State  index 
of manufacturing climbed to 10 from minus 7.8 in January,
exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. It was the
highest since May 2012. Readings greater than zero signal growth
in New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.  The Bank of England kept its asset-purchase target at 375
billion pounds and its main interest rate at a record-low 0.5
percent when it met on Feb. 7.  “If necessary, we will do more,” King said on Feb. 13.
“We must recognize, however, that there are limits to what can
be achieved via general monetary stimulus -- in any form -- on
its own.”  The U.K. economy shrank 0.3 percent in the last three
months of 2012 and is facing the threat of an unprecedented
triple-dip recession. Still, surveys of purchasing managers for
January showed expansion in both manufacturing and services
sectors, which together account for almost 90 percent of
Britain’s gross domestic product.  Gilt Yields  The pound has depreciated 4.4 percent this year, the
second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 0.7 percent and the euro rose 2.1 percent.  The 10-year  gilt yielded  2.19 percent after falling as much
as six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.13 percent.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 traded at 96.21.  U.K. government bonds handed investors a loss of 2.7
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German bunds dropped 1.6 percent and
Treasuries fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
