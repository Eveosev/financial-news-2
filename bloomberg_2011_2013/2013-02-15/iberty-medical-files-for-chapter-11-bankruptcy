Liberty Medical Supply Inc. and
affiliates that provide products and services for people with
diabetes and other ailments filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
court protection amid pressure from creditors.  The Port St. Lucie, Florida-based company listed assets and
debts of as much as $500 million each in papers filed today in
Wilmington, Delaware.  “Several unexpected events” including disputes with tax
authorities and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
led to the filing, said Frank A. Harvey, Liberty chief executive
officer, in an e-mailed statement.  Bankruptcy petitions were also filed by Polymedica Corp.,
National Diabetic Medical Supply LLC, Liberty Healthcare Group
Inc. and Liberty Healthcare Pharmacy of Nevada LLC.  Among the largest unsecured creditors listed in court
papers were CGS Administrators of Nashville, Tennessee, owed
$137 million, and Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Illinois,
owed more than $5 million.  “Liberty continues to focus on our critical mission to
positively impact the lives of our patients” by helping to
manage their health, Harvey said.  The case is In re Liberty Medical Supply Inc., 13-10268,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
