Most Czech central bank board
members see less of a chance that monetary conditions will need
to be relaxed further, minutes from the Feb. 6 rate meeting
showed today.  The Ceska Narodni Banka last week left the  benchmark  two-
week repurchase rate at 0.05 percent, almost three-quarters of a
percentage point less than the euro-area benchmark.  “A majority of board members viewed the likelihood of the
need to further ease the monetary conditions as smaller given
the persisting weak exchange rate of the koruna at the forecast
horizon compared to the situation at the turn of the year,” the
minutes said. “It was also said several times that new economic
data might change this view in the months ahead and the
likelihood of the need for monetary easing may rise again.”  The central bank is aiming to prevent inflation from
undershooting its target range of 1 percent to 3 percent as the
 economy  suffers in the longest recession on record. Gross
domestic product shrank for a fourth consecutive quarter in the
final three months of last year, with households and businesses
curbing spending as government pursues austerity policies and
the euro-area crisis curbs demand for exports.  The koruna strengthened after last week’s policy meeting,
gaining 1.8 percent to the euro, its best weekly rally in 14
months. Since then it has weakened, falling 0.6 percent against
the euro this week to trade at 25.377 as of 8:38 a.m. in Prague.  The minutes don’t disclose the views of individual board
members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
