U.S. stocks  rose for the week,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its longest winning
streak in two years, amid optimism over corporate dealmaking and
better-than-estimated economic data.  H.J. Heinz Co. rallied 19 percent after Warren Buffett’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Capital agreed to buy the ketchup
maker.  General Electric Co.  climbed 3.5 percent as Comcast Corp.
agreed to buy the remainder of NBC Universal. The S&P 500 fell
on the last trading day as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. slumped after e-
mails showed the world’s largest retailer had the worst sales
start to a month in seven years.  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,519.79 for the week. The
benchmark U.S. equity measure touched its  highest level  since
Oct. 31, 2007, and reached a valuation last seen almost two
years ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 11.21 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 13,981.76. The gauge closed at a five-year
high on Feb. 12.  “When Warren Buffett does a deal, people listen,”  Chad Morganlander , a portfolio manager at Florham Park, New Jersey-
based Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which manages $127 billion, said by
telephone. “Investors are seeing a gradual improvement within
the U.S. economy. That combined with very low volatility in
financial markets is the perfect cocktail for mergers and
acquisitions.”  The S&P 500 has rallied for seven straight weeks, the
longest winning streak since January 2011. Among economic
reports, claims for jobless benefits plunged in the latest week,
showing U.S. employers have little need to trim staff as demand
improves. Another report showed consumer confidence in the U.S.
rose in February to a three-month high. Manufacturing in the New
York region unexpectedly rebounded this month.  M&A Action  Almost $40 billion in deals were announced in the U.S. on
Feb. 14, bringing the total this month to more than $140
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That already
surpassed the total of $99.6 billion during the first two months
of 2012.  Investors also watched corporate earnings. About 74 percent
of the 393 S&P 500 companies which reported  fourth-quarter
earnings  so far have beaten profit estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Equities rose this week as President  Barack Obama  delivered
his State of the Union address on Feb. 12 in Washington, calling
for raising the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour and pledged
to expand trade with Europe. He also proposed spending $50
billion on “urgent” infrastructure projects.  ‘Better News’  “It’s important that we continue to see the U.S. economy
recovering,” said  Jeff Morris , the Boston-based head of U.S.
equities for Standard Life Investments, in a phone interview.
His firm oversees $263 billion. “Given the run we’ve had,
you’ll need to hear that drumbeat of better news to take the
market higher.”  The S&P 500 is up 6.6 percent this year as U.S. lawmakers
reached a budget compromise and has more than doubled since
bottoming in March 2009 after the Federal Reserve conducted
three rounds of bond buying to boost economic growth. The index
is trading at 15 times earnings in the past year, the highest
multiple since July 2011.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the VIX, lost 4.3 percent to 12.46 this week, trading near
its lowest level since April 2007.  Heinz rallied 19 percent to $72.28 after Berkshire Hathaway
and 3G Capital agreed to buy the ketchup maker for about $23
billion, ending the independence of an iconic ketchup maker that
traces its roots to the 1860s.  NBC Universal  GE jumped 3.5 percent to $23.29. Comcast, the largest U.S.
cable company, will buy out GE’s ownership of NBC Universal for
$16.7 billion, following through on the cable company’s purchase
of a controlling stake two years ago. For GE, the deal turns an
asset that didn’t fit with its business into a  source of cash .
The company will use proceeds to increase repurchases of its
shares by $10 billion a year, GE said.  Constellation Brands Inc. surged 36 percent to $43.39 after
winning full control of the Corona beer brand in the U.S. as
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV sought to salvage its bid to buy the
rest of Grupo Modelo SAB. Constellation will gain Modelo’s
brewery in Piedras Negras, which is located in Mexico near the
Texas border, and perpetual rights for the Corona and Modelo
brands in the U.S. for about $2.9 billion.  Strategic Alternatives  Avon Products Inc. jumped 22 percent, its biggest rally
since 1989, to $20.57 as profit topped estimates. Chief
Executive Officer  Sheri McCoy , who took the helm of the world’s
largest door-to-door cosmetics seller in April, is cutting about
1,500 jobs and leaving the South Korea and Vietnam markets as
part of a plan to save $400 million by the end of 2015. McCoy
said she would seek strategic alternatives for the company’s
Silpada jewelry unit, where sales fell 18 percent in the fourth
quarter.  Herbalife Ltd. climbed 8.1 percent to $38.74. Billionaire
investor  Carl Icahn  reported a 13 percent stake in the marketer
of nutritional supplements and said he would seek talks with the
company that hedge-fund manager  Bill Ackman  has accused of
illegally operating a pyramid scheme. Strategic alternatives for
Herbalife may include taking it private, Icahn said in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Wal-Mart erased 3.1 percent to $69.30. The Bentonville,
Arkansas-based company had the worst sales start to a month in
seven years as payroll-tax increases hit shoppers already
battling a slow economy, according to internal e-mails obtained
by Bloomberg News.  ‘Total Disaster’  “In case you haven’t seen a sales report these days,
February MTD sales are a total disaster,” Jerry Murray, Wal-
Mart’s vice president of finance and logistics, said in a Feb.
12 e-mail to other executives, referring to month-to-date sales.
“The worst start to a month I have seen in my ~7 years with the
company.”  Coca-Cola Co. sank 3.5 percent to $37.42 for the biggest
decline in the Dow this week. The company reported that global
volume sales rose 3 percent in the fourth quarter, trailing the
5.4 percent growth estimated by Mark Swartzberg, an analyst at
Stifel Financial in New York, who has a hold rating on the
shares.  CenturyLink Inc. tumbled 20 percent, its biggest drop in
almost 13 years, to $33.02. The phone and Internet carrier
slashed its dividend by 26 percent to 54 cents. At least six
 analysts downgraded  the stock following the move, unappeased by
the company’s plans to buy back as much as $2 billion in stock.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. plunged 21 percent, the most
since September 2011, to $28.85. The biggest U.S. iron ore
producer cut its quarterly dividend by 76 percent and announced
a share sale to repay debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
