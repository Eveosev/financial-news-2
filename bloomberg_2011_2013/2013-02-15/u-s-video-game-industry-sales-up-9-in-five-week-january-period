U.S. retail sales of video-game
software, hardware and accessories rose 9 percent to $834.7
million in January, aided by an extra week compared with a year
earlier, according to market research firm  NPD Group Inc.   Even with five weeks in this year’s January data, sales of
software fell 0.5 percent to $392.9 million, the Port
Washington, New York-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Hardware sales rose 3.7 percent to $205 million in
the period ended Feb. 2.  The retail-industry data accounts for about 50 percent of
total consumer spending on games, NPD said. With a normalized
four-week comparison, hardware and software sales would have
experienced double-digit percentage declines, the researcher
said.  Microsoft Corp.  held the lead in console sales in January
for the 25th consecutive month. The Redmond, Washington-based
company sold 281,000 Xbox 360 units, up 4.1 percent from 270,000
a year ago, said  David Dennis , an Xbox spokesman.  The video-game industry, in the eighth year of the current
console cycle, has entered a period of transition to new
consoles. Nintendo Co. began selling the Wii U in November, Sony
Corp. has scheduled a Feb. 20 meeting where it’s expected to
discuss plans for a new PlayStation 4. Microsoft’s Dennis
declined to comment on reports that the company will begin
selling a new Xbox later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
