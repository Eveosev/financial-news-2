The World Bank, returning to Myanmar
after more than two decades, is in talks with the government to
help the country invest in gas turbines and expand access to
electricity, an official said.  Axel van Trotsenburg , the bank’s vice president for East
Asia and Pacific, told reporters in Washington that the turbines
would help produce 120 megawatts. They would be financed by
zero-interest loans as part of $165 million that is potentially
available for the country.  “We believe the country has enormous potential provided
the reforms are sustained,” van Trotsenburg said after
returning from a trip there. “It will require a lot of hard
work but also there will be solid support by the international
community.”  Myanmar last month cleared about $1 billion in overdue debt
with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank with a bridge
loan from Japan, opening the door for increased lending as it
seeks to overhaul its infrastructure.  The Washington-based bank last year opened an office in
Yangon and appointed a country manager after a new government
took power in March 2011 and initiated steps to liberalize the
country after five decades of military rule. The bank has
already approved an $80-million grant and a $440-million loan to
support economic development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
