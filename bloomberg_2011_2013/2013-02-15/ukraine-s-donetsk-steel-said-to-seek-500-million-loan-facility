Donetsky Metalurgichesky Zavod , a
Ukrainian steelmaker, is seeking to raise a loan for as much as
$500 million, according to a person with knowledge of deal.  The facility may include three- and five-year portions and
is being coordinated by ING Groep NV and UniCredit SpA, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private.  Donetsk Steel, as the company is known, expects to sign the
deal by the end of next month, the person said. The loan will be
provided by a club of lenders and will not be widely syndicated,
they said.  The company raised a two-year $274 million loan in July
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Donetsk Steel’s
press office, based in Donetsk, Ukraine, did not return a phone
call or reply to an e-mail seeking comment.  Donetsk Steel is also considering selling $500 million of
bonds, Interfax-Ukraine reported Feb. 13, citing documents for
the company’s Feb. 26 shareholder meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
