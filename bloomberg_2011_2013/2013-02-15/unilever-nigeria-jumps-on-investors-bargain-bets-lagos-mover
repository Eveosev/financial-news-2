Unilever Nigeria Plc , a consumer-
goods manufacturer, made its biggest gain in more than five
years as institutional investors bet it was a bargain after a
price slump, FBN Capital Ltd. said.  The stock rose 5.3 percent to 49.50 naira at the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, its biggest gain since Aug.
13, 2007. Some 64.6 percent of the three-month daily average
volume was traded, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
stock lost by 9.6 percent to 47 naira yesterday.  “Unilever is gaining from increased demand from
institutional investors that considered it a good price after
yesterday’s sell off,”  Bunmi Asaolu , an analyst at Lagos-based
FBN Capital said by phone today. “We rate it neutral and an
investor can buy to hold based on fundamentals.”  Unilever’s net income for the nine months through September
was little changed at 4 billion naira from a year earlier, it
said in October. Revenue rose to 41.7 billion ($265 million)
naira, from 40.4 billion naira.  The stock has gained by 6.5 percent this year, compared
with a 18.5 percent rise in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
