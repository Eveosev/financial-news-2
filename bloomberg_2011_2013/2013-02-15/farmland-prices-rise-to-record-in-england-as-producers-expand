Farmland prices climbed to a record
in England and Wales in the second half of last year as
producers sought to expand operations amid rising commodity
prices, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said.  Farmland in the region averaged 6,783 pounds ($10,504) an
acre, up 2.3 percent from the first half of the year, RICS said
today in a report on its website, citing a  survey  it completed
with the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, England.
Prices have “continually risen” since early 2009, it said.
Fifty-four percent of surveyors contributing to the report
expect farmland  prices  to extend gains in the next year, RICS
said.  “The majority of demand continues to be driven by
commercial farmers, keen to expand production to capitalize on
high agricultural commodity prices,” RICS said in a statement.
“Farmers are discriminating in favor of large, top quality
neighboring plots with as small a residential component as
possible. As a result, there is considerable price
differentiation in farmland, even locally.”  The most expensive agricultural land is in the West
Midlands, with prices averaging 7,625 pounds an acre, according
to the report. Farmland in Scotland is the least expensive at
3,750 pounds an acre, primarily because of lower prices for
pasture land.  To contact the reporter on this story:
