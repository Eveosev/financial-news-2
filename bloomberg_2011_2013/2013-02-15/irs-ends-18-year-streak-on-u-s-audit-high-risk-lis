After 18 consecutive years of
criticizing the Internal Revenue Service’s balky computers, the
Government Accountability Office is giving the tax agency a
thumbs-up.  The GAO  removed the IRS from its list of 30 “high-risk”
areas that make the U.S. government most vulnerable to waste and
fraud.  “Progress has been made in addressing significant
weaknesses in information technology and financial management
capabilities,” GAO wrote yesterday, citing the 2012
implementation of a program that processes tax returns more
quickly.  GAO first put the tax agency on its watch list in 1995,
citing “long-standing and pervasive problems which hampered the
effective collection of revenues and precluded the preparation
of auditable financial statements.”  Douglas Shulman , who was IRS commissioner until November
2012, cited the technology improvements as an accomplishment in
his final speech last year. He pointed to switching from weekly
processing of tax returns and other data to daily updates.  “This was a multi-year, incredibly complex undertaking
that went to the heart of systems that process trillions of
dollars in tax revenue,” he said.  The GAO added two programs to the high-risk list: the
government’s ability to manage climate-change risks and gaps in
weather satellite data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
