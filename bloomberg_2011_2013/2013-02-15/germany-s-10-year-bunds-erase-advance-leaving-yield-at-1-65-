Spanish and  Italian  bonds rose, set
for weekly gains, amid optimism that demand for the countries’
debt will be sustained even as Italy approached elections and
Spain’s Premier  Mariano Rajoy  repelled corruption allegations.  Yields on Spanish 10-year securities are set to fall by the
most since the period ended Jan. 4. The country achieved
“enormous progress” in its reforms, European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said on Feb. 12, while Rajoy said public
deficit data due in “coming weeks” will show the country made
“unprecedented fiscal consolidation efforts.” German bunds
were poised for a weekly decline as demand for the euro area’s
safest assets waned.  “The key thing has been the positive comments from the
Draghi in how Spain has made good progress in enacting its
austerity program,” said  Thomas Rahman , a strategist at RIA
Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “In Italy, no more news
about the election has been good news for its debt. We have been
in a quiet period and so the market has been less volatile.”  Spain’s 10-year yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.19 percent at 4:47 p.m. London time,
leaving it 18 basis points lower this week. The 5.4 percent
securities due in January 2023 gained 0.055, or 55 euro cents
per 1,000-euro ($1,336) face amount, to 101.61.  The rate on similar-maturity  Italian  bonds declined three
basis points to 4.38 percent, down 18 basis points since Feb. 8.  Yield Spreads  The yield spread between Spanish 10-year bonds and
comparable German securities decreased two basis points to 354
basis points. The gap between Italian and German 10-year yields
dropped four basis points to 273 basis points.  German 10-year yields rose one basis point today to 1.65
percent, extending this week’s increase to four basis points.  Volatility on French bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Belgium and Portugal,
according to measures of 10-year or similar-maturity debt, the
yield spread between two-year and 10-year securities, and
credit-default swaps.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italian debt returned 1.2 percent and Spanish
securities gained 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
