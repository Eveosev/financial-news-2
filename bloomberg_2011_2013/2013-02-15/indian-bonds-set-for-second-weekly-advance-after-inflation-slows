Indian bonds completed a second
weekly gain on speculation slowing inflation will enable the
central bank to cut interest rates further.  Wholesale  prices rose 6.62 percent in January, the least
since November 2009, the commerce ministry reported in a
statement yesterday. That was less than the 6.98 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The Reserve Bank of India
last lowered the repurchase  rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75
percent on Jan. 29, the first reduction in nine months. Its next
policy meeting is scheduled for March 19.  “Wholesale-price inflation data shows a trend that is
lower than what the RBI was expecting,” said  Samiran Chakraborty , an economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Mumbai.
“This opens a window for a rate cut in March.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.83 percent this week
in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
rate rose one basis point today.  The Reserve Bank predicted inflation at 6.8 percent by the
end of March in its last policy review on Jan. 29.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point today and this week to 7.61 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
