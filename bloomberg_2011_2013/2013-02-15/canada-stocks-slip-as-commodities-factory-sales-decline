Canadian stocks fell for a third day
as oil and gold producers retreated and factory sales dropped
the most in almost four years.  Goldcorp Inc. , the second-biggest gold miner by market
value, lost 2.6 percent after quarterly sales fell short of
analysts’ estimates and the metal slumped to a six-month low.
Energy producers slid as oil dropped amid declining euro-area
exports. Rogers Communications Inc. rallied 3.9 percent after
Chief Executive Officer  Nadir Mohamed  announced his plans to
step down next January.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  fell 26.62
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,695.17 at 10:24 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark index is down 0.8 percent this week, headed for
the biggest weekly loss in three months.  Canadian  factory sales  fell 3.1 percent in December, the
most since May 2009, as car assembly plants experienced longer-
than-usual seasonal shutdowns, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa.  To contact the reporters on this story:
