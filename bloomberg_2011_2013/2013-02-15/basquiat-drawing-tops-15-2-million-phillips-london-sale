A  Jean-Michel Basquiat  drawing was
the most expensive work last night in a $15.2 million auction of
contemporary art at Phillips, the first to be held in London
under its new branding -- and a new auctioneer.  Basquiat’s 1982 pastel, oilstick, colored crayon and
charcoal work on paper, “Untitled,” showing a mask-like face
with a halo and raised right hand, was knocked down by
Phillips’s new British auctioneer Alexander Gilkes to a single
telephone bidder for 1.9 million pounds ($2.9 million) with
fees, the top price of the night.  The work had to be re-offered after failing to sell 10
minutes earlier, when the buyer could not make a telephone
connection. Not seen at auction since 1984, the drawing had been
valued at 1.8 million pounds to 2.5 million pounds.  The New York-based auction house has now reverted to its
original name, derived from its 18th-century British founder
Harry Phillips, following the departure of its former chairman
and flamboyant chief auctioneer,  Simon de Pury , in December.  Eton-educated Gilkes is a co-founder of the  Paddle8  online
auction house and is an affiliated auctioneer at Phillips, where
he has taken some of the company’s day sales. He was dressed in
a gray three-piece suit for his first evening event.  “Simon was a hard act to follow,”  Morgan Long , director of
art investment at the London-based  Fine Art Fund , said in an
interview. “Gilkes was confident and gave it a really good
effort.”  Sale Total  Phillips’s sale raised 9.8 million pounds with fees from 33
lots, 82 percent of which sold, against a low estimate of 10.4
million pounds, based on hammer prices.  Phillips de Pury & Co.’s equivalent event last year raised
5.7 million pounds.  Basquiat has proved to be a mainstay of this February
series of auctions in London, inspiring a top price of 9.3
million pounds at the previous night’s sale at  Christie’s
International . The former graffiti painter was the 7th-biggest-
selling contemporary artist at auction in 2012 with $161.5
million of sales, according to the  Artnet  database.  Phillips’s event also included Basquiat’s 1985 canvas “For
B.A.M.,” featuring a free-floating head and potted plant on a
white background. Priced at 1.2 million pounds to 1.8 million
pounds, this failed to sell.  Mugrabi’s Purchases  The New York-based collector  Jose Mugrabi , seated at the
back of the room, was an active bidder, paying 1.7 million
pounds for the 1997  Christopher Wool  black-and-white enamel on
aluminum abstract “Untitled (P271),” estimated at 1.3 million
pounds to 1.8 million pounds, and 337,250 pounds for the 2005
painting, “Green Escalade” -- based on a bumper-sticker of a
bullet hole -- by the New York painter  Nate Lowman , estimated at
60,000 pounds to 80,000 pounds. Neither of these works had been
offered at auction before, according to Phillips.  “Up-and-coming artists like Lowman are Phillips’s niche,”
the Montreal-based collector Francois Odermatt said. “In 10 or
15 years, when these are established artists, this auction house
will have some of the key clients. It’s a good long-term
strategy.”  A 1964  Andy Warhol  silk-screened “Brillo Soap Pads Box,”
wrapped in its original plastic, had been estimated to fetch
between 600,000 pounds and 800,000 pounds. Back in 2006, this
same piece sold for $710,400 at Christie’s, New York. Last night
it failed to sell, though Mugrabi -- who paid 223,250 pounds for
a 1964 Warhol “Tomato Juice Box” immediately afterwards -- told
Bloomberg News that he had made an offer after the event.  Muse highlights include  weekend guides  for New York and
London,  Lewis Lapham  on history and  Catherine Hickley  on movies.  To contact the writer on the story:
