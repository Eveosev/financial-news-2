The ruble weakened, retreating from
the level at which traders say the central bank may intervene to
curb gains, as crude oil slid.  The Russian currency fell 0.1 percent against the central
bank’s dollar-euro basket to 34.6616 by 7 p.m. in Moscow after
closing stronger than 34.65 yesterday, the first time since Jan.
24. According to traders, 34.65 marks the level beyond which
Bank Rossii may intervene to curb excessive ruble strengthening.
The ruble dropped 0.1 percent against the dollar to 30.1240 for
a 0.2 percent decline in the week.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, dropped 1.1 percent to
$116.65 a barrel in London, accelerating the decline after the
U.S. reported a 0.1 decline in industrial production in January.
Bank Rossii bought about $600 million and 48 million euros ($64
million) to slow the currency’s advance in January, the
regulator said  on its website .  “So far there are no specific interventions, but everybody
knows they start below 34.65, so nobody is rushing there,”
 Dmitry Sinitsyn , head of forex operations at  Credit Suisse 
Moscow, said by e-mail.  The monthly taxation period, when exporters sell foreign
currency to pay ruble taxes, started today with obligatory
contributions to the pension fund, providing support for the
ruble.  The currency will weaken once the tax payment period ends,
according to  Artem Roschin , forex trader at Aljba Alliance in
Moscow.  “It makes more sense to start thinking about a long
position in the basket, keeping in mind the end of the tax
period,” Roschin said. The ruble may weaken to 34.80-34.90
against the basket from current level.  Russian government bonds were unchanged with the yield on
notes due 2027 unchanged at 7.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
