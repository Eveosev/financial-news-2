Finnlines Oyj, Finland’s biggest
shipping company, turned over a banned shipment of spare parts
intended for tanks in Syria to Finnish authorities.  The cargo has been seized, the Finnish Customs said in an
e-mailed statement today. Finnlines is assisting the authorities
in the investigation, Chief Executive Officer  Uwe Bakosch  said
in a statement. The goods were found in the cargo of MV Finnsun
in Antwerp, Belgium, on Jan. 3, according to Finnlines.  The company decided to turn over the goods, which had
originated in St. Petersburg, to the authorities because it
couldn’t unload or return the cargo without breaching European
Union sanctions, Bakosch said. The cargo had no export permits
and was examined Jan. 9 by customs in Helsinki.  A civil war in Syria to oust President  Bashar al-Assad  is
nearing its third year. More than 60,000 people have died in the
conflict that started in March 2011, according to the United
Nations, as forces loyal to Assad fight rebels who are seeking
an end to his family’s rule.  The EU sanctioned Syria in 2011 and the U.S. has pushed for
a UN Security Council resolution that would impose penalties,
such as economic sanctions, for a failure to end the conflict
and begin a transition to a unity government. Russia has blocked
the UN sanctions.  Finland in 2011 stopped a shipment of 69 Patriot missiles
to South Korea from Germany that was inappropriately stowed and
lacked export permits. That cargo was allowed to proceed after
it was repacked and a permit awarded by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
