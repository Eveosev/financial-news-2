Commodity assets under management
rose to $430 billion last month, as prices climbed and
withdrawals from funds slowed, Barclays Plc said.  The commodity sector “appears reasonably healthy” as it
topped $400 billion for the seventh straight month, analysts
 Suki Cooper , Sha Luo,  Kevin Norrish  and Marco Corsi said today
in a report. Assets under management tracked by commodity-index
swaps rose to $136.7 billion in January, the highest since
September 2012, report said.  “Inflation expectations are picking up again as
policymakers signal greater tolerance of rising prices,” the
analysts said. “This could also prove supportive for commodity
investor flows.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
rose 4.5 percent last month, after climbing for four straight
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
