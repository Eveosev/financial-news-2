 Spain’s core  inflation  rate
accelerated in January as the deepest austerity measures in the
nation’s democratic history sustained price increases while
pushing the economy deeper into recession.  Core  inflation , which excludes energy and fresh food
prices, accelerated to 2.2 percent in January, the National
Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. That’s more than the
2.1 percent median of four forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.
Underlying prices fell 1.6 percent from the previous month.  Spain, the euro area’s fourth largest economy, is headed
for a second straight year of  recession  as Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy ’s tax increases and spending cuts undermine
domestic demand. The European Central Bank last week left its
benchmark interest rate unchanged amid a weak economic outlook
for the region.  Carlos Ghosn , chief executive officer of France’s second-
largest carmaker Renault SA, yesterday predicted that Spanish
and Italian car deliveries will drop to a 30-year low in 2013.
 Retail sales  in Spain, which have slumped for 2 1/2 years,
dropped 10.7 percent in December from a year earlier.  Spain’s headline inflation rate, based on European Union
calculations, was 2.8 percent, matching an estimate published on
Jan. 31. Stripping out taxes, inflation was 0.7 percent in
January, according to the Spanish statistics institute, and 0.2
percent if fresh food and energy were also excluded, according
to the Spanish measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
