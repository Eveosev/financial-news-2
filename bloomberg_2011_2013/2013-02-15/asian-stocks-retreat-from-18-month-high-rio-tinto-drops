Asian  stocks  fell, with Japan’s
Topix Index snapping the longest weekly winning streak in 40
years, as the yen rose and profit reports from Trend Micro Inc.
and  Rio Tinto Group  disappointed investors.  Rio Tinto declined 2.7 percent in Sydney after the miner
reported its biggest loss in at least 15 years. Trend Micro
tumbled 6.1 percent after the Japanese anti-virus software
maker’s net income fell 23 percent.  Auckland International
Airport Ltd.  slumped the most in four years after a New Zealand
pension fund reduced its stake in the nation’s busiest terminal.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  slid 0.1 percent to 133.75 as
of 6:21 p.m. in Tokyo after closing yesterday at the highest
level since August 2011. The gauge has risen 0.5 percent this
week. About five stocks fell for every three that rose. Equity
markets in China, Taiwan and Vietnam were shut today for public
holidays.  “There is a risk of a correction, but it may be shallow,”
said  David Cassidy , Sydney-based head of equity strategy at UBS
AG. “People aren’t positioned for this rally and they are still
scrambling to buy. So I wouldn’t be getting too bearish on
equities right now.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  slid 1.2 percent, led by
banks and exporters, as investor weighed whether Group of 20
nations leaders will pressure Japan on the yen’s depreciation.
Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak later said in
Moscow that the group’s communique won’t include the phrase
“currency war.” The broader Topix Index lost 1.3 percent,
halting a 13-week advance, the longest such streak since 1973.  Yen Rises  The yen rose against its most major counterparts and yields
on 10-year Japanese government bonds fell two basis points to
0.745 percent. The currency extended its advance after Reuters
reported that Toshiro Muto, chairman of Daiwa Institute of
Research and former deputy governor for the Bank of Japan, is
the leading candidate for the governor’s position. A stronger
Japanese currency cuts the overseas earnings outlook for
exporters.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.1 percent, falling
from the highest level since September 2008. South Korea’s  Kospi
Index  added 0.1 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose
0.1 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index retreated 0.2
percent.  Gains in Asian shares in 2013 have lagged the U.S. as fewer
companies beat profit forecasts. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
gained 3.3 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a
6.7 percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Of the 331 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have reported  earnings this quarter  and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 51 percent exceeded profit expectations. That
compares with the 73 percent of S&P 500 companies that topped
profit forecasts.  Relative Value  The Asian benchmark trades at 14.8 times average estimated
earnings compared with 13.7 for the S&P 500 and 12.4 times for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Rio Tinto declined 2.7 percent to A$70.15. Kirin Holdings
Co. retreated 4.9 percent to 1,171 yen as Japan’s largest
beverage maker forecast operating profit growth this year of
less than a third of the five-year average.  Trend Micro declined 6.1 percent to 2,581 yen. Net income
for 12-months ended Dec. fell to 13.4 billion yen ($145 million)
from 17.3 billion yen a year earlier.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.2 percent. The gauge
yesterday climbed 0.1 percent to a five-year high as a drop in
jobless claims and Warren Buffett’s deal for H.J. Heinz Co.
overshadowed concern over shrinking economies in Europe and
Japan.  Europe GDP  Gross domestic product in the euro area shrank 0.6 percent
in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the worst
performance since the first quarter of 2009.  Auckland International Airport fell 5.8 percent to NZ$2.77
in Wellington. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund sold 100
million shares to institutional investors at NZ$2.76 each.  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. , the Japanese refining unit of
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, surged 13 percent to 589 yen after saying
net income will rise to 26 billion yen in the 12 months through
December from 1 billion yen a year earlier.  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. advanced 7.7 percent to
HK$4.64 in Hong Kong, extending yesterday’s gain, after January
sales volume swelled at the unit of the Chinese owner of Volvo
Cars Corp.  Japanese banks were one of the biggest  contributers  to
declines on the MSCI Asia Pacific gauge. Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. lost 5.8 percent to 196 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest bank by market value,
declined 3.2 percent to 3,640 yen. The lenders had their
investment ratings cut at UBS Ag, which said recent gains were
an overreaction to expectations for monetary easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
