Westshore Terminals Investment
Corp. , operator of North America’s largest coal-export facility,
fell the most since July 2011 after saying it will cap dividend
payments to help pay for the replacement of aging equipment.  Westshore dropped 5.1 percent to C$27.06 ($26.88) at 11:37
a.m. in Toronto after earlier declining as much as 10 percent.  The company plans to spend C$210 million over as long as
five years at its coal terminal south of Vancouver, it said in a
statement today. Westshore plans to set aside cash in a so-
called capital projects fund to reduce future borrowing, the
Vancouver-based company said.  Westshore will limit its quarterly dividend to C$0.33 a
share starting in the second quarter. The company reduced its
fourth-quarter payout to C$0.275 from C$0.33 in the previous
quarter after a December incident in which a ship struck an
elevated railway trestle at the terminal, disrupting output. The
company has yet to announce its first-quarter distribution.  Allocating money to the fund will “significantly reduce
per-share dividends which were expected to increase
substantially this year,”  Megan MacNeill , a Vancouver-based
analyst at Haywood Securities Inc., said in a note. She
downgraded her rating on Westshore to sell from hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
