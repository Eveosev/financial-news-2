England’s Alex Hale and Michael Lumb
combined for 143 runs to defeat New Zealand by 10 wickets and
take the deciding game in their three-match Twenty20 series.  Hale, 80 not out, and Lumb, unbeaten on 53, needed just
12.4 of their 20 overs to surpass the 139-8 set by New Zealand
in Wellington. England’s opening pair took 50 minutes to reach
the target.  Martin Guptill led the host’s attack with 59 runs before
being caught and bowled by captain Stuart Broad, who took 3-15
for England. Jade Dernbach was 3-36.  “I can’t remember a much more powerful performance from an
England side,” Broad said in broadcast comments. “It was key
for us to reclaim some confidence here. We bowled well and held
our lengths early and the way we chased down those runs was
pretty spectacular.”  The visitors won the opening match by 40 runs in Auckland,
with New Zealand rebounding three days ago with a 55-run win to
even the series.  The teams will also meet for three one-day internationals
and three Tests in New Zealand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
