Copper is poised for the first
weekly decline in three as the euro-area recession deepened more
than economists forecast, weakening demand for metals.  Metal for delivery in three months was little changed at
$8,250 a metric ton on the the London Metal Exchange at 12:01
p.m. in Seoul. The contract is down 0.5 percent this week.
Futures for delivery in May advanced 0.2 percent to $3.76 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  Gross domestic product in the euro region fell 0.6 percent
in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the worst
performance since the first quarter of 2009. It exceeded the 0.4
percent median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Europe’s 17-nation currency yesterday depreciated 0.7 percent
against the dollar.  “GDP in the Euro-zone came out weaker, droving the euro
lower and weighing on metals prices,” Hwang Il Doo, a senior
trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co., said by phone from
Seoul. “We are not completely sure yet if Chinese demand will
actually resume after the holiday.”  Financial markets in China are closed this week for the
Lunar New Year. The Asian nation is the world’s biggest consumer
of copper.  On the LME, aluminum was little changed after yesterday
advancing to a six-week high on rising global auto sales. Zinc,
nickel and lead rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
