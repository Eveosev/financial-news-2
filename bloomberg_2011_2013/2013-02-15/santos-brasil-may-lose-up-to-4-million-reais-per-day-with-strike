Santos Brasil Participacoes SA ,
Brazil’s  largest shipping  container operator, stands to lose as
much as 4 million reais ($2.04 million) a day if port workers
proceed with plans to strike over proposed regulatory changes.  “Each day paralyzed is huge for us,” Mauro Salgado,
Santos’s chief commercial officer, said today in an interview in
Sao Paulo. “We will use all means to keep operating.”  Port union leaders in Brazil, the largest exporter of sugar
and orange juice, are considering stopping work this month if
President Dilma Rousseff doesn’t accept modifications to a plan
to cede control of as many as 95 terminals to private operators.
A meeting between government officials and workers in Brasilia
yesterday didn’t produce any results and unions will discuss
demonstrations and stoppages next week, Paulo Pereira da Silva,
head of union Forca Sindical, told reporters.  Santos, based in its namesake port city south of Sao Paulo,
 declined  0.4 percent to 31.10 reais at 5:36 p.m. in Sao Paulo,
the first drop in four trading days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
