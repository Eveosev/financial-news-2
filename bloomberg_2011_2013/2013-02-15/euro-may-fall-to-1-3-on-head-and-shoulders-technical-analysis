The euro may weaken to $1.3 per
dollar after the currency formed a so-called head-and-shoulders
pattern, according to City Index Group Ltd.  Europe’s shared currency has fallen below the neckline that
connects the $1.34 area in mid-January and the $1.35 level
earlier this week with the head at around $1.37, according to
James Chen, chief technical strategist at City Index. A break
below support at $1.33 may signal further declines in the euro,
Chen said. Support refers to an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to buy an asset are clustered.  “As head-and-shoulders patterns are considered potential
reversal formations, this price action hints at further possible
bearishness going forward,” Chen wrote in a research note
yesterday. “A strong breakdown below 1.3300 support would
confirm this bearishness, with a further breakdown below the
1.3200 area placing the current bullish trend in serious risk of
reversal, with an initial objective around 1.3000 support.”  The common currency rose 0.1 percent to $1.3380 at 6:45
a.m. in London today from the close yesterday, when it touched
$1.3315, the least since Jan. 24. The euro has gained about 11
percent since July 24, when it sank as low as to $1.2043. It
last touched $1.3 on Jan. 4.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
