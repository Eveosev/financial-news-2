The Green Bay Packers released
 Charles Woodson , the former National Football League defensive
player of the year, while the Indianapolis Colts declined to
give a new contract to  Dwight Freeney , the club’s all-time sack
leader.  Woodson, 36, who signed with Green Bay in 2006 after eight
seasons with the Oakland Raiders, started 100 games for the
Packers. He was named the NFL’s best defender by the Associated
Press in 2009, when he recorded a career-high nine interceptions
along with four forced fumbles and two sacks.  Woodson earned four Pro Bowl selections during his seven
seasons with the Packers.  Woodson was a “once-in-a-generation talent,” a key part
of the Packers’ Super Bowl title three years ago and a future
member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, General Manager  Ted Thompson  said in a news release sent by the team.  “He has been an integral part of the Packers’ success and
our Super Bowl title in 2010 would not have been possible
without his contributions,” Thompson said.  Woodson, a defensive back, holds franchise records for the
most defensive touchdowns with 10 and the most interceptions
returned for a touchdown with nine. He’s tied for second in
league history with 11 career interceptions returned for scores,
behind  Rod Woodson ’s 12.  ‘Dominant Player’  Freeney, 32, the Colts’ 11th overall pick in the 2002 draft
who tallied 107.5 sacks for the club, can enter the free agency
market on March 12.  “He has been a dominant player, which is all the more
impressive considering his size for his position, and he has won
a lot of games for this franchise,” Colts owner  Jim Irsay  said.
“Dwight was an artist, a joy to watch, and the dedication he
put toward his craft was a rare quality.”  Freeney, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, had 13.0 sacks in
his rookie season and had at least 10 sacks in 2003 (11.0), 2004
(16.0), 2005 (11.0), 2008 (10.5), 2009 (13.5) and 2010 (10.0).
He became the first Colts player to top the NFL in sacks with
his total in 2004.  He took down 53 different opposing quarterbacks and had
sacks against 27 of 31 teams.  Freeney played on seven division champions, two conference
champions and the Colts’ 2006 Super Bowl team which beat Chicago
29-17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
