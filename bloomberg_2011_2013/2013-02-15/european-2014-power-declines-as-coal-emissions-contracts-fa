European power for 2014 delivery in
Germany and France, the bloc’s biggest markets, dropped as the
cost of carbon emissions and coal fell.  Baseload German 2014 electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, declined for a second day, losing as much as
0.8 percent, while the French equivalent fell 0.8 percent,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  The benchmark German contract dropped as much as 35 cents
to 42.30 euros ($56.56) a megawatt-hour and was trading at 42.40
euros at 4:45 p.m. in Berlin. In France, the year-ahead contract
slid 35 cents to 45.20 euros.  European coal for delivery in 2014 fell 0.4 percent to
$98.50 a ton in the fifth day of declines, while European
emissions allowances for December dropped as much as 3.2 percent
to 5.08 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. Power can track emissions and coal, which affect
production costs.  March power in Germany lost as much as 1 percent to 38.45
euros while the equivalent French contract slid 1.1 percent to
43.50 euros a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  Temperatures in Germany may fall to minus 1.5 degrees
Celsius (29 Fahrenheit) at 6 a.m. tomorrow compared with a
previous forecast of minus 1.4 degrees, according to a GFS model
supplied by MetraWeather to Bloomberg. In France, minimum
temperatures will reach 1.3 degrees at 6 a.m., in line with
earlier predictions.  Wind output in Germany is predicted at less than 1 gigawatt
tomorrow, Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather forecaster,
said on its website. That compares with an average level of 4.9
gigawatts, according to data from EEX on Bloomberg.  Demand  in France, Europe’s second-biggest power market, may
reach 73,000 megawatts tomorrow, according to a forecast on the
website of Reseau de Transport d’Electricite, the network
operator. That compares with 78,535 megawatts today.  RWE AG  delayed the start of its 608-megawatt Gersteinwerk
K2 coal-fed power plant to Feb. 18 after a boiler fault
yesterday, the company said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
