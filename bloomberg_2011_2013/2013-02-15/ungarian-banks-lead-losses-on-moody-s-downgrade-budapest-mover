OTP Bank Nyrt. , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell for a second day, leading a decline in stocks,
after Moody’s Investors Service lowered its credit ratings.  OTP’s shares fell 0.9 percent to 4,760 forint by the close
in Budapest, extending its two-day drop to 3.1 percent and
paring this week’s gain to 1.9 percent. The benchmark BUX  index 
slumped 0.3 percent today and 1.1 percent this week.  Moody’s lowered OTP’s standalone  credit assessment  by one
level to Ba2 and that of  FHB Jelzalogbank Nyrt. , a mortgage
lender, by two steps to B3, citing a drag on profits as
Hungary’s economy deteriorates, according to a statement after
the market’s close yesterday. OTP led a plunge in Hungary’s
stocks yesterday after data showed gross domestic product fell
2.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the most
in three years.  “The drivers of the lower standalone credit assessments
are the increasingly weak economic and operating environment in
Hungary and the challenges this creates for all three banks’
franchises, asset quality and profitability,” Simone Zampa, a
Milan-based analyst at Moody’s, wrote in the statement.  FHB reversed intraday declines of as much 3.1 percent to
close 0.5 percent higher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
