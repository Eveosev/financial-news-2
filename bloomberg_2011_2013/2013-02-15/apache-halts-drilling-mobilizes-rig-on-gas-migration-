Apache Corp.  evacuated some rig
workers, halted drilling and shut in a well in the Gulf of
Mexico after natural gas began flowing up.  Apache is working to kill the well and is bringing in
another rig to drill a relief well if it’s required,  John Roper ,
an Apache spokesman, said in an e-mail today. No pollution has
been detected from the well, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east
of Venice, Louisiana, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement said in a  notice  yesterday.  The company found “underground migration” of gas from the
bottom of the 8,261-foot (2,518-meter) well to another sand
formation at about 1,100 feet, Roper said. The well at Main Pass
295 in the Gulf began flowing on Feb. 5, he said in a phone
interview. Apache was drilling in 218 feet of water.  Apache evacuated non-essential workers and the well’s
blowout preventer was activated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
