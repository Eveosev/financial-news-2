HJ Heinz Co.  was cut three levels to
junk by Fitch Ratings after agreeing to be acquired by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Capital in a $23
billion deal that will add to the ketchup-maker’s debt.  The credit grade was cut to BB+ from BBB+ because “Heinz’s
leverage could increase,” the ratings firm said today in a
report on the Pittsburgh-based company. “Fitch views this
substantially higher level of financial risk as not being
commensurate with an investment-grade rating.”  Berkshire and  Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G will each pay about
$4.1 billion for an equity stake, with Buffett’s firm
contributing an additional $8 billion for preferred shares.
Heinz said today it obtained $14.1 billion in financing from
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. to support the deal,
including a revolving line of credit and bridge facilities.  Fitch said it could downgrade the condiment maker again
after reviewing financing terms and the firm’s  capital structure 
once a deal is completed.  Tom Russo , a partner at Berkshire shareholder Gardner Russo
& Gardner, said yesterday that Heinz will have the resources to
meet its obligations as it benefits from interest rates near
record lows.  “It will not be hard to service the debt because the debt
will be at such low rates,” Russo said. “The cash that’s left
over can go to Berkshire for reinvestment elsewhere.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
