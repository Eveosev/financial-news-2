Five Formula One racing cars
belonging to the HRT team that went out of business after the
season-ending event in Sao Paulo on Nov. 25 have ended up in a
junk yard on the outskirts of Madrid.  The owner of  Auto-Recycling Teo Martin , which dismantles
cars and resells parts, said he’s preparing an inventory to see
what he can sell after clearing out the team base. The HRT team
didn’t score a championship point over three seasons.  “We’re not selling Scuderia Ferrari here so I’ve been
surprised by the interest,” Teo Martin said by phone from San
Martin de la Vega. He said he received about 50 e-mails
expressing interest in parts since yesterday.  The assembled pieces of a top-end Formula One car might
cost as much as $1 million, according to Tony Jardine, a former
assistant manager of the McLaren team. Ferrari is the sport’s
oldest and most successful team.  Martin said he paid a “symbolic” fee of significantly
more than 50,000 euros ($67,000) to clear out the base. He had
to return the engines and gearboxes to their makers so the cars
aren’t ready to race.  One of the 50 e-mails the company has received is from
Hinwil, Switzerland-based Sauber Formula One team, which is
interested in a refuelling-rig part, Martin added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
