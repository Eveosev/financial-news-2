The Canadian dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart for the first time in four days as the nation’s
 manufacturing sales  dropped the most in December since 2009.  The currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, headed for a second weekly loss
amid a decline in commodities including crude oil, Canada’s
biggest export. The loonie weakened versus 13 of its 16 most-
traded peers as Group-of-20 finance ministers and central
bankers began talks in Moscow amid bets they may criticize
policies that have helped Japan’s currency depreciate.  “The Canadian dollar has weakened off to what were fairly
miserable December manufacturing sales,”  Camilla Sutton , head
of currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by phone from
Toronto. “If your timeframe is short, I think a lot of the
risks have tilted to the downside for Canada dollar.”  The loonie depreciated 0.6 percent to C$1.0064 per U.S.
dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It lost 0.4 percent on the week.
One Canadian dollar buys 99.36 U.S. cents.  Canada’s dollar has fallen 0.9 percent this year among the
10 developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar has risen 0.7
percent, and the yen has tumbled 7.4 percent.  Government bonds fell, pushing  yields on the benchmark 10-
year debt up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.01
percent. The price of the 2.75 percent securities maturing in
June 2022 decreased 15 cents to C$106.20.  Debt Auction  The Bank of Canada will auction C$400 million ($400
million) of real-return bonds on Feb. 20. The inflation-linked
debt matures in December 2044. At its last RRB auction on Dec.
5, the central bank sold C$700 million of 30-year bonds at a
median yield of 0.3 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.59
times, compared with 3.04 times at the Sept. 12 auction.  Hedge funds and other large speculators decreased bets for
a fourth straight week that the Canadian dollar will gain
against the greenback, reducing them to the lowest since August,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers on an
advance in the loonie compared with those on a drop -- so-called
net longs -- was 26,565 on Feb. 12, compared with 27,761 the
week before.  Factory sales fell 3.1 percent, dropping to C$48.0 billion
($47.9 billion) from C$49.6 billion the previous month,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The decline was larger
than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
17 economists that had a median estimate of a 0.8 percent
decline.  The loonie remained weaker even as the Canadian Real Estate
Association said  existing homes sales  rose 1.3 percent in
January after a 0.5 percent decline in December.  Outlook Reduced  Bank of Governor Mark Carney reiterated this week that an
increase in the benchmark interest rate, which has been  1
percent  since 2010 to spur growth, is “less imminent” because
inflation has been slower than forecast and will remain below
the 2 percent target rate through the first half of next year.
The bank cut its 2013 growth forecast last month to 2 percent,
from a 2.3 percent estimate in October.  “The data was quite a bit softer than expected, and it
painted a sluggish picture of the Canadian economy for the
latter part of last year,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency
strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities Inc., said
in a telephone interview from Toronto. “It reaffirms the low-
for-longer outlook for interest rates.”  Futures on crude oil fell as much as 2.2 percent to 95.21 a
barrel in New York, the lowest level since Feb. 11.  Commodities Drop  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell for the
first time in four days, dropping 0.5 percent. Raw materials
including oil account for about half of Canada’s export revenue.  The loonie weakened as industrial production in the U.S.,
Canada’s biggest trade partner, unexpectedly declined last
month.  Output  at U.S. factories, mines and utilities fell 0.1
percent after a revised 0.4 percent gain in December, Federal
Reserve data showed. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
was for a 0.2 percent increase.  Consumer confidence  in the world’s largest economy rose in
February to a three-month high. The Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment climbed to a
reading of 76.3, from 73.8 last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
