Mizuho Financial Group Inc.  fell the
most in almost two years, leading a drop in Japanese bank
stocks, after UBS AG analyst  Shinichi Ina  cut the lender’s
rating to sell from neutral, saying recent gains were
“overheated.”  The shares declined 5.8 percent, the largest drop since
March 15, 2011, to 196 yen at the 3 p.m. close of Tokyo Stock
Exchange trading. They are up 25 percent this year.  Ina’s rating on Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. was
also reduced to neutral from buy, he said in a telephone
interview today. The shares fell 3.2 percent to 3,640 yen. The
country’s benchmark  Topix Index  slid 1.3 percent.  “Expected monetary easing driven by Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe  won’t bolster bank lending rates and drive the megabanks’
net interest profits higher in a short period of time,” Ina
said. “The gains in the past 30 days stemmed from an overheated
buying spree and now we are seeing profit taking by traders.”  Abe’s pledge to stimulate the economy has spurred a 14
percent jump in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average since elections
were held on Dec. 16. The Topix Banks Index has climbed 26
percent since then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
