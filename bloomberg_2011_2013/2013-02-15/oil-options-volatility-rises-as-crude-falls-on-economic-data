Crude oil options volatility rose as
the underlying futures fell after U.S. industrial production
unexpectedly shrank and euro-area exports declined the most in
five months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, rose to 19.44 percent on the New York
Mercantile Exchange from 16.83 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery fell
$1.49, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $96.41 a barrel on the
Nymex. Futures pared the weekâ€™s gain as January factory output
slipped while euro-area exports dropped in December.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $100 calls, which fell 23 cents to 67 cents a barrel on
volume of 6,855 contracts. April $101 calls were the second-most
active with 5,431 lots. They declined 15 cents to 46 cents.  Puts accounted for 51 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the previous session, bearish bets calls made up 62 percent
of the 89,803 contracts traded.  April $85 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 3,498 contracts changing hands. They were down 3
cents at 17 cents. June $85 puts declined 5 cents to 77 cents a
barrel on 3,392 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
33,475 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 33,118 and
December $110 calls at 30,339.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
