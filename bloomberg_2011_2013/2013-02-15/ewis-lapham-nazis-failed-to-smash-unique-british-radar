During the early days of World War
II, the Germans tried to dominate the skies. On Aug. 14, 1940,
the Luftwaffe’s No. 3 fleet from Norway attacked Newcastle.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  During the 1930s, the English had set up a unique air-
tracking radar system developed by Sir Robert Watson-Watt along
the east and south coasts. It could detect objects in the sky
from 100 miles away, and relay the data to a defense network.  The German planes were intercepted and 15 bombers were shot
down, with no RAF losses. By the beginning of September, the
Luftwaffe had lost more than 800 aircraft with many more
seriously damaged.  German intelligence never appreciated the importance of the
radar, and  Goering ’s failure to attack the clearly vulnerable
stations amazed the British command.  I spoke with  Paul Kennedy , author of “Engineers of
Victory: The Problem Solvers Who Turned the Tide in the Second
World War,” on the following topics:  1. Wartime Challenges  2. Encouraging Innovation  3. Hitler’s Priorities  4. Auditor of Institutions  5. Battle of the Atlantic  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
