Tenaris SA , a producer of steel
pipes for the oil and natural gas industry, will build its first
U.S. seamless-pipe mill in Texas at an estimated cost of $1.5
billion.  The plant in Bay City will have a production capacity of
600,000 tons a year of seamless pipe, the Luxembourg-based
company said today in a statement.  The plant is expected to begin operations in 2016 and
generate 600 manufacturing jobs, the company said.  U.S. Steel Corp., the largest U.S. producer of the metal by
volume, shipped 1.9 million tons of pipes and tubes from its
tubular segment at an average price of $1,687 a ton in 2012, it
said on Jan. 29. Hot-rolled steel coil, a benchmark product used
in appliances and vehicles, averaged $658.66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
