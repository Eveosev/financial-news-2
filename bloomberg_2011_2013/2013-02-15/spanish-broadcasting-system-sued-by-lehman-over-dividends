Spanish Broadcasting System Inc. , a
provider of bilingual radio and TV programs across the U.S., was
sued by  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , which claims the company
owes $29.36 million in preferred stock dividends.  Lehman, based in New York, asked a  Delaware Chancery Court 
judge to rule the Miami-based broadcaster violated a contract by
not making the payments, and is therefore prohibited from
incurring additional debt, according to papers made public today
in Wilmington.  “Despite the fact” of the contract, and non-payment to
Series B preferred stockholders since mid-2009, “the company
proceeded in 2011 and 2012 with the incurrence of hundreds of
millions of new debt -- including a $275 million refinancing,”
Lehman lawyers said in the complaint.  Lehman seeks a ruling that the broadcaster caused a
“triggering event” by not paying the dividends, that incurring
debt was prohibited. It is also asking for unspecified damages
“to be determined at trial,” according to the filing.  A spokesman for Spanish Broadcasting,  Brad Edwards , didn’t
immediately return calls seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. Spanish
Broadcasting System, CA8321, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
