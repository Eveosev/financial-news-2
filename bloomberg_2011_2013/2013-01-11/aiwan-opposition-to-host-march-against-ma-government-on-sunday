Taiwan ’s opposition party expects
100,000 people to participate in a planned Jan. 13 protest
against President Ma Ying-jeou’s administration.  The opposition is also demanding that Premier Sean Chen be
held accountable for the island’s weak economy and step down,
said Jason Lin, spokesman of the  Democratic Progressive Party  by
phone today.  Ma’s approval rating has fallen to 13 percent since his re-
election last January with 52 percent of the popular vote,
according to a December  poll  by Taipei-based television network,
TVBS. The  International Monetary Fund  estimates Taiwan’s economy
grew at a rate of 1.3 percent in 2012, the slowest pace since
the 2009 global recession.  Protesters will also call for regulators, including the
Fair Trade Commission and the National Communications
Commission, to block the sale of Kong-listed  Next Media Ltd. (282) ’s
Taiwan assets to prevent a monopoly, Lin said. A group of
companies plans to buy Next Media Taiwan print and television
units for a total NT$17.5 billion ($602 million).  Tsai Shao-Chung, president of Want Want Chinatimes Group,
which publishes the China Times and the Commercial Times, is
among the buyers.  Fiscal changes and reforms to the island’s social welfare
system are also among the the DPP’s concerns. Ma said on Nov. 21
that the island’s aging population is straining its welfare and
pension system and that the government would review reform
proposals by this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
