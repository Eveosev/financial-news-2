Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) , the world’s
biggest wind-turbine maker by market value, rose to its highest
in four months after  China  announced it will boost renewable-
energy capacity this year.  The stock jumped 10 percent, its maximum daily limit, to
6.5 yuan, the highest since Sept. 13, as of 12:07 p.m. in
Shanghai trading. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell
0.5 percent.  The Beijing-based turbine maker’s stock has increased by
its daily limit for the second consecutive day after China’s
National Energy Administration announced Jan. 8 the country will
add 49 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity this year,
including 18 gigawatts of wind power. Total installed capacity
for clean energy was 39 gigawatts in 2012, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  “China’s goal may indicate a 30 percent growth in turbine
shipments,” Jerry Weng, a Shanghai-based analyst at KGI
Securities Co., said by phone today. Sinovel and  Xinjiang
Goldwind Science & Technology Co. (2208) , China’s biggest producer of
turbines, “may have a chance to negotiate prices as policy
support stimulates demand.”  Goldwind rose 3.4 percent to 6.12  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
