Ford Motor Co. (F)  plans to hire 2,200
salaried employees in the U.S. this year, the most in more than
a decade, in an expansion that shows the strength of the
recovery in the second-largest U.S. automaker’s home market.  The plan follows the addition of more than 8,100 hourly and
salaried jobs last year, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker
said today in an e-mailed statement. The company’s target for
salaried employee hiring would be the biggest increase since
Ford added 3,300 such workers in 2001.  Ford is expanding after U.S. light-vehicle sales gained 13
percent last year to 14.5 million, the best annual total in five
years. The company doubled its  quarterly dividend  yesterday
after earning a bigger pretax profit in  North America  during
2012’s first nine months than for all of 2011.  “We’re excited about the growth opportunity in 2013,” Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of the Americas, said today in an
interview during “In the Loop with  Betty Liu ” on Bloomberg
Television. The hiring is “about supporting the introduction of
great new products and the pace of those new products.”  The company last year introduced redesigned versions of two
of its top sellers, the Fusion family sedan and Escape sport-
utility vehicle. This year, the automaker is rolling out the
Lincoln MKZ sedan aimed at reviving its lagging luxury line.  Ford yesterday increased its quarterly dividend to 10 cents
a share, a move that will boost the annual payout to the Ford
family to more than $28 million. The first-quarter dividend,
which will cost the company about $380 million, will be payable
March 1, the automaker said yesterday in a statement.  Regional Profit  Ford earned $6.47 billion before taxes in North America in
2012’s first nine months. The region generated an operating
profit margin of 11.2 percent during that period in an industry
where a 5 percent margin is respectable, as part of Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ’s product-development plan known
as One Ford.  While Ford’s hiring will increase costs, the automaker will
still meet its long-term pledge to keep profit margins in a
range of 8 percent to 10 percent, said  Brian Johnson , an analyst
with Barclays Plc, who rates Ford overweight.  “The rebound in the U.S. market has given them more
latitude to put more investments back in the product line and
still be at the high end of their 8 to 10 percent margin
guidance,” said Johnson, who expects Ford North American
margins to top 10 percent this year. “If investors are looking
for 11 to 12 percent margins and growth, they’ll likely to be
disappointed. Ford’s more likely to err on the side of keeping
the brand franchise healthy.”  CEO’s Record  Ford  rose  1.2 percent to $14 at the close in  New York . The
shares have gained 8.1 percent this year after advancing 20
percent in 2012.  Mulally has led Ford to 14 consecutive  quarters of net
income  as the automaker boosted margins through his One Ford
global product-development plan. Mulally, 67, is trying to boost
profits by selling the same models worldwide, rather than
different versions for various regions.  Ford is more than halfway to its commitment to add 12,000
new U.S. jobs by 2015, made as part of the company’s 2011
contract with the United Auto Workers union, according to the
statement.  Ford has forecast that its North American production will
rise to 750,000 vehicles in the first quarter, an 11 percent
increase from a year earlier.  Ford ended last year with 28,000 salaried workers, up from
25,000 in 2009, when U.S. auto sales plunged to a 27-year low.
The company had 38,600 white-collar employees in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
