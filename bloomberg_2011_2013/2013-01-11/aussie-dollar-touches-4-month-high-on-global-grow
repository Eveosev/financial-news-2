The Australian dollar weakened from
a level that matched the highest in almost four months as
technical indicators signaled gains in the currency may have
been too rapid.  The so-called Aussie slid versus most of its 16 major
counterparts after data showed inflation in  China , the South
Pacific nation’s biggest trading partner, quickened more than
expected and spurred concern policy makers will struggle to
balance price gains and growth.  New Zealand ’s currency retreated
from a three-week high as Asian stocks pared an earlier advance.  “The fact that the Aussie struggled so hard to break
through the $1.06 level and didn’t quite make it made people
wonder whether it’s due for a little bit of a pullback,” said
 Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist at  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  in Sydney. “It’s broadly going to be supported on dips.”  The Australian dollar lost 0.1 percent to $1.0584 as of
4:55 p.m. in Sydney after earlier rising to $1.0599, matching
the high reached yesterday that was the strongest level since
Sept. 14. It gained 0.2 percent to 94.29 yen. New Zealand’s
dollar touched 84.61 U.S. cents, the most since Dec. 17, before
trading at 84.26, 0.4 percent lower than yesterday’s close. It
bought 75.06 yen from 75.08 in  New York .  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares was little changed
from yesterday earlier gaining as much as 0.3 percent.  Relative Strength  The Australian dollar’s relative strength index versus the
greenback reached 68 yesterday, near the 70 level that some
traders see as a sign it has risen too quickly and may be due to
reverse course. Against the yen, it was at 78 today.  China’s National Bureau of Statistics said today the
 consumer price index  rose 2.5 percent last month from a year
earlier. That compares with the 2.3 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey and a 2 percent gain in November.  Gains in the Aussie were capped as National  Australia  Bank
Ltd. lowered its estimate for the nation’s growth this year to 2
percent from 2.5 percent previously. The  Reserve Bank  of
Australia’s key rate will probably fall to 2.25 percent in the
third quarter from the current 3 percent, analysts led by Chief
Economist  Alan Oster  wrote in a report today.  “With the economy continuing to weaken and unemployment
set to rise noticeably through 2013, the RBA will need to cut
significantly further than previously expected,” economists at
the Melbourne-based lender wrote.  Rate Bets  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 77 percent chance RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will cut the
cash rate to a record 2.75 percent or lower by the middle of
this year. Central bank policy makers will next meet on Feb. 5.  The Australian dollar gained 0.2 percent in the past week,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, a set of
gauges that track 10 developed-nation currencies. Its New
Zealand counterpart rose 0.6 percent.  Physical  iron ore  with 62 percent content at the Chinese
port of Tianjin advanced to $158.50 a ton on Jan. 8, the highest
close since October 2011, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The
metal is Australia’s biggest export.  Australia’s 10-year bond fell, pushing the yield up as much
as six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.5 percent, a
level unseen since Aug. 17. It closed the day at 3.47 percent.
New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to interest-rate
expectations, fell one basis point to 2.80 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
