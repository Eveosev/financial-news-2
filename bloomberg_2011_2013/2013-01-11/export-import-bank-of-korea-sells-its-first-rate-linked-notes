Export-Import Bank of Korea  sold its
first structured notes linked to  interest rates  as it seeks to
lure investors looking for higher coupons amid slumping
benchmark yields.  The state-owned lender, known as Kexim, issued 40 billion
won ($37.8 million) of notes on Dec. 28 tied to rates for
certificates of deposit, Lee Hae Sung, senior manager at the
Seoul-based bank’s treasury department, said by phone. The 15-
year callable securities pay 4 percent annually for days when
the 91-day CD rate stays below 6 percent, according to data
compiled by Nice Pricing Inc., a bond-price assessment company
in  Seoul .  The CD measure, which South Korean banks use as a benchmark
for short-term lending, dropped to the lowest level in almost
two years in October after the country’s central bank cut
interest rates for the second time last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The reference yield was at 2.87 percent
on Jan. 10, according to Bloomberg data.  Shinyoung Securities Co., a Seoul-based brokerage house,
bought the notes, Lee said.  “For investors, just a little bit of enhancement in yields
can be an attractive investment target these days,” Lee said.  Kexim may issue as much as 400 billion won of structured
notes in 2013, though the bank won’t consider more complex
products than single-range accruals, Lee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
