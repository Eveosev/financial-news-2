The Federal Trade Commission sued to
shut down an alleged $220 million telemarketing scheme operating
out of the Empire State Building, saying it has victimized
thousands of people, including the elderly and disabled.  The Tax Club Inc. has duped victims interested in working
at home or setting up Internet businesses, charging them
thousands of dollars for nonexistent small-business development
services, according to court papers filed yesterday in federal
court in  Manhattan  by the FTC and the attorneys general of New
York and  Florida .  “The defendants promise, but fail to deliver, customized
tax advice, personalized business planning and individualized
business credit counseling, all supposedly provided by
experienced professionals with specialized expertise,” the
government agencies said in the court papers.  The Tax Club began in  Utah  and expanded to comprise at
least 12 companies controlled by four individuals and run from
the 60th floor of the landmark Manhattan office tower, the FTC
and states said in court papers. They asked for an order
shutting down the businesses, freezing their assets and
appointing a temporary receiver.  The scheme has been in operation since at least 2008, they
said.  Judith Archer, who represents all but one of the
defendants, declined to comment on the allegations. Michael
Hartmere, who represents an individual defendant, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Tax Club Inc.,
1:13-cv-00210, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
