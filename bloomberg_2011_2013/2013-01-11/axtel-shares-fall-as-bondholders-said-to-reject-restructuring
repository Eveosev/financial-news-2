Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO)  plunged the most in three
weeks after a creditor group said it would reject the company’s
restructuring offer.  The stock of Mexico’s second-largest land-line phone
carrier fell 3.9 percent to 3.19 pesos at 1:59 p.m. in Mexico
City. Shares of the company, based in San Pedro Garza Garcia,
earlier dropped as much as 5.4 percent, the biggest decline on
an intraday basis since Dec. 21.  Bondholders controlling 40 percent of Axtel’s dollar notes
will reject the Mexican phone company’s restructuring offer,
Bloomberg News reported yesterday, citing a letter obtained from
two investors in a creditor group.  Axtel, struggling with record losses as it tries to compete
with billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s America Movil SAB, has offered to
swap debt for new notes and cash in a restructuring that BCP
Securities valued at 54 cents on the dollar.  The phone company’s investor relations chief, Adrian de los Santos, and press official Julio Salinas didn’t respond to e-
mails and calls seeking comment yesterday on the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
