Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker by market value, said it will eliminate as many
as 800 jobs in the U.K. this year as the European auto market
may shrink for the sixth year in a row.  The manufacturer will start talks with labor
representatives for the cutbacks, which it plans to implement by
about the second quarter, Tokyo-based Honda said today in an e-
mailed statement. The company’s plant in Swindon, England, has a
workforce of 3,500 people, said Fiona Cole, a spokeswoman.  “These conditions of sustained low industry demand require
us to take difficult decisions,” Ken Keir, executive vice
president of Honda Motor Europe, said in the statement. “We are
setting the business constitution at the right level to ensure
long-term stability and security.”  Car sales across Europe are declining as unemployment and a
recession in the countries using the euro discourage consumers
from making large purchases.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Europe’s
second-biggest carmaker, forecast on Jan. 9 that the market will
shrink by as much as 5 percent this year.  Among Japan’s three biggest carmakers, Honda is the least
reliant on Europe, with the region accounting for only about 7
percent of total revenue, compared with about 11 percent at
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and 15 percent at  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , according
to estimates at BNP Paribas SA.  Honda’s 11-month sales in Europe fell 6.2 percent from a
year earlier to 131,348 vehicles, propelled by a 15 percent drop
in November. That compares with a 7.2 percent industrywide
contraction in the period to 11.7 million cars, according to the
European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
