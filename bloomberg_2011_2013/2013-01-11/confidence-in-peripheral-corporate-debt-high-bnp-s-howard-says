Mark Howard , managing director of
credit research at  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , said that increased bond
sales from companies in Europe’s most troubled economies is due
to improved investor confidence.  “There is a lot of confidence right now in policy makers,
at the ECB in particular, and confidence that risk assets are
going to do well,” Howard said on Bloomberg Television’s
“Lunch Money” with Stephanie Ruhle.  Demand for higher-yielding corporate bonds was in
countries, “where the broader buyer base can participate,”
Howard said. Those countries include Ireland, Portugal and
Spain, he said.  Companies in the periphery are selling more bonds than in
any time in the past three months due to investor demand for 
high returns.  Investor demand for peripheral company bonds has pushed
yields on the debt down to a record 2.56 percent, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Periphery Non-Financial Index
shows. That’s still 100 basis points more than notes issued by
companies in Europe’s core nations including Germany and France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
