Gasoline slid as  Brent crude 
retreated after the restart of the expanded Seaway oil pipeline
increased the flow of domestic crude to the  Gulf Coast , reducing
the demand for waterborne imports.  Futures fell as weaker Brent prices reduced the cost of
foreign oil used by U.S. refiners and of gasoline imports. The
500-mile (805-kilometer) line running from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to
Freeport,  Texas , has resumed full service after shutting Jan. 2
to complete the final connections necessary to expand its
capacity to 400,000 barrels a day from 150,000 barrels.  “This is taking the pressure off Brent crude and could
translate into lower product prices across the board,” said
 Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
Chicago. “You’re alleviating the glut, getting it out to the
refiners who can actually buy the stuff, and they can put more
product out into the global marketplace.”  Gasoline for February delivery fell 5.77 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.7356 a gallon at 10:08 on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Prices touched $2.7266, the lowest intraday level
since Dec. 24.  The expansion of the line, operated by Enterprise Products
Partners LP and Enbridge Inc., is expected to shrink record
levels of oil supplies at Cushing and reduce imports to the Gulf
Coast. The pipeline, which formerly carried imported crude north
to Cushing, was reversed in May and closed Jan. 2 to expand its
capacity.  “Products and Brent are significantly weaker than WTI,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. “The startup of Seaway will enable increased volumes
of Midcontinent crude to reach the Gulf Coast, impacting
Atlantic Basin crude oil supplies.”  Brent Declines  Brent for February settlement fell $1.62, or 1.5 percent,
to $110.27 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the biggest decline since Dec. 6. The European
benchmark grade’s premium to West Texas Intermediate shrank
$1.01 to $17.06 a barrel, the narrowest gap since Sept. 21.  Heating oil for February delivery fell 3.83 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.016 a gallon on the exchange.  The average nationwide  retail price  for regular gasoline
gained 0.3 cent to $3.313 a gallon, AAA said today on its
website. That’s the highest price since Dec. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
