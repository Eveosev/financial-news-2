Sydney Airport (SYD) , owner of  Australia ’s
largest international airstrip, fell the most in 13 months after
Morgan Stanley said it may have to raise equity to meet about
A$3.6 billion ($3.8 billion) of spending needs.  The stock  slumped  5.5 percent to A$3.08 at the close of
Sydney trading, the biggest decline since Dec. 6, 2011. The
airport operator dropped below its  200-day moving average  price
and trading volume was more than six times the daily level in
the past three months.  Today’s drop took Sydney Airport’s stock loss in the past
two sessions to 7.2 percent. The company may need to spend about
A$500 million to repurchase leases on its terminal 3 and Jet
Base sites from Qantas Airways Ltd., buy out minority stakes
valued at about A$1.1 billion, and commit A$2 billion to  capital
spending  for a long-term plan on its operations, according to
Scott Kelly, a Sydney-based Morgan Stanley analyst.  “It is likely there may be some equity required,” Kelly,
who rates the stock equal-weight, wrote in a note dated Jan. 9.  Tracy Ong, a Sydney-based spokeswoman for the airport
company, said by e-mail that she couldn’t comment on market
speculation.  Sydney Airport has a market value of A$5.73 billion and
annual capital expenditure averaged A$295 million over its most
recent five fiscal years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
