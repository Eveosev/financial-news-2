Liverpool reached an out-of-court
settlement with former owners  Tom Hicks  and  George Gillett  over
the forced sale of the 18-time English soccer champion.  Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group, then known as
New England Sports Ventures, in 2010 for 300 million pounds
($483 million). Gillett and Hicks were unhappy with the handling
of the sale to the group headed by Boston Red Sox owner  John Henry , with Hicks describing it as an “epic swindle.”  Hicks and Gillett said the transaction wasn’t done
transparently, with then-club directors Martin Broughton and
Christian Purslow and current managing director Ian Ayre
concealing negotiations with Henry from them. The former owners
also claimed that the team was sold below its market value, and
cited a Forbes magazine estimate that said it was worth 533
million pounds.  Broughton, Purslow and Ayre all denied the accusations,
resulting in a lawsuit brought by Hicks and Gillett.  “The parties have now agreed a settlement (the terms of
which are confidential),” the club said in a  statement  on its
website. “All claims and allegations made against Messrs.
Broughton, Purslow and Ayre have been withdrawn by Messrs. Hicks
and Gillett and all legal proceedings between the parties
concluded.”  Liverpool said neither side would have further comment on
the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
