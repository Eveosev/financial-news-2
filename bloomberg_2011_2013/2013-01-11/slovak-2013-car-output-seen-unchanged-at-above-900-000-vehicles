Carmakers in  Slovakia  will probably
maintain output in 2013 at last year’s level of more than
900,000 vehicles, driven by “attractive” models and emerging-
market demand, the country’s Car Industry Association said.  The combined output of the local units of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,
 Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  and  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  surged about 41 percent
last year, Jaroslav Holecek, the association’s president, said
at a press conference in Bratislava, Slovakia, today without
disclosing data for individual companies. In 2011, the three
companies assembled 639,763 vehicles.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is relying on
carmakers to drive economic  growth  at a time when the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis and government austerity measures are
hurting demand. Car production jumped 48 percent in the first 11
months of 2012 compared with the same period the previous year.
Slovak 11-month industrial output increased 11.5 percent.  “We have a very attractive product mix, ranging from small
cars to sport-utility vehicles,” Holecek said. “Moreover,
carmakers here produce for a global rather then regional market
and demand from countries such as Russia or  China  is helping to
offset western Europe’s weakness.”  Volkswagen in late 2011 started to assemble the so-called
New Small Family subcompact models in Bratislava, adding to SUVs
already produced in the east European country. The company
planned to make a record 400,000 cars in Slovakia in 2012.  Kia, which makes Sportage SUVs as well as the cee’d and
Venga models in Zilina, northern Slovakia, said yesterday it
produced a record 292,000 vehicles in 2012. This year, it plans
to assemble 290,000 cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
