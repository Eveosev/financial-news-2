Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  Chief Financial
Officer Tim Sloan said concerns about the fiscal cliff debate
may have stimulated customers to get loans instead of damping
economic activity.  The congressional effort to avert tax increases and
spending cuts had a slightly positive effect as customers sought
to secure money before lawmakers made a decision, Sloan said
today during the San Francisco-based lender’s quarterly earnings
conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
