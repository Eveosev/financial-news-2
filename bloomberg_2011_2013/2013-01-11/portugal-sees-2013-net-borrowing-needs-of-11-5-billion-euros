Portugal  said net borrowing needs
will be about 11.5 billion euros ($15 billion) in 2013, when it
plans to regain access to bond markets after requesting a
bailout two years ago.  Net financing from issuing treasury bills will reach 5
billion euros, government debt agency IGCP said today on its
 website . Portugal auctioned 22 billion euros of bills in 2012,
though it hasn’t auctioned bonds since requesting a bailout in
April 2011.  “If market conditions allow and demand for Portuguese
bonds in the secondary market continues to reveal positive
developments, possible primary issuance of existing bond lines
will be explored,” the agency said in the statement. The IGCP
said it will also continue to explore opportunities to exchange
bonds this year and will consider debt buybacks.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling a deepening
recession as he raises taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-
euro aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . Portugal aims to regain access to bond markets by
September 2013 and Passos Coelho has said if the country can’t
do that for “external reasons,” it would be able to rely on
continued support from the IMF and the EU.  Falling Yields  Portuguese bond yields have dropped as the government
complies with terms of the bailout. Yields peaked a year ago,
when  Standard & Poor’s  cut Portugal’s credit rating to non-
investment grade, or junk, following  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s
Investors Service.  The difference in yield that investors demand to hold
Portugal’s 10-year bonds instead of German bunds has narrowed to
4.6 percentage points from 16 percentage points on Jan. 31,
2012. Portugal’s two-year note yield has dropped to 3.48
percent, while 10-year bonds yield 6.21 percent. The cost of the
aid program financing to Portugal is about 3.2 percent, Finance
Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Dec. 18.  Portugal has to meet a 5.8 billion-euro September 2013 bond
redemption without relying on the EU-led rescue program, which
extends until the middle of 2014. The debt agency on Oct. 3
exchanged 3.76 billion euros of securities due in September 2013
for the same value of notes maturing in October 2015, reducing
its repayment burden for next year.  Portugal plans to increase the volume of trading in its
bonds before resuming sales of longer-maturity debt, Joao Moreira Rato, chairman of the country’s debt agency, said in an
Oct. 15 interview.  OMT Terms  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said on Sept.
6 that debt purchases may be considered for euro-area countries
currently under bailout programs, such as Greece, Portugal and
Ireland, when they regain bond- market access . The measure,
called Outright Monetary Transactions, “would not apply to
countries that are under a full-adjustment program until full-
market access will be obtained,” Draghi said on Oct. 4. “The
OMT is not a replacement” for a lack of primary-market access,
he said.  The government forecasts  debt  will peak at 122.3 percent of
gross domestic product in 2014 after reaching 122.2 percent in
2013. The government projects GDP will shrink 1 percent in 2013
after contracting 3 percent in 2012. Economic growth has
averaged less than 1 percent a year for the past decade, placing
Portugal among  Europe ’s weakest performers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
