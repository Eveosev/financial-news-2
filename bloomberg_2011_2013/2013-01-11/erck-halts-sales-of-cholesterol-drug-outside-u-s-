Merck & Co. (MRK)  will stop selling the
cholesterol drug Tredaptive, marketed outside the U.S., after a
the treatment was shown to be ineffective and potentially
harmful in a study.  The medicine is approved in 70 countries and sold in 40,
the  Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-based company said in a
statement today. Merck said last month it wouldn’t seek U.S.
approval after findings revealed Tredaptive didn’t reduce heart
attacks or stroke and led to non-fatal serious side effects.  Tredaptive combines the vitamin niacin and the medicine
laropiprant, added to reduce a face-flushing effect of the drug.
The pill generated less than $20 million in 2012. A risk-
assessment committee had recommended to European regulators that
sales be suspended because of the safety concerns.  “Patients currently taking Tredaptive are our priority,
and we are committed to continue to work with regulatory
agencies around the world to ensure that physicians have
appropriate information as we take steps to suspend the
availability of Tredaptive,” Michael Rosenblatt, Merck’s chief
medical officer, said in the statement.  Merck rose 1.1 percent to $43.23 at the close of  New York 
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
