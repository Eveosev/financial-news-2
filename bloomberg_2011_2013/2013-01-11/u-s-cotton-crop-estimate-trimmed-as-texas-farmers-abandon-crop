The cotton crop in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter, will be 1.4 percent smaller
than estimated a month ago as more farmers in  Texas  left
fields unharvested, the government said. Analysts expected
production to be little changed.  The crop, which was mostly harvested in 2012, totaled
17.01 million bales, down from the December estimate of
17.26 million, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
today in a report. Nine analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
estimated output at 17.24 million bales, on average. The
previous crop was 15.57 million bales, each weighing 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Estimated production in Texas, the top growing state,
“is too high and final production will be at or near the
low end” of what merchants are expecting, or about 5
million bales,  Sharon Johnson , a market specialist for
Knight Futures in Atlanta, said in a report before the
figures were released. Last month, the USDA estimated the
Texas crop at 5.515 million bales.  Cotton has plunged 66 percent from a record $2.197 a
pound in March 2011 as demand slumped and global production
increased. The March contract rose 0.8 percent to 75.8
cents on ICE Futures U.S. in New York at 9:51 a.m.  Yields in the U.S. averaged 866 pounds per acre, the
USDA said, up from 793 pounds estimated last month. The
figure was 790 pounds in the previous year.  Export Forecast  U.S. growers will export 12.2 million bales in the
marketing year that began Aug. 1, up from 11.71 million in
the previous 12 months, the USDA said. Unsold supplies at
the end of the year will total 4.8 million bales, up
percent from 3.35 million a year earlier, according to the
report. Last month, the surplus was projected at 5.4
million bales.  World output will reach 118.83 million bales, down
from 124.13 million in the previous year, the USDA said.
Last month’s estimate was 116.9 million bales.  Global consumption will total 106.06 million bales, up
2.9 percent from 103.09 million in the previous year, the
department said. Stockpiles on July 31 will reach 81.72
million bales, up 2.6 percent from 79.64 million forecast
in December, the USDA said.  Estimated inventories in  China , the biggest user of
the fiber, will be 40.61 million bales at the end of the
marketing year, up 8 percent from the December estimate of
37.61 million, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
