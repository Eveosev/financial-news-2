American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
supplier of wind-turbine components, said  China ’s Supreme
People’s Court will review a lower court’s decision dismissing a
intellectual-property lawsuit against Sinovel Wind Group Co.  The date of the review has not been set, AMSC said today in
a statement. China’s highest court agreed in May to hear the
case, the smallest of four suits the Devens, Massachusetts-based
company is pursuing against its former largest customer.  AMSC is seeking a total of more than $1.2 billion in
damages in Chinese courts, alleging that Sinovel violated sales
contracts and stole its technology. The company spent about
$300,000 in the third quarter on its legal battle with China’s
second-biggest turbine maker.  AMSC shares gained 0.4 percent to $2.77 at 10:35 a.m. in
 New York . Sinovel contributed about 70 percent of its revenue in
fiscal 2010, before the turbine company stopped accepting
shipments in March 2011.  Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. is China’s
largest turbine maker by revenue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
