Colombia’s  exports  fell 8.2 percent
to $4.73 billion in November compared with the same month last
year, the government statistics agency said today in a report on
its website.  Exports rose 5.8 percent in October from the same month
last year.  The central bank cited lower export growth in its decision
to cut interest rates at four of its last six policy meetings,
arguing that a slowdown in the global economy has curbed demand
for the Andean nation’s products.  Banco de la Republica cut its  benchmark interest rate  a
quarter point to 4.25 percent in its last meeting of 2012,
saying that the Colombian economy is growing below its potential
and that inflation and inflation expectations have fallen below
the 3 percent midpoint of the target range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
