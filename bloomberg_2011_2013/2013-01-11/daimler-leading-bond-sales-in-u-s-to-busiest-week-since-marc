Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) 
led companies in the busiest week for  dollar-denominated bond
sales  in 10 months as relative yields narrowed amid a rush of
foreign borrowers looking to secure rates that reached record
lows.  Daimler, the world’s third-largest maker of luxury
vehicles, raised $3 billion and Torino, Italy-based Intesa
issued $3.5 billion of debt as they headed  sales  of at least
$52.4 billion, the most since $60.4 billion in the five days
ended March 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
increased from  $13.6 billion  last week and are about double the
2012 weekly average of $28.2 billion.  Sales rose as companies began reporting earnings, with
profit at Standard & Poor’s 500 Index members expected to
increase 2.5 percent, according to analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Yields touched an unprecedented 3.543 percent on Jan.
9. Investors are showing a stronger appetite for risk, luring
more foreign banks into selling dollar debt, Mizuho Securities
USA Inc.’s Timothy Cox said.  “Year-end is behind us so people can take a little bit
more risk; you don’t have the window dressing that you have at
the end of the year, when people keep their portfolios fairly
clean,” Cox, the New York-based executive director of debt
capital markets, said in a telephone interview. “Yankee banks
have a big demand to raise capital and globally they’re looking
to come into the States.”  Relative Yields  The extra yield investors demand to own U.S. corporate
bonds rather than government debentures decreased to 217 basis
points yesterday from 220 basis points on Jan. 4, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield
index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Yields fell to 3.55 percent as of yesterday from 3.6
percent on Jan 4, index data show.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $45.6
billion, compared with  $12.1 billion  last week and a 2012 weekly
average of $21.4 billion, Bloomberg data show.  Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, sold $750 million
of two-year, floating-rate notes to yield 60 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate, $1.25 billion of 1.25
percent, three-year debt to yield 90 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $1 billion of 1.875 percent,
five-year securities at a spread of 115 basis points, Bloomberg
data show.  Europe ‘Calm’  Intesa,  Italy ’s second-largest lender, offered its first
benchmark sale in the U.S. in almost two years. The bank sold $2
billion of 3.125 percent, three-year securities at a relative
yield of 275 basis points and $1.5 billion of 3.875 percent,
five-year debentures at a 310 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show. Benchmark offerings are typically more than $500 million.  “ Europe  looks calm and the world banking system has
strengthened,”  James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist at
Wells Fargo Funds Management LLC in Menomonee Falls,  Wisconsin ,
said in an interview. “Yields are near record lows in
investment grade and appetite remains strong.”  Yields on high-grade debt decreased to 2.78 percent
yesterday from 2.82 percent on Jan. 4, and compare with a record
low 2.732 percent on Nov. 8, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate index. Spreads decreased 1 basis
point to 145 basis points.  Of the 27 companies that have reported earnings from the
S&P 500 index, 22 posted earnings that beat analyst estimates
while 19 reported sales that exceeded estimates, Bloomberg data
show.  Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6.8
billion, compared with  $1.6 billion  last week and matching a
2012 weekly average of $6.8 billion, Bloomberg data show.  Bombardier Offering  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , the third-largest commercial aircraft
maker, sold $2 billion of bonds in its first sale in about 10
months. The Montreal-based company issued $750 million of 4.25
percent, three-year securities at a spread of 389 basis points
and $1.25 billion of 6.125 percent, 10-year debt at 427 basis
points, Bloomberg data show.  The company postponed an issue of $1 billion of eight- and
10-year notes on Nov. 15, pointing to unsatisfactory market
conditions.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s.  Yields on junk debt fell to a record-low 6.53 percent
yesterday from 6.62 percent on Jan. 4, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index. Spreads decreased
10 basis points to 494 basis points.  Issuers planning sales include energy company Atlas
Resource Partners LP with $250 million of eight-year notes and
