(Corrects company spelling in second paragraph.)  Copper supply will lag behind demand
for the “next few years,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  Demand may climb about 5.5 percent a year over the period,
Fraser Jamieson, an analyst at JPMorgan’s Cazenove in  London ,
said in a report dated today. Copper has a high correlation to
improving industrial production, he said.  “We recognize near-term risk, with Chinese imports
underwhelming and high inventories, but would see any sustained
weakness as an opportunity to add selective exposure.” His top
equity picks are Antofagasta Plc, Inmet Corp., Southern Copper
Corp. and PanAust Ltd., according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
