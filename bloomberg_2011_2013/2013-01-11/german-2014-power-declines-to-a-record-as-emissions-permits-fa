Power contracts for 2014 delivery in
 Germany  and  France  slid to record lows as December European
Union emissions permits dropped to the lowest since trading
began in April 2008.  German 2014 power, a European benchmark, lost as much as
0.5 percent while the equivalent French contract fell 0.3
percent, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Carbon
allowances for December declined as much as 3.1 percent.  German baseload power, for supplies delivered around the
clock, fell as much as 20 cents to a record 44.20 euros ($58.67)
a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
The contract traded at 44.21 euros as of 4:55 p.m. Berlin time.
French year-ahead electricity fell 15 cents to 46.85 euros, the
lowest since the contract started trading in January 2011.  EU carbon permits for December slid as much as 19 cents to
a record 5.86 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London . Power can track fuel and emissions prices,
which affect the cost of production at plants that burn fossil
fuels.  “Power demand has reached its peak and is expected to drop
by about 1 percent each year on energy efficiency measures,”
Per Lekander, a Paris-based analyst at  UBS AG (UBSN) , said in an e-
mailed research note. “The renewables boom across  Central
Europe  is a key negative driver for power prices.”  The share of renewables in German power production rose to
21.9 percent in 2012 from 20.3 percent in 2011, the BDEW utility
lobby said in a report yesterday.  Next-Week Power  Power contracts for next-week delivery in Germany erased
earlier gains dropping 0.1 percent to 54.35 euros a megawatt-
hour, while the equivalent French contract was unchanged at
63.50 euros, broker data show.  Low temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to decline to

Paris are expected to fall to minus 5 degrees on Jan. 17,
