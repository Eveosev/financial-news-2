The Brussels prosecutor’s office
issued a negative opinion on  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) 
Chief Executive Officer  Bernard Arnault ’s request for
naturalization in Belgium,  De Morgen  reported, citing Jean-Marc
Meilleur, a spokesman for the office.  Meilleur didn’t elaborate on the report to the
parliamentary committee handling naturalization requests, the
newspaper said. A separate report by Belgium’s immigration
affairs service last month also was negative,  De Morgen  said.  The reports state that Arnault doesn’t fulfill the
condition of having his main residence in Belgium for at least
three years and the prosecutor’s office also cited uncertainty
over the construction around Arnault’s business network in
Belgium, according to the newspaper.  The country’s security services also must submit a report,
as opinions from the three agencies are required on all requests
for Belgian citizenship. The parliamentary committee isn’t bound
by the opinions and under Belgian law the condition of main
residence can be circumvented if the applicant can prove a bond
with Belgium in the past three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
