Kazakhstan, the biggest energy
producer in central Asia, plans to almost double processing
capacity its three refineries to 21 million metric tons by 2022,
state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co. said.  The plants handled 11.4 million tons of crude in 2011, the
Astana-based company said in a statement e-mailed today.
KazMunaiGaz owns Atyrau and Pavlodar refineries, and jointly
owns the Shymkent facility with China National Petroleum Corp.  Shymkent increased crude processing by 3.2 percent to 4.75
million tons last year from a year earlier, while Atyrau handled
by 1.1 percent less at 4.42 million tons, Interfax said today
citing the  KazMunaiGaz unit . The Pavlodar refinery planned to
process 5 milion tons in 2012, Interfax reported.  -- Editors: Raj Rajendran, Torrey Clark  To contact the reporter on this story:
