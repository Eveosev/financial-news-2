CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
said its wind park in eastern  Romania , the largest in Europe, is
expected to earn the company 1.3 billion koruna ($67 million)
more in 2012 than it did the year before.  For the three quarters ended Sept. 30 CEZ earned 1 billion
koruna more from its 600-megawatt Fantanele-Cogealac wind farm,
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, than it
did for the same period in 2011, Barbora Pulpanova, a
spokeswoman for Prague-based CEZ said by e-mail. This is
expected to grow to 1.3 billion koruna for the full-year.  The increase in earnings is driven by the final completion
of the wind farm and the connection of all the turbines to the
grid, Pulpanova said. She declined to disclose the total
earnings from the project.  CEZ connected the final turbine at the wind farm in the
province of Dobrudja to the grid in November. It’s  Europe ’s
biggest land-based wind facility and it generates enough power
for as many as 1 million homes. CEZ has invested 1.1 billion
euros ($1.5 billion) in the project.  When CEZ started building its wind farm in 2008 Romania had
just 14 megawatts of installed wind capacity, said the
spokeswoman. Since then the company has seen “large wind
business development” in the country and predicts that within
10 years wind power will “significantly” help the country to
boost its energy production from renewables.  Romania, which approved a law giving incentives to
investments in renewable energy, had 982 megawatts of wind power
installed at the end of 2011, more than double the 462 megawatts
of capacity it had a year earlier, according to the European
Wind Energy Association.  The incentives have been attracting investors including  GDF
Suez (GSZ)  which said Dec. 21 it plans to develop a 50-megawatt wind
park in the country’s southeast. On Dec. 17 a venture between
 Italy ’s  ERG SpA (ERG)  and  Russia ’s OAO Lukoil bought an 84-megawatt
wind development in Romania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
