U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline sank to a
two-week low as  demand  for motor fuel slumped to the least in 11
months in the U.S. and  stockpiles  on the Gulf increased.  Nationwide, gasoline use slipped by almost 6 percent to
8.01 million barrels a day in the week ended Jan. 4, the lowest
level since Feb. 3, according data from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. Inventories of gasoline on the Gulf
advanced 1.15 million barrels to  81.4 million .  The discount for  reformulated  gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or RBOB, widened 4.75 cents to 15.25 cents a gallon
versus futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:53 p.m.,
the widest gap since Dec. 27.  Conventional gasoline  also slid 1
cent to trade at a 14 cents under futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf gained 0.63 cent to a
0.13 cent premium versus heating oil futures. The same fuel rose
1.63 cents to 5.63 cents over futures in  New York  Harbor.  Distillate stockpiles retreated by 125,000 barrels to 23.7
million last week in the Central Atlantic region, known as PADD
1B, which includes New York and  New Jersey .  To contact the reporters on this story:
