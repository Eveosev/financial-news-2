Saudi Arabia may have used some of
the heavy crude it has in storage to meet export requirements
last month, according to an analyst based in the kingdom.  Demand for heavy crude rises in the Northern Hemisphere
winter as it yields more fuel oil, said Sadad al-Husseini, who
runs Husseini Energy, a consulting company he founded after
retiring from Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Fuel oil is used in power
generation in some Asian markets.  Saudi Arabia cut output in December to 9.025 million
barrels a day, the lowest level in 19 months, a person with
knowledge of the kingdom’s energy policy said yesterday. The
kingdom exported 9.151 million barrels a day, drawing the extra
oil from inventories, the official said.  Saudi Arabia prefers to store light crude grades in winter
as demand for heavier crude rises, he said. If there is
increased demand for heavy crude, Saudi Arabia responds by
supplying from inventories instead of boosting output, he said.  “This stabilizes Saudi production levels more,” said al-
Husseini, who is based in Dharan, Saudi Arabia. He was executive
vice president of exploration and development at Saudi Aramco
before leaving in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
