EnergySolutions Inc. (ES) , which services
nuclear reactors, was sued by an investor who says the stock is
undervalued in a proposed $3.75-a-share takeover offer by Energy
Capital Partners II LLC.  Lawyers for Terry Printz contend that directors have a duty
to get the best price for the shares, and that EnergySolutions
is worth more than the total $1.1 billion offer, according to a
complaint made public today in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington.  “The proposed transaction is unfair and grossly inadequate
because, among other things, the intrinsic value of
EnergySolutions common stock is materially in excess of the
amount offered given the company’s recent financial
performance,” plaintiff’s lawyers said in court papers.  Printz is asking a judge to award the suit group status on
behalf of all outside shareholders, to stop the transaction
under its present terms and to award unspecified damages and
legal fees.  Salt Lake City-based EnergySolutions rose 2 cents to $3.83
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading at 1:03 p.m.  Mark Walker, a spokesman for EnergySolutions, said in an e-
mailed statement that the company would have no comment on the
lawsuit.  The case is Printz v. Rogel and EnergySolutions, CA8203,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
