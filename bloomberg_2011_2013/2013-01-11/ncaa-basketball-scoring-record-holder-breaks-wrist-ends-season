Jack Taylor  of Grinnell College, who
scored 138 points to break college basketball’s 58-year-old
single-game scoring record, is out for the season after breaking
his wrist.  The 22-year-old sophomore guard at the Division III school
in Grinnell,  Iowa , broke the radius of his shooting arm during a
game Jan. 9, the  Associated Press  said, citing college spokesman
Ted Schultz.  Taylor, who was averaging 36.3 points per game, scored 11
points in six minutes of play before he injured his arm,
according to the team’s website. Grinnell (9-3) won the game
119-117 against Cornell College in  Mount Vernon , Iowa.  Taylor may have surgery in the next week and then require
as long as three months to recover, AP reported.  During his National Collegiate Athletic Association record-
breaking performance, Taylor made 52 of 108 field-goal attempts
Nov. 20, including 27 3-pointers, in a  179-104 win  over Faith
Baptist Bible College.  The performance broke the record of 113 points, set by
Clarence “Bevo” Francis of Division II Rio Grande in 1954.  To contact the reporter on this story:
