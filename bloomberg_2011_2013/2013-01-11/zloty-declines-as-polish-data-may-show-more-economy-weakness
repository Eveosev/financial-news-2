The zloty slid for a second day as
reports next week may show Poland’s economic situation continued
to worsen and inflation slowed.  The zloty weakened 0.8 percent to 4.1188 per euro as of
4:51 p.m. in Warsaw, the biggest decline since Jan. 4. The yield
on five-year notes rose 11 basis points to 3.63 percent.  Polish inflation probably slowed to the central bank’s goal
of 2.5 percent in December, while industrial output slumped the
most since April 2009, the statistics office will say next week,
according to median forecasts from analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The “collapse” in inflation will convince the
central bank to continue cutting  interest rates , Pasquale Diana
and Jaroslaw Strzalkowski, economists at Morgan Stanley, said in
a report today.  “Weaker economic growth and problems with this year’s
budget may limit zloty appreciation in the coming weeks,”
 Grzegorz Maliszewski , chief economist at Bank Millennium SA in
Warsaw, said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
