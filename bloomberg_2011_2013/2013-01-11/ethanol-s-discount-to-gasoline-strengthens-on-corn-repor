Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
futures strengthened the most in two months after a government
report showed that corn stockpiles in the U.S. were lower than
analysts expected.  The  spread  shrank 9.98 cents as the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said corn  inventories  dropped to the least in nine
years for December after drought reduced production and animal-
feed demand remained strong. Corn inventories totaled 8.03
billion bushels, less than the 8.219 billion average estimate of
26 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “A tighter corn balance table means they should slow down
production a little bit,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at
INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “We should squeeze margins
here and that should happen.”  The grain-based additive was 44.85 cents below the price of
the motor fuel based on prompt-month contracts for both
commodities. That was less than yesterday’s 54.83 cents, the
smallest gap since Dec. 18 and ethanol’s biggest jump versus
gasoline since Nov. 7.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 4.6 cents, or
2 percent, to settle at $2.291 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the highest price since Dec. 14. It was the steepest one-
day gain since Oct. 11. Prices have advanced 1.1 percent in the
past year.  Corn stockpiles were 17 percent smaller on Dec. 1 than a
year earlier, the  report  showed. Analysts were expecting a 15
percent decline. Inventories were 9.647 billion a year earlier.  One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol
in the U.S. About 4.5 billion bushels, or 42 percent of this
year’s crop, will go toward making the fuel, the USDA said in
the report today.  Corn Climbs  Corn for March delivery climbed 10 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $7.0875 a bushel in Chicago. Prices are up 20 percent in the
past year.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 27 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline for February delivery slumped 5.38 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.7395 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers RBOB, which is made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago rose 7.5 cents
to $2.275 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. In  New
York , the additive rose 8 cents to $2.365.  Ethanol on the West Coast jumped 5.5 cents to $2.39 a
gallon. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, the biofuel strengthened 7.5
cent to $2.325.  To contact the reporter on this story:
