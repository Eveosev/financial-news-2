Taiwan ’s dollar gained for a second
week, touching a 16-month high today, on speculation demand for
the island’s exports is improving as  China’s economy  recovers.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  Overseas sales from China, Taiwan’s biggest trading partner,
rose 14 percent from a year earlier in December, official data
showed yesterday. That compared with a 2.9 percent increase in
November. Chinese imports climbed 6 percent after staying at the
same level the month before. The island’s exports jumped 9
percent last month, following a 0.9 percent increase in November,
the government reported Jan. 7.  “Taiwan has the world’s biggest trade surplus with China,
and it looks like demand from China’s really picking up,” said
 Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong .
“There’ll be appreciation pressure for the currency for the
rest of the year, but the central bank will try to maintain its
relative stability.”  The Taiwan dollar rose 0.3 percent this week to NT$29.039,
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency climbed 0.2 percent today and touched NT$28.930, the
strongest level since Sept. 1, 2011. Global funds bought $106
million more local equities than they sold today, following net
buying of $324 million yesterday, exchange data show.  Counter Appreciation  Taiwan’s central bank has bought the greenback to counter
appreciation in the island’s currency during the final minutes
of trading on most days in the past nine months, according to
traders who asked not to be identified. The monetary authority’s
mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate stability and to
intervene in the event of abnormal moves, Governor Perng Fai-Nan
said Dec. 19.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a gauge
of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose
28 basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, during the five-day
period to 3.35 percent. It gained 17 basis points today.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022 was
little changed this week and today at 1.171 percent, according
to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending 
rate was steady at 0.387 percent, a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
