Investors should buy the dollar
versus the franc as bullish positions on the Swiss currency
climb to their highest level in more 17 months, indicating it
may have gained too much, too fast,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) 
recommended.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the franc compared with
those on a drop -- so-called  net longs  -- was 11,631 on Jan. 1,
the highest level since the week ended Aug. 5, according to data
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Traders had a net-short position in francs as recently as
November, the data showed.  The data suggest “franc positions are already long,
suggesting scope for unwinding,” London-based strategists at
the firm including Adrian Schmidt wrote today in a note to
clients. Schmidt wasn’t available to comment on the report.  The euro probably will also strengthen against the Swiss
currency, the analysts wrote.  The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 91.30 centimes today in  New
York  after gaining as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The euro
advanced 0.4 percent to 1.2181 and touched 1.2201, the strongest
level since December 2011.  The franc rose 2.5 percent versus the dollar in 2012 and
appreciated 0.7 percent against  Europe ’s shared currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
