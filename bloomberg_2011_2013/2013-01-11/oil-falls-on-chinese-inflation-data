Oil dropped as accelerating Chinese
inflation bolstered concern that economic stimulus may be
curbed. The spread between crude in New York and London narrowed
to the least in almost four months.  Futures fell 0.3 percent after the Chinese government said
prices rose the most in seven months. The discount of West Texas
Intermediate oil traded in New York to London’s Brent shrank
after  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) 
completed the Seaway pipeline expansion, providing an outlet for
record supplies in the central U.S.  “If Chinese inflation is accelerating, there may be less
room for stimulus, which would cool demand for oil in  China ,”
said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There should be plenty of oil
heading to the  Gulf Coast . We should see the spread continue to
come in rather quickly.”  Crude oil for February delivery fell 26 cents to $93.56 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was
12 percent above the 100-day average. Futures rose 0.5 percent
this week, the fifth weekly gain in a row. Prices settled at
$93.82 yesterday, the highest level since Sept. 18.  Brent oil for February settlement declined $1.25, or 1.1
percent, to $110.64 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume was 35 percent above the 100-day
average. The grade dropped 0.6 percent this week.  Premium Shrinks  The Chinese  consumer price index  rose 2.5 percent in
December from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics
said today in Beijing. That compares with the 2.3 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists and a 2 percent
gain in November.  “We’re probably seeing an overreaction to the Chinese
data,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “It looks like
the rise in inflation was due to cold weather. Once winter is
over, prices should ease.”  China, the largest oil-consuming country after the U.S.,
accounted for 11 percent of global demand in 2011, according to
 BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
shrank to $17.08 a barrel, the narrowest gap since Sept. 19, as
service resumed on the Seaway pipeline, which can now carry
400,000 barrels a day from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast.
Brent’s premium was $25.53 on Nov. 15.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if it dropped to $10 or less in
the next couple months,” Armstrong said.  Increasing Capacity  Supplies in Padd 2 , which includes the Midwest and Cushing,
climbed to a record 115.1 million barrels last week, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration said Jan. 9. Stockpiles at
Cushing, the delivery point for WTI, rose 332,000 barrels to a
record 50.1 million in the week ended Jan. 4, according to the
EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  “The WTI-Brent spread should narrow a bit more in the next
six weeks or so as Cushing stockpiles start to decline,” said
 Mike Wittner , head of oil-market research for the Americas at
 Societe Generale  in New York.  U.S. crude output  climbed 0.2 percent to 7 million barrels
a day last week, the highest level since 1993, the EIA said Jan.
9. Production has increased 17 of the last 18 weeks. The nation
will pump 7.92 million barrels a day in 2014, the agency said
Jan. 8 in the monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  expects to pump 700,000 barrels a day to
the Houston area from Cushing by mid- to late 2013 on the
southern leg of its Keystone XL pipeline, which began
construction last summer.  ‘Important Step’  “Production is rising at about 1 million barrels a day
this year,” Wittner said. “Seaway is an important step but on
its own won’t relieve the glut at Cushing. The opening of
Keystone later this year will add 700,000 barrels a day of
capacity and should have a major impact.”  Gasoline and heating oil, which have moved with Brent more
closely than with WTI for the past year, plunged today. Gasoline
for February delivery tumbled 5.38 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$2.7395 a gallon in  New York , the lowest settlement since Dec.
21. February heating oil decreased 4.58 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to close at $3.0085 a gallon.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
dropped as much as 1.3 percent, led by declines in gasoline,
silver and heating oil.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 468,542
contracts as of 2:36 p.m. Volume totaled 732,744 contracts
yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 13 and 51 percent above
the three-month average. Open interest was 1.48 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
