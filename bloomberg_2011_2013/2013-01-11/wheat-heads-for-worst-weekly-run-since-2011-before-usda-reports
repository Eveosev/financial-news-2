Wheat traded near a six-month low,
set for the worst weekly run in more than a year, as investors
assessed whether an increase in acreage in the U.S., the largest
shipper, will offset yield losses from a drought.  The contract for March delivery traded little changed at
$7.45 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 10:02 a.m.
Singapore time, after falling as much as 0.1 percent and gaining
0.3 percent. Futures, which slumped to $7.3975 on Jan. 4, are
down 0.3 percent this week for a sixth straight decline, the
worst run since October 2011.  Winter-wheat acreage probably climbed to the highest in
four years, as prices and crop-insurance guarantees encouraged
farmers to boost plantings, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Dormant winter-wheat crops are in the  worst  condition since
records began in 1985 because of the drought, according to the
government. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will release its
supply, demand and acreage reports in  Washington  today.  “The USDA data batch will be the focus tonight and these
reports typically result in significant market volatility,”
 Luke Mathews , a Sydney-based analyst at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , wrote in a report today.  The USDA may report that quarterly  inventories  in the U.S.
may have risen to 1.68 billion bushels as of Dec. 1, from 1.66
billion a year ago, according to the average estimate of 25
analysts in a separate Bloomberg News survey. Stronger demand
will probably cut those stockpiles to 741 million bushels before
the 2013 harvest, down from a previous USDA estimate of 754
million, according to another Bloomberg survey.  Egypt , the biggest buyer, purchased 55,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat at a tender yesterday, signaling a 21 percent slump
from a four-year high in July made U.S. supplies competitive.  Corn for March delivery declined 0.3 percent to $6.9675 a
bushel, while soybeans for delivery in the same month fell 0.2
percent to $13.775 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
