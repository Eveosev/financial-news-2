Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR) ’s revival
plan was rejected by the Indian government, setting back the
company’s efforts to restart operations after it grounded
flights following five years of losses.  The 6.5 billion rupees ($119 million) that parent UB Group
pledged to provide Kingfisher isn’t adequate to ensure reliable
services, an official at the Civil Aviation Ministry said in New
Delhi today. The plan submitted to the regulator doesn’t provide
for payments of money owed to airports, said the official, who
asked not to be identified, citing government rules.  Kingfisher, the only Indian carrier to order Airbus SAS
superjumbos, aims to restart operations this year with seven
aircraft, Chairman  Vijay Mallya  said in an e-mail to employees
yesterday. The airline, which lost its license on Jan. 1, has
been talking to investors such as Etihad Airways PJSC.  Kingfisher gained 0.6 percent to 14.79 rupees at 12:15 p.m.
in Mumbai trading, after rising as much as 9.9 percent. The
stock fell 29 percent last year and slumped 68 percent in 2011.  The Bangalore, India-based carrier also defaulted on
payments to fuel suppliers, creditors and airports as losses
widened amid rising fuel costs and price competition.
Kingfisher, which was No. 2 in  India  by market share in 2011,
has debt of 85 billion rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
