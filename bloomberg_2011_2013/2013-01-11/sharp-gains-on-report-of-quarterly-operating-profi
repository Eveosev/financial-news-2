Sharp Corp. (6753) ,  Japan ’s biggest maker
of liquid-crystal displays, jumped the most in two weeks in
Tokyo trading after the Mainichi newspaper reported it expects
to post an operating profit for the first time in five quarters.  Sharp  rose  as much as 12 percent, the biggest gain since
Dec. 26, to 328 yen before trading at 324 yen as of 9:16 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Osaka , Japan-based company had an
operating profit of about 20 billion yen ($224 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31, Mainichi reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The company isn’t the source of the report and plans to
report earnings Feb. 1, it said in a statement.  Sharp may get as much as 200 billion yen in additional
loans from Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. and the Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in September when its 200 billion yen in
bonds will mature, the Asahi newspaper reported earlier today.
Sharp boosted sales in each of the last four months from a year
earlier, helped by recovering demand for televisions, the
company said Jan. 7.  The maker of Aquos TVs warned in November about its ability
to survive after hemorrhaging 103 billion yen in cash from
operations in the fiscal first half amid competition from
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Sharp, the worst performing  stock  in the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average in 2012, will disclose its strategy for
increasing capital in a medium-term plan by March 31, President
Takashi Okuda said Jan. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
