The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  retreated one basis point to 103 basis
points as of 8:17 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices. The measure has declined 10 basis
points this year, after sliding 93 basis points in 2012,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell three basis points to
135 as of 9:23 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is on track for its lowest close since August 2011,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased one basis point
to 112 basis points as of 11:13 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The gauge has fallen 15.5 basis
points since Dec. 31, extending a 53 basis-point drop in 2012,
CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
