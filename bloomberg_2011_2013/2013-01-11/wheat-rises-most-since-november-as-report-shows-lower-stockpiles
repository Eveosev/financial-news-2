Wheat futures rose the most since
November after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
stockpiles will be lower than analysts expected and that less
winter grain was planted than forecast.  Inventories on May 31 will total 716 million bushels, the
USDA said in a report today. That’s down from the 754 million
bushels forecast in December and the 741 million projected by
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . U.S. winter plantings
totaled 41.8 million acres, less than the 42.6 million forecast
in the survey.  “The stocks number was bullish, and that’s where all the
buying is coming from,” Jamey Kohake, a broker and branch
manager at Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake ,  Kansas , said by
telephone. The lower-than-expected acreage “reiterated that
there’s a downside limit in wheat.”  Wheat futures for March delivery jumped 2.6 percent to
$7.64 a bushel at 11:31 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
heading for the biggest gain since Nov. 27. The price through
yesterday dropped 4.3 percent this month.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
