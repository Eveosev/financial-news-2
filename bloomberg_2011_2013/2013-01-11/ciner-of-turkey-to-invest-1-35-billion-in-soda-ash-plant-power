Ciner Group, a Turkish company with
interests in mining, energy and media, will invest $1.35 billion
in a soda ash production complex that will also have an 800
megawatt power plant.  Ciner’s Kazan Soda Elektrik AS will use a former  Rio Tinto
Plc (RIO)  site in Kazan, near Ankara for the project, Nedim Sener,
chairman of Kazan Soda, said at a news conference. Soda ash is
used in glass, chemicals, paper, detergent and other industrial
products. China Tianchen Engineering Corp. will provide
engineering and procurement services and the site will be
completed by 2017, Sener said.  Kazan will have an annual production of 2.7 million metric
tons of soda ash and Ciner, which also holds a 74 percent stake
at Eti Soda AS, the country’s biggest soda ash producer at a
nearby site, will have a combined soda ash production of 4.4
million tons when both plants run at full steam from 2017, Sener
said.  “Ciner Group will be the world’s biggest producer of soda
ash when the plants are complete,” Sener said.  Ciner will use loans only from Chinese banks and some
equity to finance the project, Turgay Ciner, chairman of the
group, said in the news conference.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, has a strategic
partnership with Ciner Group in Turkish media through Bloomberg
HT television.  To contact the reporters on this story:
