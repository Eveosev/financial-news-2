Gas and oil rigs in the U.S. dropped
for the seventh straight week to the lowest level since March
2011 as energy producers curbed exploration.  Total energy rigs fell by one to 1,761, bringing the seven-
week loss to 50 rigs, data posted on  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) â€™s website
show.  Oil rigs  rose by five to 1,323, the first advance since
Nov. 16. The  gas count  declined by five to 434, the field-
services company based in Houston said. Miscellaneous rigs fell
by one to four.  The oil rig count has fallen every month since September as
companies, responding to  high crude supplies  and a decline in
prices, scale back their drilling programs. The gas count has
shrunk to less than a third of its peak in August 2008 after a
shift from dry-gas plays to more profitable liquids.  Crude for February delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  climbed 72 cents yesterday to settle at $93.82 a
barrel, down 8.2 percent from a year ago.  U.S. oil output  rose  17,000 barrels a day to 7 million last
week, the most in almost 20 years, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. Stockpiles of the feedstock climbed
0.4 percent to 361.3 million barrels in that same period.
Supplies reached a 22-year high of 387.3 million barrels in
June.  Natural gas for February delivery gained 8 cents to $3.193
per million British thermal units on the Nymex yesterday.
Futures are up 8.6 percent from a year ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
