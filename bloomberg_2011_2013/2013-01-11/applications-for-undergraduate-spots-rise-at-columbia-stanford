Undergraduate applications rose at
Columbia University and  Stanford University , while they declined
at Dartmouth College, as elite schools begin to tally admissions
data for the class that begins in the 2013-2014 academic year.  Applications to Columbia’s undergraduate schools increased
5 percent from a year earlier to 33,460, according to Jessica Marinaccio, dean of undergraduate admissions. The number
received by Stanford was 5 percent to 6 percent more than last
year’s pool of 36,632, according to estimates from Colleen Lim,
director of admission at the school near Palo Alto, California.  Dartmouth, in Hanover, New Hampshire, reported a decline of
about 3 percent to 22,400 applications, said Justin Anderson, a
spokesman for the school.  Peers of Dartmouth and New York-based Columbia in the
eight-member Ivy League, including Harvard, Yale and Princeton
universities, plan to release application totals later this
month, officials said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
