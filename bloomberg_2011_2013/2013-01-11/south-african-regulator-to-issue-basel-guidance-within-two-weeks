South Africa ’s banking regulator
will issue a guidance note to lenders within the next two weeks
after global central bank chiefs gave four more years to meet
international liquidity requirements.  Financial regulators meeting in  Basel ,  Switzerland , on Jan.
6 delayed the full implementation of the so-called liquidity
coverage ratio, or LCR, intended to curb excessive risk in the
banking sector. They also expanded the list of what can be
classed as high-quality liquid assets to include equities and
securitized mortgage debt.  South Africa will probably follow the revised timeline,
under which banks will have to meet 60 percent of the LCR
obligations by 2015 with the full rule phased in annually
through 2019, the Registrar of Banks Rene van Wyk said today in
an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg.  The banking regulator will still assess the liquidity of
the additional assets included under the amendments, he said.
“I don’t see major benefits or issues as far as the additional
high-quality liquid assets are concerned,” Van Wyk said. “Some
of them may even be irrelevant in our market, but we must still
assess it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
