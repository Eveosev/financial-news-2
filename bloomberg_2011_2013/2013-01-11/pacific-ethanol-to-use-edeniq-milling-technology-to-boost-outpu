Pacific Ethanol Inc. (PEIX) , a U.S. biofuel
producer, is seeking to increase production at a California
plant using technology from Edeniq Inc.  Pacific Ethanol expects to boost yields by 2 percent to 4
percent using Edeniq’s milling system, which converts corn and
other plant feedstock materials into particles that are
processed into fuel more efficiently, the Sacramento,
California-based company said today in a statement.  The company will install the so-called Cellunator
technology this quarter at its plant in Stockton, California. It
will also use another Edeniq system that increases corn-oil
recovery, according to the statement.  Pacific Ethanol has four plants in California, Oregon and
Idaho that produce a total of 200 million gallons (758 million
liters) of fuel a year. The Stockton site’s annual capacity is
60 million gallons.  Edeniq, based in Visalia, California, received a $3.9
million grant in June from the  California Energy Commission  to
develop cellulosic ethanol production technology, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
