European Union carbon fell to a
record after the bloc sold an all-time-high volume of allowances
this week. United Nations Emission Reduction Units for December
plunged 41 percent, their biggest-ever one-day drop.  The EU contract for December declined 2.2 percent to close
at 5.92 euros ($7.91) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The weekly drop was 6.6 percent. United Nations
Certified Emission Reductions for December dropped 11 percent to
42 euro cents a ton at 4:59 p.m.  The bloc sold 14.7 million tons of prompt-delivery EU
permits this week and will sell 18.8 million tons next week.
That’s the biggest volume slated for this year, according to
data from the European Energy Exchange AG in Leipzig,  Germany ,
and ICE.  The EU commission in Brussels yesterday proposed rules
governing use of ERU offsets issued by so-called Track 1 and
Track 2 processes of the Joint Implementation mechanism of the
1997 Kyoto Protocol. The rules were not as restrictive as
indicated last year by the regulator, said Daniel Rossetto,
managing director of Climate Mundial Ltd., a London adviser in
carbon markets. ERUs eligible for compliance in the EU “will
now be less scarce,” he said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
