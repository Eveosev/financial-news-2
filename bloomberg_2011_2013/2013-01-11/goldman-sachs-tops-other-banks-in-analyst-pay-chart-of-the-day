The base salaries of analysts at
three major U.S. investment banks have declined since 2009,
while increasing 15 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that from 2009 to 2012, the base
pay of analysts at Goldman Sachs increased to $76,250 on average
from $66,000 according to data provided by Glassdoor, a San
Francisco-based career website. The combined average pay at Bank
of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. over
the same period fell to $58,226 from $62,105. The data, which
exclude bonuses and other forms of compensation, were gathered
from verified surveys of analysts with one to three years of
experience at each firm.  Lower salaries are “consistent with what we’re hearing, so
it suggests to me that until there’s a turnaround in the banking
sector, until the next period of real growth, we may see more of
the same,” said  John Challenger , chief executive officer of
Chicago-based Challenger Gray & Christmas Inc., an employment
consulting firm. “Goldman has continued to go out and pay for
and be the place that the very top talent wants to go. It’s a
conscious choice that they’ve made to not lose that position.”  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and
Citigroup declined to comment on the Glassdoor survey. Morgan
Stanley is planning to eliminate 1,600 jobs in the coming weeks
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. This
accounts for 6 percent of the company’s investment banking
division. The nine largest investment banks announced more than
30,000 job cuts in the first nine months of 2012 according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
