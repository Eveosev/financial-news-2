GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the
world’s biggest polysilicon maker, expects a “substantial”
loss for last year because of oversupply in the industry.  “The development of photovoltaic business has been slowed
down with clear overcapacity across the solar value chain,”
GCL-Poly said today in a statement. The slide in prices “is
particularly significant during the fourth quarter of 2012.”  The company, which posted a profit of HK$4.3 billion ($555
million) in 2011, expects to release annual earnings in March.  A surplus across the solar-component industry has combined
with slowing demand to depress prices. The average price of the
raw material to make solar panels fell 19 percent in the fourth
quarter, following a 12 percent drop in the prior three months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  GCL-Poly, which also makes wafers from its polysilicon,
reported a loss of HK$330 million in the first half of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
