Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD) , the German pay-
TV operator part-owned by  News Corp. (NWSA) , fell the most in almost
six months after Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said
Web-based competition poses a risk to growth and stock gains.  Sky Deutschland  dropped  as much as 5.6 percent, the biggest
decline since July 23, and was trading down 4.2 percent at 4.45
euros at 12:32 p.m. in Frankfurt. Volume exceeded the three-
month daily average by more than 75 percent, and the stock was
the worst performer on the 50-company mid-cap MDAX Index.  A stock-price boost from a possible bid from News Corp. for
full control may be offset by “execution risks,” while
increases in subscriptions to a bigger proportion of households
may be curtailed by competitors such as  ProSiebenSat.1 Media
AG (PSM) ’s MaxDome service, which offers access to programs via the
Web, Merrill Lynch analysts, including Daniel Kerven in  London ,
said in a research report.  The analysts cut their  recommendation  on Unterfoehring-
based Sky Deutschland to neutral from buy. They raised their
stock-price estimate to 4.80 euros from 4 euros.  Sky Deutschland was the highest price since October 2008 in
the four trading sessions through Jan. 9 after signing an
agreement a week ago to sell subscriptions to Internet-based TV
customers of Bonn-based phone company  Deutsche Telekom AG. (DTE)  That
contract will give viewers access by mid-2013 to soccer matches
played by Germany’s Bundesliga and the UEFA Champions League, as
well as the Sky Film channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
