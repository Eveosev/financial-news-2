Italy sold 5 billion euros ($6.6
billion) of securities today with rates on 2015 debt dropping to
the lowest since March 2010 as investors remain confident the
next government will maintain the economic reforms put in place
by Prime Minister Mario Monti.  The Treasury in  Rome  today sold 3.5 billion euros of a 2015
note at 1.85 percent, down from the 2.5 percent paid Dec. 13 and
the lowest since March 2010. The Treasury also sold a total of
1.5 billion euros of floating-rate securities maturing in June
and Oct. 2017 respectively. Investors bid for 1.45 times the
amount of the 2015 paper offered, up from 1.36 times Dec. 13.  Opinion polls show Pier Luigi Bersani, the center-left
leader, probably will succeed Monti, though he may need Monti’s
support to assemble a majority in both houses. That outcome is
viewed by analysts as a guarantee that the former European
commissioner’s economic reform path will continue.  “If the center-left falls short of a stable upper house
majority, Bersani will likely turn to Monti’s centrists for
support,” analysts at Eurasia Group in New York including Peter
Ceretti said in a note yesterday. “The weaker the center-left’s
majority, the stronger Monti’s bargaining position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
