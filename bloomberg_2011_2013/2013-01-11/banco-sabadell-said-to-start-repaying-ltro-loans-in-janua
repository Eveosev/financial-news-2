Banco Sabadell SA (SAB) , Spain’s fifth-
biggest lender, may start to repay emergency loans from the
 European Central Bank  in January.  Sabadell will consider repaying between 10 percent and 20
percent of the 24 billion euros ($32 billion) of loans this
month that it borrowed under the ECB’s longer-term refinancing
operation, said an official for the bank who asked not to be
named in line with company policy.  Spanish banks including Sabadell took advantage of the more
than 1 trillion euros of cheap three-year loans that the ECB
channeled into Europe’s banking system at the end of 2011 and
start of 2012 to help calm the region’s financial crisis.  Banco
Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s biggest bank, has about 35 billion euros
of LTRO loans and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , the
second-biggest, about 22 billion euros.  Funding conditions have improved for the Spanish government
and lenders this month, allowing banks including Sabadell to tap
wholesale debt markets. The Sabadell, Spain-based bank sold 1
billion euros of five-year covered bonds today at a spread of
250 basis points over the benchmark swap rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
