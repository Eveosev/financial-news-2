The  Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission  will appeal a court restriction on its access to
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  e-mail in a probe of market manipulation.  The energy regulator will challenge a magistrate judge’s
November order blocking a review of unredacted copies of 25 e-
mails because they involve attorney communications, it said
today in a filing in federal court in Washington.  FERC sued New York-based JPMorgan July 2 demanding the e-
mails in an investigation of possible manipulation of power
markets in California and the Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures
Energy Corp. The agency opened the probe last year after
complaints from California and Midwest grid operators who said
JPMorgan’s bidding practices were abusive.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson said she agreed with
JPMorgan’s lawyers that the redacted portions are confidential
communications.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the
filing.  The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
 District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
