Equity mutual funds recorded the
second-highest inflows on record in the first week of the year
as stocks rallied on signs that the global economy is gaining
momentum.  About $22 billion flowed into equity funds around the
world, according to data compiled by research firm EPFR Global
going back to 1996. Emerging-market equity funds took in the
most money on record in the week ended Jan. 9, Morgan Stanley
wrote in a report today that cited EPFR data. The  MSCI All-
Country World Index (MXWD)  jumped 3.1 percent in first week of 2013 and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index reached a five-year high
yesterday.  The flows represent a turnaround for investors who have
pulled cash from U.S. shares, the world’s biggest equity market,
for the past six years. About $150 billion was withdrawn from
mutual funds that invest in American stocks in 2012, according
to data from Washington-based  Investment Company Institute .  The record for equity fund inflows globally was the third
week of September 2007, when $23 billion was added, the data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
