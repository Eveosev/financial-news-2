TNK-BP’s spending on East Siberia’s
Verkhnechonsk oilfield has increased to 90 billion rubles ($3
billion) after the third-largest Russian oil producer invested
18.5 billion rubles on the development last year.  Processing capacity will be expanded this year to meet peak
annual production of 7.8 million metric tons in 2014, Sergei
Fedorov, the project’s general director, said in a statement on
the Moscow-based company’s  website  today. The unit produced more
than 7 million tons of crude in 2012, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
