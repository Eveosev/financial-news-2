Empresa Distribuidora &
Comercializadora Norte SA (EDN)  is heading for its biggest weekly gain
since May 2009 on speculation the company will increase rates.  Edenor, as Argentina’s largest electricity distributor is
known, gained 1.8 percent to 0.884 peso in  Buenos Aires  at 2:20
p.m., a 22.9 percent increase during the week, the most since
the first week of May 2009.  The rally started after the Argentine government announced
on Jan. 7 new rules for oil and gas producers paving the way for
rate increases in the electricity distribution industry.  “Edenor is the tip of the iceberg as its current market
value is worth nothing,” Carlos Aszpis, an equity strategist at
Schweber & Cia., said in phone interview from Buenos Aires.
“The rate increase will arrive next week, in six months or a
year, and the company will have to recover its 10 times higher
value granted by investors in its initial public offering.”  Argentine deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof was not
immediately available to take calls, his spokeswoman Jessica Rey
said in a phone interview from Buenos Aires. She declined to
comment.  Edenor, owned by  Pampa Energia SA (PAMP) , has posted seven
straight quarterly losses that forced it to sell assets for
 capital spending  to avoid a debt default. The company has
negative  cash flow  and is not paying in full for the electricity
it distributes to the government controlled wholesale seller
know as Cammesa.  To contact the reporters on this story:
