The yen slid to the weakest level
since June 2010 versus the dollar, extending its longest streak
of weekly losses since 1989, as  Japan  planned new monetary
stimulus. Shares of U.S. banks retreated as Wells Fargo & Co.’s
lending margin shrank. The euro and Italian bonds rose.  The yen weakened 0.4 percent to 89.17 per dollar at 4:34
p.m. in New York to extend a ninth straight weekly drop. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1 percent from a
five-year high while the VIX Index, the benchmark gauge of U.S.
options, slid to the lowest level since June 2007. The S&P GSCI
commodities gauge fell 0.5 percent on concern accelerating
inflation in  China  will halt stimulus efforts. The euro jumped
to a nine-month high of $1.3342 as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
predicted it may reach $1.37.  The yen slid as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
government planned to spend 10.3 trillion yen ($116 billion) in
stimulus efforts that may weaken the currency. China’s  inflation 
quickened to a seven-month high last month, the government said
today after exports and credit growth underscored the strength
of an economic rebound. In the U.S., investors awaited almost 40
quarterly reports from S&P 500 companies next week to gauge the
outlook for earnings and the economy.  “Abe announced fiscal stimulus in Japan, which is what
sent the yen lower against the dollar,”  Richard Franulovich , a
senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York,
said in a telephone interview. “We were expecting some sort of
fiscal program, and they basically put some flesh on the bone.”  Yen Performance  The yen weakened against 13 of 16 major peers today, with
South Korea’s won and the euro climbing almost 1 percent to lead
gains against Japan’s currency. The yen weakened more than 1
percent for the week against all 16 peers except South African’s
rand. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index jumped 1.4 percent today,
reaching the highest level since February 2011.  Telephone, industrial and financial companies led declines
among the 10 main  industry groups  in the S&P 500, while
consumer-staples, technology and energy companies rose the most.
The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
is known, lost 1 percent to 13.36, its lowest closing level
since June 2007.  Wells Fargo slipped 0.9 percent, paring a drop of as much
as 2.5 percent, after the largest U.S. home lender’s net-
interest margin, which represents the gap between what banks pay
depositors and what’s earned on loans, fell 10 basis points from
the third quarter to 3.56 percent. Banks in the S&P 500 lost 0.9
percent as a group for the biggest decline among 24 groups.  Bank Earnings  Seventeen of the 24 companies in the KBW Bank Index will
report earnings next week, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. on
Jan. 16 and Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. on Jan. 17.  Banks could face lower profits on home loans this year as
minutes of the Fed’s December meeting, released Jan. 3, showed
policy makers may end $85 billion monthly bond purchases in
2013. That could “spoil the party” for lenders that profited
from a more than 20 percent jump in mortgage originations last
year, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-biggest U.S. energy company, rose
1.1 percent after saying earnings increased from the third
quarter as rising prices blunted the impact of declining oil
output. The company is scheduled to report full results on Feb.
1.  The yield on 10-year Treasuries lost three basis points to
1.86 percent as yields near the highest level since May lured
investors.  Commodity Movers  Oil slipped 0.3 percent to $93.56 a barrel in New York,
retreating from the highest level since September, and Brent
crude lost 1.1 percent to $110.64 in  London . China is the
biggest buyer of industrial metals and energy. Silver, gasoline
and heating oil lost at least 1.4 percent to lead losses in 16
of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI.  “The good news about China is that it is in a trajectory
of improvement,”Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at
the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in  Cleveland , said in a
phone interview. His firm oversees $20 billion. “The bad news
is that it may also boost inflation. In the U.S., people will be
focused on earnings. It’s not great yet, but it certainly has
the potential for improvement as we get further into the year.’  European Markets  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.1 percent today as basic-
resource companies led declines, extending a weekly decline to
0.3 percent.  Cap Gemini SA (CAP) ,  France ’s biggest computer-services company,
rose 2.3 percent  after rival  Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  raised its full-year
sales forecast. Getinge AB sank 8.2 percent, the biggest decline
since March 2009, as the Swedish maker of sterilization systems
said demand for its products weakened during the fourth quarter.  The yield on  Italy ’s two-year notes fell one basis point to
1.36 percent. The government sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.7
billion) of debt maturing in December 2015 at an average yield
of 1.85 percent, down from a rate of 2.50 percent at the
previous sale of the securities on Dec. 13.  Italian 10-year bonds lost three basis points to 4.13
percent and the yield difference over similar-maturity German
bunds narrowed to 255 basis points. The spread reached as little
as 248 basis points, less than 250 basis points for the first
time since July 22, 2011.  Euro Climbs  The euro strengthened against all 16 major peers today
extending its weekly gain against the dollar to 2.1 percent for
its biggest rally since September.  ‘‘We recommend long euro-dollar positions with a target of
$1.37 and a stop at $1.29,” Goldman Sachs strategists including
London-based Thomas Stolper wrote in a note to investors today.
A long position is a bet that an asset will rise.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  slipped 0.4 percent,
capping its first weekly drop in two months.  The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  sank 1.8 percent  Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea’s biggest automaker, led the
Kospi index 0.5 percent lower after the won gained to a five-
month high against the dollar. Infosys Ltd.,  India ’s second-
largest software exporter, rallied 17 percent, the most on
record, after raising its sales forecast.  Brazil ’s Bovespa index
slipped 0.3 percent.  Equity mutual funds recorded the second-highest inflows on
record in the first week of the year as stocks rallied on signs
that the global economy is gaining momentum.  About $22 billion flowed into equity funds around the
world, according to data compiled by research firm EPFR Global
going back to 1996. Emerging-market equity funds took in the
most money on record in the week ended Jan. 9, Morgan Stanley
wrote in a report today that cited EPFR data. The MSCI All-
Country World Index jumped 3.1 percent in  first week  of 2013 and
the S&P 500 rallied 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
