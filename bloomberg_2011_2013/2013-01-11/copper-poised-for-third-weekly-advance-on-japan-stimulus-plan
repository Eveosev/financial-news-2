Copper was set for a third weekly
advance on optimism that plans by the Japanese government to
spend 10.3 trillion yen ($116 billion) to boost the economy will
increase demand. Other industrial metals also rose.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed as much as 0.6 percent to $8,162 a metric ton
and traded at $8,123 by 10:42 a.m. in  Shanghai . Aluminum rose
for a fifth day, the longest winning streak since September.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s fiscal spending plan
is expected to increase gross domestic product by about 2
percentage points and create about 600,000 jobs, according to a
statement from the Cabinet office today. The MSCI  Asia  Pacific
Index is poised to gain for an eighth week, while the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index closed yesterday above its highest closing
level since December 2007.  “Copper is supported by a rally in equities in Asia and
the U.S.,” said Peng Guoliang, an analyst at Dadi Futures Co.
“The physical market is quiet in  China  this season and today’s
CPI and PPI data actually indicate the macroeconomic picture is
rather mixed.”  Consumer prices in China gained 2.5 percent in December
from a year ago, compared with the 2.3 percent median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of 42 analysts. Producer prices fell
1.9 percent, compared with the estimate of a 1.8 percent drop.  China is the world’s biggest importer of copper. Metal for
delivery in April fell 0.2 percent 58,640  yuan  ($9,434) a ton on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Futures for March delivery on the
Comex in  New York  fell 0.2 percent to $3.7010 per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
