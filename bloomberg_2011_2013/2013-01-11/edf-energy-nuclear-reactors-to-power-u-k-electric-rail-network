EDF Energy Plc, the U.K. unit of
Electricite de France SA, won a contract from Network Rail Ltd.
to supply power from its nuclear plants to railroads as Britain
increases the use of electric trains to cut emissions.  EDF Energy will provide 3.2 terawatt hours of electricity a
year for 10 years to power a rail network used by 3 million
passengers a day, the company said today in a statement.  Britain is electrifying its rail network to phase out
diesel trains, with plans for three-quarters of all passenger
miles to be by electric train by 2020. EDF operates eight
nuclear power stations in Britain and has proposed to add
reactors at sites in Somerset and Suffolk.  Most of the electricity will be used for trains, which now
make up 55 percent of rail traffic, according to EDF. Electric
trains emit as much as 35 percent less carbon per passenger and
are quieter than diesel vehicles, the U.K. Department for
Transport says on its website.  Network Rail, which owns and maintains the U.K.â€™s rail
infrastructure, is the biggest electricity consumer in Britain.  The company is working to electrify more than 2,000 miles
(3,200 kilometers) of track, according to EDF.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
