Coffee growers in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, may increase sales if there’s a “big
movement” in prices up or down on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
Cazarini Trading Co., a broker in Varginha, Brazil, said.  Growers will probably sell if prices are up at $1.55 to
$1.60 a pound or down at $1.35 to $1.40 a pound, Thiago Cazarini, a broker at the company, said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. Arabica coffee futures traded on ICE are today at
$1.497 a pound after falling 37 percent last year.  “The market should flow if a big movement up or down
happens,” he said.  Lower prices prompted Brazil’s growers to hold back beans.
The nation’s coffee exports fell 16 percent last year, Brazil’s
coffee exporters’ council, known as Cecafe, said in a report e-
mailed yesterday.  Demand for exports is “starting to pick-up,” Cazarini
said in the report. Shipments from Brazil are set to rebound
this year by as much as 9.5 percent, according to Cecafe.  Exports will rise to as much as 31 million bags from 28.3
million bags a year earlier, the industry group estimated.  Buyers of coffee from Brazil are getting a discount of 18
cents to 19 cents a pound below the exchange price for beans of
good-cup quality and a discount of 10 cents a pound for beans of
fine-cup quality, data from Rio de Janeiro-based broker Flavour
Coffee e-mailed yesterday showed. Fine-cup coffee beans are
usually more expensive because of their taste profile.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
