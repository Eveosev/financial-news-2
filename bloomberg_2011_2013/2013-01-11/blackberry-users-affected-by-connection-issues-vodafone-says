BlackBerry smartphone customers on
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s networks have been hit by connection
problems caused by the wireless carrier’s systems which the
carrier has said it is working to fix.  “Vodafone can confirm that some BlackBerry customers
experienced issues with their data services this morning in
 Europe , Middle East and Africa,” Newbury, England-based
Vodafone said in a statement today. “The issue was caused by a
router error. Services are in the process of being restored.”  The incident follows two disruptions in BlackBerry maker
 Research in Motion Ltd. ’s operations in the past 16 months and
comes as the company prepares to release its BlackBerry 10
phones on Jan. 30. More than 60 Fortune 500 companies are
testing the new phones that RIM is counting on to claw back
market share lost to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and devices running
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software.  “All BlackBerry services are operating normally but we are
aware that a wider Vodafone service issue is impacting some of
our BlackBerry customers in Europe,  Middle East  and Africa,”
RIM said in an e-mail.  South African customers of Vodafone’s  Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) 
unit who use the devices were also affected by a connection
outage, according to website  mybroadband.co.za .  RIM climbed 14 percent to $13:56 at the close in New York,
reversing an earlier decline, on signs of mounting optimism for
BlackBerry 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
