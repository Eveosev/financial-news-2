European Union regulators will
publish guidelines on what funding airports can receive from
governments “around the summer,” EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said in a speech today.  Revised EU rules on subsidies used to rescue most companies
in difficulty will also be published in the summer, Almunia
said.
