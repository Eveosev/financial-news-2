European Union Economic and Monetary
CommissionerOlli Rehn said euro-area finance ministers will
reach a decision on a bailout for Cyprus “in due course.”  “I expect that we can conclude the work and the Eurogroup
can take decisions in due course so we can ensure financial
stability in Cyprus,” Rehn said at the European Policy Centre
in Brussels today.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who heads
the group of euro-area finance chiefs, said yesterday that talks
on aid for Cyprus will run at least into February.  Rehn today responded to German concerns about  money
laundering  in Cyprus. Bailout funds aren’t justified as long as
German taxpayers have the impression that they’re backing
illicit money in Cyprus, Bild reported Jan. 9, citing  Germany ’s
Free Democratic parliamentary caucus leader, Rainer Bruederle.  Cyprus “has already enacted several laws against money
laundering in recent weeks and months and now the critical thing
is of course implementation,” Rehn said. “Cyprus needs to
implement these new laws against money laundering to ensure it
is not a problem on the island. Moreover, it is important that
Cyprus reforms its financial sector in line with European
principles.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
