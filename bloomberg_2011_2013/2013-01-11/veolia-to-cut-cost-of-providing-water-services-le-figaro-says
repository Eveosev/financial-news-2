Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  plans to cut
costs in its water service business as margins in  France  shrink,
Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot told Le Figaro.  The utility, based in Paris, will centralize the services
operation as margins are expected to fall by half as contracts
are renewed through 2015, Frerot was quoted as saying.  Veolia is also seeking new markets for services such as
dismantling and decontaminating nuclear sites, the daily said.
The utility called a briefing to detail nuclear plans next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
