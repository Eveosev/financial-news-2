AMR Corp., the parent of American
Airlines reorganizing in bankruptcy, asked a judge for more time
to file its restructuring plan as the carrier weighs a possible
merger with  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)   American wants to extend from March 11 to April 1 its
exclusive right to submit a proposal to pay creditors and emerge
from court protection, it said yesterday in a filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in  Manhattan .  The additional time, if approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Sean Lane, would be the fifth such extension since Fort Worth,
Texas-based American filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. The
extension would prevent rival plans from being filed in court.  The airline said the extension would allow it to review
with creditors “all strategic alternatives.” Chief Executive
Officer Tom Horton said this month that the airline expected to
reach a decision on whether to merge with US Airways in a matter
of weeks.  The case is in re  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) , 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
