The U.S. government  budget deficit 
narrowed to its best December monthly result in five years,
reflecting higher revenue, lower spending and calendar-driven
shifts in some payments.  The shortfall last month shrank almost completely to $260
million from $86 billion in December 2011, according to Treasury
Department data issued today in Washington. The gap was smaller
than the $1 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Through the first three months of this fiscal year,
the deficit was 9.1 percent smaller than the same period last
year.  “We had a pretty solid month in December mostly because of
quite a bit of tax-related activity that was shifted into
December due to concerns over the fiscal cliff and anticipated
higher tax rates in 2013,” said Thomas Simons, a government
debt economist at Jefferies Group Inc. in New York. “Going
forward we are still going to run fairly substantial deficits
this year and in coming years without any significant change to
the spending policy.”  The U.S. had a  monthly budget surplus  of $48.3 billion in
December 2007.  The U.S. reached its $16.4 trillion debt limit on Dec. 31.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Dec. 26 he could
create about $200 billion of “headroom” to avoid possible
default with the use of extraordinary measures.  U.S. Workers  The House of Representatives passed legislation averting
income tax increases for most U.S. workers Jan. 1 after
Republicans abandoned their effort to attach spending cuts that
would have been rejected by the Senate. The 257-167 bipartisan
vote broke a yearlong impasse over how to head off $600 billion
in tax increases and spending cuts that had been scheduled to
begin taking effect on Jan. 1.  While the measure averts most of the immediate pain, it is
only a small step toward controlling the federal deficit -- an
issue that will return with a looming fight over raising the
debt limit.  Today’s report showed revenue rose 12.3 percent in December
from the same month a year earlier, to $269.5 billion from $240
billion. Spending fell 17.2 percent to $269.8 billion from
$325.9 billion.  December Estimates  Estimates for December ranged from a gap of $35 billion to
an even balance for the month, according to the Bloomberg survey
of 22 economists.  Individual income tax receipts in the first three months of
this fiscal year rose to $312.4 billion from $270.4 billion in
the same period last year. Corporate income tax receipts rose to
$62.5 billion from $55.6 billion.  The Congressional Budget Office said  Jan. 8  December would
show a budget deficit of $1 billion.  The CBO said that receipts in December 2012 were about $30
billion more than the receipts in the same month the year
before.  “In both years, spending was affected by a shift of
certain payments from January to December -- because January 1
is a holiday -- but spending this December also was affected by
a shift of certain payments into November,” the CBO said.  The CBO said there was a $24 billion increase in withheld
taxes last month.  “ The strong growth in withheld taxes may be attributable
in part to an acceleration in the payment of some compensation
from calendar year 2013 to 2012 because people were anticipating
higher tax rates,” the CBO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
