Uganda  for the first time is
refunding money to donor countries, handing back 38.3 billion
shillings ($14.2 million) stolen by government officials, Keith
Muhakazi, the deputy secretary to the Treasury, said.  The East African nation has allocated the cash to repay
donors including the  World Bank , the U.K., Ireland,  Sweden ,
Denmark and Norway, which froze about $263 million in budget
support because of the theft, he said.  “We have asked these countries to provide account details
for depositing these funds,” Muhakanizi told reporters today in
Kampala, the capital. Ireland has already been repaid 4 million
euros ($5.4 million) and will use the money for its intended
programs without channeling it through the government, he said.  Uganda, Africa’s biggest coffee exporter, is hopeful
donors, who finance a quarter of the country’s annual budget,
will resume aid this year because of improved public financial
management, Muhakanizi said. The aid freeze was partially
responsible for the government on Dec. 4 lowering its economic
growth forecast to 4%-4.5% from 5% earlier. In the six months
through December, the nation spent according to its budget, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
