The  Dallas Cowboys  agreed to make
72-year-old Monte Kiffin the team’s defensive coordinator, ESPN
reported citing unidentified people.  Kiffin succeeds Rob Ryan, who was fired this week. The
Cowboys (8-8) ranked 17th in the 32-team league against the run
and 21st against the pass this season.  Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment on the report.  Considered the creator of the Tampa-2 defense, which relies
on team speed and linebackers who can play in pass coverage,
Kiffin resigned this season as defensive coordinator at the
 University of Southern California , where his son Lane is the
coach.  He also was defensive coordinator of the NFL’s  Minnesota
Vikings  (1991), New Orleans Saints (1995) and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers (1996-2008).  Pittsburgh’s Dick LeBeau, 75, is the oldest defensive
coordinator in the NFL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
