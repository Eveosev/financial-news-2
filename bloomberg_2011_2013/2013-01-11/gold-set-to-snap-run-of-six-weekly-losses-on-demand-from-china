Gold fell for the second time in
three days as inflation in  China  topped economist estimates,
increasing concern that officials may curb stimulus.  China’s inflation accelerated to a seven-month high in
December, the National Bureau of Statistics said today. Bullion
climbed 7 percent last year, a 12th straight gain, as central
banks in Europe, the U.S. and China increased stimulus measures
to boost economies. The Asian country is the world’s biggest
bullion buyer after  India .  “The market is reacting to China’s inflation numbers,”
Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said in a telephone interview from Chicago. “Less
liquidity in the system means a slowdown in purchases.”  Gold futures for February delivery dropped 1 percent to
settle at $1,660.60 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Today’s decline is the biggest for a most-active contract
since Jan. 4. Prices are still up 0.7 percent this week, ending
a six-week slump.  Silver futures for March delivery declined 1.6 percent to
$30.408 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,631.20 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
$701.45 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
