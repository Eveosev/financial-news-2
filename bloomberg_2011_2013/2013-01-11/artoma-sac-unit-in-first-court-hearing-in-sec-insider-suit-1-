Lawyers for Mathew Martoma and SAC
Capital Advisors LP’s CR Intrinsic unit appeared in court for
the first time in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
suit over an alleged $276 million insider-trading scheme.  “We see this as a relatively straightforward insider
trading case,” said SEC lawyer Charles Riely, introducing the
case in a court conference before U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero today in Manhattan.  Marrero didn’t immediately set a schedule for pretrial
proceedings in the case. He set another conference for May 24.  Martoma, 38, faces related criminal charges of conspiracy
and securities fraud for allegedly using inside information
about a clinical drug trial to help trade in  Elan Corp. (ELN)  and
 Wyeth LLC. (PFE)  He has pleaded not guilty. Jonathan Gasthalter, a
spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC, has said the firm
and its founder,  Steven A. Cohen , did nothing improper.  In addition to Martoma and CR Intrinsic, the SEC originally
sued  University of Michigan  neurologist Sid Gilman, claiming he
passed the alleged illegal tips to Martoma. Gilman has signed a
non-prosecution agreement with U.S. prosecutors and agreed to
settle the SEC case.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. CR
Intrinsic Investors LLC, 12-cv-8466, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
