Lithuania ’s bankrupt Bankas Snoras
AB said it agreed last year to sell two subsidiaries to an
unnamed buyer.  The deal to sell the  Finasta Group , which controls an
investment bank, and Snoras’s leasing unit was signed Aug. 24,
Snoras said today in a  report to creditors  posted on its
website. Giedrius Simonavicius, a spokesman for the central
bank, said today by e-mail that the buyer hasn’t yet sought the
necessary regulatory approval.  Snoras, once Lithuania’s third-biggest bank by deposits,
was declared bankrupt and taken over by the central bank in
November 2011 after assets were discovered missing from its
balance sheet. Completing the sale of Snoro Lizingas UAB and
seven companies in the Finasta Group is among the bankruptcy
administrator’s top priorities, Snoras said.  Omada Capital , a London-based investment fund with
interests in financial services, said in September that it had
submitted a bid for the Snoras units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
