The  Nigeria  police introduced a code
of conduct for its officers to deal with allegations of extra-
judicial killings and other abuses made by rights groups
including Amnesty International.  The code is a “set of guiding principles” and “standards
of behavior” for all police officers in the country, Mohammed
Abubakar, inspector-general of police, said in the document
presented to the public yesterday in Abuja, the capital. The
document identifies measures police authorities are taking to
conform with international conventions, according to Abubakar.  Police in Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer and most
populous nation of more than 160 million people, have faced
allegations of rights violations including unlawful executions,
torture and excessive use of force made by local and
international human rights groups.  A regulation that empowers officers to shoot suspects that
attempt to escape or resist arrest, is frequently abused and
allows the police get away with murder,  Amnesty International 
said. At least 7,000 citizens have been unlawfully killed by the
police within the last decade, according to New York-based Human
Rights Watch  A new code of conduct for the police “is not a magic wand
but it’s a beginning,” Chidi Odinkalu, chairman of the  National
Human Rights Commission , said today phone from Abuja. “It is
recognition by the management of the police that something needs
to be done.”  Amnesty International is concerned the code “does not
explicitly state that use of force must be lawful and
proportionate as well as necessary,” Lucy Freeman,  London-
based deputy director for the group’s Africa Program, said in an
e-mailed statement. “There must be adequate systems and
mechanisms in place alongside training and regulations on the
use of force and firearms to make sure that police apply the
relevant UN standards in their daily work.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
