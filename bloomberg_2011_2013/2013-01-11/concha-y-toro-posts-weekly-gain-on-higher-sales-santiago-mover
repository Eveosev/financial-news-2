Vina Concha y Toro SA  rose for a
fourth day after Chile’s largest wine exporter reported better-
than-expected sales last quarter.  The stock rose 0.1 percent to 939.9 pesos at 2:30 p.m. in
Santiago. The company’s shares have gained for three straight
weeks, leaving them up 0.8 percent this year. The volume of
shares changing hands this week reached 4.5 million, the highest
since the week ending Sept. 14.  Concha y Toro, based in Santiago, reported that sales in
the fourth quarter on a preliminary basis rose 8.9 percent from
a year earlier to 134 billion pesos ($284 million), according to
an e-mailed press release sent Jan. 9. The rise was led by a 12
percent gain in export sales from  Chile , the company said in the
statement.  “The results show a change in trend compared to prior
quarters, when the volume declined year-on-year,” Banchile Citi
analysts Alexander Robarts, Matias Brodsky and Sergio Matsumoto
said in an e-mailed note.  Banchile Citi, the joint research department of Banco de
Chile and Citigroup Inc., had predicted 119 billion pesos for
the fourth-quarter sales.  Concha y Toro’s shares retreated 5.8 percent in 2012 and
have gained 0.8 percent so far in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
