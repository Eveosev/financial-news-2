Two Daiwa Asset Management Co. fund
managers in  Singapore , who advised on investing in Indian
stocks, have left the firm, said two people with knowledge of
the matter.  Sudhindra Ballal and Vikas Sharda, who advised on three
funds with $260 million in assets, the  first  of which was set up
in December 2007, were asked to leave in late October, said the
people, who requested anonymity as the matter is private. The
advisory role moved to managers in  India , they said.  The shift to India will give an additional revenue stream
to Daiwaâ€™s asset management arm in the country, a loss-making
entity now, according to one of the people. The unit  managed 5.4
billion rupees  ($99 million) in the last quarter of 2012,
according to the Association of  Mutual Funds  in India. Daiwa is
looking to sell the unit, the Economic Times  reported  on Nov. 7.  Akihiro Honda, a spokesman for Tokyo-based parent company
 Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) , declined to comment.  Daiwa is trimming costs as it loses money abroad. The
company on Nov. 8 increased its goal for expense cuts to 70
billion yen ($790 million) by March 2015 from 60 billion yen
targeted earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
