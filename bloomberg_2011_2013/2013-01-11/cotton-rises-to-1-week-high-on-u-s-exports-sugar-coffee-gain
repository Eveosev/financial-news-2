Cotton rallied to a one-week high on
signs of improved demand for U.S. exports. Sugar, coffee and
orange juice also advanced, while cocoa fell.  Export sales of  upland cotton  in the month ended Jan. 3
averaged 249,000 running bales a week, more than four times the
average of a year earlier, data from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  showed today. Domestic production in the 12 months
ended July 31 probably was less than the government said last
month, according to analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The USDA
will update its estimate today at noon in  Washington .  “The latest U.S. export-sales report confirmed this
encouraging pace of business,” Peter Egli, a Chicago-based risk
manager for Plexus Cotton Ltd., said in an e-mailed report. “We
remain friendly on prices in the longer run.”  Cotton for March delivery rose 0.8 percent to 75.79 cents a
pound at 10 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , after touching
76.03 cents, the highest since Jan. 3. Prices as of yesterday
still were down 22 percent from a year earlier as demand slowed
from  China .  Also on ICE, raw-sugar futures for March delivery rallied
0.1 percent to 18.98 cents a pound, heading for a third straight
gain. Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery advanced 0.3
percent to $1.5005 a pound. Orange-juice futures for March
delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1.126 a pound, poised for a third
straight increase.  Cocoa future for March delivery fell 0.3 percent at $2,263
a metric ton, after fluctuating between gains and loses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
