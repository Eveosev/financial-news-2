The  yuan  strengthened beyond 6.22
against the dollar for the first time in 19 years and forwards
headed for the best week since October 2011 on speculation  China 
will tolerate appreciation to temper inflation.  Consumer-price gains quickened to 2.5 percent in December
from a year earlier, compared with a 2 percent increase in
November and the 2.3 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
42 economists, the statistics bureau reported today. Exports
climbed 14.1 percent last month and imports rose 6 percent, with
both numbers exceeding forecasts, official data showed yesterday.  “Recent data have dashed concerns on China’s economy,”
said Daniel Chan, executive vice-president at Glory Sky Global
Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Higher inflation means officials
will accommodate a stronger yuan to lower prices of imports.”  The currency strengthened 0.13 percent to 6.2163 per dollar
as of 10:20 a.m. in  Shanghai  and touched 6.2155, the highest
level since the government unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It climbed 0.23 percent this week.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.9 percent in
the past five days to 6.2670, the best performance since the
period ended Oct. 28, 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts were at a 0.8 percent discount to the spot rate.  Stronger Fixing  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate
0.13 percent stronger, the biggest increase since November, at
6.2712 per dollar today. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  The government will release fourth-quarter  gross domestic
product  numbers, as well as figures for December industrial
production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment on Jan. 18.
Economic growth probably accelerated to 7.8 percent over the
three months from a year earlier, after contracting for seven
straight quarters, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
analysts.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.3
percent to 6.1735 per dollar, the strongest level since trading
started in 2010.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, increased 20 basis
points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 1.65 percent this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
