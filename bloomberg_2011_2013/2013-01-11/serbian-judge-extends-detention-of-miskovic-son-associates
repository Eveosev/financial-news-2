Miroslav Miskovic,  Serbia ’s richest
man, will remain in detention for at least another month as a
probe continues into alleged corruption in the sale of state
road companies, a judge said.  Miskovic, 67, his son Marko and another two men will be
detained until at least Feb. 10, while three other associates
arrested in the same investigation will be released, Maja
Kovacevic-Tomic, a judge at the  Higher Belgrade Court , said in a
phone interview.  The case involves suspicions regarding more than 30 million
euros ($40 million) of alleged illegal profits from the sales.  A company statement last month said “we are absolutely
certain that the activities of Delta Holding and its owner,
Miroslav Miskovic, are in accordance with the law, and we are
fully cooperating with the authorities.”  Miskovic, the owner of closely held  Delta Holding , and his
son were arrested Dec. 12 as Serbia’s government pledged to step
up the fight against corruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
