Malaysia ’s ringgit completed its
best weekly gain in four months after government reports showed
factory production and exports improved and  China ’s economic
recovery gained traction.  The currency touched a 10-month high today amid signs fund
inflows into emerging-market assets are accelerating. China said
yesterday imports jumped 6 percent in December, brightening the
outlook for Malaysian exporters. Industrial output in  Southeast
Asia ’s third-largest economy rose 7.5 percent in November from a
year earlier, while overseas shipments grew 3.3 percent, both
beating economists’ estimates.  “China trade numbers are fueling optimism global growth is
picking up,” said Roy Teo, a currency strategist in  Singapore 
at ABN Amro Bank NV. “There is new optimism and new money
coming into financial markets. Risk-on may persist till the end
of the month.”  The ringgit rallied 1 percent to 3.0228 per dollar in  Kuala
Lumpur  from a week ago as of 4:05 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the most since the five
days ended Sept. 14. The currency gained 0.1 percent today and
touched 3.0160, a level last seen on March 12, 2012. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, was at 5.02 percent versus 5.16
percent on Jan. 4.  Emerging-market bond funds attracted $2.04 billion of
inflows in the seven days to Jan. 9, the second-best weekly
intake on record, Morgan Stanley said in a Jan. 10 report,
citing data compiled by EPFR Global. Equity funds had a record
week, with $7.4 billion of inflows.  The yield on Malaysia’s 3.314 percent sovereign notes due
October 2017 was little changed from a week ago, according to
Bursa Malaysia. It fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.24 percent today.  The  finance ministry  will sell 4.5 billion ringgit ($1.5
