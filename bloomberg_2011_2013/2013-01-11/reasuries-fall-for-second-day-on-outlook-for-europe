Treasury 10-year notes rose as
yields at almost the highest level since May lured investors
into the world’s biggest bond market.  Yields on the benchmark notes earlier advanced to the
highest level in a week as demand for Italian bonds at an
auction indicated  Europe ’s debt crisis is easing. Italian 10-
year bonds extended a gain, narrowing the yield difference, or
spread, over similar-maturity German bunds to less than 250
basis points, or 2.5 percentage points, for the first time since
July 22, 2011.  “Guys are not looking to get short at these levels,” said
Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “The market tried to test selling-off earlier today
-- people are looking to be long.” A short is a bet the price
of a security will drop, while a long is a bet the price will
rise.  The 10-year  yield  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.87 percent as of 5 p.m. New York time
after climbing to 1.93 percent, the highest level since Jan. 4,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of 1.625
percent note due in November 2022 rose 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000
face value, to 97 27/32.  The yield on the 30-year bond fell three basis points to
3.05 percent.  Yield Curve  The difference between the yields on two-year debt and 10-
year notes earlier steepened to 1.67 percentage points, almost
the most since May, on optimism the global economic recovery is
strengthening, reducing demand for safe-haven assets. It touched
1.69 percentage points on Jan. 4, the widest since May 4.  “We’ve seen a struggle this week in the market between
investors where they have flip-flopped on positive-data figures
or near-term event risks,” said Adrian Miller, director of
fixed-income strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New York.
“Going into the weekend, there’s still uncertainty tied to
various near-term event risks.”  The U.S. sold $66 billion in Treasuries this week,
including $32 billion in  three-year notes  on Jan. 8 at a yield
of 0.385 percent, $21 billion in  10-year debt  the next day at a
yield of 1.863 percent and $13 billion in 3o-year bonds on Jan.
10 at a yield of 3.07 percent.  The sales this week raise $24.4 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $41.6 billion,
according to the Treasury.  The Treasury will sell two-, five and seven-year securities
on three consecutive days starting Jan. 28. The offering sizes
will be announced on Jan. 24. It is scheduled to sell 10-year
inflation-indexed securities on that day.  ‘Inflationary’ Fed  The  yield difference  between 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which
represents traders’ outlook for the rate of inflation over the
life of the securities, touched 2.54 percentage points today,
close to the widest in two months. It touched 2.55 percentage
points yesterday, the highest since Nov. 2. The average over the
past decade is 2.28 percentage points.  The Fed’s  preferred measure  of inflation expectations, the
five-year, five-year forward break-even rate, was 2.82 percent,
compared with a 2012 average of 2.6 percent. The gauge projects
the expected pace of consumer price increases from 2018 to 2023.  “People still expect Fed policy will be inflationary,”
said Brian Edmonds, head of interest rates at Cantor Fitzgerald
LP in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade directly
with the Fed. “Most signs in the economy show that it’s
stabilizing and may get a bit better although it’s not close to
any of the thresholds the FOMC talked about in terms of removing
accommodation. We still have a long way to go.”  Unemployment, Inflation  The Federal Open Market Committee for the first time in
December linked the outlook for its main interest rate to
unemployment and inflation targets. The central bank said the
rate would stay close to zero “at least as long” as
unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and inflation projections
are for no more than 2.5 percent.  The unemployment rate, which has been above 7 percent since
December 2008, held at 7.8 percent in November. In the 12 months
ended in November, consumer prices rose 1.8 percent, the Labor
Department reported in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
