Penson Worldwide Inc. (PNSN) , a provider of
financial clearing services and related operational and
technology products, filed for bankruptcy in  Delaware  with a
plan to liquidate its business.  The Plano, Texas-based company listed both assets and debt
of $100 million to $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed
today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Chapter
11 is the section of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code  used by companies
to reorganize. In 2011, Penson had revenue of $217.3 million,
court papers show.  “Average daily trading volume in equities fell by 5
percent in 2010 and 8 percent in 2011, and short selling
continued to fall in each of the years from 2009 through 2011,”
Bryce B. Engel, chief operating officer of Penson Worldwide,
said in court papers.  “This decrease in market participation and activity had a
direct, negative impact on Penson’s commission and interest
revenues which were closely correlated to activity in the
financial markets,” Engel said.  Penson began to market Nexa Technologies Inc. as a going-
concern sale, and expects to complete a sale of Nexa during the
bankruptcy process, Engel said. Nexa is Penson’s only operating
entity in the U.S. in bankruptcy.  Affiliates SAI Holdings, Penson Financial Services, Penson
Financial Futures, Penson Holdings, Penson Execution Services,
Nexa Technologies, GHP1, GHP2 and Penson Futures also sought
protection.  Penson’s largest unsecured creditors listed in court papers
include holders of about $216 million in 12.5 percent senior
second lien secured notes due in 2017; holders of about $62.9
million in 8 percent senior convertible notes due in 2014; and
Sungard Financial Systems LLC, owed $6.4 million.  The case is In re Penson Worldwide Inc., 13-10061,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
