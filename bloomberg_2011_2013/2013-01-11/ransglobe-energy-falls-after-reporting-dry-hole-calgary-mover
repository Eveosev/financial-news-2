TransGlobe Energy Corp. (TGL) , the
Calgary-based oil producer with operations in  Egypt , declined
the most in six months after reporting a dry hole at the first
of three planned exploration wells at its South Mariut project.  TransGlobe  fell  6.4 percent to C$8.85 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest drop since July 5.  The Al Azayem No. 1 well will be plugged and abandoned
after TransGlobe found no hydrocarbons in what was expected to
be the primary reservoir, the company said today in a statement.
TransGlobe operates South Mariut and holds a 60 percent stake.  The rig will be moved 15 kilometers (9 miles) north to
drill the second planned well, Al Nahda No. 1, into a different
formation that may contain 19 million barrels of oil, according
to the company’s “best estimate” in the statement. A location
for the third well hasn’t been chosen.  Shale and other dense rock removed from the Al Azayem well
will be analyzed for hydrocarbon content, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
