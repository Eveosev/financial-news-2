 France’s Foreign Ministry advised
French nationals to leave  Mali  after President  Francois Hollande 
said he is ready to take military action in the African country.  The government also warned those planning to travel to Mali
to postpone their trips, the ministry said in an advisory
published on its website today.  Action could be taken quickly to halt a renewed offensive
by Islamist rebels in northern Mali, Hollande said in a New
Year’s greeting to ambassadors in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
