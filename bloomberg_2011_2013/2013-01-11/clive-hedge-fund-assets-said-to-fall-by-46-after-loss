Clive Capital LLP’s assets plunged
46 percent in 2012 after the commodity hedge fund lost money for
a second year running and investors withdrew their cash, said
two people with knowledge of the matter.  Clive ended the year managing $1.95 billion, down from $3.6
billion at the end of 2011, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the London-based hedge fund is private. The
fund declined 8.8 percent in 2012 after falling 11 percent a
year earlier, depending on share class, causing some clients to
lose patience with its  investment performance , the people said.  Clive, started in 2008 by former Moore Capital Management
LLC trader  Chris Levett , is among commodity funds that have
struggled to make money over the past two years after price
swings in markets from oil to wheat whipsawed money managers.
The Newedge Commodity Trading Index, which tracks some of the
biggest  hedge funds  focused on energy, metals and agriculture,
fell 6.3 percent in the 23 months through November, latest
available data show.  “Commodity hedge funds had a tough 2012,” said Marcus Storr, head of hedge funds at Feri Trust GmbH in  Bad Homburg ,
Germany. “First, the underlying commodities were weak with the
exception of some agricultural products. There were also choppy
markets. There were a few outliers, but the majority of
commodity hedge funds declined.”  Elizabeth Holstein, who oversees  investor relations  at
Clive, declined to comment.  Assets Fell  Clive managed $2.9 billion at the start of October, meaning
assets fell by about $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012,
the people said. The firm bets on the direction of prices as
well as seeking to profit from differences in related commodity
markets, which is known as relative value trading.  Clive told clients at the start of May that it was getting
“bearish on oil” after concluding that other traders had
become too confident in an economic rebound following four
months of rising stock and commodity prices, according to a
letter obtained by  Bloomberg News . The bet paid off, with Clive
surging 10 percent in May after oil and raw materials reversed
into bear-markets.  Missed Rally  Clive then missed a July commodities rally that was
triggered in part by European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s pledge to defend the euro currency bloc.  The firm’s difficulty making successful trades demonstrates
the challenge commodity traders have faced as the European
sovereign debt crisis, concerns about economic growth in China
and debates over  government spending  in the U.S. roiled markets.  Some of the biggest commodity hedge funds closed last year.
BlueGold Capital Management LLP, the $1 billion energy fund co-
founded by  Pierre Andurand , liquidated after losing 34 percent
in 2011 and  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)  shut a $500 million
commodities fund after it lost almost 13 percent in four months.  Levett, 42, left  Louis Bacon ’s Moore in 2007 to start
Clive. He stopped taking money from investors two years later
after assets climbed to almost $4 billion.  The fund’s Class A shares surged 44 percent in 2008, 17
percent in 2009 and 20 percent in 2010, according to investors.
Class B shares, which started later, rose 16 percent in 2008, 16
percent in 2009 and 18 percent in 2010.  Prior to joining New York-based Moore, Levett worked at
trading firm Commodity Corp. He started out in commodities in
1992 at American International Group Inc., where he traded oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
