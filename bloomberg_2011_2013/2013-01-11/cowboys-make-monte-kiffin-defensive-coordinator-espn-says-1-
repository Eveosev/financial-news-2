The Dallas Cowboys hired 72-year-old
Monte Kiffin as the team’s defensive coordinator, three days
after firing Rob Ryan from that position.  Considered the creator of the Tampa-2 defense, which relies
on team speed and linebackers who can play in pass coverage,
Kiffin resigned this season as defensive coordinator at the
 University of Southern California , where his son Lane is the
head coach.  He also has been defensive coordinator of the NFL’s
Minnesota Vikings (1991), New Orleans Saints (1995) and Tampa
Bay Buccaneers (1996-2008).  “Monte Kiffin’s level of experience and track record of
success as an NFL defensive coordinator are unmatched,” head
coach Jason Garrett said in a statement released yesterday by
the Cowboys. “He has produced NFL defensive units that have
consistently performed at a high level in a scheme that has
stood the test of time.”  The Cowboys (8-8) ranked 17th in the 32-team league against
the run and 21st against the pass this season.  Pittsburgh’s Dick LeBeau, 75, is the oldest defensive
coordinator in the NFL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
