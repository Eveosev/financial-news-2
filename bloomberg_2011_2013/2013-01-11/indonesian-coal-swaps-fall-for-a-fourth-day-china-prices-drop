Swaps prices fell for a fourth day
for thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of
the fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the second
quarter slid 5 cents yesterday to $64.50 a metric ton on a net-
as-received basis, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The February
contract was 5 cents lower at $63.60 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the
second quarter fell 5 cents to $86.30 a ton on a net-as-received
basis, the energy broker said. The February contract gained 30
cents to $85.50 a ton.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has fewer than 6,100 kilocalories
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
