Senalia, the biggest grain-silo
operator in  France ’s Rouen port, plans to embellish its storage
facilities as part of an urban renewal program in the city on
the Seine River.  The grain handler held a competition for ideas to beautify
its silos, 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) west of Rouen’s historic
center, the port wrote in  documents  on its website. The
competition, aimed at architects, engineers, landscapers and
other artists, closed Jan. 7.  Senalia’s gray concrete silos on the Elie peninsula in the
Seine stand 70 meters (230 feet) tall, the height of a  typical 
20-story apartment building. Construction on the terminal
started in 1960 and additional storage capacity was added
through to 1990, for total capacity of 250,000 metric tons of
grains.  “With annual traffic of 2 million tons, the Elie peninsula
is one of the economic lungs of the national grain business,”
the port wrote. “Its sustainability is therefore a prerequisite
for the port of Rouen and the economic actors.”  Rouen, where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake in 1431,
started developing part of the Seine River banks west of the
center in 2000 to link the city and its port area, turning dock-
side warehouses into residential and commercial areas.  A jury will study the entries in February and announce the
winning concept to enhance the silos in March, with a prize of
12,000 euros ($16,000) for the winner, according to the
competition  document .  Senalia operates another 435,000-ton grain storage terminal
downstream of Rouen. Total grain-storage capacity in the Rouen
area is 1.19 million tons.  Rouen is  Europe ’s largest wheat-export port. Senalia’s
silos on the port function as the sole point of delivery for
milling-wheat futures contracts traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
