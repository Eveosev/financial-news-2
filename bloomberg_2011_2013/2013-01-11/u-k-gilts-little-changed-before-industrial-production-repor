U.K. government bonds were little
changed before a government report forecast to show industrial
production increased in November.  The pound reached a two-week low against the euro after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday the
common-currency areaâ€™s economy should gradually recover. U.K.
industrial output rose 0.8 percent according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey, after it fell 0.8 percent
in October. The U.K. is set to auction 2.5 billion pounds of 28-
, 91- and 182-day bills today.  The  10-year gilt  yielded 2.10 percent at 9:18 a.m. in
 London  after rising seven basis points yesterday. The price of
the 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 was at 96.99.  Sterling fell 0.1 percent to 82.18 pence per euro after
depreciating to 82.19 pence, the weakest level since Dec. 28.
The pound dropped 0.1 percent to $1.6151.  The U.K. currency has fallen 1.1 percent this year, the
second-worst performer of 10 developed-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen dropped 3.1
percent and the dollar declined 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
