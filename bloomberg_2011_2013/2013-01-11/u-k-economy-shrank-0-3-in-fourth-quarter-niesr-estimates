Britain’s economy  probably shrank in
the fourth quarter, tipping it closer to a triple-dip recession,
according to an estimate from the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research.  Gross domestic product  fell 0.3 percent in the period after
rising 0.1 percent in the three months through November, the
London-based institute, whose clients include the Bank of
England and the U.K. Treasury, said in a statement today.  Niesr said the estimate for fourth-quarter GDP is
“distorted due to an artificially high level of output” in the
third quarter, when the London Olympics boosted growth.
“Removing these distortions suggests an underlying economic
performance that is best described as flat,” it said.  The estimate follows data today showing  industrial
production  rose less than economists forecast in November and
manufacturing unexpectedly fell. While the U.K. economy emerged
from a recession in the third quarter, the recovery has yet to
gain traction.  Niesr also said that Britain’s economy probably stagnated
in 2012 after growing 0.9 percent the previous year. Economists
in a Bloomberg News survey in December forecast expansion of 1.1
percent in 2013 following a contraction of 0.1 percent last
year.  The  Bank of England ’s Monetary Policy Committee left its
 bond-buying program  on hold at 375 billion pounds ($604 billion)
yesterday. It will have new economic and inflation forecasts at
its next policy meeting in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
