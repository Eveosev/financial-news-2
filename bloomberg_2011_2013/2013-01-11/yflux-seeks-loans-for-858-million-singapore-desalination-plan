Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , Singapore’s biggest
publicly traded water company, will start discussions with
lenders on loans for its S$1.05 billion ($858 million) Tuaspring
venture, the island’s largest desalination plant.  The company is seeking non-recourse project financing,
where the lender can recoup payments from the venture’s profits,
Hyflux said today in a statement. Development and construction
at Tuaspring, Singapore’s second seawater desalination facility,
is on track, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
