Barloworld Ltd. (BAW) , a seller of
equipment to mining and construction companies, fell the most
since Nov. 9 as a monthlong rally that followed a 53 percent
rise in full-year income was snuffed out.  Shares in the Johannesburg-based company declined 3.4
percent at 82.79 rand. About 693,000 shares changed hands, or 88
percent of the three month daily average. The 29-member FTSE/JSE
Africa Industrial Index was down about 0.7 percent.  “Barloworld was in an overbought space for a while,”
 Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at Afrifocus Securities (Pty) Ltd., said
by phone today. “This paring wasn’t a surprise.” The stock’s
relative strength index has been above 70, which to some
technical analysts suggests a security is overbought and may be
set for a reversal.  The stock reached 89.70 rand on Jan. 4, its highest level
since May, following a 22 percent rally from Dec. 3. Barloworld
reported record sales to mines amid a 53 percent rise in full-
year net income to 1.6 billion rand ($180 million) in November.
The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index hit the latest in a series
of record highs on Jan. 9.  The equipment seller’s 30-day historical volatility, a
measure of stock swings, increased to 30.35 from 27.91
yesterday. The FTSE/JSE Africa’s 30-day  volatility measure  was
at 9.10 from 8.97 previously. A higher reading means an asset’s
price can have bigger moves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
