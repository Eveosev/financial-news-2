Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
expanded by almost 265 million euros ($351 million) in December
as commercial lenders set aside more cash with the central bank
to meet mandatory  reserve requirements .  Reserves rose to 10.9 billion euros driven by a net 333.8
million-euro increase in mandatory reserves, the Belgrade-based
Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-mailed statement today.
Inflows included 43.9 million euros from sovereign loans and
grants and 33.6 million euros from government’s debt sales in
December. The biggest cost last month was to repay 58.3 million
euros in debt.  Net reserves, excluding the money commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , were little changed at 6.6 billion euros at the end of
December, the central bank said.  Interbank foreign-currency trading dropped 23 percent on
the month to 1.3 billion euros, bringing the 12-month volume in
the market to 17.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
