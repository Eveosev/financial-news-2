Norway  and  Sweden  need to build more
power links to  Germany  to handle rising production from hydro
plants and other renewable sources, according to a German
industry lobby group.  The Scandinavian nations need to add seven to 12 gigawatts
of capacity in the next three decades, Bundesverband der
Deutschen Industrie e.V., said today in an e-mail. That’s on top
of Statnett SF’s 1,400 megawatt  undersea cable  from Germany to
Norway that is scheduled for completion by 2018.  “We see economic potential for additional interconnector
capacities,” said Carsten Rolle, executive director of the
Berlin-based lobby group.  The increase in capacity would benefit Norway because
Germany would be able to ship excess output to the Nordic nation
to pump water into higher reservoirs to be released at periods
of high demand, according to Rolle.  Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said this week
that the construction of too much export capacity would push up
domestic power prices and damage manufacturing industries. The
country should apply a “measured pace” when building power
links, Stoltenberg said on Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
