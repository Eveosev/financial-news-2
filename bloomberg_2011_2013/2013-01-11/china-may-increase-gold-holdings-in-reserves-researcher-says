China , owner of the world’s largest
foreign exchange reserves, may increase gold holdings to
diversify away from the  U.S. dollar , a researcher said.  “There’s no reason why the Chinese central bank should
hold a disproportionate amount of other countries’ reserve
currencies such as the dollar,”  David Marsh , chairman of the
Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, said today
in an interview in Beijing. “It is likely that the Chinese
authorities will carry on purchasing gold in modest amounts and
they will do it in a way calculated not to disturb the market.”  Gold climbed to a record $1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6,
2011 and traded little changed at $1,674.45 an ounce at 8:29 a.m.
Beijing time.  “As China aspires to take the lead politically and
economically, it is unlikely to be satisfied with storing its
wealth simply in liabilities of other countries,” Marsh wrote
in a report commissioned by the World Gold Council and published
today.  The Chinese  yuan , also known as  renminbi , is expected to
emerge gradually as a new reserve currency along with its
growing use in trade and investment, according to the report.  “By the year 2020, the renminbi will be the third-biggest,
or one of the three biggest, reserve currencies in the world,”
Marsh said in the interview.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
