Iran  rejected media reports that it
is behind a wave of online attacks against U.S. banks, saying it
disapproves of offensives against financial bodies.  “Iran respects international law and refrains from
targeting other nations’ economic or financial institutions,”
Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a statement issued
yesterday, according to a report published on the state-run
 Press TV  news channel’s website. Iran condemns the use of
malware that targets service-providing institutions and violates
states’ sovereignty, according to the statement.  In the past four months, online banking sites including
those of  Bank of America Corp. , Citigroup Inc.,  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC) ,  U.S. Bancorp (STL)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  have faced major
disruptions, according to a Jan. 8  New York  Times  report .  James A. Lewis, a former official in the State and Commerce
Departments and a computer security expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, was quoted as
saying in the report that “there is no doubt within the U.S.
government that Iran is behind these attacks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
