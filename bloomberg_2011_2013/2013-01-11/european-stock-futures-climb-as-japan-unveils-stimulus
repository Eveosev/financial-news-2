European stocks slipped for a second
day as an inflation report led to concern that China has less
room for monetary easing, while the trade deficit of the U.S.
unexpectedly widened.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  slid 2.7 percent, the biggest
contribution to the Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s slide.  Tullow Oil
Plc (TLW)  sank 3.2 percent after saying it will write off $299 million
in 2012.  SAP AG (SAP)  gained 1.2 percent after unveiling the most
significant overhaul of its enterprise software in two decades.  The Stoxx 600 lost 0.1 percent to 287.08 at the close in
London. The equity benchmark declined 0.3 percent this week. The
volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 shares was 19
percent greater than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Chinese inflation report is what is weighing on
equities today as it has some investors worried that it could
limit the degree of further stimulus in China,” Mark Andersen,
co-head of  asset allocation  at UBS AG in Zurich, said in a
telephone interview. “We still think the positive growth
momentum is supportive of markets. We’re seeing a synchronized
pickup of growth on a global basis, providing investors with an
underlying positive sentiment.”  Trade Deficit  In the U.S., a Commerce Department release showed that the
country’s trade deficit widened to $48.7 billion in November
from a revised $42.1 billion in October. The median forecast of
69 economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a deficit of
$41.3 billion.  China’s inflation accelerated more than forecast to a
seven-month high, limiting room for monetary easing to support
the recovering economy. The  consumer price index  rose 2.5
percent in December from a year earlier, exceeding the 2.3
 percent median estimate  of 42 economists.  Higher inflation means tighter monetary policy, a stronger
currency to limit imported inflation, less liquidity and higher
rates in the second half of the year, said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a
Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.  In  Japan , the Cabinet Office said the government will spend
10.3 trillion yen ($115 billion) to drag the economy out of its
 third recession  in the last five years. The stimulus will
increase gross domestic product by about 2 percentage points and
create some 600,000 jobs, according to the statement.  Manufacturing Production  In the U.K., a report showed manufacturing production
unexpectedly dropped in November.  Factory output  decreased 0.3
percent from October. The  average estimate  compiled by  Bloomberg
News  had called for it to increase 0.5 percent.  A gauge of European mining shares posted the biggest drop
of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600, slumping 1.7
percent.  BHP Billiton , the  world’s largest mining company ,
declined 2.7 percent to 2,075 pence, its biggest slide since
August. Rio Tinto Group lost 1.2 percent to 3,468 pence.  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , which named  Mark Cutifani  as its new chief
executive officer on Jan. 8, dropped 1.5 percent to 2,042 pence.  Tullow Oil slumped 3.2 percent to 1,186 pence. The U.K.
explorer focusing on Africa and  Latin America  said it more than
doubled write-offs from exploration in 2012 because of
unsuccessful wells in Ghana, Guyana and Suriname.  Acciona SA (ANA)  slipped 2.9 percent to 62.86 euros after HSBC
Holdings Plc downgraded the company to neutral from overweight,
meaning that investors should not buy more of the shares. HSBC
cited clarity on renewable levies in Spain and contract wins for
Acciona’s water division.  The shares  surged 113 percent from
July through yesterday, while the IBEX gained 45 percent.  SAP Gains  SAP climbed 1.2 percent to 61.32 euros. The world’s largest
maker of enterprise software unveiled a faster version of its
Business Suite applications at an event in  Palo Alto ,
 California . SAP executives said they aim to replace software
from Oracle, Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines
Corp. that customers use to process and analyze information.  Cap Gemini SA (CAP)  added 2.3 percent to 34.29 euros as rival IT
outsourcing company Infosys Ltd. jumped the most since its
initial public offering in 1993 in Mumbai trading after raising
its full-year sales forecast.  Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT)  surged 6.1 percent to 15.57 euros,
its biggest gain in five months. Portugal’s biggest retailer
said sales rose 11 percent in 2012. The company said on Dec. 11
that revenue would grow by at least 10 percent a year in the
three years through 2015.  National benchmark indexes gained in 11 of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  markets. France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX both
advanced 0.1 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.3
percent.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures volatility on the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 50 Index, dropped 3.4 percent to 15.57,
its lowest since June 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
