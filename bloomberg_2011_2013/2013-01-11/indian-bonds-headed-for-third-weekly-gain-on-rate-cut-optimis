India ’s 10-year bonds were poised
for a third weekly advance on speculation the central bank will
reduce  interest rates  as the economy is predicted to expand at
the slowest pace in a decade.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the repurchase  rate  by
50 basis points to 7.5 percent by the end of March, after
keeping it unchanged since April, according to 11 of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Gross domestic product will increase by
about 5.7 percent to 5.9 percent in the financial year through
March, the  finance ministry  said in a mid-year review presented
to Parliament on Dec. 17.  “The markets are pricing in the prospects of easing going
forward and investors should look forward to yields remaining
soft,” said N.S. Venkatesh, Mumbai-based head of treasury at
state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  “The RBI will have to shift its
balance toward growth, even as inflation, though trending down,
remains high.”  The rate on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, this week to 7.86
percent as of 9:15 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. It fell two basis points today to the
lowest level for a benchmark 10-year security since Sept. 29,
2010.  Factory Output  Wholesale prices probably rose 7.37 percent in December
from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey before the
figures are published on Jan. 14. Costs increased 7.24 percent
in November, the slowest pace in 10 months, official data show.  Government data due today will show industrial  output 
climbed 0.1 percent in November, compared with an 8.2 percent
advance in October, according to a separate Bloomberg News
survey. Factory production contracted in five of the first 10
months of 2012.  Seven of the economists surveyed on the repurchase rate see
a 25 basis point reduction by the end of this quarter. Of the
remaining three, UBS AG expects a 100 basis point cut, Westpac
Banking Corp. predicts the rate will be held, while Woori CBV
Securities Corp. sees a quarter of a percentage point increase.
The next policy review is on Jan. 29.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 7.57 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate rose one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
