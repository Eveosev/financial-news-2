Colombia ’s peso was poised for a
weekly rally on speculation increased foreign investment will
make the currency more attractive.  The peso was little changed at 1,763.50 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:10 a.m. in Bogota and was headed for an increase of 0.4
percent since Jan. 4. Colombia’s peso rallied 9.7 percent last
year, the most after the Polish zloty and Hungarian forint among
171 counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  “Colombia’s fundamentals point to a stronger peso,”
Eduardo Bolanos, an analyst at Asesores en Valores brokerage in
Bogota, said in a phone interview. “Foreign direct and
portfolio investment are coming into Colombia and they will
continue to come in.”  The government cut taxes on overseas investors’ earnings
from domestic securities to 14 percent from 33 percent as of
Jan. 1 to help increase demand and lower borrowing costs.  Agriculture Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo urged the central
bank on Jan. 9 to boost dollar purchases to ease gains in the
local currency, which are marking coffee, flower and banana
exporters less competitive.  The peso touched 1,750.50 on Jan. 2, the strongest intraday
level since July 2011. Central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe
said that day on RCN Radio that the  exchange rate  is a concern
and reiterated that Banco de la Republica will buy a minimum of
$20 million a day through at least the first quarter. The
central bank printed pesos to purchase a record $4.4 billion
last year.  The peso will probably rally to 1,750 this month, which may
prompt policy makers to increase U.S. dollar purchases,
according to Bolanos.  The yield on 10 percent peso-denominated debt due in July
2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.49
percent today, according to the central bank. The price fell
0.247 centavo to 137.706 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
