in November.  Imports rose to $39.5 billion, as volumes increased 2.2%.
Electronic and electrical equipment and parts led the gain in
overall imports, followed closely by motor vehicles and parts as
well as metal and non-metallic mineral products.  Exports declined to $37.5 billion, as prices were down 1.3%.
Exports of farm, fishing and intermediate food products as well

to the overall decline.  Exports to the United States grew 3.9% to $28.3 billion.
Imports from the  United States  rose 1.7% to $25.0 billion, the

international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula (2007=100).  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010 -
X201000311141&amp;lang=fra) .  Beginning with the release of the January 2013 reference
month, the Canadian international merchandise trade data will be
made available on average 35 days after the end of the reference
month, on average 5 days earlier than previously. For further
information, consult the release date calendar
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/release-diffusion/2013-eng.htm#a6 ) .  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data are revised with the
release of the January, February and March reference months.
Revisions to BOP based data for the previous three years are
released annually in June with the April reference month.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
sector with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables,
free of charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
