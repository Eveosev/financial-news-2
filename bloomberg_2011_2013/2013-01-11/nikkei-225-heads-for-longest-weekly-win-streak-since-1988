     Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  shares  rose a third day,
with the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average capping its longest weekly win
streak since December 1988, as the yen slid and the Cabinet
approved 10.3 trillion yen ($116 billion) in stimulus to speed
the economic recovery.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, added 2.3
percent.  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asia’s leading apparel chain,
climbed 4.8 percent after raising its profit forecast. Sharp
Corp. led gains on the Nikkei 225 after the Mainichi newspaper
reported that the television maker expects to record its first
operating profit in five quarters.  The Nikkei 225 climbed 1.4 percent to close at 10,801.57 in
 Tokyo , rising 1.1 percent on the week. Volume on the gauge was
almost 32 percent higher than the 30-day average. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index advanced 1.1 percent to 898.69 after rising as much
as 1.5 percent, with about two stocks gaining for each that
fell. Shares pared gains after the government announced the
stimulus plan.  “The package wasn’t much of a surprise and shows they are
making steady progress to make their promises come true,” said
Kenichi Kubo, a senior  fund manager  at Tokio Marine Asset
Management Co., which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($56
billion). “Money is flowing into Japanese stocks from overseas
as well.”  The Topix advanced 24 percent since Nov. 14 when elections
were announced, driving the gauge into a  bull market  on
expectations a new government would call for more stimulus. An
advance of 20 percent or more from a low signals a bull market
to some investors. Net buying of Japanese shares by foreign
investors in 2012 was the highest since 2010, according to Tokyo
Stock Exchange.  The gauge is trading at 1.07 times book value,
compared with 2.21 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.59
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Stimulus Plan  The stimulus package announced today will include 3.8
trillion yen for disaster prevention and 3.1 trillion yen to
stimulate investment. The plan will increase gross domestic
product by about 2 percentage points and create about 600,000
jobs, according to the Cabinet Office. Before the announcement,
the government reported a bigger-than-expected current account
deficit in November.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The U.S.
equity benchmark yesterday rose 0.8 percent to the highest level
in five years with financial shares leading gains.  Exporters gained as the yen fell against 14 of its 16 major
peers for a second day, trading near a 2 1/2 year low against
the dollar. A weaker currency boosts the value of overseas
earnings for Japanese companies.  Canon added 2.3 percent to 3,370 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s
No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, rose 1.6 percent to 983
yen.  China Inflation  Japanese shares maintained gains even after  China ’s
inflation in December accelerated more than forecast to a seven-
month high as the nation’s coldest winter in 28 years pushed up
vegetable prices. Rising inflation limits room for easing to
bolster growth.  Fast Retailing gained 4.8 percent to 23,640 yen. The
clothier saying its net income will probably be 87 billion yen
for the year ending August, higher than its previous forecast of
84.5 billion yen, as sales overseas rise.  Sharp jumped 13 percent to 330 yen after the Mainichi
newspaper reported it expects to post an operating profit for
the first time in five quarters.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 4.2 percent
to 20.99, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Japan’s Nikkei 225
January options settled at 10,771.98 today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
