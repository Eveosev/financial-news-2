Romania ’s  inflation  rate rose more
than forecast in December, exceeding the central bank’s 2012
target, on rising food and electricity prices.  The inflation rate rose to 4.95 percent from 4.6 percent in
November, the Bucharest-based National Statistics Institute said
today in an e-mail. The median estimate of 15 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg was 4.6 percent. Prices grew 0.6 percent
from the previous month.  Romanian monetary-policy makers kept the benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged at 5.25 percent at the first meeting of this year
on Jan. 7 to weigh inflationary pressures against a slowdown in
economic growth. The government lowered its 2012 economic-growth
forecast yesterday to 0.7 percent from about 1 percent and to
1.8 percent in 2013 from about 2 percent, according to Minister
Delegate for Budget Liviu Voinea.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei targeted inflation of
between 2 percent to 4 percent at the end of 2012, from 3.1
percent in 2011 when it met its target for the first time since
2007. The bank forecast inflation at 5.1 percent at the end of
December because of a drought-induced increase in food prices.
It targets inflation at 2.5 percent plus or minus 1 percentage
point in 2013.  Food-cost growth accelerated to 6.2 percent in December
from a year earlier on rising vegetable prices, compared with
5.9 percent in November. Inflation for non-food items picked up
to 4.5 percent, compared with 3.7 percent in November, on higher
electricity prices, according to the report.  Service-price growth slowed to 3.6 percent from a year ago,
compared with 4.1 percent in November, as a stronger currency
lowered transport, rent and telephone prices gauged in euros,
the institute said.  -- With assistance from Barbara Sladkowska in Warsaw. Editor:
