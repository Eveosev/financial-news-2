Corn and wheat surged the most in at
least three months after a government  report  showed drought and
rising demand eroded stockpiles more than previously forecast in
the U.S., the world’s biggest grain exporter.  Corn futures for March delivery surged as much as 3.6
percent on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, before settling up 1.4
percent at $7.0875 a bushel at 2 p.m. Wheat futures for March
delivery gained as much as 3.8 percent, the most since Sept. 28,
before settling at $7.5475 a bushel, up 1.4 percent.  Inventories of corn on Dec. 1, after the 2012 harvest, were
8.03 billion bushels, down 17 percent from a year earlier and
the smallest for that date since 2003, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said. Analysts had predicted 8.219 billion on
average in a Bloomberg survey. Wheat  reserves  on May 31, before
the 2013 harvest, will be 716 million bushels, down 5 percent
from a December forecast and 741 million forecast by analysts.  “Supplies are tight, and the market’s job is to rally to
slow down usage,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities
Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.
“Now the attention shifts to prevailing drought conditions in
the western Midwest and the upcoming planting season.”  Crops from Ohio to  Nebraska  were hurt by the worst drought
since the 1930s, sending corn prices up as much as 68 percent
since mid-June to a record $8.49 on Aug. 10. Production plunged
13 percent and was the lowest in six years, USDA data show.
Wheat prices surged to a four-year high of $9.4725 on July 23,
as crop conditions deteriorated to the worst on record in
November, when winter grain went dormant. The fields will resume
growth in April and be harvested in June.  ‘Bullish Numbers’  “The corn stocks were pretty friendly” for prices,  Jason Britt , the president of brokerage Central States Commodities
Inc. in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said by telephone. “The wheat
stocks number and the acreage played into the positive side. We
trade carryouts and stockpiles and we got bullish numbers in
this report.”  The harvest of corn, the nation’s biggest crop, totaled
10.78 billion bushels, the USDA said in a separate report today.
While that’s up from 10.725 billion estimated in December, it’s
down from 12.36 billion collected in 2011 and the lowest in six
years. Analysts expected 10.65 billion bushels, on average.  An estimated 4.5 billion bushels will be used to produce
ethanol, unchanged from the December forecast and down from
5.011 billion in the previous year, the USDA said. Feed demand
will total 4.45 billion bushels, up from 4.15 billion projected
a month ago and less than 4.548 billion a year earlier, the
agency said.  Harvest Decline  While the government estimates winter-wheat  planting  rose
1.2 percent from a year earlier to 41.819 million acres, only 82
percent, or 34.292 million, will actually be harvested after dry
weather stunted growth and prevented some plants from emerging
from the ground,  Richard Feltes , the vice president of research
at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago, said in an e-mailed
report today.  The USDA forecast lower domestic wheat stockpiles as the
amount used in  animal feed  is set to increase. About 350 million
bushels will be used in cattle rations, 11 percent more than the
315 million projected last month, according to the report.  Since reaching their highs last year, grain prices had
tumbled as the outlook for global supply improved and demand
slowed. Corn futures slipped as much as 19 percent from their
closing high in August, while wheat slipped into a  bear market ,
dropping as much as 21 percent. That may have sparked demand
from users and speculative investors, Britt said.  “Corn, wheat, even soybeans, a lot of these markets
suffered into the end of the year,” he said. “A lot of  New
York  guys and Chicago guys were selling, and the funds were
leaning to the short side. You get too many people on one side
of the boat and eventually it’s going to tip over.”  -- Editors: Steve Stroth, Thomas Galatola  To contact the reporters on this story:
