South Korea ’s three-year bonds fell,
with yields rebounding from a record low, as the central bank
kept borrowing costs unchanged.  The Bank of  Korea  left its  seven-day repurchase rate  at
2.75 percent today in a decision predicted by all but one of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. One had forecast a 25 basis
point cut, after similar moves at reviews in July and October.
The won, the best performer of the past year among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, climbed to a 17-month high.  “There are some signs the Korean and the global economies
may have bottomed, reducing the need for an interest rate cut,”
said Kong Dong Rak, fixed-income analyst at Hanwha Investment &
Securities Co. in  Seoul . “The  Bank of Korea  has already cut
rates last year to help the economy and too many rate reductions
could weaken the impact of a cut.”  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due 2015
climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.74
percent as of 10:06 a.m. in Seoul, according to Korea Exchange
prices. It fell to 2.70 percent yesterday, the lowest for a
benchmark three-year note in data going back to 2000.  The won gained 0.4 percent to trade at 1,056.38 against the
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level since Aug. 4, 2011.  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week he was
concerned about herd behavior in the foreign-exchange market and
may introduce measures to curb the won’s volatility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
