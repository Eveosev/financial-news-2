Blackburn Rovers named Michael
Appleton as manager to replace the fired Henning Berg, the
second-tier English soccer team said on its website.  Appleton, 37, joins Blackburn on a 2 1/2-year contract from
Blackpool, which hired him in November. Berg was fired Dec. 27
after just 57 days in charge, winning one of his 10 games.  Blackburn is currently 13th of 24 teams in the Championship
after being relegated from the Premier League last season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
