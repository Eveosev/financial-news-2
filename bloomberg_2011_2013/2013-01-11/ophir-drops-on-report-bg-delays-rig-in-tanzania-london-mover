Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR) , a U.K. oil and gas
explorer focusing on Africa, fell the most in 11 weeks in  London 
trading after joint-venture partner  BG Group Plc (BG/)  decided to hand
back a rig in Tanzania.  Ophir dropped 4.5 percent to close at 537 pence, the
biggest one-day decline since Oct. 24, valuing the London-based
company at 2.15 billion pounds ($3.5 billion).  BG said it hasn’t exercised an option to extend the Deepsea
Metro I rig beyond June 8 as the venture looks for cheaper
drilling in the second half of the year. The decision may slow
Ophir’s hunt for oil and gas in East Africa.  “This may delay the high-impact exploration on outboard
Block 1 and raise doubt in investors’ minds about BG’s
enthusiasm chasing the exploration upside until a new rig is
confirmed, weighing on the stock short-term,” Laura Loppacher,
an analyst at Jefferies Group Inc. in London, said today.  Patrick Handley, a spokesman for Ophir, declined to
comment.  Ophir  said  last month the rig moved to the Mzia-2 appraisal
well, due for completion in late January. The drillship will
then return to the Jodari asset for a drill stem test, after
which the joint venture plans to resume exploration in Block 1,
it said.  Ophir has an interest in Blocks 1, 3, 4, 7 and East Pande
off  Tanzania , according to its website. The BG venture, in which
Ophir has a 40 percent share, had discovered 13.5 trillion to 21
trillion cubic feet of gas-in-place across Blocks 1, 3 and 4 as
of September, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
