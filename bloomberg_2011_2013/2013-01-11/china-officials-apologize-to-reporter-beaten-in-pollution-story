Provincial authorities apologized to
a China Central Television journalist who was beaten up while
reporting a story about pollution at a paper mill, the state-run
Global Times newspaper said today.  Zhao Xi was attacked Jan. 9 after he went to film illegal
pollution emissions at the mill in Yueyang in southern  Hunan
province , the newspaper reported. Two employees at the mill were
arrested and local officials visited Zhao to apologize, it said.  The local government held an emergency meeting after the
attack and ordered an investigation into the pollution
allegations, according to the newspaper. It said Zhao suffered
“slight injuries” to his forehead.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
