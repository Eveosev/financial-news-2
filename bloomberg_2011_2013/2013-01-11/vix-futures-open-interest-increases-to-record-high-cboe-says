Ownership of  futures  on the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index rose to a record today
after a two-month rally took the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index to
the highest level since December 2007.  Open interest in futures on the gauge known as the  VIX (VIX) 
climbed to 438,038 this morning, eclipsing the previous high set
in September, according to the CBOE Futures Exchange. The
increase came after the gauge of  S&P 500  option prices posted a
record weekly drop of 39 percent last week and retreated for six
consecutive days through Jan. 8.  The S&P 500 has  rallied  8.7 percent from its November low
as the  Federal Reserve  expanded its bond purchase program to
boost the economy and lawmakers passed a bill averting most of
the more than $600 billion of spending cuts and tax increases
known as the fiscal cliff. The index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,469.05 at 1:22 p.m. in  New York  today, after reaching a five-
year high yesterday.  The VIX gained 0.2 percent to 13.52 today.  Total volume in futures on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index rose to a record 23.79 million in
2012, up from 12.03 million the year before, the CBOE Futures
Exchange said on Jan. 2.  CBOE Futures Exchange is a unit of Chicago-based  CBOE
Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , which has the sole license to trade futures on
the CBOE Volatility Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
