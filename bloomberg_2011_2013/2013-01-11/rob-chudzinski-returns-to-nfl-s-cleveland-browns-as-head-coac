Rob Chudzinski is returning to the
 Cleveland  Browns as head coach after two stints as an assistant
with the National Football League team.  The 44-year-old Chudzinski succeeds Pat Shurmur, who was
fired Dec. 31, the day after the Browns ended the season 5-11
and finished their two years under him with a 9-23 record.
Chudzinski will be the Browns’ 14th head coach.  Chudzinski spent the 2004 season with the Browns as tight
ends coach and 2007-08 as offensive coordinator. In 2007, he
directed Cleveland to its best offense in terms of total yards
(5,621), passing yards (3,726) and points scored (402) since the
club’s return in 1999, the team said in a statement on their
website last night.  In 2011, his first year with the Carolina Panthers,
Chudzinski tutored quarterback Cam Newton, who became the first
rookie in NFL history to throw for 4,000 yards and set a league
record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback with 14. The
Panthers also became the first team in league history with three
700-yard rushers in DeAngelo Williams (836), Jonathan Stewart
(761) and Newton (706).  The Panthers also set club records for total yards (6,237)
and first downs (345) in 2011, one year after experiencing
franchise lows in both categories. Carolina scored 48 touchdowns
after recording 17 the year prior to Chudzinski’s arrival.  The Panthers also moved from last in total yardage to
seventh, marking the biggest improvement in the league since the
St. Louis Rams went from 27th in 1998 to first in 1999.  Chudzinski will be introduced today by the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
