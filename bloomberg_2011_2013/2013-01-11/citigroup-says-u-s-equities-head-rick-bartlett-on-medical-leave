Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
 U.S. bank , said North American equities head Richard “Rick” Bartlett has taken a medical leave of absence.  Bartlett took the leave earlier this month, according to
Scott Helfman, a spokesman for the New York-based lender, who
declined to comment further. Bartlett couldn’t be reached at his
office and didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  He joined Citigroup in 1990, according to records from the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and helps oversee a
business that  posted  global revenue of $1.96 billion for the
first nine months of 2012.  Global equities head Derek Bandeen and Suni Harford, head
of markets for North America, will assume Bartlett’s duties on
on an interim basis, according to a person familiar with the
arrangement who requested anonymity because the details aren’t
public.  Wall Street equities units are responsible for the trading
of shares as well as equity derivatives, contracts whose values
are based on underlying securities, such as common stock. They
deal with some of the firms’ biggest clients, including  hedge
funds , pension funds and asset managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
