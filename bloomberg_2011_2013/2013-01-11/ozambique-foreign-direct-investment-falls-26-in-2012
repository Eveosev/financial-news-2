Foreign direct investment approved
by Mozambique’s  Investment Promotion Center  fell 26 percent in
2012 from a year earlier, the investment agency said.  Foreign investments declined to $725.8 million last year
from $974.5 million, the Maputo-based agency said today in an e-
mailed statement. The investments approved by the agency were
for industries including farming, banking, construction and
tourism, it said.  The agency didn’t take into account some mining and gas
exploration investments that were given the go-ahead last year,
