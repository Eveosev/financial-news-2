Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale
provided about 35 million euros ($46 million) for a 30-megawatt
solar-power plant in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt.  Parabel AG and SRU Solar AG developed the project that uses
about 121,000 modules from  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  and inverters from
 Siemens AG (SIE)  and Danfoss A/S, the German lender said in an e-
mailed statement. NordLB provided the project with a long-term
loan and a refinancing loan from KFW Groupâ€™s renewable energy
aid program in contracts signed last month, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
