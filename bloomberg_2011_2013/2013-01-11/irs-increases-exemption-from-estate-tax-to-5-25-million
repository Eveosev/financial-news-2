Taxpayers will be able to leave an
extra $130,000 to their heirs free of estate taxes this year
under cost-of-living adjustments announced by the  Internal
Revenue Service .  The estate-tax exemption for 2013 will be $5.25 million for
individuals, up from $5.12 million in 2012, the IRS said in a
statement today. For married couples, the combined threshold is
$10.5 million.  The budget deal passed by Congress Jan. 1 made permanent
the estate- and gift-tax exclusions and indexed them for
inflation so they will increase over time. The exemption limits
were set to drop to $1 million in 2013 if Congress hadnâ€™t acted.  The IRS announcement on cost-of-living adjustments for 2013
also affects the standard deduction and personal exemption
thresholds as well as the brackets for income-tax rates. The
budget deal created a new  tax  rate of 39.6 percent for
individuals whose annual income exceeds $400,000, or $450,000
for married couples.  To contact the reporter on this story:
