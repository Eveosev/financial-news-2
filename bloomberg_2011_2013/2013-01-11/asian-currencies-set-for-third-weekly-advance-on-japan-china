Asian currencies headed for a third
weekly advance as  Japan ’s 10.3 trillion yen ($116 billion)
spending package and a rebound in China’s exports improved the
outlook for a global economic recovery.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose to a 16-month
high as overseas sales from China,  Taiwan  and  Malaysia  grew more
than analysts had forecast, according to official figures
released this week. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s fiscal
package will increase gross domestic product by about 2
percentage points and create about 600,000 jobs, according to a
statement released by the Cabinet Office today.  “The global outlook is continuing to improve and we remain
constructive on  emerging markets  for the year as external risks
diminish,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior strategist at
Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong. “The mood was boosted by the
Japanese fiscal stimulus plan. We expect most regional
currencies to do well.”  India ’s rupee strengthened 1.4 percent this week through
yesterday to 54.5775 per dollar, according data compiled by
Bloomberg. Malaysia’s ringgit climbed 1.1 percent in the past
five days to 3.0195 as of 10:15 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur,  Thailand ’s
baht gained 0.9 percent to 30.25 and South Korea’s won rose 0.7
percent to 1,056.73.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
active currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.25 percent this
week. The gauge touched 118.63 today and yesterday, the
strongest level since September 2011.  Record Inflows  Emerging-market equity funds attracted their biggest-ever
weekly inflows of $7.4 billion in the seven days ended Jan. 9,
Jonathan Garner and Pankaj Mataney, Morgan Stanley analysts,
wrote in a report today. Developing-nation debt lured its
second-largest inflows of $2 billion, according to the report,
citing data from EPFR Global.  China , the top destination for exports from South Korea,
Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, reported a 6 percent increase in
imports for December yesterday, the fastest growth in six
months. Exports climbed 14 percent, the most since May.  The rupee climbed to a one-week high of 54.565 yesterday on
speculation the central bank will reduce borrowing costs to
support growth.  Wholesale prices rose 7.37 percent in December from a year
earlier, near the 10-month low of 7.24 percent in November,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before
data due Jan. 14. The Reserve Bank of India will review interest
rates on Jan. 29.  Malaysia Output  The ringgit gained for a fifth day, its longest winning
streak since September, after government reports showed factory
production and exports improved. Industrial output in Southeast
Asia’s third-largest economy rose 7.5 percent in November from a
year earlier, while overseas shipments grew 3.3 percent, both
beating economists’ estimates.  “China trade numbers are fueling optimism global growth is
picking up,” said Roy Teo, a currency strategist in  Singapore 
at ABN Amro Bank NV. “There is new optimism and new money
coming into financial markets. Risk-on may persist till the end
of the month.”  Elsewhere in Asia, the Philippine peso appreciated 0.7
percent this week to 40.628 per dollar, Taiwan’s dollar advanced
0.6 percent to NT$28.949, while the Chinese  yuan  gained 0.23
percent to 6.2159.  Indonesia ’s rupiah was little changed from
last week at 9,661.  To contact the reporter on this story:
