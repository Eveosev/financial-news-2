Grupo Pao de Acucar ,  Brazil ’s biggest retailer, fell the most in
two months after reporting sales at supermarkets open at least a
year grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter.  Shares slid 3.2 percent to 89 reais at the close of trading
in Sao Paulo after earlier tumbling as much as 4.2 percent in
the steepest intraday drop since May 23. It was the worst
performance on the benchmark Bovespa index, which fell 0.3
percent.  Same-store sales at supermarkets rose 5.6 percent in the
three months through December from the same period a year
earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory filing
yesterday. The increase in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 8.7
percent.  “Those figures were disappointing because the end of the
year usually represents a good time for retailers,” Karina Freitas, an analyst at brokerage Concordia SA in  Sao Paulo , said
in a phone interview. “Consumers took advantage of government
incentives to buy products such as cars in the middle of 2012,
so by Christmas there was less disposable income for more
spending.”  President  Dilma Rousseff  last year lowered taxes on
 consumer goods , asked banks to reduce borrowing costs, ordered
power utilities and phone companies to cut prices and capped car
imports from  Mexico  to boost domestic demand and spur growth in
Latin America’s biggest economy.  Pao de Acucar’s net revenue advanced 9.1 percent to 14.6
billion reais ($7.2 billion) in the fourth quarter and 9.3
percent to 50.9 billion reais for 2012, according to yesterday’s
filing. Earnings will be released Feb. 19.  Shares (PCAR4)  gained 35 percent in 2012, compared with the
Bovespa’s 7.4 advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
