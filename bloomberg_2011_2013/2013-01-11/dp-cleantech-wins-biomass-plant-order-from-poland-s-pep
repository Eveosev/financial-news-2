DP CleanTech Group Ltd. won a $34.1
million order from  Polish Energy Partners SA (PEP)  to build a 30-
megawatt biomass power plant in Winsko, southwest  Poland .  The project will be built over the next two years, with the
aim of starting up the plant at the end of 2014, DP Cleantech
said today in an e-mailed statement that was dated Jan. 8. The
straw-fired technology will also be able to handle a fuel mix
that’s as much as 90 percent woodchips, the company said.  DP CleanTech, which developed its technology in Europe, has
headquarters in Copenhagen and Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
