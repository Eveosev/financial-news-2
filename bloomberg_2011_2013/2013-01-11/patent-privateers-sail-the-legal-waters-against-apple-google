To harry other nations without
attacking them, monarchs like  England ’s Elizabeth I commissioned
ship captains to plunder merchant vessels, creating a type of
pirate known as a privateer.  The term is used today to describe businesses that obtain
patents from technology companies and then file infringement
lawsuits against the sellers’ competitors. Tech companies use
privateers to distract their adversaries or collect royalties on
the patents without provoking retaliatory litigation, said Ron Laurie, managing director of Inflexion Point Strategy LLC in
 Palo Alto ,  California .  Nokia Oyj (NOK) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and Alcatel-Lucent are among
companies connected with these licensing firms. Companies that
would, in the past, assert their patents in lawsuits only to
protect their property now say they work with privateers because
they’re obligated to make money from past research.  “The moral stigma of being associated with patent
assertion isn’t what it used to be,” said Laurie, who advises
companies on intellectual-property purchases. “The whole
patent-assertion business is becoming more and more legitimized
through these privateering operations.”  The practice of selling patents and retaining the rights to
share in lawsuit proceeds probably will grow as early innovators
in mobile-phone development, such as Nokia and Ericsson AB, lose
market share to the likes of Apple and Samsung Electronics Co.  It can also make it hard to figure out who actually owns a
patent. The U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office  plans at a  meeting 
today to discuss possible rules requiring more disclosure about
the “real party in interest” in patents and applications.  Litigation Strategies  “Every large company is selling patents today,” said  Ron Epstein , chief executive officer of patent brokerage Epicenter
IP Group LLC.  “When they are selling, they are looking for the best
possible price,” he said. “Does an intelligent manager of a
resource called a patent have a responsibility of getting the
highest possible return for these assets, or do they have to
worry about how it will harm competitors?”  Yesterday, a Nevada licensing company,  Unwired Planet Inc. (UPIP) ,
said Ericsson had sold it 2,185 phone-related patents and
applications in return for “certain ongoing rights in future
revenues.”  MobileMedia Ideas LLC, a licensing company holding former
Nokia patents, last month won a jury verdict against  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,
which has an agreement allowing use of different patents Nokia
owns.  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  and Alcatel-Lucent also have transferred
 patent rights  to entities filing infringement suits, and are
entitled to share their licensing proceeds.  MobileMedia is “solely responsible for their own licensing
and litigation strategies,” said Mark Durrant, a spokesman for
the Finnish handset maker.  Fewer Risks  Companies that sell patents don’t face the costs of
litigation or the possibility of a countersuit against their
products, Laurie said.  When Nokia sued Apple in 2009, the iPhone maker lodged
infringement claims against Nokia. The companies, which could
have faced limits on sales of their products if they lost,
negotiated an agreement two years later.  Five years ago, any connections with patent-assertion
companies reflected poorly, Laurie said. “Now that’s kind of
history and everyone’s singing ‘How can I get in on this
action?’” he said.  Patent Pool  MobileMedia owns patents that originated with Nokia, Sony
Corp. and MPEG LA, the licensing administrator for a pool of
patents used by consumer-electronics makers. Those three
retained a stake in MobileMedia, according to a June 21, 2010,
filing in the Apple case.  A federal jury in  Delaware  found on Dec. 13 that Apple’s
iPhone infringed three patents held by MobileMedia. A second
trial will be held to determine how much Cupertino, California-
based Apple should pay.  Research in Motion Ltd., which makes the BlackBerry phone,
lost a Swedish arbitration court case in November challenging
MobileMedia’s right to sue. RIM and Nokia announced a licensing
deal Dec. 21 that resolves other litigation. The MobileMedia
case is continuing.  Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent set up a fund called MultiMedia
Patent Trust to hold Lucent patents. A jury on Dec. 13 cleared
Apple and LG Electronics Inc. of the trust’s infringement
claims.  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and Nokia will get a
share of licensing proceeds from Nokia patents transferred to a
Canadian firm, Mosaid Technologies Inc.  Google Inc. (GOOG)  filed a
complaint with European regulators in June saying the Mosaid
agreement improperly thwarts competition.  Nokia’s Reasons  “Often we do not have the resources or otherwise are not
best positioned ourselves to exploit those inventions, either
through our own products or through our own licensing
activities,” said Paul Melin, Nokia’s chief intellectual
property officer. “Divestments of patents have become a very
important channel for us to monetize and realize the value of
our research and development.”  Melin said the company has transferred patents more than 20
times over the past five years, many going to companies whose
main business is to derive licensing revenue.  David Cuddy, a Microsoft spokesman, and  Mary Ward , an
Alcatel-Lucent spokeswoman, had no comment.  Blurred Connections  The changing ownership of a patent can make it hard to
determine who benefits from a lawsuit.  In a case against Google and  AOL Inc. (AOL)  in Alexandria,
 Virginia , a judge confronted what he called the “increasingly
common but always vexing” question of who has “all substantial
rights” to a patent. That information is needed, District Judge
T.S. Ellis said, to make sure the firm that brought the case,
Suffolk Technologies LLC, had standing to sue.  Suffolk Technologies is owned by a group that includes
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., General Atlantic Partners LP and
Boston Consulting Group Inc., the judge said.  The patents
originated with BT’s  British Telecom , which transferred them
with an agreement it would get at least half the proceeds from
the patent, according to the judge’s Dec. 7 opinion.  Laurie said he’s heard speculation that some patent owners
create offshore companies to blur connections to licensing
firms.  “It sounds like a spy novel,” Laurie said. “All sorts of
creative models are being designed for this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
