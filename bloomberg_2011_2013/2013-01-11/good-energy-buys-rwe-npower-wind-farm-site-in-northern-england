Good Energy Group Plc (GOOD) , a British
renewable-power supplier, bought a land-based wind farm site in
Doncaster, northern  England , from RWE Npower Renewables Ltd. for
3 million pounds ($4.8 million).  The site has planning approval for the installation of four
turbines, according to a statement e-mailed today from
Chippenham-based Good Energy. It will have a capacity of about
8.2 megawatts and is expected to begin working by the year-end.  Good Energy plans to close a deal with debt providers for
the facility in the first half, it said. The project will help
it reach a goal of developing 110 megawatts of capacity by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
