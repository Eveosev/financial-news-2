Oldendorff Carriers GmbH, a Luebeck,
Germany-based freight trader, was the largest charterer of ships
used to transport minerals and grains in 2012, booking more
vessels than the biggest commodities traders and miners.  Oldendorff hired 273 dry-bulk vessels in 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg today from Clarkson Plc, the largest
shipbroker.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the second-biggest exporter of  iron
ore , ranked number two with 233 vessels, of which 223 were
voyages to ship 35.2 million metric tons of iron ore, the data
show. Oldendorff’s charters included 6.1 million tons of
shipments of the steel-making raw material.  Shipping rates as measured by the Baltic Dry Index averaged
920 points last year, the lowest since 1986, as the fleet
expanded at more than twice the pace of demand. Vessel supply
grew 11 percent while seaborne trade climbed 5 percent to almost
4 billion tons, according to the shipbroker’s data. Cargoes
included 1.11 billion tons of iron ore, 1.06 billion tons of
coal, and 350 million tons of grains and soybeans.  Cargill Inc., a Minneapolis-based commodities trader that
is the biggest closely held U.S. company, booked 231 ships,
making it the third-largest by number, the data show.  Oldendorff was also the largest charterer in 2011, booking
392 ships, followed by Cargill with 301, and South Korean ship
owner and operator STX Pan Ocean Co. The number of single-voyage
bookings reported last year for STX Pan Ocean fell by 52 percent
to 114, Clarkson data show.  Oldendorff controls a fleet of more than 400 vessels
shipping 200 million tons a year, according to its  website .  Spot Charters  Cargill’s transport unit operates a fleet of more than 350
vessels, according to its website. In 2011, the company was
going to trade almost 200 million tons of dry freight during the
year to May 31 of that year, Andy James, Cargill Ocean
Transportation’s former head of derivatives, said at the time.
Forbes ranked Cargill the largest closely held U.S. company by
revenue in a 2012 survey.  The tally of single-voyage, or spot, bookings covered the
four largest vessel types totaling a  fleet  now at 9,495 ships.
Not all are reported. Of the 4,716 vessels hired last year, 18
percent didn’t list a charterer, according to Clarkson. In 2011,
a company wasn’t named for 16 percent of the 5,472 charters.  Vale SA, the world’s second-largest miner that is building
its own fleet of the biggest carriers, chartered 69 vessels last
year. BHP Billiton Ltd., the third-largest producer, booked 125
in 2012, compared to 201 the prior year, according to Clarkson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
