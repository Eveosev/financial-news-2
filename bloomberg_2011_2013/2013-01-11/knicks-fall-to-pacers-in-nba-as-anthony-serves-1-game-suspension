Paul George  had 24 points and 11
rebounds to lead the Indiana Pacers to an 81-76 victory over the
 New York Knicks , who played without the suspended Carmelo Anthony, the team’s top scorer.  “We’re improving with every game,” George said in a
televised interview. “Our defense is holding up.”  The Knicks, who fell to 23-12 with their second straight
defeat, lead the five-team Eastern Conference Atlantic Division
by three games from the Brooklyn Nets.  Anthony was suspended for one game by the National
Basketball Association for repeatedly confronting  Kevin Garnett 
of the Boston Celtics after a Jan. 7 defeat at Madison Square
Garden in New York.  The Pacers hold a 1 1/2-game lead over the  Chicago Bulls 
atop the Eastern Conference’s five-team Central Division.  The Knicks rallied from a 39-34 halftime deficit to lead
60-58 after the third quarter before being outscored in the
fourth quarter at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, where
the Pacers are 14-3.  The Pacers are playing without Danny Granger Jr., the
team’s leading scorer for the past five seasons. Granger is
rehabbing from a procedure for left patellar tendinosis, which
affects the tendon that attaches the kneecap to the shinbone.  “Our offense is going to come around especially when Danny
comes back,” George said.  Ian Mahinmi came off the bench to score 13 points for the
Pacers, who improved to 22-14.  Reserve J.R. Smith led the Knicks with 25 points and  Tyson Chandler  added 12 points and 15 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
