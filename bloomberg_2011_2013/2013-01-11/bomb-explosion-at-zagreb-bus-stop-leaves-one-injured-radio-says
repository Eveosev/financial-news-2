A bomb explosion early today at a
bus stop in Stenjevec, a suburb west of the Croatian capital,
Zagreb, injured one person, state radio reported, citing Vitomir
Bijelic, a police official.  “It is a serious crime aimed at injuring people and
alarming the public,” Bijelic told the public broadcaster.  Two days ago, an explosive device was set off by a freight
train in another Zagreb suburb. No injuries were reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
