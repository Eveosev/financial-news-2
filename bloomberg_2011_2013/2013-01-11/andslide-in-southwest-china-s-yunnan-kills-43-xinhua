A landslide in southwestern  China ’s
Yunnan province killed 46 people and covered the homes of 16
families, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The landslide in Zhenxiong County occurred at about 8:20
a.m. yesterday, burying 27 adults and 19 children in Gaopo
Village, Xinhua said earlier.  Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping told relief
agencies to resettle residents and maintain public order,
according to Xinhua. Minister of Land and Resources Xu Shaoshi
and civil affairs and finance ministry officials have gone to
the landslide area, it said.  In October, a landslide in Yunnan killed at least 19 people,
and in September a 5.6 magnitude earthquake killed at least 80
people and destroyed more than 6,650 homes in the mountainous
province and neighboring Guizhou.  China has allocated 6.8 billion  yuan  ($1.1 billion) from
its central budget to help needy people in natural disaster-hit
areas, Xinhua said Dec. 4, citing the ministries of finance and
civil affairs.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
