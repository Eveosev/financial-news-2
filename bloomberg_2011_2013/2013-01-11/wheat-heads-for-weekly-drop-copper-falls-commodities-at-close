speculation China may delay any easing after data showed
inflation accelerated more than forecast in December.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold headed for the first weekly advance in seven as signs
of increased demand in China outweighed concern that an end to
stimulus in the U.S. this year will bolster the dollar. Yen-
priced bullion rallied to a record and platinum was set for the
best week since September.  Spot gold was at $1,674.05 an ounce by 3:18 p.m. in

The metal is 1.1 percent higher this week, set to end the worst

yesterday, the highest level since Jan. 3.  Spot platinum gained as much as 0.4 percent to $1,637 an
ounce, the highest since Dec. 12, and is up 5 percent this week
in the best showing since Sept. 14. One ounce of platinum bought
as much as 0.9787 ounce of gold today, the most since April. The
ratio has risen for nine days, the longest period of advances
since April 2009.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat traded near a six-month low, set for the worst weekly
run in more than a year, as investors assessed whether an
increase in acreage in the U.S., the largest shipper, will
offset yield losses from a drought.  The contract for March delivery traded at $7.4525 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade at 1:31 p.m. Singapore time.

bushel, while soybeans for delivery in the same month fell 0.4
percent to $13.745 a bushel.  Rubber fell for the first time in four days, paring a
weekly gain, as  China ’s inflation accelerated and its auto sales
missed a forecast, damping demand.  Rubber for delivery in June declined 0.4 percent to end at
312.2 yen a kilogram ($3,505 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, trimming the weekly advance to 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
