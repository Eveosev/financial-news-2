Crude options volatility was little
changed as futures gained for a fifth week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 22.24 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 4:10 p.m., compared with 22.06 percent yesterday.
February options expire Jan. 16.  Crude oil for March delivery dropped 28 cents to settle at
$93.99 on the exchange. February-delivery crude oil fell 26
cents to $93.56 a barrel and advanced 47 cents this week.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
March $85 puts, which rose 1 cent to 42 cents a barrel on volume
of 2,928 contracts at 3:48 p.m. in  New York . March $90 puts were
the second-most active, with 1,858 lots exchanged as they
advanced 1 cent to $1.14 a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 57
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 53
percent of the 152,693 contracts traded.  March $110 calls were the most active options with 9,831
