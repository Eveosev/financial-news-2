Rubber fell for the first time in
four days, paring a weekly gain, as  China ’s inflation
accelerated and its auto sales missed a forecast, damping demand.  Rubber for delivery in June declined 0.4 percent to end at
312.2 yen a kilogram ($3,505 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, trimming the weekly advance to 1.4 percent.  China’s stocks fell after a report showing inflation
accelerated more than forecast, limiting room for monetary
easing to support an economic recovery. Auto sales in China rose
4.3 percent last year, missing official projections, after local
governments restricted purchases to control congestion and
consumers shunned Japanese cars amid a territorial dispute.  “Accelerating inflation and lower-than-expected car sales
in China spurred selling ahead of three-day holidays in Tokyo,”
Chaiwat Muenmee, an analyst at DS Futures Co., said from Bangkok.  China’s consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in December from a
year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said today. That
compares with the 2.3 percent median estimate of 42 analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  and a 2 percent pace in November.  Total vehicle sales in China climbed to 19.3 million units
in 2102, according to data released by the state-backed China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers today. That compares
with the group’s forecast in July for full-year deliveries to
rise 5 percent to 8 percent and reach 20 million.  Rubber for delivery in May fell 1.9 percent to close at
25,710  yuan  ($4,137) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board added 0.1 percent to 102.70 baht
($3.39) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporters on this story:
