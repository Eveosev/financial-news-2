BP Plc failed to find a buyer for a
cargo of  North Sea  Forties crude for loading in February at the
lowest differential in almost two weeks. Total SA bought a lot
of Brent blend at a cheaper premium than the previous trade.  Daily exports of Azeri Light crude from the Turkish port of
Ceyhan will be little changed in February from this month,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  BP offered Forties consignment F0201 for loading Feb. 1 to
Feb. 3 at 70 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, without
finding a buyer, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. That compares with
a lot that traded yesterday at a $1.15 premium and is the lowest
since a deal at plus 45 cents on Dec. 31.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold Brent cargo B0106 for loading
Jan. 25 to Jan. 27 at 70 cents more than Dated Brent, the survey
showed. That’s lower than a deal on Jan. 4 at a $1.35 premium
and is the cheapest since a trade on Sept. 6 at minus 25 cents.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days dropped 18 cents to $1.35 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for February settlement traded at $110.02 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $112.27 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $109.30, a discount of 72 cents to February.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals for a second
day, according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was at minus 61 cents, 5 cents narrower than yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest  Europe ,
the  discount  was unchanged at $1.14, the data showed.  Shipments from Ceyhan will total 17.85 million barrels, or
637,500 barrels a day, according to the plan. That compares with
639,000 barrels a day for this month.  The 1,768-kilometer (1,100-mile) Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline carries Azeri Light crude from Baku, in the Azeri
section of the  Caspian Sea , through  Georgia  to Ceyhan, on
 Turkey ’s Mediterranean coast.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell 3 cents to $2.33 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show.  Nigeria postponed to February one Qua Iboe cargo that was
originally scheduled to load this month and delayed three lots
of its benchmark grade to March from next month, according to a
revised plan obtained by  Bloomberg News . Total exports of the
grade next month will now by 10 shipments, the plan showed.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, issued a
second tender to buy West African crude for March loading, a
document obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  The tender, which was released today, closes at 3 p.m.
local time on Jan. 16 with offers valid until 5 p.m. the next
day, according to the document.  The company bought one shipment each of Nigerian Qua Iboe
and Okoro from BP and awarded China International United
Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Unipec, one lot each of
Antan and Angolan Nemba blend earlier this week.  In  Ghana , the Jubilee oil field capacity is now in excess
of 120,000 barrels of oil a day, allowing for tests of pumping
equipment in the next few weeks, Tullow Oil Plc said. The
company expects floating production vessel output to increase to
about 130,000 barrels by October after improving gas handling
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
