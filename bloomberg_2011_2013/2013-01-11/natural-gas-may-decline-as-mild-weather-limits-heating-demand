Natural gas futures may fall next
week as unusually mild weather heading into mid-January reduces
the need for heating fuel.  Ten of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey, or 71 percent,
predicted that futures will decline on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  through Jan. 18. Three, or 21 percent, said gas will
rise and one said prices will stay the same. Last week, 50
percent of participants said gas would advance this week.  Eastern U.S. temperatures will be above normal over the
next five days and warm weather will linger in the Southeast
through Jan. 19, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Gas futures rose 2.6 percent yesterday,
the first gain in four days, after the Energy Information
Administration reported the biggest weekly  stockpile decline 
since February 2011, which followed a cold blast.  “The temperatures are going to be well above normal and we
should see a major drop-off in demand again next week,”  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“We had the biggest withdrawal in two years and we could barely
muster a 10-cent rally. It goes to show we are going to have
significant challenges to rally next week.”  Natural gas advanced 4 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $3.327 per
million British thermal units this week in New York, the third
gain in four weeks. Prices rebounded 4.2 percent today, the
biggest one-day gain since Dec. 20. Futures are up 20 percent
from a year ago.  “There is a good chance that we will take out $3 next week
and we could get into the $2.95 area,” Flynn said.  Temperature Outlook  The low temperature in Chicago tomorrow may be 48 degrees
Fahrenheit (9 Celsius), 30 above normal, said AccuWeather Inc.
in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  New York City ’s low Jan. 15 may
be 10 above the usual reading at 37 degrees.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
Energy Department data show.  U.S. stockpiles  dropped by 201 billion cubic feet to 3.316
trillion in the week ended Jan. 4, data from the Energy
Department’s EIA show.  Analyst estimates  predicted a decline of
191 billion and a separate  survey  of Bloomberg users forecast a
193-billion drop.  A  surplus  to the five-year average fell to 10.7 percent
from 12.4 percent the previous week.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 50 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  3      10      1  To contact the reporter on this story:
