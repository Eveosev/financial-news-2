Agnieszka Radwanska will enter the
Australian Open tennis tournament next week after not dropping a
set in securing back-to-back titles to start the season.  Radwanska, the world No. 4 from Poland, eased past  Dominika
Cibulkova  of Slovakia 6-0, 6-0 in today’s Sydney International
final to continue her undefeated run this season after also
winning last week’s tournament in Auckland. Cibulkova had 36
errors, compared with eight for Radwanska.  In each of the previous four years, at least one finalist
from the premier-level women’s event at Sydney Olympic Park
Tennis Centre went on to reach the championship match at the
Australian Open. Victoria Azarenka won in Sydney last year
before claiming her first Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park.  The season-opening major starts in three days. Radwanska,
23, was drawn to play Bojana Bobusic of Australia in round one.  Top-seeded Azarenka will begin her title defense against
Monica Niculescu of Romania and was placed in the same half of
the 128-player draw as five-time champion  Serena Williams  of the
U.S., putting them in line for a semifinal meeting.  Kevin Anderson , ranked 36th on the ATP World Tour, became
the first South African in tournament history to reach the
Sydney singles final. He’ll play  Bernard Tomic  of Australia
tomorrow for the title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
