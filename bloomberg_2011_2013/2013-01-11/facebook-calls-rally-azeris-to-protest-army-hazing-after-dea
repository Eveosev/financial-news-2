Thousands of Azeris are signing up
on  Facebook Inc. (FB)  to rally against violence in the armed forces
tomorrow after the death of a conscript that his family has
blamed on a beating in a hazing incident.  The campaign, which has been joined by more than 13,000
Facebook users in the former Soviet republic, was prompted by
the Jan. 7 death of an 18-year-old conscript, Ceyhun Qubadov, at
an army base in the western Daskasan district. The U.S. Embassy
in the capital, Baku, has warned the planned demonstration may
turn violent.  The  Defense Ministry , which first said Qubadov died of
heart failure, has backtracked after pictures of the soldier’s
bruised body were posted on the Internet. An army commander was
reprimanded and criminal proceedings initiated into the case,
the ministry said on its  website  yesterday. In video statements
on Facebook, Qubadov’s mother said he was beaten to death.  Azerbaijan’s largely conscript-based army lost 77 soldiers
in non-combat incidents last year, Jasur Sumarinli, head of the
Doctrine Center of Military Studies, said by phone from Baku.
Many of the deaths were caused by hazing and illness, he said.  Military service is mandatory for all men aged between 18
and 35 in the Caspian Sea nation, which has a population of 9
million. The government has rejected calls to shift to an all-
volunteer force because of the country’s military standoff with
neighboring  Armenia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
