Greece â€™s energy regulator approved
higher renewable-power taxes for consumers, backing a second
increase in five months to bolster funds at market operator
Lagie SA.  The levy, which compensates Lagie for guaranteeing fixed
power prices to clean-energy producers, will rise to an average
9.30 euros ($12.35) a megawatt-hour from 7.50 euros, the
watchdog said in a statement on its  website . The increase is
backdated to Jan. 1 and valid for six months.  Greece, whose financial crisis began in 2009, has like
other European countries introduced a feed-in tariff that pays
renewable-power generators above-market rates for their output.
The nation has fast-tracked solar projects to help revive its
economy, which remained in a recession for a fifth year in 2012.  Household users will now pay 9.53 euros a megawatt-hour
under the tax changes, up from the 8.74-euro charge applied on
Aug. 1, according to the statement.  The difference between the feed-in tariffs and the prices
charged to end-users, which are decided by the Energy Ministry,
has resulted in a deficit of about 280 million euros, according
to the Athens-based regulator. The ministry is seeking to erase
that gap by the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
