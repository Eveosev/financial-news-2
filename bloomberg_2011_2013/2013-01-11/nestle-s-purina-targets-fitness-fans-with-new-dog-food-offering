Fitness fanatics in the U.S. who run
with the dogs are the latest target for  Nestle SA. (NESN)   The world’s biggest food company is introducing a range of
performance-enhancing pet food that promises to give dogs a
greater chance to keep up with owners who exercise them daily or
take them along while training for marathon running.  Purina Pro Plan Sport comes in three formulas with targeted
levels of protein and fat to help promote canine strength and
endurance, Nestle said today in a statement. To promote the
brand, the Swiss company will hold a series of events across the
U.S. this year, including camps where owners can learn about
sports for dogs. Purina will also sponsor 5-kilometer races for
people and their hounds, as well as other runs and walks.  “There are already many performance nutrition products to
help people excel in sport,” Steve Crimmins, chief marketing
officer for Nestle Purina Pet Care, said in the statement. “By
giving dogs the right kind of nutrition, we can help promote
their athletic abilities in the same way.”  Keeping pets fit isn’t a new departure for Vevey,
Switzerland-based Nestle, the world’s second-biggest pet food
maker, behind Whiskas cat food maker Mars Inc. Purina and the
company’s Jenny Craig diet-planning unit started a program in
the U.S. last year to help dogs and their owners lose weight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
