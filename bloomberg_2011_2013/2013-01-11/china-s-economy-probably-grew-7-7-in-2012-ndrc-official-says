China’s economy  probably grew 7.7
percent in 2012, exceeding the government target of 7.5 percent,
a vice chairman at the nation’s economic planning agency said.  Gross domestic product will expand about 7.5 percent this
year and inflation will average 3.5 percent,  Zhang Xiaoqiang ,
from the National Development and Reform Commission, was quoted
by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying at a forum today.  Zhang gave his estimate a week before the National Bureau
of Statistics releases fourth-quarter and full-year GDP data.
Economic growth probably accelerated to 7.8 percent in the three
months through December from a year earlier, pushing up
expansion for the year to 7.7 percent, according to Bloomberg
News surveys ahead of the data announcement on Jan. 18.  Zhang said on April 3 that  China ’s economy may have
expanded about 8.4 percent in the first quarter of 2012. The
official figure announced 10 days later was 8.1 percent.  Inflation accelerated more than forecast to a seven-month
high of 2.5 percent in December, statistics bureau figures
showed today. Customs data yesterday showed exports rose 14.1
percent last month from a year earlier, adding signs the economy
is recovering from a seven-quarter slowdown.  --Zhou Xin, Penny Peng. Editors: Nerys Avery, Scott Lanman  To contact the reporter on this story:
