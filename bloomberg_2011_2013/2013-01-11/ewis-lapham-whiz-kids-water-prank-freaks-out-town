“Important!! Do not use the
drinking water for any purpose,” read the notice in mailboxes,
as fire trucks drove through the streets of Blackstone,
 Massachusetts , issuing similarly urgent warnings through
loudspeakers.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  On March 28, 2006, intruders scaled a security fence topped
with barbed wire, broke through a two-inch steel door, climbed a
tower and crashed through a fiberglass cover protecting the
town’s water supply. Finding a mysterious bucket nearby,
officials responded immediately.  Schools, shops and restaurants were closed while the 1.3-
million gallon system was flushed. Residents got rid of anything
that might be tainted, including ice cubes and baby formula.  Lab results a few days later showed no contamination, and
the culprits were found to be two 15-year-old high-school
students who thought it would be fun to pee in the water tower.  Dubbed the “Whiz Kids” by a Boston paper, the two cost
the town $40,000 and revealed precisely how vulnerable our
drinking-water supplies are.  I spoke with James Salzman, author of “Drinking Water: A
History,” on the following topics:  1. Commodity?  2. Right of Thirst  3. Roman Aqueducts  4. Safety of Supply  5. Bottled Water  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
