Genting Malaysia Bhd. (GENM) , owner of
Resorts World Casino New York City, fell the most in three
months in Kuala Lumpur trading after Citigroup Inc. said plans
by New York to expand casino gambling in the state is
“negative” for the Southeast Asian company.  The  stock  sank 3.7 percent to close at 3.61 ringgit, its
steepest decline since Oct. 10. Genting Malaysia, based in Kuala
Lumpur, was the biggest decliner on the  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI
Index (FBMKLCI)  today, which fell 0.1 percent. Its parent  Genting Bhd. (GENT) 
slipped 2.4 percent, the most since Nov. 14.  New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo  proposed to build up to
three casinos in upstate New York to help revitalize the economy
and boost tourism in the upstate, according to his third State
of the State address in Albany on Jan. 9.  “We believe the three casinos will be full-fledged with
table games but Resorts World New York will probably remain a
slot-only racino,” Citigroup analysts led by George Choi wrote
in a report dated yesterday. “Allowing table games at Resorts
World New York would likely cannibalize the three casinos in
upstate New York, which would work against the government’s
attempt to help the economy in upstate.”  They maintained their  buy  call on Genting Malaysia with a
price estimate of 4.50 ringgit, saying that it’s the cheapest
gaming stock in Citigroup’s coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
