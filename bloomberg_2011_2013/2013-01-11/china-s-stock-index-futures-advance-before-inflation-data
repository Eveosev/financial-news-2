China’s stocks  fell the most among
Asian markets after a report showing inflation accelerated more
than forecast, limiting room for monetary easing to support an
economic recovery.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 1.8 percent to 2,243 at
the close, the most since Sept. 20. It dropped 1.5 percent this
week, the first decline in six weeks. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 1.9
percent to 2,483.23, led by financial and material companies.  “Inflation is a potential threat to the market,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co. in  Shanghai .
“Though it won’t trigger an immediate interest-rate increase,
it will weigh on investors’ sentiment. The market lacks
catalysts for more gains in January and needs to consolidate.”  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048)  plunged 4.5 percent, leading
declines for property stocks, after consumer prices rose at the
fastest pace in seven months in December.  Citic Securities Co. (600030) 
and Soochow Securities Co. dropped at least 3.9 percent after
regulators reprimanded the two brokerages for failing to make
timely disclosures. Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co. fell after
the Hainan Daily reported the province banned government
officials from drinking alcohol during business receptions.  The Shanghai Composite had surged 17 percent from an almost
four-year low on Dec. 3 through yesterday, while the CSI 300
climbed 20 percent, signaling a  bull market , on signs economic
growth is picking up. Government data yesterday showed overseas
shipments rose 14.1 percent from a year earlier last month, the
most since May and more than double the 5 percent median of 40
economists’ estimates.  Inflation Data  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slipped 0.8 percent
today. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  advanced 1.7 percent in
 New York  yesterday. The  yuan  strengthened beyond 6.22 against
the dollar for the first time in 19 years.  Average trading volumes on the Shanghai index were 22
percent higher than the 30-day average. Thirty-day  volatility  in
the gauge was at 20.1, compared with last year’s average of
17.1. The measure trades at 12.4 times reported earnings,
compared with the seven-year average of 21.4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg since 2006.  A gauge of developers in the Shanghai index dropped 3.8
percent today, the most among five industry groups. Poly Real
Estate, China’s second largest by market value, lost 4.5 percent
to 13.53 yuan.  China Merchants Property Development Co. (000024) , the
third biggest, slid 3.9 percent to 29.01 yuan. Gemdale Corp.
fell 4.1 percent to 6.81 yuan.  The  consumer price index  rose 2.5 percent in December from
a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said today in
Beijing. That compares with the 2.3 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 42 economists and a 2 percent gain in
November. Producer prices dropped 1.9 percent, compared with an
estimate for a 1.8 percent decline.  Tighter Liquidity  December inflation points to tighter monetary policy, a
stronger currency to curb imported inflation, less liquidity and
higher rates in the second half of the year, said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.  Inflation may exceed 3 percent next month because the
weeklong Chinese New Year holiday falls in February this year
after being in January in 2012, said Li Miaoxian, a Beijing-
based economist with Bocom International Holdings Co., the
investment banking unit of Bank of Communications Co.  December economic data including industrial production and
fixed-asset investment as well as a report on fourth-quarter
gross domestic product are due on Jan. 18.  Citic Securities, China’s largest brokerage, dropped 3.9
percent to 12.71 yuan. Soochow Securities declined 6.1 percent
to 7.42 yuan.  Wuliangye Earnings  Citic Securities was reprimanded by the securities
regulator for failing to disclose a drop in profit at SooChow
Securities when advising on its initial offering.  Both companies received warning letters from the China
Securities Regulatory Commission for not disclosing the earnings
drop, which happened before the initial public offering
prospectus of SooChow Securities was published, and for not
giving additional information about the decline while marketing
the shares, the regulator said on its website.  Two phone calls to  Raymond Tang , a Beijing-based press
officer at Citic seeking comment on the report went unanswered.
Staff at Soochow’s board secretary office referred queries about
the reprimand to the stock exchange filing when contacted by
phone today.  Kweichow Moutai, the biggest baijiu maker, slumped 1.5
percent to 211.26 yuan.  Luzhou Laojiao Co. (000568)  dropped 1.8 percent
to 36.41 yuan. The southern province of Hainan banned government
officials from drinking alcoholic beverages during business
receptions, Hainan Daily reported yesterday, citing documents
issued by the local authorities.  China’s currency strengthened 0.16 percent to 6.2144 per
dollar as of 3:29 p.m. in Shanghai and touched 6.2133, the
highest level since the government unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993, according to the  China 
Foreign Exchange Trade System. Yuan forwards headed for the best
week since October 2011.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Ravil Shirodkar  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
