Vinema Biorefinarias do Sul Ltda. , a
Brazilian biofuel company, plans to spend 720 million reais
($354 million) building the nation’s first six ethanol-fuel
mills that use grains as raw material.  The company expects to secure most of the 40 million reais
of equity commitments for a first plant in the city of Cristal
within 40 days, Vilson Neumann Machado, director of development
projects at Camaqua, Brazil-based Vinema, said in a telephone
interview today.  The plants will be built in the southern state of Rio
Grande do Sul where it’s unsuitable to grow sugar cane, the
feedstock used by the rest of  Brazil ’s ethanol industry.
Virtually all of the state’s ethanol is imported on trucks which
is costly, he said.  “Ethanol costs about 1.30 reais a liter at the gates of a
mill in Sao Paulo,” Machado said. “When it arrives here, it’s
1.60. That’s a big difference.”  The plants are expected to come online through 2020 and
will be able to jointly produce 600 million liters (158 million
gallons) of fuel a year, he said. They will operate for more
than 350 days a year, running on grains including rice, sorghum
and oats.  The ethanol, which requires less refining than the cane
variety, will also be sold as a feedstock for solvents and
pharmaceuticals, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
