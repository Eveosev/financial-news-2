International Game Technology (IGT) 
dissident investor Jason Ader dropped his bid for a board seat
at the company, while continuing to back a slate of candidates.  Ader, who runs New York-based Ader Investment Management
LLC, said he intends to nominate three candidates, according to
a regulatory filing today. He said the group believes IGT is
undervalued as a result of the company’s lack of focus on its
core slot machine business, poor capital allocation decisions
and management that is inexperienced in gaming.  “We are convinced our slate will make a major improvement
in this company,” Ader said in a press release.  IGT, the world’s largest slot-machine maker, said this week
that Ader, a former casino analyst, would propose four new
directors to the Reno-based company’s board, including himself.
According to Ader’s filing today, he will nominate the three
others, but not himself.  Juda Engelmayer, a spokesman for Ader, said his group had
presented the investment manager as an option and later “made a
tactical decision to nominate a ‘short slate’” of directors.  The Ader group will nominate Charles Mathewson, IGT’s
former chairman and chief executive officer, Raymond J. Brooks,
a former insurance industry executive, and Daniel B. Silver, an
executive at Ader’s firm, its filing said.  IGT’s current chief executive, Patti Hart, said in an
interview this week that she and the company’s current board
oppose the new nominees.  IGT rose 0.1 percent to $14.98 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 5.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
