Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender, hired  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ’s Jean-Francois Courville as chief operating officer for the bank’s wealth-
management unit.  Courville, chief executive officer of Manulife’s asset-
management business, begins Feb. 4, the Toronto-based bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. As executive vice-president of
global wealth services, Courville will run RBC Wealth
Management’s global support groups, which are being combined
under one operating office.  Royal Bank’s wealth-management unit had C$763 million ($775
million) of profit in 2012, down from C$811 million in 2011,
according to financial statements. Wealth management accounted
for about 10 percent of the lender’s total profit for the year.  The wealth-management unit had about C$578 billion of
assets under administration and almost C$340 billion under
management as of Oct. 31, according to financial statements.  The move was reported earlier today by the Wall Street
Journal. Telephone messages left with Courville and Jana Miller,
a Manulife spokeswoman, weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
