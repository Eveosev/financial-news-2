Auto sales in  China , including those
of cars and buses, may accelerate this year and surpass 20
million units for the first time, spurred by a rebound in
economic growth and urbanization.  Wholesale deliveries may gain 7 percent this year to 20.65
million units, led by demand for passenger vehicles, the state-
backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in a
statement in Beijing today. SUV sales will remain the fastest-
growing segment, while commercial vehicles will post a slight
gain, according to the projections.  “A continuous and stable macroeconomic policy will be good
for the development of the vehicle market,” CAAM said. Vehicle
demand will be supported by urbanization and there exists a big
market potential for exports, the group said.  While Chinese auto demand is forecast to accelerate this
year, the pace of growth remains less than a quarter of the
stimulus-led 32 percent rate in 2010, as cities including
Beijing and Guangzhou restrict new vehicles to reduce smog and
traffic jams. Competition for market share is poised to
intensify as foreign automakers led by  General Motors Co. (GM)  and
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  step up their push into smaller cities
traditionally dominated by local brands.  “Not everyone will be the winner but some of the
automakers that invest previously in R&D will be,” said Jeff Chung, Hong Kong-based analyst at  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) 
“The automakers with the best product mix, best geographic mix
will still enjoy very high growth rates.”  Ford Focus  Passenger-vehicle sales may climb 8.5 percent to about 16.8
million units, CAAM estimates, while commercial vehicle sales
will probably rebound from last year’s 5.5 percent contraction
to gain 1 percent to about 3.85 million units.  Ford Motor Co. (F) , whose top seller in China in 2011 ranked
10th, had the best-selling sedan in China last year with the
Focus. The car beat GM’s Chevrolet Sail and Buick Excelle --last
year’s top seller.  Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) ’s Haval was the most
popular SUV model, according to CAAM data.  Auto sales in China rose 4.3 percent to 19.3 million last
year, missing official projections for deliveries of as much as
20 million made in July. Passenger-car sales rose 7.1 percent to
15.5 million units in 2012, with SUV the fastest-growing segment
at 26 percent gain, CAAM said.  Industrywide passenger-vehicle sales unexpectedly shrank in
September after anti-Japan demonstrations sparked a backlash
that hurt sales at  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)   Investment Destination  Still, China is seen as the top investment destination for
global automakers as the country has “significant domestic
demand and export opportunities,” according to a survey of 200
auto industry executives by  KPMG  released yesterday. The
industry may see more consolidation and midsize automotive deals
overseas as it focuses on acquiring key technologies, KPMG’s
survey found.  The number of private passenger vehicles in China was 62.4
million at the end of 2011, a sevenfold increase on the 8.45
million at the end of 2003, according to National Bureau of
Statistics data. The number of cars may surpass 200 million by
2020, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on July 31,
citing the Ministry of Transport.  Total vehicle exports last year jumped 30 percent to 1.06
million units and are projected to gain 25 percent to 1.3
million, according to CAAM.  e  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
