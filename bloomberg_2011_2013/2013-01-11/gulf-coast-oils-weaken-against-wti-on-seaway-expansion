Gulf Coast  oils on the  spot market 
weakened to four-month lows as flows on the Seaway pipeline
resumed at expanded rates to send as much as 400,000 barrels of
crude a day to the Houston area.  The 500-mile (805-kilometer) line running from Cushing,
 Oklahoma , to Freeport, Texas, has restarted after shutting Jan.
2 to complete the final connections necessary to expand capacity
from 150,000 barrels, as  Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)  and
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said in a statement.  Seaway increased flows to 280,000 barrels a day as of 7:30
a.m.  New York  time, said Hillary Stevenson, a Louisville,
Kentucky-based data integrity analyst for Genscape Inc., which
monitors electrical output at pumping stations.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark low-density, low-
sulfur crude on the Gulf Coast, weakened 25 cents to a premium
of $16.85 a barrel more than West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 11:30 a.m. in New
York. That’s LLS’s lowest premium to the U.S. benchmark since
Sept. 6.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium to WTI shrank 50 cents
to a $16.50. Mars Blend, a medium-gravity, high-sulfur crude
from the  Gulf of Mexico , weakened by $1 to a $12.25-a-barrel
premium to WTI.  Other offshore Gulf crudes also weakened. Poseidon’s
premium to WTI narrowed by $1 to $12.50 a barrel. Southern Green
Canyon’s shrank 75 cents to a $12.65.  Thunder Horse ’s premium
lost 70 cents to $15.15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
