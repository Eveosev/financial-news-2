Chile ’s peso fell from a three-month
high as faster-than-forecast inflation in  China  spurred concern
that economic stimulus for the Andean country’s biggest export
market will be limited.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 471.55 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:03 a.m. in Santiago, paring its weekly gain to 0.4
percent. The peso advanced yesterday to 470.95, the strongest
closing level since Sept. 26.  China is the world’s biggest buyer of copper, which
accounted for 61 percent of Chile’s exports last month. The
metal fell 0.7 percent today as China’s consumer prices rose 2.5
percent last month from a year earlier, compared with the median
forecast of 2.3 percent in a survey by Bloomberg.  “Commodities are a bit weaker on China inflation,” said
Ronald Volpi, the head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica
Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “Copper’s falling, so we
could see the dollar higher.”  The peso has rallied 1.5 percent in January, the best
performance after the Romanian leu and Mexican peso among 25
emerging-market currencies.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
cut their short peso position to $3.1 billion on Jan. 9, the
lowest since September 2011. Local investors reduced bets on the
peso to $15.3 billion, the lowest since October 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
