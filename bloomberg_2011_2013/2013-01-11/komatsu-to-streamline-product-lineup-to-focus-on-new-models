Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-
biggest construction equipment maker, will streamline its
product lineup to trim costs and allocate resources to design
high-end models as competition from Asian rivals intensifies.  The Japanese company plans to cut product lines for mid-
and small-sized excavators, bulldozers and wheel loaders by 20
percent to about 100 at its Awazu plant in central  Japan  by
March 2016, spokesman Hiroshi Ishihara said today by telephone.  Komatsu is accelerating development of value-added
products, including driverless dump trucks used in mining, and
fuel-efficient models by paring costs through cutbacks in its
existing produce lines. Asian competitors, including China’s
 Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) , are stepping up competition by offering
lower-priced machinery as they challenge Komatsu and industry
leader Caterpillar Inc. of the U.S.  Komatsu plans to increase research and development by 6.8
percent to 58.5 billion yen ($658 million) for the financial
year through March 31, the company said on April 26.  The cutback was earlier today reported in the Nikkei
newspaper, without saying where it obtained the information.  Komatsu gained 1.9 percent to 2,337 yen as of 1:36 p.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, extending its gain in the past six
months to 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
