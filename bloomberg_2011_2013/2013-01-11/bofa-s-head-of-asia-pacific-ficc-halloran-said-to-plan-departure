Michael Halloran, Asia-Pacific head
of fixed-income, currencies and commodities at  Bank of America
Corp. , plans to leave the firm after more than four years there,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The departure may be announced as early as next week, one
of the people said, declining to be identified because the
matter hasn’t been disclosed publicly.  Halloran was hired from UBS AG in September 2008 to head
the division, according to an internal memo issued at that time.
At  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America, he was co-
head of Asia-Pacific Global Markets with Yasuhiro Fujiwara, who
left in 2011 and was replaced by Peter MacDonald to head the
region’s equities business.  Halloran and Paul Scanlon, a Hong Kong-based spokesman,
declined to comment.  Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, in October
hired Loh Boon Chye as deputy president and head of global
markets for the Asia-Pacific region from Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
