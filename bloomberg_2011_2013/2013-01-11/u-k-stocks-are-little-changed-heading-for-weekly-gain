U.K. stocks  climbed for a third day,
extending the highest level in more than 4 1/2 years, as Japan’s
government announced a package of stimulus measures.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  led an advance in banks. International
Consolidated Airlines Group rallied 5.4 percent after UBS AG
raised its recommendation on the parent of British Airways.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto  Group dropped more than 1 percent as

6,121.58 at the close in London, the highest level since May
2008. The benchmark gauge has climbed 0.5 percent this week,

policy,” Julien Seetharamdoo, who helps manage $440 billion as
senior economist and investment strategist at HSBC Global Asset
Management Ltd., said on Bloomberg Television. “We’ve not
really seen a convincing move out of deflation into inflation
and this is what the Japanese are trying to do. In the short
term, performance in equity markets is driven by what happens to
the currency, and the yen continues to weaken.” He spoke in an
interview with  Guy Johnson  and  Francine Lacqua .  The volume of shares trading on the FTSE 100 was 27 percent
higher than the average of the last 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan Stimulus  Japan’s government will spend 10.3 trillion yen ($116
billion) to drive a recovery from the country’s third recession
in five years, according to a statement by the Cabinet Office.  The stimulus “shows a clear commitment to economic
revitalization,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a press
conference today in  Tokyo .  U.K.  manufacturing production  unexpectedly declined in
November, indicating continued weakness in the economy toward
the end of 2012. Factory output fell 0.3 percent from October,
when it dropped 1.3 percent, the  Office for National Statistics 
said today in London. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
projected a 0.5 percent gain. Total industrial production rose
0.3 percent, also less than forecast.  A gauge of banks in the FTSE 350 Index rose 0.9 percent.

Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  increased 1 percent to 360.4 pence. Lloyds
Banking Group Plc added 1.4 percent to 54.04 pence.  IAG Rallies  IAG gained 5.4 percent to 207.6 pence, the highest price
since August 2011. UBS upgraded the shares to buy from neutral,
citing increased confidence about the airline’s talks with
workers at its Spanish unit. Iberia’s ground staff, cabin crew

restructuring plan, calling off planned strikes.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  added 3.3 percent to 380.1 pence after Citigroup

inflation accelerated. Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in
December from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics
said today in Beijing. That compared with the 2.3 percent median

Tinto, the second-largest, lost 1.2 percent to 3,468 pence.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  tumbled 3.2 percent 1,186 pence after the

recorded total charges of about $670 million for 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
