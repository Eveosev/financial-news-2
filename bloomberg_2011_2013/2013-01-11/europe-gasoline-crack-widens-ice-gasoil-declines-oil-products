European  gasoline barges  dropped
from the highest level in almost three months as Total SA sold.
The fuel’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , widened to the most
since October.  Gasoil for February delivery fell for the first time in
five days on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange as Brent declined.  Light Products  Gasoline barges  in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub
traded from $970 to $979 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus bulletin
board. Deals were done at $987 to $994.50 a ton yesterday, the
highest since Oct. 19. BP Plc and Gunvor Group Ltd. bought 2,000
ton barges of the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to
make finished fuel.  Gasoline’s  crack  rose 28 cents to $7.49 a barrel as of
10:58 a.m. local time, the most since Oct. 12, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in  London .  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, was little changed
at $6.90 a barrel, PVM data show. That was $6.91 yesterday, the
most since Nov. 23.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for February delivery fell 1.4 percent to $945.25 a
ton, as of 12:35 p.m. London time. The contract was $4.50 a-ton
in backwardation, or premium, to March. The market structure can
signal rising demand or falling supply.  Gasoil’s crack, which is also a measure of refining profit,
narrowed to $16.37 a barrel versus $16.52 a barrel at 4:30 p.m.
yesterday. Brent lost 1.2 percent to $110.54 a barrel.  Gasoil inventories in the ARA-area are rebuilding toward
the five-year average, as demand has been limited by milder-
than-normal weather in the region,  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of
commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London, said in
e-mailed comments today.  The fuel’s stockpiles in independent storage in ARA
increased 5.1 percent to 2.13 million tons in the week to Jan.
10, PJK International BV said yesterday. That is the highest
since Oct. 4 and below the five-year average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Temperatures in  Frankfurt ,  Germany , Europe’s biggest market
for the fuel, were above the five-year average for most of
December and so far in January, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Residues  An upward trend in ARA fuel oil stockpiles in recent weeks,
if continued, may eventually encourage shipments of the product
to  Asia , Tchilinguirian said.  Fuel oil inventories in independent storage increased to
923,000 tons, the most in two months, according to PJK.  To contact the reporter on this story:
