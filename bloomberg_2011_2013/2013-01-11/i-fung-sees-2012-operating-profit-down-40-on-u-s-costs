Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the world’s largest
supplier of clothes and toys to retailers, said operating income
slumped 40 percent in 2012 as margins and orders weakened in its
U.S. business.  The U.S. unit has recovered more slowly than expected, the
Hong Kong-based company said in a statement to the stock
exchange yesterday. It posted core operating profit of $882
million in 2011.  The supplier to  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  in August said sales
growth in the U.S. trailed its expectations due to weaker
consumer spending. The company has sought to boost sales by
supplying global retailers with increasing amounts of Asia-made
clothes, toys and furniture.  “The 2013 outlook will remain rather challenging for Li &
Fung as the U.S. economy recovery is still quite slow,” said
Steven Leung, institutional sales director at UOB Kay Hian Ltd.  U.S. retailers have relied on discounts to boost sales with
unemployment close to 8 percent. In December, 4.8 million
Americans were out of work for six months or more, according to
the Labor Department.  The supplier got about  60 percent  of its revenue from the
U.S. in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Analysts on
average forecast 2012 operating profit of $885 million for the
company, according to sixteen estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Global Supplier  Net income in 2012 is “unlikely to exceed” the previous
year, Li & Fung said yesterday. It reported earnings of $681
million in 2011. This would be the first time since 2008 that Li
& Fung’s annual profit hasn’t risen, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Dow Famulak replaced Richard Darling as president of the LF
USA business effective Dec. 19, the supplier said.  Li & Fung, whose customers include U.S. retailer  Kohl’s
Corp. (KSS) , in March raised HK$3.9 billion ($503 million) in its
biggest share sale since listing in 1992.  The global outsourcer has relied on acquisitions to boost
growth, spending about $3 billion on deals from 2006 to 2011,
driving up both sales and profit in the five-year period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock fell 1.7 percent to end at HK$13.88 yesterday,
ahead of the earnings report. It declined 4.9 percent last year
compared with a 23 percent gain for the Hang Seng index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
