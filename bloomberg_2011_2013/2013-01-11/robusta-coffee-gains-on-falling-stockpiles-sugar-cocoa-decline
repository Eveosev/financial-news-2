Robusta coffee climbed for a second
day in  London  as stockpiles of the beans used in instant drinks
and espresso continue to decline. Cocoa and sugar retreated
along with most of the commodities.  Robusta coffee stockpiles with a valid grading certificate
in warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe were 104,860 metric tons
on Jan. 7, down 1.6 percent from two weeks earlier, according to
data on the exchange’s website yesterday. Inventories have
fallen 75 percent since reaching an all-time high of 417,420
tons in July 2011. Commodities slid as the dollar advanced,
making raw materials priced in the U.S. currency less attractive
as an alternative investment. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge
of 24 raw materials slid as much as 0.4 percent.  “Robusta is gaining a slight support from lower stockpiles
but volume is still very low,” Jerome Jourquin, the head of
agricultural commodity derivatives at brokerage Aurel BGC in
Paris, said by e-mail today. “Coffee traded down the past three
months, reaching the targets on both arabica and robusta.
January should be a month of consolidation.”  Robusta for March delivery advanced 0.2 percent to $1,922 a
ton by 10:22 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. It gained 0.4 percent
yesterday. Arabica coffee for March delivery slid 0.4 percent to
$1.491 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Robusta coffee gained 6.3 percent last year while arabica
beans lost 37 percent, making them the worst performing
commodity in the GCSI index in 2012. Arabica prices fell partly
because of a record crop in top producer  Brazil  and rising
inventories of the variety favored by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   Brazil’s Harvest  The coffee harvest in Brazil this year may approach 2012’s
output even as trees enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year
cycle, the  Agriculture Ministry  said. Producers will harvest
between 47 million and 50.2 million bags, compared with 50.8
million last year, ministerial crop-forecasting agency Conab
estimated. Another large crop could push prices to as low as
$1.40 a pound, Jose Milton Dallari, a director at the Rio de
Janeiro-based National Agricultural Society, said in an
interview this week.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery slid 0.4
percent to $510.40 a ton in London. Raw sugar for March delivery
retreated 0.4 percent to 18.88 cents a pound in  New York .  Cocoa for March delivery was down 0.7 percent to 1,432
pounds ($2,307) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for March delivery
fell 0.8 percent to $2,250 a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
