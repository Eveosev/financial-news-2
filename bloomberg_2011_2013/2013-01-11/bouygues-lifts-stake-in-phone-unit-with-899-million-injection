Bouygues SA (EN) ,  France ’s second-biggest
builder, lifted its stake in Bouygues Telecom by almost a
percentage point as it injected 678 million euros ($899 million)
in its telecommunications unit whose profit has been sapped by
increased competition.  Bouygues’s stake in Bouygues Telecom climbed to 90.53
percent from 89.55 percent, a company official said today,
confirming a report in newspaper L’Agefi. JC Decaux Holding’s
stake in Bouygues Telecom dropped to 9.47 percent from 10.45
percent as it injected 22.2 million euros, the official said.  Bouygues Telecom Chief Financial Officer Eric Haentjens
said in November that there would be a capital increase to
partly make up for the cost of purchasing two blocks of so-
called fourth-generation frequencies for 943 million euros.  Bouygues, the Paris-based building, television and
telecommunications company, said in November third-quarter net
income dropped 29 percent, led by a decline at its phone unit.
To revive earnings, Bouygues Telecom, France’s third-largest
mobile-phone operator, has cut jobs, prices and marketing
expenditure, and introduced new services to regain customers
from  Iliad SA (ILD) , which started a wireless service in January 2012.  Bouygues rose 0.2 percent to 22.37 euros at 10:46 a.m. in
Paris trading.  Dividend Policy  Bouygues Telecom, which accounted for 39 percent of the
dividends received by Bouygues SA from 2006 to 2011, had already
reduced its dividend paid in 2012 by 50 percent, and will
suspend dividend payments this year, Jean-Michel Koster, an
analyst at CM-CIC in Paris, said in a research note yesterday.
It “seems unreasonable” for Bouygues SA to maintain its 2012
dividend at the same level as 2011, he said.  The official at Bouygues declined to comment on the
dividend.  Bouygues’s policy is for a “slight increase or stability
in the dividend” over the long term, CFO Philippe Marien said
in November. It “is not a policy based mechanically on free
cash flow on one year or a payout on one year,” he said. The
investment in the 4G licenses and the deterioration of Bouygues
Telecom’s cash flow meant 2012 was unusual, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
