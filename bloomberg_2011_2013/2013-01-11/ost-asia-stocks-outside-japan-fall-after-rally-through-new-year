Most Asian  stocks  outside  Japan  fell
this week as investors locked in profits after a rally through
the first week of the year and amid mixed economic reports from
 China .  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled developer,
slumped 3.6 percent in Hong Kong on speculation there will be
less room for monetary easing after consumer prices rose.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company by market value,
dropped 3.2 percent after climbing 15 percent through seven
straight weekly gains. Japanese shares capped their longest
streak of weekly gains in more than 20 years as the nation’s
government announced 10.3 trillion yen ($116 billion) in further
stimulus measures.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 0.1 percent to 131.82 this
week after a seven-week winning streak, the longest in almost a
year. The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan  slipped less than a
10th of a percentage point, with more than six stocks falling
for every five that rose, while the  MSCI Japan Index (MXJP)  jumped 1.1
percent in its eighth weekly gain.  “We don’t expect a no-brainer, one-way climb for stocks,”
said  Michael Kurtz , chief global equity strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. “Japan for its part has delivered a
key step toward expectations of a major pro-reflation policy
shift.”  The benchmark Asia gauge climbed 14 percent in 2012 as
central banks from the U.S., Europe, Japan and China took action
to spur economic growth.  Stocks on the index were at about 14.2 times estimated
earnings, compared with multiples of 13.3 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  1989 Peak  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.1 this week, a
ninth straight advance. The Topix Index, the country’s broadest
measure of share price performance, also rose for a ninth week,
the longest such streak since it hit an all-time high in
December 1989.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  dipped 0.8 percent as the
nation’s central bank left its key rate unchanged as expected.
Singapore’s Straits Times Index slipped 0.3 percent. Taiwan’s
Taiex Index increased 0.2 percent. The Philippine Stock Exchange
Index gained 1.3 percent, reaching a record close on Jan. 9.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 0.3 percent this week
as BHP fell 3.2 percent to A$36.68 and  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia  slid 3 percent to A$61.38 after an 8.5 percent, seven
week rally through Jan 4.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  sank 0.3 percent this week. The
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 1.5 percent. China’s inflation in
December accelerated to a seven-month high as the nation’s
coldest winter in 28 years pushed up vegetable prices.  China CPI  China’s consumer price index rose 2.5 percent from a year
earlier in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said
yesterday, a pickup that may limit room for easing to support an
economic recovery.  China Resources Land dropped 3.6 percent to HK$22.65 in
Hong Kong, while China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., the
biggest mainland developer by value listed in Hong Kong,
retreated 0.4 percent to HK$24.60. Both companies last week
reached record highs.  “The market lacks catalysts for more gains in January and
needs to consolidate,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central
China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Inflation is a potential
threat to the market. Though it won’t trigger an immediate
interest-rate increase, it will weigh on investors’ sentiment.”  Shippers Rally  While Chinese property developers dropped, shipping
companies rallied after the nation’s customs office on Jan. 10
said China’s exports rose 14.1 percent from a year earlier in
December, and imports increased 6 percent.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the world’s largest operator of
dry-bulk ships, surged 8.6 percent to HK$4.56 this week in Hong
Kong while China Shipping Container Lines Co. advanced 5.3
percent to HK$2.57.  Japanese exporters gained as the nation’s currency
depreciated and as the government announced a stimulus package
including 3.8 trillion yen for disaster prevention and 3.1
trillion yen to stimulate investment. The plan will increase
gross domestic product by about 2 percentage points and create
about 600,000 jobs, according to the Cabinet Office.  Japanese Exporters  The yen traded near a 2 1/2 year low against the dollar
this week, boosting the value of overseas earnings for Japanese
companies.  Honda Motor Co., a Japanese carmaker that gets about 43
percent of sales from North America, gained 3.4 percent to 3,380
yen this week in Tokyo.  Sharp Corp. (6753) , Japan’s biggest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, soared 12 percent to 330 yen. The company, which gets
more than half its  revenue  from overseas, had an operating
profit of about 20 billion yen in the three months ended Dec. 31,
the Mainichi newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  BEC World Pcl (BEC) , Thailand’s biggest publicly traded
television broadcaster, fell 11 percent in Bangkok after
Macquarie Group Ltd. and Kasikorn Securities Pcl cut their
rating on the shares to underperform from neutral.  Hyosung Corp. (004800) , a chemicals and trading company, slumped 11
percent to 66,400 won in Seoul after Kiwoom Securities Co. cut
its price target to 87,000 won from 93,000 won, citing the
company’s slower-than-expected pace of earnings recovery.  Aluminum producers rose after industry bellwether Alcoa Inc.
reported fourth-quarter sales that exceeded analysts’ estimates.
 Alumina Ltd. (AWC) , a supplier of the material used to make aluminum,
surged 15 percent to A$1.09 in Sydney, while  Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest supplier of the light metal,
climbed 3.4 percent to HK$3.95 in Hong Kong.  BYD Co. (1121) , the Chinese carmaker partly owned by  Warren
Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. rose 13 percent to HK$25.85
after CCB International raised its rating on the stock to
neutral from underperform.  To contact the reporters on this story:
