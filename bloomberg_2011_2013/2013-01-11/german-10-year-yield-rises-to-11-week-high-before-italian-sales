Italian government bonds rose for a
fourth day as borrowing costs fell when the nation sold 5
billion euros ($6.6 billion) of securities, underlining demand
for the debt of so-called peripheral countries.  The extra yield investors demand to hold  Italy ’s 10-year
bonds instead of Germany’s shrank below 2.5 percentage points
for the first time since July 2011 as the sale added to optimism
the debt crisis is easing. German bunds fell, with yields rising
to an 11-week high, after the European Central Bank refrained
from cutting interest rates yesterday and President Mario Draghi
said the economy should gradually recover. Spain raised more
than its target at an auction yesterday.  “Risk appetite remains positive,” said Richard McGuire, a
senior rates strategist at Rabobank International in London.
“There’s an ongoing risk-on move, underpinned yesterday by the
very favorable outcome for the Spanish auctions. Draghi’s
rhetoric highlighted the marked improvement in financial
markets.”  Italy’s 10-year yield dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.12 percent at 4:26 p.m.  London  time after
falling to 4.09 percent, the lowest level since November 2010.
The 5.5 percent note due in November 2022 rose 0.295, or 2.95
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 111.345.  The spread over similar-maturity bunds narrowed as much as
12 basis points to 248 basis points.  The  two-year  rate slipped one basis point to 1.36 percent
after sliding to 1.28 percent yesterday, the least since April
2010. The yield has declined 32 basis points since this week.  Italy Auction  Italy sold 3.5 billion euros of debt maturing in December
2015 at an average yield of 1.85 percent, down from 2.50 percent
at the previous auction on Dec. 13. The Rome-based Treasury also
allotted 1.5 billion euros of floating-rate notes.  Italian bonds also advanced on speculation a government led
by Pier Luigi Bersani, the frontrunner in Italy’s election
campaign, will maintain Prime Minister Mario Monti’s policies
that were credited for stabilizing the bond market. Bersani’s
spokesman Stefano Fassina said today the candidate may seek
Monti’s support should he fail to win a Senate Majority.  Spanish 10-year  yields  dropped two basis points to 4.89
percent after falling to 4.84 percent, the least since March 1.  The country sold a combined 5.8 billion euros of bonds due
between 2015 and 2026 yesterday, surpassing its maximum target
of 5 billion euros.  ‘Revised Target’  Spanish  five-year yields  will fall to 3 percent, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. strategists Francesco Garzarelli and Silvia Ardagna wrote today in a note to clients. That compares with a
3.50 percent estimate in December.  “Our revised target implies five-year Spain trading at
around 230-250 basis points over Germany, where spreads were in
early 2011,” they wrote.  Spain’s five-year yield fell five basis points to 3.48
percent today. The  spread  over similar-maturity German notes was
286 basis points.  Volatility on Belgian bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by those of Spain and Italy, according
to measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the yield
spread between two- and 10-year debt, and credit default swaps.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield climbed two basis points to
1.58 percent after rising to 1.61 percent, the  highest  level
since Oct. 25.  The ECB kept its benchmark interest rate at 0.75 percent
yesterday in a unanimous decision a month after calls for a cut
from some of its Governing Council. Policy makers maintained
their so-far untapped offer to buy the bonds of governments who
request assistance.  German bunds fell 1.5 percent this month through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian debt
returned 2.1 percent and Spanish securities gained 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
