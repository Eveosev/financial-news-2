German stocks  were little changed,
falling for the week, as declines by  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  and  RWE AG (RWE) 
offset optimism about a Japanese stimulus plan to accelerate a
recovery in the world’s third-biggest economy.  ThyssenKrupp slid 1.9 percent. RWE fell 2.4 percent to its
lowest in more than six months as European utilities declined.
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  retreated 1.8 percent as UBS AG cut its
rating on the stock. SAP AG rose 1.2 percent after unveiling a
software overhaul.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  advanced 0.1 percent to 7,715.53 at the close
of trading in  Frankfurt , paring its weekly loss to 0.8 percent.
The gauge has still gained 1.4 percent since the start of the
year as U.S. politicians agreed on a compromise budget to
prevent most scheduled tax increases and delay spending cuts.
The broader HDAX Index rose 0.1 percent today.  “My feeling is the market is taking a breather, but
without any selling pressure,” Matthias Jasper, head of
equities at WGZ Bank AG in Dusseldorf, said in a phone
interview. “There doesn’t seem to be optimism seeping in from
 Japan , though the initial trading days this year have been very
strong and the market is already discounting a lot of good
news.”  The number of shares changing hands on the DAX was 60
percent more than the average of the last 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  In Japan, the Cabinet Office said the government will spend
10.3 trillion yen ($116 billion) to drag the economy out of its
third recession in the last five years. The stimulus will
increase gross domestic product by about 2 percentage points and
create some 600,000 jobs, according to a statement.  Chinese Inflation  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1.8 percent today
as the nation’s inflation accelerated faster than estimated,
limiting room for easing. The  consumer price index  rose 2.5
percent in December from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today in Beijing. That compares with the 2.3
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey and a 2
percent gain in November.  ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s largest steelmaker, dropped 1.9
percent to 18.68 euros. A gauge of commodity-linked stocks
performed the worst of the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  RWE retreated 2.4 percent to 29.98 euros, its lowest price
since June 25. A gauge of European  utility companies  was among
the worst performing on the Stoxx 600.  Lufthansa Downgraded  Lufthansa fell 1.8 percent to 14.51 euros. UBS downgraded
its rating on Europe’s second-largest carrier to neutral from
buy, saying the shares’ upside is limited after a 55 percent
rally in 2012.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest lender, declined 0.3
percent to 37.26 euros, after earlier falling as much as 1
percent.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the second-largest German lender, lost
3.5 percent to 1.64 euros, its biggest drop since Nov. 16.  SAP gained 1.2 percent to 61.32 euros after unveiling the
biggest overhaul to its mainstay enterprise software in two
decades. At an event in  Palo Alto ,  California , the largest maker
of enterprise software showed a faster version of its Business
Suite product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
