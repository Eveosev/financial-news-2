Running back Eddie Lacy will skip
his senior season at the  University of Alabama  and enter the
National Football League draft after the team’s second straight
national championship.  Crimson Tide spokesman Jeff Purinton announced Lacy’s
decision today in an e-mail. Lacy rushed for 140 yards and a
touchdown in  Alabama ’s 42-14 victory over the  University of
Notre Dame  in the Bowl Championship Series title game four days
ago.  Lacy led Alabama with 1,322 yards rushing and 17 touchdowns
on the ground this season, his first as the team’s primary
running back. The 6-foot, 220-pound Lacy also caught 22 passes
for 189 yards and two scores.  Crimson Tide quarterback A.J. McCarron has said he will
play his senior season. Linebacker C.J. Mosley and offensive
lineman Anthony Steen have also said they intend to return next
year, according the school’s athletics website.  The Crimson Tide are 5-1 favorites to win their third
consecutive BCS title next season, according to online sports
book Bovada.lv.  The three-day  NFL draft  begins on April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
