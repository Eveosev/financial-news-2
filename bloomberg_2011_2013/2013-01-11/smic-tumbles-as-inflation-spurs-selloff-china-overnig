Chinese stocks traded in New York
slumped, led by commodity producers and manufacturers, after
data showed inflation in Asia’s biggest economy unexpectedly
accelerated to a seven-month high.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. fell 1.1 percent to 101.34 in New
York, posting a weekly drop of 0.4 percent. Chipmaker
 Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMI)  sank for the
first time in four days, while  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.  slid
the most since October.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , China’s most-used search
engine, soared to an 11-week high.  The China-US gauge followed the  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  Index
lower for the first weekly decline since November. Rising food
prices stoked inflation last month to 2.5 percent from a year
earlier, a government report yesterday showed, compared with the
2.3 percent median of economists’ estimates. The climb in
consumer prices damps prospects of economic stimulus and comes
after December data from retail sales to exports improved.  “It’s the first disappointing statistic we’ve seen out of
 China  in a long time,” Stephen Leeb, chief investment officer
of Leeb Capital Management Inc., who recommends buying Chinese
stocks, said by phone in New York yesterday. “You’ve had a huge
rally in China, and people are looking for an excuse to take
some profits.”  Chinese  inflation  quickened 2 percent in November from a
year earlier.  ETF Retreats  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 1 percent to $41.09,
extending its weekly loss to 1.3 percent. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index ended little changed, for a gain of 0.4 percent on the
week.  The Shanghai Composite gauge of domestic Chinese shares
fell 1.8 percent to 2,242.997, capping a 1.5 percent weekly
decline, the first since the end of November. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  dropped 0.7 percent to 11,842.59, adding
to a weekly loss of 0.8 percent.  American depositary receipts of Semiconductor, known as
SMIC, slumped 5.3 percent to $3.06 in New York. The Shanghai-
based technology manufacturer surged 117 percent from a July 20
low to Jan. 10. The stock is up 13 percent in the week.  “I wouldn’t chase after SMIC at the moment given its nice
run-up recently, but rather wait for pull back and buy on any
technical correction,” Rick Hsu, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. who rates SMIC the equivalent of buy, said Jan. 10. “I feel
sentiment remains a bit skeptical on how it competes against
Taiwanese peers, as well as how sustainable and significant it
could turn around into profitability.”  Huaneng Acquisition  Beijing-based Aluminum Corp.’s ADRs dropped 3.5 percent to
$12.82, the biggest decline since Oct. 26. The stock had
previously gained 43 percent from a two-year low reached on
Sept. 5.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011)  slipped 2.6 percent to
$36.14, the lowest price in almost three weeks. Huaneng agreed
to buy a 50 percent stake in a fuel company from Huaneng Group
for 108 million  yuan  ($17.4 million) and will inject $1.4
billion yuan into the business after completion of the
acquisition, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing.  Beijing-based Baidu added 2.2 percent to $112.97, rising
for a third day to the highest price since Oct. 26. Trading
volume was 73 percent higher than the daily average over the
past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China Lodging Group Ltd. (HTHT)  led gains on the China-US measure,
rising 5.2 percent to $17.92 on volume almost 10 times the
three-month daily average. The Shanghai-based hotel operator
said preliminary results showed its same-hotel revenue per
available room rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
