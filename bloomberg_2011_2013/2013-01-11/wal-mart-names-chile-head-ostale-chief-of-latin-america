Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  promoted
Enrique Ostale, head of its Chilean stores, to president and
chief executive officer of its Latin American operations as the
retailer probes possible bribery in multiple regional markets.  Ostale assumes the new role March 1, the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based company said today in a statement. Current Latin
American chief Eduardo Solorzano will retire from the role and
continue to serve on the board of Walmart de Mexico.  Solorzano’s retirement isn’t related to the probe, said
Kevin Gardner, a Wal-Mart spokesman.  “The changes we’re announcing today are just part of our
normal process as we work to develop global talent,” he said
today in an e-mail.  The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and
Exchange Commission are investigating allegations that the
world’s largest retailer systematically bribed Mexican officials
to more quickly open stores. Wal-Mart also has said it is
inquiring into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in  Brazil , India and China.  The shares rose 0.4 percent to $68.61 at 12:36 p.m. in New
York. Through yesterday, the stock has risen 16 percent in the
past 12 months.  From an office in Mexico City, Ostale will oversee
operations in Argentina, Brazil,  Chile , Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala,  Honduras , Mexico and  Nicaragua .  Ostale came to Wal-Mart from Chilean supermarket operator
Distribucion y Servicio D&S SA, which Wal-Mart bought in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
