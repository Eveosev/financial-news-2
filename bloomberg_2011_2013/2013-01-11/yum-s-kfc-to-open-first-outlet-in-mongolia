Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM)  will open its first
KFC restaurant in  Mongolia , Asia’s fastest-growing economy, this
year with conglomerate Tavan Bogd Group, the Ulan Bator-based
company said.  Tavan Bogd, whose businesses include distributing
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  cars, said it won the rights to establish KFC
outlets in Mongolia, and plans to set up four this year,
according to a statement on its  website  today.  The Louisville, Kentucky-based restaurant chain, whose logo
features the image of founder Colonel Harland Sanders, is
entering the North Asian country as commodity mining and
investment drive the nation’s development. Mongolia’s economy is
forecast to expand 15.7 percent this year, the fastest pace in
Asia, according to International Monetary Fund  estimates .  All four KFC outlets will be located in the capital city of
 Ulan Bator , Ts. Baatarsaikhan, chief executive officer of Tavan
Bogd, said in today’s statement.  “We are conducting a market survey together with a global
research company to determine the market potential and identify
eating habits of Mongolians, which will outline our development
road map,” he said.  Amy Sherwood, Yum’s Kentucky-based spokeswoman, was not
immediately able to respond to an e-mail sent by Bloomberg News
after regular office hours.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
