Ebara Corp. (6361) , a 100 year-old Japanese
manufacturer, plans to cut a total of 90 jobs at its unit that
makes pumps and refrigeration machinery by the end of March as
domestic demand stagnates.  “Given the growth markets for both pumps and refrigeration
operations are outside  Japan , the company is transforming the
business structure to tap growth,” Japan’s biggest pumps maker
said in a statement yesterday.  Ebara’s fluid machinery unit, which also makes turbines and
compressors, accounts for about 70 percent of its near-15,000
staff. The company expects the unit’s operating profit to fall
9.7 percent to 14 billion yen ($157 million) in the year ending
March 31, it said in November.  The job cuts will come via early retirement and voluntary
retirement incentives, it said.  Ebara, founded in 1912, produced Japan’s first domestically
built water pumps in 1925 and expanded operations into
compressors, turbines and garbage incinerators between the 1950s
and 1970s, according to its website. It has since diversified
operations to build semiconductor-making equipment.  Ebara rose 1.1 percent to 371 yen as of 9:27 a.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock has risen 39 percent in the past
12 months, compared with a 48 percent increase in U.S. rival
