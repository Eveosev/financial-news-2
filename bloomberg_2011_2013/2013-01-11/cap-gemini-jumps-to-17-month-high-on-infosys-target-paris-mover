Cap Gemini SA (CAP) ,  France ’s biggest
computer-services company, rose to its highest level in 17
months after rival  Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  raised its full-year sales
forecast.  Shares of the Paris-based company jumped as much as 4.4
percent to 34.98 euros, the highest intraday level since Aug 1.
2011. The shares traded 4.2 percent higher at
9:52 a.m. at 34.91 euros.  Cap Gemini was the biggest gainer on the benchmark CAC 40
Index and led the  European Stoxx 600 Technology Index. (SX8P)  About
381,000 shares changed hands in the first hour of trading, more
than half the stock’s three-month average daily volume of
761,000 shares.  “Cap Gemini is getting a boost from the positive Infosys
announcement,” said Laurent Daure, a Paris-based analyst for
Kepler Capital Markets. “Cap Gemini is the only European IT
services company with significant exposure to the U.S. and to
finance -- two points on which the Infosys report is
encouraging.”  Cap Gemini, which competes with  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) , got about 19 percent of its sales in North
America in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cap
Gemini’s sales shrank 2 percent in 2012 to 10.3 billion euros,
according to the median of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Infosys, based in Bangalore, jumped by as much as 17
percent, the most since it began trading in Mumbai in 1993,
after raising its sales forecast by about 3 percent to 407.5
billion rupees ($7.5 billion) as it reported better-than-
expected profit for the third quarter.  Infosys said it is benefiting in the U.S. from the shift in
the government’s spending focus to health care and other
civilian services from defense.  “Across the board in America, we’ve seen good traction,”
said Ashok Vemuri, the head of Infosys’s business in the
Americas. The government spending move “is good news for us,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
