Japan â€™s environment ministry plans
to set up a fund to promote clean energy projects and to seek
investment from the private sector.  The ministry is requesting 1 billion yen ($11.2 million)
for the fund in a budget request for the year ending March 2014,
it said today in a  document  on its website.  The fund will invest in renewable energy projects as well
as community funds that will put money into clean energy,
according to the document.  The move is intended to encourage investments and loans
from the private sector into low carbon projects such as wind
power generation, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
