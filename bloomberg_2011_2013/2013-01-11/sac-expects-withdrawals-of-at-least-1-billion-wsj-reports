SAC Capital Advisors LP has told
employees and business partners that it expects investors to
withdraw at least $1 billion from the firm amid the U.S.
government’s  insider-trading  investigation, the Wall Street
Journal  reported , citing people briefed on the communications.  Outside clients make up about $6 billion of Stamford,
Connecticut-based SAC’s $14 billion of assets under management,
the newspaper reported. SAC, the hedge fund founded by  Steven A. Cohen , has been telling senior employees of the expected
redemptions and asking clients whether they plan to pull money,
the Wall Street Journal said.  A spokesman for SAC said it is premature to speculate about
redemptions, the Wall Street Journal reported. SAC spokesman
Jonathan Gasthalter declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told SAC last
year that it is considering pursuing civil fraud claims related
to alleged insider trading in two drugmakers by a former
portfolio manager at the firm. Prosecutors say Cohen, 56,
discussed the stocks with the manager, the first time government
officials have linked him to a transaction at the center of an
insider-trading case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
