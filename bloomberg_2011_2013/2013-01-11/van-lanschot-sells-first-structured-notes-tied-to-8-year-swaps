Van Lanschot NV (LANS)  sold the first
structured notes to pay coupons based on eight-year constant-
maturity  swap rates  in euros in at least 13 years.  The oldest independent Dutch bank issued 6.5 million euros
($8.6 million) of securities in five offerings since Nov. 11
that pay yields based on the rates, benchmarks that measure the
cost of exchanging floating and fixed interest payments through
the swaps market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
notes are the first to reference euro swaps of an eight-year
maturity in Bloomberg data that go back to 1999.  Van Lanschot’s latest note was a 1.5 million euro three-
year security issued on Jan. 1 that pays a fixed rate of 2.15
percent for two years before switching to the swap rate.  “The investors wanted to profit from rising  interest rates 
and expect eight-year rates to be attractive in the coming
years,” said Florian Hillen, Amsterdam-based head of structured
products at Kempen & Co. NV, Van Lanschot’s asset management,
brokerage and corporate finance unit.  Securities linked to constant-maturity swap rates allow
investors to bet on the future direction of interest rates. The
euro eight-year swap rate is  1.41 percent , Bloomberg data show.
The measure fell to 1.27 percent on Dec. 10, the least since at
least 1999.  The notes were bought by European private banks, said
Hillen.  Four of last year’s five largest structured notes tied to
constant maturity swaps in euros, totaling $992.1 million, were
linked to the 10-year rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
