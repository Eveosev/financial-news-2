Russia’s Foreign Ministry said the
country is under no obligation to allow adoptions of Russian
children by U.S. families to proceed under a treaty between the
two nations.  Russia, though, will continue to make use of the treaty to
monitor the treatment of its citizens adopted in the U.S., the
ministry said in a statement posted on its website today.  Russian President  Vladimir Putin ’s spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov , said yesterday that the U.S.-Russia adoption agreement
remains in force until January 2014 because of a provision
setting a one-year termination delay, according to the Russian
state news service RIA Novosti. Russia banned U.S. adoptions,
effective Jan. 1, under a law passed last month.  The U.S. is “very hopeful” that Russia will allow
Americans to complete pending adoptions jeopardized by the new
Russian ban, State Department spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland  said
yesterday. Between 500 and 1,000 U.S. families are in various
stages in the process of adopting Russian children, according to
the State Department. Russian authorities say that 46 children
had been cleared for adoption before the ban took effect.  Russian children who have had their adoption definitely
approved by a court will be able to leave for the U.S., Peskov
said in an interview with Dozhd television channel broadcast
today. Other children won’t be allowed to proceed with their
adoptions, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
