Lawyers for James Holmes, accused of
fatally shooting 12 people at an Aurora,  Colorado , movie
theater, told a judge they aren’t prepared for an arraignment at
a hearing scheduled for tomorrow.  “The defense has notified the  district attorney  that it is
not prepared to proceed to arraignment in this case by Friday,
and therefore request that the hearing on Friday serve only as a
status hearing and not arraignment,” according to a filing
today in Colorado state court in Centennial.  Arapahoe County District Court Judge William Sylvester is
weighing whether there is enough evidence against Holmes to
order him to go trial on murder charges. At the conclusion of a
preliminary hearing yesterday, Sylvester set a hearing for
tomorrow morning and indicated he would rule at or before that
hearing whether there is enough evidence to proceed to trial.
Sylvester also indicated that if he sends the case to trial, he
would ask Holmes to enter a plea tomorrow.  Holmes, who studied neuroscience at the University of
Colorado-Denver, is charged with first-degree murder, which can
carry the death penalty in Colorado, and more than 100 counts of
attempted murder.  The case is People v. Holmes, 12-cr-01522, 18th Judicial
District Court, Colorado (Centennial).  To contact the reporter on this story:
