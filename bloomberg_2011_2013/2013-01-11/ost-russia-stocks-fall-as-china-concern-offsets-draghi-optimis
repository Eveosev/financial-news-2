Most Russian stocks declined as
Chinese inflation accelerated more than expected last month,
offsetting investor optimism after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said the euro-area economy will recover.  The 50-stock Micex Index fluctuated, falling less than 0.1
percent to 1,506.20 by 11:37 a.m. in Moscow, trimming its weekly
gain to 2.1 percent. Thirty-one stocks fell and 18 rose. OAO GMK
 Norilsk Nickel  lost 1.3 percent and OAO Novatek, Russia’s
second-biggest gas producer, dropped 0.9 percent, while
coalminer OAO Raspadskaya rose 3.4 percent.  China’s inflation accelerated faster than estimated,
limiting room for easing. The euro-area economy will return to
health in 2013, Draghi said yesterday, and Japan today announced
a 10.3 trillion-yen ($116 billion) stimulus package.  “Draghi’s remarks had a positive bias,” Peter Szopo, head
of research at  Alfa Bank , wrote in an e-mailed report. “ Japan ’s
prime minister announced $116 billion in stimulus, but higher-
than-expected Chinese inflation data are weighing on markets.”  Oil, Russia’s main export revenue earner, was little
changed, after gaining 72 cents yesterday to an almost four-
month high of $93.82 a barrel in New York. Saudi Arabia, the
world’s largest crude exporter, reduced output in December to
the lowest in 19 months, according to a Persian Gulf official
with knowledge of the kingdom’s energy policy.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 0.8 percent to $30.05,
gaining for the first time in four days. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the stock futures, rose
1 percent to 20.97.  The Micex trades at about 5.4 times  estimated earnings .
That compares with a multiple of 10.8 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index.  Russian (INDEXCF)  equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg. Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from
oil and natural gas industry sales.  -- Editors: Torrey Clark, Alex Nicholson  To contact the reporter on this story:
