U.S. nuclear generation fell to the
lowest level in four days as  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  shut a reactor in
 Massachusetts  after recirculation pumps tripped offline.  Total U.S. production declined 0.6 percent from yesterday
to 92,923 megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, according to
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg.
Output was  2.5 percent less  than a year earlier with eight of
104 reactors offline.  Entergy shut the 685-megawatt Pilgrim 1 reactor yesterday
after operating it at full power. The cause of the pump trip at
the unit, 38 miles (61 kilometers) southeast of  Boston , is being
investigated, the company said.  “The plant will be restarted after a thorough evaluation
and any necessary repairs are completed,” Entergy said in an e-
mailed statement.  Generation in the Northeast dropped 2.8 percent to 24,214
megawatts, the  biggest slide  since Dec. 16. Western output
increased by 130 megawatts as Entergy boosted generation at the
Grand Gulf 1 reactor in Mississippi to 90 percent from 80
percent yesterday. The unit tripped offline last week when a
protective relay identified a fault, said Mike Bowling, a
company spokesman based in Jackson.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 43 days in
2011, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
