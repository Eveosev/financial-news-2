The Philippine peso climbed to the
highest level in almost five years on speculation the central
bank will start raising its benchmark interest rate in 2013 to
ward off inflation. Five-year government bonds declined.  Overseas investors bought $316 million more of the nation’s
stocks than they sold yesterday, exchange data show, as Chinese
export numbers topped estimates. The economy is at risk of
overheating and “it’s very healthy” for the  Philippines  for
borrowing costs to rise, Michael Spencer, Deutsche Bank AG’s
chief economist for Asia, said at a briefing yesterday in Manila.
He forecasts a 75 basis point rise in the policy rate this year.  “The rate-cut factor has reached bottom and this will be
supportive for the peso,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , an economist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  Singapore , adding that he
predicts borrowing costs will be increased in the second half.
“As risk appetite returns, the Philippines is set to lead the
pack in Southeast Asia on investor interest.”  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 40.605 per dollar at the close
in Manila, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. It touched
40.567 earlier, the strongest level since March 10, 2008. The
currency strengthened 0.7 percent from Jan. 4, a fourth week of
gains. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 4.1
percent.  The central bank is “looking at tools” to manage inflows,
Governor Amando Tetangco said today in  Manila , adding that there
were no specific measures at the moment. The monetary authority
imposed limits on currency forward positions at banks last month.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut its policy rate four times
last year to a record low of 3.5 percent. The next policy
meeting will be on Jan. 24. Tanuwidjaja predicted the central
bank will raise its overnight borrowing rate by 25 basis points
each in the third and fourth quarters. The peso will probably
strengthen to 39.30 by the end of 2013, he said.  The yield on the 5 percent notes due August 2018 rose six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.05 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
