Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland in 1967, has died. He was
76.  Nobs died yesterday, a few days after an accident in his
“beloved mountains,” according to the festival  website .  “In your typical spirit, you left by surprise as if to
remind us once more, that in life as in music, each great
performance could be the last one even if the show must go on,”
the festival said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
