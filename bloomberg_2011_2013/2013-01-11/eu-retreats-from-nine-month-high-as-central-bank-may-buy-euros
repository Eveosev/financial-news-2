Romania’s leu retreated from a nine-
month high on speculation the central bank may buy euros to
bolster its foreign-exchange reserves before payments it has to
make to the  International Monetary Fund .  The currency weakened 0.4 percent to 4.3849 per euro by 5
p.m. in Bucharest, after gaining 0.7 percent yesterday to the
highest level since April 9. Yields on Romania’s June 2016 euro-
denominated bonds rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 3.09 percent.  Romania, which secured a 20 billion euros ($27 billion)
bailout from the IMF and the European Union in 2009, has to
repay about 5 billion euros this year. Foreign exchange reserves
rose to 31.2 billion euros at the end of December from 31.17
billion a month earlier, according to the central bank.  “With conditions improving for the leu, coupled with an
ongoing recovery in foreign appetite for leu debt, we think the
central bank may use the opportunity to start rebuilding its
reserves by buying hard currency at these levels,” Mihai Tantaru, a Bucharest-based economist at ING Bank  Romania  SA
wrote in a note today. “This may keep the leu from advancing
sharply over the coming weeks.”  The central bank will repay 3.8 billion euros to the IMF in
2013 and the government must return 1.2 billion euros, Prime
Minister Victor Ponta said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
