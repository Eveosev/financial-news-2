U.K. house prices stagnated in
December and may record a modest increase in 2013, Acadametrics
Ltd. said.  The average price of a home in England and  Wales  was
227,026 pounds ($366,000) last month, Acadametrics and  LSL
Property Services Plc (LSL)  said in a monthly report published in
London today. From a year earlier, values rose 3.2 percent.  U.K. credit conditions have eased and mortgage approvals
have risen in a sign the Bank of England’s new credit program
may be starting to have an impact. While Acadametrics said 2013
may be a “slightly easier year for mortgage lenders,” it noted
that the strength of the economic recovery remains a key factor.  “Much depends on what happens in the macro economy, but
from a housing-market perspective and for the moment at least we
end 2012 on a positive note, with the general consensus that
2013 will build on that,” said Acadametrics Chairman Peter
Williams. “Of course all of this is at a national level. The
picture is far less rosy at the regional and local level.”  Acadametrics’s cautious outlook tallies with that of
mortgage lender Halifax, which said on Jan. 7 that house prices
will probably remain little changed in 2013. Nationwide Building
Society said that prices may decline “modestly.”  Acadametrics estimates that there were about 657,000
housing transactions in 2012, compared with 661,165 the previous
year. That’s 63 percent of the long-term average from 1995 to
2011, indicating the market “is still operating below its
potential, largely due to the difficulties being faced by would-
be purchasers in obtaining mortgage finance.”  Out of the 10 regions tracked by Acadametrics and LSL,
eight posted increases in the three months through December from
the same period a year earlier and two declined, according to
the report.  London  led the gain, with values up 9.9 percent.  “By boosting the national average house price, London
disguises the weak state of the housing market in northern
areas,” said David Newnes, director of LSL. “If the capital is
stripped from the figures, the average increase in house prices
during 2012 falls dramatically from 3.2 percent to 1.4 percent -
- well below the rate of inflation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
