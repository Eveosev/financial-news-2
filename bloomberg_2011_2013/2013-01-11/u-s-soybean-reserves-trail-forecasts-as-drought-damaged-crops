U.S. soybean inventories on Dec. 1
fell to the lowest since 2003 and were smaller than analysts
expected after the country’s worst drought since the 1930s
damaged crops, the government said.  Stockpiles totaled 1.966 billion bushels (53.5 million
metric tons), compared with 1.981 billion, the average
expectation of 26 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .
Inventories were down 17 percent from 2.37 billion a year
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
report.  “The smaller inventory forecast reinforces that extremely
tight U.S. supply situation before next year’s harvest,” said
 Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for AgriVisor LLC in
Bloomington, Illinois. “We are going to get a price rally to
restrict consumption. U.S. processors will be scrapping the
bottom on the grain bins to get supplies this summer.”  The oilseed reached a record $17.89 a bushel on Sept. 4 as
the dry conditions threatened production. Futures have fallen 23
percent since then, with the March contract declining 0.7
percent to $13.70 at 7:46 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Soybean meal for March delivery dropped 1.1 percent to $401 for
2,000 pounds. The high-protein animal feed gained 26 percent in
the 12 months through yesterday.  Reduced Margins  Reduced soybean supplies have cut margins for meat
producers  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , which buy
soy-based animal feed. Oilseed processors such as  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and
 Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  may benefit from a global shortage of
the livestock ration. The central Illinois crush  spread  -- the
difference between the cost of a bushel of soybeans and the
value of the meal and oil it can produce -- is more than double
the average of the past two years.  The 2012 U.S. soybean crop totaled 3.015 billion bushels,
up 1.5 percent from a December estimate, the USDA said today in
an annual production  report . Analysts were expecting 2.993
billion bushels. About 3.094 billion bushels were harvested in
the previous year.  U.S. Crushings  About 1.605 billion bushels of soybeans will be processed
into  animal feed  and cooking oil, according to the report, up
from 1.57 billion projected in December and 1.703 billion in the
previous year.  U.S. inventories on Aug. 31, before the next harvest, will
total 135 million bushels, in line with analyst estimates,
compared with 130 million bushels forecast in December, the USDA
said. Stockpiles were 169 million bushels a year earlier.  Cash prices for the marketing year that began Sept. 1 will
average a record $14.25 a bushel, the USDA said, compared with
$14.55 estimated a month ago and $12.50 last year.  World production will total 269.41 million tons, more than
the 267.72 million forecast in December as Brazil is expected to
surpass the U.S. as the world’s biggest producer with 82.50
million tons harvested, up 1.9 percent from last month’s
estimate, the department said. In the previous year, world
output was 238.73 million tons.  Global  inventories  on Sept. 30 will be 59.46 million tons,
down from 59.93 million forecast in December, the USDA said. A
year earlier, supplies totaled a 55.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
