A measure of overnight borrowing
costs in euros rose for the first time since the  European
Central Bank  cut its deposit rate to zero.  The euro overnight indexed average, or Eonia, was set at
11.9 basis points yesterday from a record low 11.4 the day
before, according to the European Banking Federation. The gauge
of unsecured lending rates, derived from a daily survey of
banks, was 33.1 basis points when the ECB lowered its benchmark
rates.  An estimate of overnight borrowing costs over the next
three months also rose. The Eonia OIS swap was 10.6 basis points
at 9:25 a.m. in  London  from 9.9 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks reduced  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday as lenders placed 382 billion euros ($469 billion)
from 404 billion euros the day before.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars fell to a
seven-week low. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the
rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars,
was 46.5 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate from
minus 47 the day before.  The one-year basis swap was 53 basis points, or 0.53
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 52. Euribor is the
rate  banks  say they see each other lending in euros, according
to the same panel of banks that contribute to Eonia. Three-
month Euribor was set at a record low 0.47 percent yesterday.  Euribor is published daily after 10 a.m. London time and
Eonia is published at the end of the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
