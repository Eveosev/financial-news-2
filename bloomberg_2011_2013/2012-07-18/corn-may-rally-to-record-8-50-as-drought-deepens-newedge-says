Corn may rally to a record $8.50 a
bushel as the worst U.S. drought in decades cuts production in
the world’s biggest exporter, driving global stockpiles lower,
according to broker Newedge USA LLC.  The U.S. harvest may drop to 11.8 billion bushels (299.7
million metric tons), said  Dan Cekander , director of grain
research, who correctly predicted in March that soybeans would
trade at the most expensive level relative to corn since 2010.
Cekander’s output forecast is 29.75 million tons less than the
latest estimate from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture , and
would be the smallest crop since 2006-2007. Futures traded as
high as $7.89 yesterday, near the $7.9925 record set in 2008.  The drought is baking farms from  Arkansas  to  Ohio , reducing
yields, after frosts followed by drought cut wheat harvests in
the former  Soviet Union , prompting the  United Nations  and the
USDA to pare estimates for world grain harvests. Dimming corn-
crop prospects in the U.S. may push  global food costs  higher,
the Food & Agriculture Organization said earlier this month.  “If it doesn’t start raining the rest of July, you’re
going to have a significant shortfall here in production,” said
Cekander, a fourth-generation farmer who grows corn and soybeans
in  Illinois , the second-largest U.S. grower of both crops.
“That would put the 2012-2013 world corn carry-out below last
year,” he said, referring to year-end stockpiles.  Soybeans Climb  Corn for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to $7.6475 on
the Chicago Board of Trade at 1:49 p.m. in  London . Since
reaching the year’s low in June, the grain has rallied 51
percent. November-delivery soybeans, which lost 0.6 percent to
$15.81 a bushel, reached $16.07 yesterday, the highest price
since 2008.  Corn yields will probably drop to 134.9 bushels an acre as
 crop conditions  deteriorate, Cekander said in an interview
yesterday, forecasting prices of $8.25 to $8.50 for December
futures. That compares with the USDA estimate of 146 bushels,
and a forecast of 138 bushels from AccuWeather.com. Last year’s
harvest was 12.36 billion bushels, with a yield of 147.2
bushels.  “The fear is that the U.S. corn yield will decline to 125
to 130 bushels per acre if hot and dry weather persists through
mid-August,” Cekander said. The 11.8 billion-bushel harvest
estimate is based an area of 87.5 million acres (35.4 million
hectares), lower than the USDA’s 88.9 million acres, he said.  Corn may rally to as much as $9 if the yield on the U.S.
crop drops to less than 140 bushels an acre, according to a
report from UBS AG today. Further declines in the harvested area
as well as the yield were likely in August, the bank said.  Crop Ratings  About 55 percent of the contiguous U.S. states were in
moderate-to-extreme drought at the end of June, the highest
since December 1956, according to the National Climatic Data
Center. USDA ratings for corn and soybeans as of July 15 were
the worst for that time of year since a drought in 1988.  Yield losses for corn are nearing levels last seen in 1988,
Greg Grow, director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services
Inc., said yesterday. U.S. production slumped 31 percent that
year, according to USDA data.  A rally to $8.50 may trigger so-called rationing in demand
from feed users, and crop losses could prompt the government to
lower the mandate for using corn-based ethanol in fuel, Cekander
said. “That would allow a reduction in corn grain for ethanol
and free up some supply to get us by.”  Global corn production in 2012-2013 may total 905.2 million
tons compared with demand of 900.5 million tons, according to
the USDA, which forecasts  world ending stockpiles  of 134 million
tons. The last time world demand exceeded output was 2010-2011.  Newedge was created in 2008 as a venture between  Societe
