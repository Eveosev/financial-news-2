OAO Sberbank (SBRCY)  climbed to a two-month
high in New York and Russian equity futures rose after  Fitch
Ratings  reaffirmed its investment grade on the nation’s biggest
lender and as data showed retail  sales  accelerated last month.  American depositary receipts of Sberbank gained 0.6 percent
to $11.46 yesterday, capping the longest stretch of gains in a
month. Futures expiring in September on the dollar-denominated
 RTS index (RTSI$)  added 0.4 percent to 138,795. The  Bloomberg Russia-US
14 Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies traded in New York dropped 0.2
percent to 90.70, declining for the first time in four days.  OAO
Surgutneftegas (SGTPY)  fell the most in a month.  Sberbank is benefiting from “strong performance” and
credit underwriting that is “generally better” than other
Russian banks, Fitch said. The state-controlled bank was buoyed
by retail sales that advanced 6.9 percent in June from a year
ago following a 6.8 percent increase a month earlier, said Ilya Kravets, a portfolio manager analyst at ED Capital in New York.
The company trades at 5.35 estimated earnings, a 37 percent
discount to  peers .  “The Fitch reiteration combined with a better outlook on
retail sales helps Sberbank here because this bank has such a
huge exposure to the Russian consumer,” Kravets, who helps
manage about $100 million in assets, including Russian stocks,
said in a phone interview. “Sberbank has no exposure to  Europe ,
is cheaply valued, and has a great opportunity to deliver solid
performance.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell for the first time in four days,
losing 0.4 percent to $26.78. The RTS Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in the index futures, dropped for a
third day, declining 0.5 percent to 30.27 points.  ‘Pretty Firm’  Sberbank’s 28 percent return on equity last year as well as
its 35 percent loan growth were reasons Fitch cited for a
“stable outlook” while reaffirming a BBB rating, the ninth
highest investment-level grade.  Russian retail sales climbed in June as unemployment
remained at 5.4 percent, and real wages advanced 12.9 percent,
exceeding the median forecast of 10 economists for a 10.5
percent increase.  Consumer spending , which accounts for half of
 Russia ’s economy, is encouraging companies to maintain
headcounts which has helped balance slowing industrial-output
growth as the economic outlook dims in the country’s biggest
trading partners, the European Union and  China .  “Domestic growth in Russia is pretty firm,” Jose Morales,
who oversees $1.6 billion in emerging market equities at Mirae
Asset Global Investment in New York, said in a phone interview.
“Yet external factors -- growth in the U.S., Europe and China -
- remain the drivers for Russian stocks.”  Further Easing  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index gained 0.7 percent to
1,372.78 as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told a
Senate committee the central bank is studying options for
further easing, adding that he won’t allow consumer prices to
rise in return for faster economic growth.  Sberbank’s advance in New York extended its 2012 gain to 15
percent compared to the Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index which has
added 0.2 percent this year. Sberbank  shares  gained 0.5 percent
in Moscow to 91.61 rubles, or the equivalent of $2.84. One ADR
represents four ordinary shares.  The lender’s estimated earnings ratio traded at a discount
to the 8.5 average multiple for companies on the Bloomberg
Europe 500 Banks and Financial Services Index.  Brent crude  for September settlement rose to seven-week
high, increasing 1.1 percent to $105.16 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Crude traded on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange climbed 0.7 percent to settle at $89.87 a
barrel, exceeding $90 for the first time since May. Urals crude,
Russia’s chief export blend, gained 1.2 percent to $105.69.  Choke Civil Society  Surgutneftegas, Russia’s fourth largest oil producer, fell
the most since June 22, tumbling 3.6 percent to $5.89 after
 shares  in Moscow dropped 1.1 percent to 18.92 rubles, the
equivalent of 59 cents. One ADR equals 10 ordinary shares.  Yandex NV (YNDX) , the operator of Russia’s most popular Internet
search engine, jumped 3.8 percent, the most in two weeks, to
$18.69. Shares have risen 12 percent since touching a record low
on June 14.  The head of President  Vladimir Putin ’s human-rights council
criticized lawmakers for giving approval to three laws that he
warns will choke civil society.  Russia’s upper house of parliament yesterday passed bills
tightening controls over the Internet and foreign-funded non-
government organizations and making libel a criminal offense.
The measures, which must be signed into law by Putin, were
approved by the lower chamber last week.  Uzbekistan  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s largest mobile-phone
operator, retreated 0.5 percent to $17.69 after a government
agency in Uzbekistan suspended the license of the company’s
local unit. Shares of MTS, as the company is known, declined 1.3
percent in Moscow to 225.33 rubles, or $6.99. One ADR is
equivalent to two ordinary shares.  The RTS Index in Moscow gained for a fifth day, adding 0.2
percent to 1,393.01 while the 30-stock  Micex (INDEXCF)  Index fell 0.3
percent to 1,426.29.  The Micex has gained 1.7 percent in 2012 and trades at 5.3
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. That
compares with a 3.8 percent decline for  Brazil ’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index,
which trades at 10.2 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades at
9.7 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) 
has a ratio of 13.5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
