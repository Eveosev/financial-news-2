Russia vowed to block a United
Nations Security Council resolution threatening sanctions and
military action against  Syria , saying such a step would
encourage the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad.  “Adopting this resolution would mean direct support for
the revolutionary movement,” Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov 
told reporters in Moscow today, according to a pool report by
 Agence France-Presse . “If we are talking about revolution, the
UN has no business here.”  The UN Security Council is due to vote today on a Western-
proposed resolution on Syria under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter,
which empowers the council to impose sanctions and authorizes
military means to enforce its will. The policy by the U.S. and
its allies of supporting the Syrian opposition won’t lead
anywhere, Lavrov said.  “Assad won’t quit and our Western partners don’t know what
to do,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
