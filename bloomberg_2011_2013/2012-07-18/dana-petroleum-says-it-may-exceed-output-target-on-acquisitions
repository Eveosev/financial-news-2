Dana Petroleum Plc, the U.K. oil
producer owned by Korea National Oil Corp., said acquisitions
may allow it to exceed a production target of more than 100,000
barrels a day by 2016.  Dana may add assets in the  North Sea  and Africa, Chief
Executive Officer Marcus Richards said in a telephone interview
today. The Aberdeen, Scotland-based company has hired Jim Mair,
a 30-year veteran of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , as director of new
business development to look at acquisition opportunities.  “We are growing, not only in terms of size, financial
success, but also geographically,” Richards said.  Dana’s production rose 50 percent in 2011 to 61,970 barrels
a day, driven by projects in the North Sea and  Egypt , the
company said in an annual results statement. Output will reach
64,000 barrels a day by the end of this year, Richards said.  Dana reported a 2011 profit after tax of $293 million,
compared with a loss of $8.4 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
