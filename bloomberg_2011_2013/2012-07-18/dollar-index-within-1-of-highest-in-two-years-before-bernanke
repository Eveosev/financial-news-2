The Dollar Index traded within 1
percent of a two-year high before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  testifies to Congress for a second day, after
refraining from discussing specific stimulus measures yesterday.  The yen and the dollar strengthened against most of their
16 major peers as Asian stocks and U.S. index futures fell.
Bernanke speaks to the House Financial Services Committee today
after addressing the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. The
pound snapped a three-day gain versus the dollar before the  Bank
of England  releases minutes from its last decision on  interest
rates  and the asset-buying program. Australia’s dollar rose to
an almost two-week high versus the greenback.  “There was disappointment because of Bernanke,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in
 London . “We saw the market very optimistic going into the
Bernanke speech, therefore it was opening itself up for
disappointment.”  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six trading partners, was little changed at 83.061 at
8:54 a.m. London time. It reached 83.829 on July 12, the highest
level since July 13, 2010. The greenback appreciated about 0.1
percent to $1.2284 per euro, and was unchanged versus the yen at
79.06. The euro weakened almost 0.1 percent against the Japanese
currency to 97.12.  Euro-dollar “is a battle of two weakened currencies,”
Foley said.  Housing Starts  A report from the Commerce Department today may show
 housing starts  climbed to a 745,000 annual pace last month from
708,000 in May, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  Central bank policy makers “are looking for ways to
address the weakness in the economy should more action be needed
to promote a sustained recovery in the labor market,” Bernanke
said in response to questions during yesterday’s testimony in
 Washington . The  Federal Open Market Committee  is scheduled to
start a two-day  policy meeting  on July 31.  The pound slipped about 0.1 percent to $1.5640, while the
Aussie, as the Australian currency is called, climbed as high as
$1.0326, the most since July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
