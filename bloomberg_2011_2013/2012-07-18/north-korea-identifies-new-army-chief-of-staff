North Korea  identified a replacement
for its army chief of staff, who was dismissed earlier this week
as new leader Kim Jong Un consolidated his authority over the
nation.  Hyon Yong Chol was referred to as the new chief in a report
yesterday by the state-controlled Korea  Central News Agency ,
hours after Kim was named to the top military rank of marshal.  The agency didn’t say when Hyon was appointed to the post,
instead it referred to him as chief in a report about officers
vowing to be faithful to Kim.  “Hyon Yong Chol, chief of the General Staff of the KPA,
offered the highest glory and the warmest congratulations to the
respected supreme commander in reflection of the warm respect
and ardent loyalty of all the servicepersons,” the report said.  Hyon was named vice marshal two days ago, following the
July 15 dismissal of Ri Yong Ho from the chief of staff post.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
