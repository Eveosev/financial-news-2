Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi met
with the head of the Palestinian Authority,  Mahmoud Abbas , in
Cairo today, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  The two leaders discussed the peace process between Israel
and the Palestinians, Egyptian-Palestinian relations and efforts
to establish an independent Palestinian state, the agency said.  Hamas official Khaled Meshaal, accompanied by senior
delegates from the Islamist group, also arrived in the Egyptian
capital today on a two-day visit to discuss efforts to push the
peace process forward. Hamas, which is considered a terrorist
organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union, last
week called on Egypt to open its border with the  Gaza Strip  for
commercial trade.  Israel and Egypt, which signed a peace treaty in 1979,
sealed Gaza’s borders in June 2007 after Hamas broke off its
power-sharing agreement with the  Palestinian Authority .  To contact the reporter on this story:
