Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car
maker, fell 3.6 percent after a Wunderlich Securities Inc.
analyst cut his rating to sell, saying the company probably will
reduce third-quarter production of the Model S sedan. The
company said it hasn’t altered its production schedule.  The shares slid to $32.15 at the close in  New York . Tesla
declined 7.3 percent yesterday, its biggest decline since April
4.  Tesla will pare third-quarter output of the Model S to 500
from 1,000,  Theodore O’Neill , a Wunderlich analyst wrote in a
report, citing the company. O’Neill lowered his 18-month target
price to $28 a share from $49. The analyst had recommended
buying the stock.  “Tesla wants to be sure the cars are right and apparently
they are not in a position to ramp up to get to 1,000 units this
quarter,” O’Neill wrote. “While the company is sticking to its
5,000 unit forecast for 2012, how it gets there becomes a second
issue for it to resolve.”  At Telsa, “there’s been no change to our production,”
Shanna Hendriks, a company spokeswoman, said by telephone.  Tesla, based in  Palo Alto , California, wants to become
profitable from sales of the Model S as early as next year.
Chief Executive Officer  Elon Musk  has said the company has
10,000 orders for the vehicle and will deliver 5,300 this year
and 20,000 in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
