Siemens AG (SIE) , Europeâ€™s largest
engineering company, won an order to supply a combined-cycle
power plant to a project in  Texas .  Siemens and its partner Bechtel Group Inc. will supply the
758-megawatt plant to Panda Temple Power LLC, Siemens said today
in an e-mailed statement. The deal, which includes a long-term
service agreement, is valued at about $300 million, Siemens
said.  Once built and connected to the grid, the plant will be
able to supply about 750,000 homes in the central and northern
Texas regions, the Erlangen-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
