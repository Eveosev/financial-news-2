The ruble appreciated against the
dollar for a fourth day as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner,
rose.  The Russian currency gained 0.8 percent to 32.2925 per
dollar by the close in Moscow. It strengthened 0.2 percent to
39.622 per euro and 0.5 percent to 35.5908 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Brent crude  jumped 1.2 percent to $105.25 per barrel today,
increasing for a sixth day. Oil and gas contribute about 50
percent of Russia’s state revenue. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said yesterday the central bank is prepared to act
to spur growth if needed.  “The U.S. Federal Reserve chairman’s comments were like a
drip feed of nutrients to a sick market,” Troika Dialog Chief
Strategist Chris Weafer wrote in an e-mailed note today.
“Balancing the possibility of further monetary easing, or other
growth stimuli, continues to be the only game in town for equity
markets and most risk assets.”  Investors pared bets on the currency weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.79 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 32.9430 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
