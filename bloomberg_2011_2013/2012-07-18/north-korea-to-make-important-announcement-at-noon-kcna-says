North Korea will announce
“important news” at 12 p.m. local time today, the state-run
Korean Central News Agency said in a one-line dispatch.  The last time the totalitarian state previewed an
announcement was Dec. 19, before reporting the death of dictator
 Kim Jong Il . South Korean stocks extended losses today, with the
Kospi Index losing 0.9 percent at 11:28 a.m. in  Seoul . The won
fell 0.2 percent.  The report comes a day after Kim Jong Un’s government
promoted General Hyon Yong Chol to vice marshal following the
firing of the army chief on July 15. Kim, who succeeded his
father as leader, has worked to bolster his public image while
rebuffing Western appeals to abandon the country’s nuclear
weapons development.  South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak  held a 90-minute
national security meeting today to discuss developments in North
Korea, spokesman Park Jeong Ha said in a statement on the
presidential website. Lee ordered officials to “keep close
watch on the situation in  North Korea  and maintain close
cooperation with relevant nations,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
