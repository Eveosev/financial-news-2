Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell,
pushing the yield to the highest level in more than 10 weeks, on
speculation the government’s borrowing costs will rise as it
sells more debt. The dong was steady.  The State Treasury will auction 2 trillion dong ($96
million) of 2017 notes and 1 trillion dong of 2014 securities
tomorrow, according to a statement on the Hanoi Stock Exchange’s
website. The Treasury sold 500 billion dong of five-year debt at
9.9 percent on July 12, according to the exchange, compared with
9.6 percent paid at the previous offer of similar-maturity bonds
on July 5.  “ At the last auction, the Ministry of Finance increased
the rate, that’s why the yield is going up,” said Pham Phuong Lan, the Hanoi-based head of fixed-income and currency trading
at the Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  The yield on benchmark five-year bonds rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 10.12 percent, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar as of 5:33 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,853 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
