England  left  Kevin Pietersen  out of
a provisional 30-man squad for cricket’s ICC World Twenty20
competition in  Sri Lanka  in September.  In May, the batsman withdrew from playing in shorter forms
of the game for England to focus on Tests.  He wanted to carry on with Twenty20 matches while not
playing for England in 50-over games, but national selectors
said that wasn’t possible under the terms of his contract.  Pietersen has expressed his interest in playing at the
world event, where No. 1 ranked England is defending its title,
and there’d been speculation that a compromise might be reached
to allow him to take part.  Surrey off-spinner Gareth Batty, Yorkshire batsman Joe Root
and Test wicketkeeper Matt Prior are among those selected.  England provisional squad:  Stuart Broad  (Nottinghamshire) (capt.), James Anderson
(Lancashire), Jonathan Bairstow (Yorkshire), Gareth Batty
(Surrey), Ian Bell (Warwickshire), Ravi Bopara (Essex), Scott
Borthwick (Durham), Tim Bresnan (Yorkshire), Danny Briggs
(Hampshire), Jos Buttler (Somerset), Alastair Cook (Essex),
Steven Croft (Lancashire), Steven Davies (Surrey), Jade Dernbach
(Surrey), Steven Finn (Middlesex), Alex Hales (Nottinghamshire),
Craig Kieswetter (Somerset), Michael Lumb (Nottinghamshire),
Stuart Meaker (Surrey), Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), Graham Onions
(Durham), Samit Patel (Nottinghamshire), Matt Prior (Sussex),
Joe Root (Yorkshire), Ben Stokes (Durham), Graeme Swann
(Nottinghamshire), James Taylor (Nottinghamshire), James Tredwell (Kent), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Luke Wright
(Sussex).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
