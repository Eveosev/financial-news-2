U.K. stocks  climbed to the highest
in almost two weeks as  Bank of England  minutes showed policy
makers may reconsider the case for an interest-rate cut.  Tullow Oil Plc gained 3.3 percent after saying it
discovered oil offshore  Ghana .  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  added 1.6 percent
after reporting a 15 percent increase in gold production.  London 
Stock Exchange Group Plc fell 1.1 percent after saying “market
conditions have remained weak.”  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 56.68, or 1 percent, to 5,685.77 at
the close in London, the highest since July 5. The gauge has
climbed 8.1 percent from its 2012 low on June 1 as central banks
around the world announced measures to boost growth. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index increased 0.9 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index was little changed.  “The minutes of the June meeting showed an overwhelming
majority in favor of more quantitative easing,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index in London. “Although
they held off from cutting the interest rate from its record low
of 0.5 percent, the possibility was discussed, as were other
measures to help stimulate the economy.”  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee was
unanimous in a decision to leave its benchmark interest rate at
0.5 percent, according to minutes of their July 4-5 meeting
released today.  BOE Minutes  The nine-member committee voted 7-2 to increase
quantitative easing by 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) to 375
billion pounds, with  Spencer Dale  and Ben Broadbent dissenting
in favor of no change, the minutes showed. While the MPC said
cutting  interest rates  had “drawbacks” compared with more QE
and the arguments for and against such a move were the same as
in June, this assessment could change in light of the new credit
measures.  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne today outlined
plans to encourage as much as 51 billion pounds of spending on
U.K. infrastructure and exports to help pull the economy out of
recession.  U.K.  unemployment  fell to a nine-month low in the quarter
through May as the London Olympics helped to create jobs. The
jobless rate based on International Labor Organization methods
fell to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent in the period through
April, the  Office for National Statistics  said today.  In the U.S.,  housing starts  rose 6.9 percent last month to
a 760,000 annual pace after a revised 711,000 rate in May that
was faster than initially estimated, Commerce Department data
showed. The median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 745,000 rate.  Volume Declines  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was 24 percent lower than its 30-day average today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tullow rallied 3.3 percent to 1,428 pence after saying its
Wawa-1 well offshore Ghana encountered 20 meters of gas-
condensate pay and 13 meters of oil pay.  Fresnillo climbed 1.6 percent to 1,430 pence after
reporting a 15 percent increase in second-quarter gold
production year-on-year to 127,003 ounces. The company said it’s
on track to achieve its 2012 production targets.  Ashmore Plc (ASHM)  increased 2.6 percent to 330.3 pence after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its recommendation for the U.K.
fund manager to buy from neutral.  Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc advanced 2.4 percent to
335.3 pence after Barclays Plc upgraded the company to
overweight, the equivalent of a buy recommendation, from equal
weight.  Homeserve Rallies  Homeserve Plc (HSV)  jumped 12 percent to 187 pence after the
 Daily Telegraph  reported that the emergency-repair provider has
been approached by private-equity buyers. The company said in a
statement that it isn’t in any discussions which could lead to a
possible offer.  Aggreko Plc gained 3.5 percent to 1,995 pence after the
world’s largest mobile-power supplier said it opened a gas-fired
power plant in  Mozambique  along with South Africa’s Shanduka
Group.  LSE (LSE)  fell 1.1 percent to 1,002 pence even after Europe’s
oldest independent bourse reported a 10 percent increase in
fiscal first-quarter sales. Total income, which includes money
earned from deposits at its central counterparty, gained 10
percent to 209.5 million pounds. That matched RBC  Capital
Markets ’ estimate of 209.6 million pounds.  “Market conditions have remained weak and the summer
period is expected to be quiet,” LSE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
