Banco BPI SA (BPI) , Portugal’s fifth-
biggest bank, advanced the most in more than a week in Lisbon
trading after  Fitch Ratings  raised the bank’s viability rating,
citing the nation’s plan to shore up lenders.  The stock  climbed  as much as 3.5 percent to 53.8 euro
cents, the most since July 10, and was up 3.1 percent to 53.6
cents as of 10:03 a.m. in the Portuguese capital.  “The rating increase may be supporting BPI shares today,”
said Nuno Silva, a trader at  Banco Popular  in Lisbon.  Fitch raised BPI’s viability rating yesterday to bb- from
cc. It also increased viability ratings for Portugal’s state-
owned  Caixa Geral de Depositos SA  and  Banco Comercial Portugues
SA (BCP) , citing the completion of the Portuguese government’s
recapitalization program.  Banco Comercial shares increased 1 percent to 9.9 cents.  The three banks “are now better placed to weather expected
future asset quality deterioration given the recessionary
environment in Portugal,” Fitch said in a statement.  The  Finance Ministry  said in June that the state will
inject more than 6.6 billion euros ($8.1 billion) into BCP, BPI
and Caixa Geral to help the lenders meet capital requirements.
Portuguese banks can use a 12 billion-euro recapitalization
facility that’s part of the financial aid program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
