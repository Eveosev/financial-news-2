United Bank for Africa Plc ,
 Nigeria ’s fourth-biggest lender by market value, will seek a
local banking license in Zambia to meet the country’s new
capital requirements, Managing Director Phillips Oduoza said.  “We intend to convert our license from that of an
international bank,” Oduoza told a conference call today from
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. “What we have done is to
engage the regulators.”  The southern African country in January raised the minimum
capital requirement for international banks to $100 million from
$2.5 million and to $20 million for local banks.  UBA expects its African operations outside Nigeria to
contribute about 25 percent of earnings by end of the year, up
from 19 percent in the first quarter and 22 percent in the
second three months, Oduoza said.  UBA closed 3.2 percent lower at 4.60 naira in Lagos, paring
its gains  this year  to 81 percent. The Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index has risen 12 percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
