An Egyptian administrative court
adjourned until July 30 a hearing on whether another panel of
judges should recuse itself from a case dealing with the
legality of the committee that will draft the new constitution.  The adjournment was announced by Judge Karem Abdel Latif in
Cairo today.  The panel of judges whose status was under consideration at
today’s hearing had decided yesterday to adjourn the case
dealing with the mechanism by which members of the
constitutional committee were elected until tomorrow.  At stake in that case is whether the committee will be
disbanded. That possibility triggered outbursts in court
yesterday, with supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood chanting
against the generals who took over running the country after
 Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster last year, before formally ceding power
to President Mohamed Mursi at the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
