The  average yield  on emerging-market
domestic debt fell to a record low after slower economic growth
prompted central banks from  China  to Brazil to cut interest
rates.  Yields fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
today to 5.79 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co’s GBI-EM
Global Diversified Index. It was the lowest since JPMorgan
started to compile the data in 2003. The yields have dropped 49
basis points over the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
