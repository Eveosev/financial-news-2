U.S. Bancorp, the top performer in
the KBW Bank Index for the past 12 months, posted its 11th
straight year-over-year increase in quarterly profit as revenue
rose and the amount set aside for bad loans declined.  Second-quarter net income climbed 18 percent to $1.42
billion, or 71 cents a share, from $1.2 billion, or 60 cents, a
year earlier, the Minneapolis-based bank said today in a
statement. That beat the  average estimate  of 70 cents from 31
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.S. Bancorp was one of  only three firms  in the 24-company
KBW index to produce positive returns for shareholders during
the quarter. Chief Executive Officer  Richard Davis , 54, has
credited his strategy of running a “boring” bank that takes
deposits and makes loans while avoiding volatile businesses such
as  investment banking .  “The derivative of our income, 50 percent or thereabouts
coming from fee businesses like trusts, and like payment
businesses, also serves as a buffer against the vagaries of
 interest rates  and market perception,” Davis said today on a
conference call. “We have these other cylinders that provide us
with this fee business, which is less consistent, but also has a
whole lot less variability.”  Revenue Groth  U.S. Bancorp gained 0.5 percent to $33.11 at 10:41 a.m. in
 New York . The firm’s shares climbed 22 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with an 18 percent increase in the KBW
index.  Revenue climbed 8.1 percent to $5.07 billion from a year
earlier, driven by 6.6 percent growth in net-interest income and
9.7 percent increase in noninterest income. Mortgage banking
revenue more than doubled to $490 million from $239 million last
year.  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  set aside $470 million for soured loans,
compared with $572 million in the second quarter last year.  Wholesale banking and commercial real estate posted a 21
percent increase in income to $330 million. Consumer and small-
business banking income doubled to $378 million from $189
million.  Total loans surged 7.7 percent to $214.1 billion from
$198.8 billion. The net-interest margin, the difference between
what U.S. Bancorp pays to borrow money and what it gets for
loans, narrowed to 3.58 percent from 3.67 percent a year
earlier.  On a year-over-year basis, U.S. Bancorp has boosted profit
every period since the middle of 2009, a record that beats
JPMorgan Chase & Co., and until the start of this year, net
income had increased sequentially for eight straight quarters.  U.S. Bancorp is the biggest regional U.S. bank by assets,
operating in 25 states as of midyear, and ranks fifth by
deposits among commercial U.S. lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
