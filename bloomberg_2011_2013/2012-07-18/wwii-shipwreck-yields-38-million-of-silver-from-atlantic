Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. (OMEX) , a
deep-ocean exploration company, said it recovered about 48 tons
of silver from a World War II shipwreck three miles (4.8
kilometers) beneath the Atlantic Ocean.  The company retrieved 1,203 silver bars, or about 1.4
million ounces of the metal, from the SS Gairsoppa, a 412-foot
(126-meter) British cargo ship that sank after being torpedoed
by German U-boat in February 1941, Tampa, Florida-based Odyssey
said today in a statement. The metal, worth $38 million at
today’s prices, is being held at a secure facility in the U.K.  Odyssey said the recovered silver represents about 20
percent of the bullion that may be on board the Gairsoppa, which
lies about 300 miles off the coast of Ireland. The operation,
the largest and deepest recovery of precious metals from a
shipwreck, should be completed in the third quarter.  “With the shipwreck lying approximately three miles below
the surface of the North Atlantic, this was a complex
operation,” Greg Stemm, Odyssey chief executive officer, said
in the statement. “Our success on the Gairsoppa marks the
beginning of a new paradigm for Odyssey in which we expect
modern shipwreck projects will complement our archaeological
shipwreck excavations.”  Silver Recovery  The recovery began in May using a chartered 291-foot ship
after a series of reconnaissance dives earlier in the year, the
company said. Odyssey last year announced plans to recover
another 600,000 ounces of silver from the SS Mantola, a British
vessel sunk by a German submarine in 1917, which lies about 100
miles from the the Gairsoppa.  Odyssey has salvage contracts with the U.K. allowing it to
retain 80 percent of the net silver value recovered.  The net loss in the second quarter widened to about $15.6
million, or 21 cents a share, from $1.9 million, or 7 cents, a
year earlier, the company said today in a separate statement.
Revenue tumbled to $1.4 million from $6.7 million a year earlier
as the company said it switched its focus from expedition
charters to shipwreck recovery projects.  Odyssey fell 9.4 percent to $3.85 at the close in  New York ,
the most since Nov. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
