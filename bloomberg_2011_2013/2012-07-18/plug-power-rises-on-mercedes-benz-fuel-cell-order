Plug Power Inc. (PLUG) , a maker of fuel
cells for electric vehicles used in factories and warehouses,
reached its highest level in a month after Mercedes-Benz
purchased 72 forklift systems to use in a Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
plant.  Plug Power increased 1.7 percent to $1.17 at the close in
New York, its highest price since June 14.  Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Germany’s Daimler AG, will use the
company’s GenDrive fuel cells to replace lead-acid batteries in
a portion of its electric forklift fleet, Latham, New York-based
Plug said today in a statement.  Plug said its hydrogen fuel cells may be refilled in less
time than it takes to recharge a battery-powered electric
vehicle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
