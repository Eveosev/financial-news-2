South Korea’s won extended gains
following a report that the North gave the official title of
marshal to leader Kim Jong Un. Stocks pared losses.  The decision was made yesterday by the government and the
military, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said today in
a statement. The won climbed for a fourth day after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that possible
stimulus measures could include further asset purchases, which
previously have spurred fund flows into  emerging markets . The
won dropped 0.2 percent and the  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  1.1 percent earlier
as investors awaited the North’s announcement.  “The market is now reflecting its original momentum, based
on Bernanke’s comments, as the North’s announcement turned out
to be nothing significant” for financial investors, said Yun Se
Min, a Seoul-based currency trader for Busan Bank.  The won appreciated 0.5 percent to 1,138.21 per dollar as
of 12:33 p.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 1,137.80, the strongest level since July 6. The
currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, slid 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 7.48 percent.  The  Kospi index  traded 0.6 percent lower at 1,811.14. South
Korean defense stocks, which jumped ahead of the announcement,
reversed gains.  Huneed Technologies (005870) , a military communications
equipment maker, fell 2.3 percent, after rising as much as 10
percent earlier, while  Speco Co. (013810)  dropped 0.7 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 slid one basis point to 2.90 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. That’s the lowest for a benchmark three year  note 
since December 2010. Three-year debt futures advanced 0.10 to
105.94 and the one-year interest-rate swap slid three basis
points to 2.91 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
