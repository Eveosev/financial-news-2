Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the advisory firm
founded by Robert Greenhill, reported a 90 percent plunge in
second-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates as
advisory revenue fell by almost half.  Net income dropped to $2.2 million, or 7 cents a share,
from $21.5 million, or 69 cents, a year earlier, the New York-
based company said today in a statement. The average  estimate  of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of 25 cents.  Deals announced worldwide fell 22 percent in the first six
months to $983.8 billion from $1.26 trillion in the same period
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chief
Executive Officer Scott Bok has said market volatility and
uncertainty made it difficult for management to focus on long-
term opportunities, delaying deal announcements.  “The second quarter was obviously a slow one, both for the
entire transaction market and for us,” Bok, 53, said today on a
conference call. “We had very few significant transactions
close in the period and also had fewer non-public assignments
come to fruition.”  Advisory revenue in the second quarter declined 47 percent
to $45.1 million from the year-earlier period. Total revenue
fell 48 percent to $47.3 million.  There has been “significant improvement” in revenue from
European clients, Bok said on the call without offering details.
For the full year, advisory revenue could be similar to or
better than last year, he said.  The firm set aside $28.4 million, or 60 percent of revenue,
for compensation expense in the second quarter, compared with
$41.8 million, or 46 percent, a year earlier.  Greenhill currently has 68 managing directors who work
directly with clients, Bok said. By year-end, headcount is
expected to increase by 5 percent, Chief Financial Officer
Christopher Grubb said today on the call.  Greenhill declined 0.5 percent to close at $37.69 in  New
York . The firm’s shares have climbed 3.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
