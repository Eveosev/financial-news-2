Brazil’s government is studying
requests by  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  to increase fuel prices for a
third time this year and raise the ethanol content in gasoline,
said Energy Minister Edison Lobao.  An increase in ethanol levels to 25 percent from 20 percent
probably won’t happen this year, Lobao told reporters today in
Brasilia.  Petrobras, as the state-owned  oil company  is known, wants
to stem losses from fuel imports using cheaper sugarcane-based
ethanol.  “There isn’t any indication yet that the ethanol stored is
enough to meet the additional demand,” Lobao said. “We have to
meet with producers and the finance and agriculture ministries
to analyze it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
