German financial markets regulator
Bafin has yet to reach a deal with  RHJ International (RHJI)  on approval
for the Belgian company’s planned purchase of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s
BHF-Bank unit, said Sven Gebauer, a Bafin spokesman.  RHJ said in June that its Kleinwort Benson Group unit has
the support of co-investors for the deal and had entered an
informal review process with Bonn-based Bafin as it seeks to add
assets in the financial services industry.  Deutsche Bank has sought a buyer for BHF, which offers
wealth management and investment banking, since acquiring it
through the purchase of Sal. Oppenheim Group in 2010.  Bafin’s approval is essential for RHJ to acquire the
business as Deutsche Bank’s plan to sell to LGT Group last year
failed after the regulator voiced concern about the acquisition
by the bank owned by the family of Liechtenstein’s prince.  To contact the reporter on this story:
