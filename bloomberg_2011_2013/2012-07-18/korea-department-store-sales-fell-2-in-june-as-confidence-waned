Sales at major South Korean
department stores fell last month as concern mounted that
Europeâ€™s debt crisis will stifle global growth, damping consumer
sentiment.  Outlays at the three biggest chains declined 2 percent in
June from a year earlier after a 1 percent gain in May, the
Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.
 Discount-store sales  dropped 7.2 percent last month, the report
showed.  The Bank of Korea last week trimmed its outlook for 2012
growth for the second time this year, citing a protracted crisis
in Europe for reducing the estimate to 3 percent from 3.5
percent.  Consumer confidence  dropped to a three-month low in
June, according to a central bank report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
