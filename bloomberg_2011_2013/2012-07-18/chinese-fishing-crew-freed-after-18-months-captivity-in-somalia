China  secured the release of a 26-
man crew aboard a Taiwanese fishing boat that was captured by
Somali pirates more than 18 months ago, the Foreign Ministry
said.  The crew of 13 Chinese, 12 Vietnamese and one from Taiwan
was rescued yesterday and taken to Tanzania by Chinese naval
vessels on patrol in the  Gulf of Aden , the ministry said
yesterday in a statement on its website.  The statement didnâ€™t give details of the rescue operation
or say if a ransom was paid for the ship, which was captured in
December 2010. China has deployed warships to help international
efforts to protect sea lanes from pirates off the Somali coast.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
