Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile USA
unit moved jobs to other countries as it cut local call-center
employees, the U.S. Labor Department said, contradicting claims
by the company.  “The workers’ firm has acquired from a foreign country
services like or directly competitive with services supplied by
the workers which contributed importantly to worker group
separations at T-Mobile USA,” the authority said in a decision
posted on its  website . Based on that conclusion, it determined
the workers were entitled to apply for government assistance.  T-Mobile USA shuttered seven out of 24 call centers and cut
1,900 jobs to reduce costs amid a shrinking client base after
the failure of a proposed $39 billion sale to  AT&T Inc. (T)  last
year. In May, it said it would cut another 900 jobs. Deutsche
Telekom Chief Executive Officer  Rene Obermann  is currently
seeking a new chief for the unit after Philipp Humm left the
carrier last month to join rival  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  in Europe.  The division was “surprised” by the Labor Department’s
decision “because the facts provided did not support that the
work done by these employees was sent offshore,” it said in a
statement sent by David Henderson, a spokesman. The company
“has long had and does utilize service partners both within the
U.S. and in other countries,” it said.  Deutsche Telekom, based in Bonn, has explored options to
combine the U.S. unit with local rivals, including  MetroPCS
Communications Inc. (PCS) , people familiar with the situation have
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
