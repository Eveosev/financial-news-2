Oscar-winning film director  Danny
Boyle  has had to cut segments of his 27 million-pound ($42
million) opening ceremony for the  London  Olympics because of
public-transport concerns.  The “Slumdog Millionaire” director has been told to trim
his Olympic opening as event organizers want to prevent the
80,000 crowd being stranded. London’s subway network will stay
open until an extended time of 2:30 a.m. after the July 27
ceremony, which is due to end by 12:30 a.m.  “Currently it’s running slightly over, so we need to make
sure it fits within slots that we always said it would,” London
2012 communications director Jackie Brock-Doyle told reporters
at the Olympic Park today.  Boyle has cut a three-minute segment involving stunt bikes
and has been asked to “tighten” the transition between
sequences during the three-hour opening to the summer games, she
said.  “He’s an award-winning filmmaker. If things end up on the
cutting room floor I think he understands that,” Brock-Doyle
added.  As much as 30 minutes may be cut from the show, the
Guardian reported.  About 10,000 crew members including volunteers from the
local community are part of the opening ceremony. They’ve been
told by organizers not to reveal details of the show. A final
rehearsal inside the stadium takes place two days before the
games start.  To contact the reporter on this story:
