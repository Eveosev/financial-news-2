Record low Czech bond yields are
prompting the  Finance Ministry  to consider raising funding for
2013 as early as in September to help cushion the eastern
European Union nation from the euro-region’s debt crisis.  The country raised 6 billion koruna ($292 million) of debt
due in 2021 and 2017 yesterday as investors bid for almost three
times the amount sold, central bank data show. The average
accepted yield on the 2021 notes fell to a record-low 2.316
percent from 3.109 percent in June.  “In view of the uncertain developments in other countries,
we significantly front-loaded financing in the first half, and
in the rest of the year we’ll have to consider whether we should
use such favorable rates to increase pre-financing for 2013,”
Petr Pavelek, head of the ministry’s debt-management department
in  Prague , said in a telephone interview after the auction.  Koruna bonds are headed for their best monthly rally since
August last year, helped by the July 17 decision by Moody’s
Investors Service to affirm the country’s credit rating at the
fifth-highest level of A1, four steps above  Italy  and five above
 Spain . Moody’s cited the government’s “continued austerity
measures.” Rising demand from bondholders helped the country
meet about 75 percent of its 2012 borrowing plans before
yesterday’s auction, according to the Finance Ministry.  Higher Returns  Investors are turning to emerging-market debt for higher
returns after the EU’s financial crisis and concern that the
global economy will slow sent government yields to record lows
from the U.S. and  Canada  to Germany and  France . The  European
Central Bank  reduced its benchmark rate to a low of 0.75 percent
and the deposit rate to zero on July 5 to rejuvenate the
region’s economic growth.  “Investors leaving troubled countries don’t want to
deposit with zero interest at the ECB, and therefore are looking
for yield with reasonable risk,”  Jan Vejmelek , chief economist
at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , Societe Generale SA’s Prague-based unit,
said by phone yesterday. “We can see strong demand for
Scandinavian, Polish and Czech bonds. Foreign investors also
appreciate the Czech government’s low indebtedness.”  Public debt in the  Czech Republic  represents 44 percent of
gross domestic product, below Poland at 55 percent and the euro
area average of 92 percent, according to European Commission
estimates for 2012 from May 11.  Low Yields  Czech bonds are cheaper to insure with credit-default swaps
than notes from Aaa-rated France, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. Improving perceptions of creditworthiness cut the cost of
Czech swaps 45 basis points this year to 129 today by 3:04 p.m.
in Prague, compared with 166 for France. The swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or cash
equivalent if the issuer fails to comply with debt agreements.  To  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , Czech local-currency
debt has gotten too expensive after the rally. The Austrian bank
cut koruna bonds due in five years or more to sell from neutral
on July 13, saying in a report the yields were “very low.”  Czech bonds fell today after CTK newswire reported that the
government plans to cut the  budget deficit  at a slower pace than
originally planned. The gap this year will be 3.2 percent of GDP
instead of the previous estimate of 3 percent, CTK said, citing
documents from a cabinet meeting today.  Safe Haven  The lower house of parliament approved higher taxes on July
13, a part of Prime Minister Petr Necas’s effort to cut the
deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2013. Czech bond yields have
fallen this year because investors view the country as a
regional “safe haven,” Moody’s said in an e-mailed report.  “Contagion from the  European debt crisis  will be
contained,” the ratings company said. “The sovereign’s key
credit strengths serve as powerful buffers that insulate its
credit profile from shocks that could otherwise undermine
creditworthiness.”  Demand for Czech debt increased after the government curbed
borrowing for the rest of the year, according to Pavelek. The
amount sold yesterday at July’s only bond offering compares with
13.8 billion koruna investors bought in two auctions last month.  The country will meet its full 2012 funding target in
September or October and use auctions in the rest of the year to
help cover next year’s deficit, Pavelek said. The final amount
the government will raise for 2013 will be decided “at the end
of the summer,” he said.  ‘Large Demand’  Yesterday’s sale attracted “large demand from abroad,”
with dealers based outside the country buying about 80 percent
of the 3 billion koruna of the 2021 securities, according to
Pavelek. The share of koruna-denominated  government bonds  held
by non-residents rose to 12.8 percent in June, the highest this
year, from 10.2 percent as of May 31, Pavelek said.  Benchmark 10-year koruna yields rose today 10 basis points
to 2.52 percent after falling 60 basis points in the previous
nine days to the lowest level since Bloomberg began tracking the
generic data in 2000. The  premium  over German bunds rose to 129
basis points from an almost nine-month low of 121 yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The koruna weakened 0.2 percent to 25.330 per euro.  Necas’s cabinet yesterday survived a no-confidence vote in
parliament, its fourth since taking power in 2010, called by the
opposition over corruption allegations surrounding Finance
Minister Miroslav Kalousek.  “The ministry should take advantage of the favorable terms
to pre-finance for 2013,” said Komercni’s Vejmelek. “Borrowing
costs are at record lows largely as a result of external
factors, and it’s impossible to tell how long these will last or
how quickly the market mood may turn around again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
