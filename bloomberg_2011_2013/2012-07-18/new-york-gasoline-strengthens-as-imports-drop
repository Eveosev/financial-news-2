New York  gasoline strengthened after
imports of the fuel dropped to the lowest level in two months.  Gasoline shipments to the U.S. East Coast slipped 265,000
barrels a day to 596,000 barrels last week, the lowest level
since May 18, Energy Department data showed today. Regional
inventories of the fuel declined 1.24 million barrels to 52.2
million barrels.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in New York Harbor gained 0.25 cent to a discount of 4.88 cents
a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 12:03 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery rose 4.68 cents to $2.8406 a gallon.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) â€™s Pasadena refinery in Texas was
starting units yesterday, following a power failure that forced
the plant shut.  The 106,500 barrel-a-day refinery lost power at about 2:30
p.m. local time during a storm, Sophie Gates, a company
spokeswoman in Houston, said in a July 17 statement. All units
were shut as a result, she said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  held at 19.63 cents a gallon versus futures.  The same fuel in Chicago weakened 1 cent a gallon to a
discount of 22 cents a gallon. It is the lowest level since
April 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
