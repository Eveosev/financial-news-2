Lithuanian consumer prices,
calculated in accordance with European Union standards, will
probably drop 0.2 percent from the previous month in July
because of seasonal discounts on clothes and shoes, the
 statistics office  said.  Prices will probably advance 2.7 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 2.6 percent increase in June, the
office, based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
