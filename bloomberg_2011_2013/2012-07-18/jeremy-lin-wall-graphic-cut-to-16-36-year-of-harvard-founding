While keeping Jeremy Lin was too
expensive for the New York Knicks, fans of the Harvard
University-educated point guard can get his life-size wall
graphic on the cheap.  Fathead LLC cut the price of its Knicks Lin product to
$16.36 from $99.99 the day after New York opted against matching
the Houston Rockets’ three-year, $25 million contract to the 23-
year-old player.  The price is meant to reflect the year that Harvard, in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, was established, said Abby Pougnet, a
spokeswoman for the company controlled by Cleveland Cavaliers
owner  Dan Gilbert .  The Fathead website bills the graphic as “today’s big
deal.”  Pougnet said five of the six Lin-Knicks graphics are sold
out, and those remaining are “going out quickly now.”  After  LeBron James  left the Cavaliers for the  Miami Heat ,
Fathead reduced the price of his wall graphic to $17.41, echoing
the year of Benedict Arnold’s birth. Gilbert had called James’s
decision an act of cowardly betrayal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
