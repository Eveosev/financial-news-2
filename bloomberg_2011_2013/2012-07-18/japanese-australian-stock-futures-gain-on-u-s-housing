Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  rose after U.S. housing starts jumped to the highest
level in almost four years, boosting the earnings outlook for
Asian exporters. Gains in Japanese shares may be limited as the
yen advanced against most of its counterparts.  American depositary receipts of machinery maker  Komatsu
Ltd. (6301) , which depends on the Americas for 23 percent of its sales,
gained 0.7 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs
of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s biggest oil producer,
increased 1.3 percent as crude prices exceeded $90 a barrel for
the first time since May. Those of Mizuho Financial Group Inc.
fell 0.6 percent after the lender agreed to pay $128 million to
settle U.S. regulatory claims it inflated credit ratings of a
financial product tied to subprime mortgages.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 8,775 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,740 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,790 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.9 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.5 percent in Wellington.  “The  U.S. economy  has gone through a bit of soft patch,
but the housing sector does seem to be heading for recovery,
which is positive from a longer-term perspective for America,”
said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment strategy at
AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under
management. “The market still likes what it sees.”  Housing Starts  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The index advanced 0.7 percent in New York yesterday,
when the Commerce Department reported that housing starts jumped
6.9 percent last month to a 760,000 annual pace, the highest
since October 2008.  The  Federal Reserve  said in a survey based on reports from
its 12 district banks that the economy expanded at a “modest to
moderate” pace in June and early July. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday told Congress that the Fed can limit
inflation while providing record stimulus.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 1.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 9.2 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 5.9 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.8 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.2 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Yen Gains  The yen gained against 14 of its 16 major counterparts
yesterday, when Japan’s Topix Index fell for a ninth day, the
longest losing streak since July 2009. A stronger yen cuts the
value of earnings at Japanese exporters when repatriated.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in New York dropped 0.2 percent to 84.73.  Oil advanced for a sixth day as U.S. gasoline inventories
fell. Oil for August delivery increased 65 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $89.87 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price ranged from $88.59 to $90.04, the highest
intraday level since May 30.
By Joshua Gallu  Mizuho Financial Group, Japan’s third-biggest bank, agreed
to pay $128 million to settle U.S. regulatory claims that it
used “dummy assets” to inflate the credit ratings of a
financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the housing
market deteriorated in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
