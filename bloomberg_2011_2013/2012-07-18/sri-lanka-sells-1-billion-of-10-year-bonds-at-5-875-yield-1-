Sri Lanka  sold $1 billion of 10-year
dollar-denominated bonds at record-low yields in the country’s
fourth global offering since the end of a three-decade civil war
in May 2009.  The government sold the securities maturing in July 2022 at
5.875 percent, a premium of 437 basis points, or 4.37 percentage
points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s lower than the initial guidance of
6.125 percent and the 6.25 percent in a sale of similar-dated
debt a year ago.  President Mahinda Rajapaksa is raising cash to build roads,
ports and power plants to help boost  growth  after the $59
billion economy expanded in the first quarter at the slowest
pace in two years. The bonds attracted $10.5 billion of
subscriptions, the “largest order book as well as the largest
number of investors in the order book for Sri Lanka ever,” with
fund managers accounting for 90 percent, according to central
bank statement issued today.  “The response to the bond shows the confidence in post-war
Sri Lanka, despite weaker overall global sentiment,” said
Bimanee Meepagala, a Colombo-based analyst at NDB Aviva Wealth
Management Ltd., the country’s largest private fund. “It should
draw further foreign inflows that will help the Sri Lankan rupee,
inflation and the trade account stabilize.”  ‘Improved Confidence’  The latest offering may allow the treasury to repay
costlier debt as $500 million of bonds with an 8.25 percent
coupon issued in 2007 mature in October. The South Asian nation
previously sold $1 billion of 10-year notes in July 2011 at a
332 basis-point spread over Treasuries.  The new securities were quoted to yield between 5.69
percent and 5.74 percent as of 11:10 a.m. in  Singapore ,
according to prices from ING Groep NV and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc.  “The tighter yield reflects improved confidence that
international investors have placed in the sovereign bond
issuance of Sri Lanka,” according to the central bank’s
statement. “With this transaction Sri Lanka succeeded in
achieving a cost of funds which is progressively lower compared
to the previous issuances.”  U.S. Investors Dominate  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
HSBC Holdings Plc arranged the latest sale. The notes are rated
B+ by Standard & Poor’s and B1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
four levels below investment grade. U.S.-based investors
accounted for 44 percent of the orders, Europe 29 percent and
Asia 27 percent, according to the  Central Bank of Sri Lanka .  The president devalued the rupee in November and adopted a
more flexible floating  exchange rate  in February, driving the
currency to a record low of 134.30 per dollar on June 28.  Policy makers also raised interest  rates  in February and
April, the first increases since 2007, to restrain consumer
prices and curb spending. Inflation quickened to 9.3 percent in
June, a 14-month high and the fastest pace after Pakistan and
 India  in a basket of 17 Asia-Pacific economies tracked by
Bloomberg.  A persistent  trade gap  has also eroded the nation’s
foreign-exchange reserves to $5.82 billion in May from an all-
time high of $8.1 billion in July 2011, according to central
bank data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
