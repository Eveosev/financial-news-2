Britain for the first time granted
an option to store carbon dioxide under the seabed, allowing a
project owned by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  SSE Plc (SSE)  in Scotland
to progress.  The Crown Estate, which manages the seabed on behalf of the
monarchy, said in a  statement  it agreed to lease a storage area
in the depleted Goldeneye gas field in the North Sea to Shell
and SSE. The two companies are proposing to add a carbon capture
and storage facility to an existing power plant at Peterhead
north of Aberdeen.  Peterhead is competing for 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion)
of funding in a government competition that aims to spur CCS
projects, putting the U.K. on track to cut emissions in half by
2027 and strip carbon out of the electricity generation
industry.  Alstom SA (ALO)  and  Drax Group Plc (DRX)  are also competing for
the funds.  “This is the first agreement of its kind in the U.K. and
will be essential to progressing the Peterhead carbon capture
and storage project,” Shell said today in an e-mailed
statement. The deal follows 18 months of negotiations, the
company said.  Neither the  Crown Estate  nor Shell disclosed the value of
the deal. The Crown Estate owns the storage rights for the U.K.
continental shelf. Earlier this year it started a program to
award the agreements for lease, which are time-limited options
for storage that allow project developers to advance their
plans.  The estate said at least seven requests for such options
have been made public, and it expects to grant more starting
this summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
