Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds fell
amid speculation the central bank will lower  interest rates  this
year to buoy growth in the Andean nation.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 6.80 percent, according to the central bank. The
bond’s price rose 0.242 centavo to 125.688 centavos per peso.  Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe reiterated yesterday
the bank will probably lower and narrow the range of its
forecast for 2012 Colombian growth from the current projection
of 4 percent to 6 percent. The upper limit of the current range
is no longer “reasonable,” he told reporters.  Speculation there will be a rate cut mounted after minutes
of the central bank’s most recent meeting, released July 13,
showed more than one member of the seven-member board voted for
a quarter-point interest rate reduction last month and wanted
the bank to begin a “relaxation phase.” Banco de la Republica
held the  overnight lending rate  at 5.25 percent for a fourth
straight month on June 29 as growth cooled and prices of the
country’s commodity exports dropped. The next monetary policy
meeting is scheduled for July 27.  Colombia sold its new inflation-linked peso bond due March
2021 to yield 3.59 percent at a government auction today, the
 Finance Ministry  said. Investor demand for the 3.5 percent
inflation-linked securities, known as TES UVR, totaled 884
billion pesos ($498 million), compared to the 400 billion pesos
offered, the ministry said in a statement.  The peso erased an earlier decline, gaining 0.2 percent to
1,776.23 per dollar. It’s up 9.1 percent this year, the best
performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
