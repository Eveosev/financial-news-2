A  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  real estate
fund agreed to buy a portfolio of neighborhood retail centers in
seven U.S. states from  Regency Centers Corp. (REG)  for $321 million.  The 15 properties will be bought by an affiliate of
Blackstone Real Estate Partners VII in a transaction that’s
scheduled for completion July 25, Regency said today in a
statement. The shopping centers, located in California, Florida,
Illinois,  North Carolina , Ohio, Tennessee and Texas, are 90
percent leased, according to the Jacksonville, Florida-based
landlord.  Blackstone, based in New York, is adding retail properties
as rents and occupancies rise. Shopping-center vacancies dropped
to 10.8 percent in the three months ended June 30, down from 11
percent a year earlier and their second consecutive decline,
according to  Reis Inc. (REIS)  Effective rents, or what’s paid after any
landlord discounts, averaged $16.55 a square foot, up from
$16.49 a year earlier, the data provider said.  Regency plans to use proceeds from the sale to invest in
“dominant, grocery-anchored shopping centers located in target
markets with excellent prospects for growth,” Chief Executive
Officer Hap Stein said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
