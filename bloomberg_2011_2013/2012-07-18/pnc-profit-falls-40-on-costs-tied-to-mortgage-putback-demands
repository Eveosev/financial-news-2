PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the seventh-largest  U.S. bank  by deposits, said second-quarter
profit declined 40 percent on costs tied to mortgage-putback
demands.  Net income fell to $546 million, or 98 cents a share, from
$912 million, or $1.67, a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based
bank said today in a statement. Per-share earnings excluding
one-time items other than the mortgage costs were $1.20, two
cents less than the $1.22 average estimate of 22 analysts
 surveyed  by Bloomberg.  PNC, led by Chief Executive Officer Jim Rohr, 63, said
earnings were reduced by a $438 million pretax provision related
to the residential-mortgage repurchase demands. The company said
last month it would boost reserves by $350 million for that
purpose. PNC is facing increased claims related to loans sold to
government-sponsored enterprises as a result of the National
City Corp. acquisition in 2009, the company said.  “While we experienced a few items that reduced our
earnings in the short term, we were very pleased with our
success in continuing to grow customer relationships and loans
resulting in strong revenue,” Rohr said in the statement.  The company said it expects so-called putback demands from
government-sponsored entities to increase for loans sold in 2006
through 2008.  PNC, which gained 6.8 percent this year through yesterday
in  New York  trading, fell 1 percent to $60.97 at 9:54 a.m.  Revenue increased 1 percent to $3.62 billion, including a
17 percent climb in net interest income to $2.53 billion.  Revenue Guidance  Revenue percentage gains this year will be in the “high
single digits,” Chief Financial Officer Richard Johnson said
after the company released first-quarter earnings on April 18.  PNC’s residential-mortgage business posted a loss of $213
million on provisions for the repurchase demands.  “PNC has and expects to experience elevated levels of
residential mortgage-loan repurchase demands reflecting a change
in behavior and demand patterns of two government-sponsored
enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC, primarily related to loans sold in
2006 through 2008 in agency securitizations,” the company said
in the statement, referring to  Freddie Mac  and  Fannie Mae .  In addition to the mortgage provision, the company also had
a non-cash charge of $85 million, or 16 cents a share, from the
redemption of trust-preferred securities.  RBC Bank  Integration costs were 6 cents a share, the company said.  PNC paid about $3.47 billion for Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC
Bank USA and its related credit-card assets, a transaction that
was completed in March. The purchase is expected to add 40 cents
to earnings per share for the full year, excluding integration
costs, Johnson said in April.  Provisions for credit losses rose to $256 million from $185
million in the first quarter and compared with $280 million a
year earlier.  Total loans jumped 20 percent to $180.4 billion, led by
commercial lending.  The net interest margin, the difference between what PNC
pays on deposits and makes on loans, widened to 4.08 percent
from 3.90 percent in the first quarter and 3.93 percent a year
earlier.  The bank’s PNC Bank unit agreed last month to pay $90
million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of improperly
manipulating customers’ debit-card transactions to generate
excess overdraft fees, lawyers for the plaintiffs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
