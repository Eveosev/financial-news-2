Oil advanced for a sixth day,
exceeding $90 a barrel for the first time since May, as U.S.
housing starts increased more than forecast and gasoline
inventories fell.  Prices rose after the Commerce Department reported  housing
construction  reached a 760,000 annual pace in June. Gasoline
stockpiles declined 1.82 million barrels last week, the Energy
Department reported. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a
gain of 1.2 million.  “It’s a confirmation that the housing market has bottomed
out and it raises hopes for a good second half and better oil
demand,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The inventory
report is moderately bullish with the decline in gasoline
inventories.”  Oil for August delivery increased 65 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $89.87 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price ranged from $88.59 to $90.04, the highest
intraday level since May 30. Prices are down 9.1 percent this
year.  Brent crude  for September settlement gained $1.16, or 1.1
percent, to $105.16 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Oil moved up with equities after  housing starts  advanced
6.9 percent last month, beating the median forecast of 79
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The June pace of home starts
was the fastest since October 2008. The Commerce Department also
revised the May data upward to an annual rate of 711,000.  ‘Mildly Supportive’  “When you get one of the best numbers since 2008, it’s
certainly going to be mildly supportive,” said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. “The decline in gasoline in the inventory
report helped to support prices.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced for a second day,
rising 0.6 percent at 3:13 p.m. The S&P’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities increased 1.1 percent.  “The housing data was strong and is helping the oil
market,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “Oil is moving in tandem
with stocks.”  The decline in gasoline stockpiles, to 205.9 million
barrels, was the first in five weeks. Inventories are below the
10-year  seasonal average .  Refineries reduced their utilization rate to 92 percent
from the previous week’s 92.7 percent, the highest level in five
years, the Energy Department report showed.  Gasoline Demand  Demand for gasoline slid 3.2 percent to 8.63 million
barrels a day. Total petroleum consumption increased 0.3 percent
to 18.6 million barrels a day.  Crude inventories dropped 809,000 barrels to 377.4 million,
less than the decline of 1.3 million that was the median
forecast of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Distillates rose
2.62 million barrels to 123.5 million, exceeding a forecast gain
of 1.3 million.  “This is a temporary spike,” said Todd Horwitz, chief
strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in  New York . “We still
have plenty of oil and I still think the long-term trend is
lower.”  Technical indicators also supported crude, which exceeded
the 20-day moving average June 29 for the first time since May 2
and topped the 50-day moving average for a third day.  “From a technical standpoint, oil has triggered a level
that a lot of people have been looking at,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and founder of Iitrader.com
in  Chicago . “The $90 level is bullish.”  Futures fell earlier as the euro neared a two-year low
against the dollar, with analysts cutting European profit
estimates and growth in  China  slowing for a sixth quarter. A
stronger dollar and weaker euro reduce oil’s appeal as an
investment alternative.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 485,562
contracts as of 3:13 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 615,802
contracts yesterday, 10 percent above the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
