Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , the Nordic region’s
largest lender, said second-quarter profit jumped 17 percent
after interest income increased in  Sweden ,  Norway ,  Finland  and
 Denmark  and beat estimates on higher trading earnings.  Net income rose to 820 million euros ($1 billion) from 698
million euros a year earlier, the Stockholm-based bank said in a
statement. That beat the 722 million-euro average estimate of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net interest income, the
difference between what it makes from lending and pays for
deposits, increased 10 percent to 1.46 billion euros, the
company said.  Sweden’s banks have largely steered clear of the  European
debt crisis  and their balance sheets aren’t weighed down by
assets linked to the region’s most indebted nations, giving them
better access to funding than many European peers and allowing
them to increase lending to their Nordic clients. Nordea’s loans
to the public increased 8 percent in the year through June.  “We maintained good business momentum and increased return
on equity despite continued pressure on  interest rates ,
financial turmoil and the slowdown in European economic
activity,” Chief Executive Officer  Christian Clausen  said.  Nordea rose  as much as 1.95 kronor, or 3.2 percent, to
62.55 kronor in Stockholm trading, its highest intraday price
since March 22. The stock was up 2.9 percent at 62.35 kronor at
10:34 a.m. local time. Nordea has gained 17 percent this year,
making it the eighth-best performer on the 38-company Bloomberg
Europe Banks and Financial Services Index, which has risen 0.2
percent.  Trading Income  “Nordea reported second-quarter 2012 pretax profit 13
percent ahead of consensus, driven by better than expected
trading income and lower loan losses,” Claire Kane and Fiona Swaffield, analysts at  RBC Capital Markets  in  London , wrote in a
note to clients today. “Loan losses are stable versus the first
quarter 2012, with a flat loan loss ratio of 26 basis points.”  Trading income at Nordea advanced 39 percent to 494 million
euros in the second quarter, while net credit losses increased
84 percent from a year earlier to 217 million euros, the Swedish
lender said.  Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA) , Sweden’s No. 2 lender, also saw a
rise in second-quarter profit amid rising business volumes and
higher interest income. Stockholm-based Handelsbanken’s profit
rose to 3.41 billion kronor ($489 million) in the three months
through June, from 3.14 billion kronor a year earlier as net
interest income jumped 16 percent to 6.58 billion kronor.  Tougher Rules  Sweden, whose bank industry is four times the size of the
economy, is pushing through tougher capital rules than
elsewhere, requiring its lenders to target 10 percent core Tier
1 buffers of their risk-weighted assets from January and 12
percent from 2015. That compares with the Basel Committee’s core
capital target of at least 7 percent, while the European Banking
Authority has set a temporary 9 percent target for some banks.  Nordea had a core Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.8 percent,
excluding so-called transition rules to new regulation, at the
end of the second quarter, the Swedish lender said. Nordea’s
return on equity stood at 12.1 percent at the end of June,
beating the estimate of 10.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
