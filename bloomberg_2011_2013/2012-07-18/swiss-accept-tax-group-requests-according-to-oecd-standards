Switzerland  is implementing
legislation that will allow so-called group requests in cases of
suspected tax offenses, a government spokesman said.  “The parliament’s upper house already approved the draft,
and the lower house is expected to decide during the next
session in September,” Mario Tuor, a spokesman for the State
Secretariat for International Financial Matters in the Swiss
capital Bern, said today in a phone interview.  The Swiss government today  said  it endorsed a decision by
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to
include group requests in its so-called Model Convention on tax
administrative assistance. The backing is part of the country’s
efforts to rid itself of an image as a safe haven for untaxed
assets.  Switzerland, where about 27 percent of all offshore wealth
is managed, has signed accords with  Germany  and the U.K.
involving a one-time payment on previously undeclared funds and
a withholding tax on future  capital gains  and investment income.  The Swiss government so far has struck about 25 double-
taxation agreements with other countries allowing administrative
assistance in individual cases of suspected tax fraud or tax
evasion. The new law will extend these accords to so-called
group requests whereby the people must be identified through
specific search criteria, Tuor said.  The only tax agreement already including group requests is
the one between Switzerland and the U.S. which still needs
approval by the Senate in Washington D.C.  To contact the reporter on this story:
