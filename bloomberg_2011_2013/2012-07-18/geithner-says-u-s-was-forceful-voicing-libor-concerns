Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the U.S. was “very forceful from the beginning”
in expressing concerns about manipulation of the London
interbank offered rate.  “We acted very early in response to concerns that the
process that set this rate was impaired and flawed, and
vulnerable to misrepresentation,” Geithner said at a conference
in  New York  today. Geithner said he briefed U.S. financial
regulators and wrote “a detailed set of recommendations” to
British regulators.  Regulators in both the U.S. and U.K. defended their
reaction to the manipulation of Libor, the global benchmark for
$500 trillion of securities, after Barclays Plc was fined a
record 290 million pounds ($453 million) for rigging borrowing
costs.  The New York Fed last week released documents showing it
knew Barclays underreported rates and that Geithner, then the
president of the regional Fed bank, sent a memo in June 2008 to
 Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  recommending changes to how
Libor was calculated.  Geithner was speaking at the CNBC Institutional Investor
Delivering Alpha Conference.  To contact the reporters on this story:
