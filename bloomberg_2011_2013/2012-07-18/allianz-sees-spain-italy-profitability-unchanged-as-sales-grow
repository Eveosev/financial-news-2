Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest
insurer, expects sales to keep increasing in Spain and  Italy 
while profitability in both countries remains unchanged,
according to Chief Financial Officer Oliver Baete.  “Spain is in a very difficult situation but we are
outperforming our competitors both in growth and efficiency,”
Baete said today as the Munich-based company made presentations
to investors in Milan.  Giacomo Campora, chief executive officer of Allianz’s
Italian banking unit, said the country’s life-insurance buyers
are seeking “safe harbors” and the company’s local sales
strategy is paying off.  Italy accounted for 10 percent of Allianz’s operating
profit and revenue in 2011, the company said. Allianz, which
opened its first Italian branch in 1966, has reduced its
holdings of southern European  government bonds  as the sovereign-
debt crisis has worsened.  The company said today that unrealized sovereign-debt
losses at the end of the first quarter totaled 1.16 billion
euros ($1.4 billion), of which 800 million euros was
attributable to Italian debt.  Revenue from Allianz’s Pacific Investment Management Co.
unit is helping offset the effect of low  interest rates  on the
company’s life-insurance business, Baete said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
