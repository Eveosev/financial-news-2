Shawn Atleo and five other
candidates are vying to lead  Canada ’s Assembly of First Nations
after no candidate won enough support in the first round of
voting to select the head of the country’s main native group.  Atleo, 45, the current national chief, leads after the
first ballot with 284 of 540 votes cast, said Loretta Lambert,
chief electoral officer of the assembly. Canada’s native leaders
are voting in Toronto today. The winning chief needs 60 percent
support.  To contact the reporter on this story:
