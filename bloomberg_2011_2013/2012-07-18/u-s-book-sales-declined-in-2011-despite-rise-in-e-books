The U.S. book market declined 2.5
percent in 2011 as sales of e-books, which are lower priced than
printed works, more than doubled within the category that
includes fiction and nonfiction.  Publishers generated $27.2 billion in book sales, down from
$27.9 billion in 2010, according  BookStats , an annual report
produced by the Association of American Publishers and the Book
Industry Study Group. Units sold rose 3.4 percent to 2.77
billion.  Sales of trade books -- that is, adult fiction, nonfiction,
children’s books and others -- were little changed at almost $14
billion. E-books in the category more than doubled to $2.07
billion, while print remained dominant, with $11.1 billion.  The industry has lost revenue because of the proliferation
of e-books, a niche led by  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  Seeking more control
over the pricing of digital editions, publishers have signed
deals with Apple Inc., allowing them to set prices. The  Justice
Department  said the publishers colluded with Apple in those
deals, and three publishers recently settled.  The children and young-adult category, which includes
popular series such as “The Hunger Games,” published by
 Scholastic Corp. (SCHL) , had the largest gain, growing 12 percent to
$2.78 billion, according to the report.  As the bankruptcy of Borders Group Inc. hurt sales, retail
outlets’ total fell 13 percent to $8.59 billion last year.
Stores remained the largest channel.  Online retail grew 35 percent to $5.04 billion. Revenue for
publishers selling directly to consumers through websites almost
doubled to $1.11 billion, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
