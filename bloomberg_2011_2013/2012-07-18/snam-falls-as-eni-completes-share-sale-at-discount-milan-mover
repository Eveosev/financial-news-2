Snam SpA (SRG)  fell the most in almost two
months in Milan after energy company  Eni SpA (ENI)  completed the sale
of 5 percent of Snam for 3.43 euros per share.  The price is a discount of about 3 percent to Snam’s
closing price of 3.53 euros yesterday. Eni raised 612.5 million
euros ($752 million) from the sale, the Rome-based company said
today.  Eni agreed to sell 30 percent of Snam at 3.47 euros a share
to state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA on May 30.  Snam fell as much as 4.7 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since May 21, and was down 3.6 percent as of 11:22 a.m. in
Milan, where the company is based. The stock has fallen 0.2
percent this year as Eni has sought buyers for its stake.  “The timing is surprising since the closing on the 30
percent stake to the CDP is expected by mid-October,” Stefano Gamberini, an analyst at Equita SIM SpA, wrote in a note today.
“The operation could put pressure on the stock that had a good
performance in the last few months.”  Investors have expressed interest in buying Eni’s remaining
stake in Snam, Eni Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  said
July 16. Sovereign and infrastructure funds are among the
interested parties, Scaroni said.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  forced the sale of Eni’s stake
in Snam to improve access to the country’s gas-pipeline network
and cut energy costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
