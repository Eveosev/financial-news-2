U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said he thinks the  tax rate  on carried interest might
need to be raised.  “If you look at any tax reform proposal out there that has
any patina of bipartisan support, they believe we have to
rethink how we treat investment income and carried interest,”
Geithner said at a conference in New York today.  Under current law, a manager’s profits from a private-
equity fund, known as carried interest, are considered  capital
gains  and therefore taxed at 15 percent.  “Obviously, carried interest doesn’t raise that much
revenue,” Geithner said. “If you’re not going to do that,
whose taxes are you going to raise?”  Geithner was speaking at the CNBC Institutional Investor
Delivering Alpha Conference.  To contact the reporters on this story:
