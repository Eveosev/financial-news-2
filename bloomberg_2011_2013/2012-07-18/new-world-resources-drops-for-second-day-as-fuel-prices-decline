New World Resources Plc (NWR)  declined for
a second day, headed for its lowest close this month, as fuel
prices retreated on concern that further economic weakness in
 China  will reduce demand.  The stock of the biggest Czech producer of coking coal fell
1.3 percent to 100.85 koruna by 11:36 a.m. in Prague. A close at
that level would be NWR’s lowest since June 28. The  PX (PX)  index, in
which NWR has a 3.6 percent weighting, slid 0.6 percent.  Oil declined in New York and emerging-market stocks fell
after China signaled more economic weakness and analysts cut
profit forecasts for European companies at the fastest rate
since 2009. Europe’s benchmark coal derivatives slid for the
first time in four days, falling 0.2 percent to $97.25 a metric
ton in the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
