The U.S. House Agriculture Committee
will hold a hearing next week to examine the collapse of
Peregrine Financial Group Inc., the futures broker with a $200
million shortfall in client funds.  “The futures and swaps markets must function with
confidence to allow end-users, farmers and ranchers to
effectively manage risk,” Representative Frank D. Lucas, an
Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the panel, said yesterday in
a statement announcing the July 25 hearing.  Peregrine is under investigation after Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Russell Wasendorf Sr. unsuccessfully attempted
suicide. The  National Futures Association  said the chairman may
have falsified bank records after only $5 million was found in
an account that was reported to have $225 million on or about
June 29. Wasendorf said in a signed statement linked to his
suicide attempt that he committed fraud for two decades at his
 Cedar Falls , Iowa-based company, according to a criminal
complaint.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Peregrine
over the shortfall on July 10, less than a year after being
scolded for poor oversight following the collapse of  MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) , which left an estimated $1.6 billion gap in
customer funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
