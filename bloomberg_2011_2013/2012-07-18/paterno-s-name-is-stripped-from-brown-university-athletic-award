Joe Paterno ’s alma mater,  Brown
University , has permanently stripped his name from an annual
athletics award after an investigation found Paterno and other
Penn State University officials concealed a child sexual abuse
scandal involving a former assistant football coach.  Brown’s award for outstanding male freshman athlete had
been renamed in 1993 to honor Paterno, who graduated from the
Ivy League school in 1950 and was inducted into its Athletic
Hall of Fame in 1977.  The award was presented earlier this year without Paterno’s
name and the school yesterday approved a decision to make the
change permanent. The announcement came five days after former
 Federal Bureau  of Investigation Director  Louis Freeh  said in a
report that Paterno and other top school officials covered up
Jerry Sandusky’s sexual abuse of children to protect the school
from “bad publicity.”  “In light of the outcome of the Sandusky trial and the
findings of the Freeh Report, the university has been reviewing
these tributes to take appropriate action,” Brown said in a
statement on its  website .  Brown officials also said Paterno’s place in the school’s
athletic Hall of Fame will be reviewed.  Penn State spokesman David La Torre said yesterday that the
school will make a decision in the next 7 to 10 days about
whether to remove an on-campus statue that honors Paterno.  To contact the reporter on this story:
