Jeremiah O. Norton, a U.S. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. director, said the government may have
saddled the financial industry with overly burdensome
regulations that don’t work well with each other.  “I’m not sure that we calibrated that right as a
government,” Norton said in remarks at his first public event
since starting the job in April. “It worries me that we’re not
seeing the whole picture as a government.”  Banks are experiencing a “profitability challenge,”
squeezed by “regulatory headwinds” from the 2010 Dodd-Frank
Act and Federal Reserve indications that  interest rates  will
stay low, Norton said today at a meeting of the Exchequer Club
in Washington.  Norton is a former  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  banker and deputy
assistant  Treasury secretary  who was sworn in as one of two
Republicans on the five-member FDIC. The other Republican is
 Thomas Hoenig , who is awaiting confirmation as the board’s vice
chairman and has drawn attention for pushing a return to Glass-
Steagall Act separations of banking functions. Norton declined
to comment on Hoenig’s proposals.  The bank regulator said today that working out the
international cooperation for his agency’s Dodd-Frank authority
to dismantle systemically significant firms is a “vital,
critical element.” He also said that so-called living wills
required from the big banks “could become a very expensive
exercise” if they don’t prove useful in helping regulators
dismantle large banks in case of bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
