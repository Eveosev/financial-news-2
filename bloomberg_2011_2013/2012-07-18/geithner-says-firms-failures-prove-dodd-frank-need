U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said risk-management failures at firms including
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  prove the importance of the Dodd-Frank
financial rules overhaul.  “We still have unfinished business,” Geithner said in
remarks prepared for a meeting of the Financial Stability
Oversight Council in Washington today. “Consider the failures
of MF Global and Peregrine Financial, the risk-management
failures at JPMorgan, the abuses surrounding Libor, or the
financial threats from Europe.”  Geithner is the chairman of the council, which was created
by Dodd-Frank to prevent another financial crisis. The panel
also includes Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, and the
chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Geithner said the council, in a closed session earlier
today, designated eight so-called financial market utilities,
such as clearinghouses and exchanges, as systemically important
to the financial system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
