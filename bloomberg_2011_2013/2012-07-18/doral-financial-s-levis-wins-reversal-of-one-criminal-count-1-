Mario “Sammy” Levis, a member of
the family that founded Puerto Rican bank-holding company  Doral
Financial Corp. (DRL) , won reversal of one of three criminal
convictions.  Levis, formerly Doral’s treasurer, was convicted in 2010 of
two counts of  wire fraud  and one count of securities fraud for
lying to investors about the value of mortgage-related
securities held by the company. He was sentenced to five years
in prison.  A federal appeals court in New York today threw out one of
the wire fraud charges, ruling that the trial judge should have
let Levis argue that Doral used a hedging strategy that he
reasonably believed limited Doral’s financial risks.  Prosecutors claimed Levis manipulated the value of
mortgage-related assets to inflate the price of  Doral stock . In
March 2005, the Levis family owned 8.2 percent of the company’s
shares, prosecutors said.  Doral, based in  San Juan , Puerto Rico, said in September
2005 that it would restate its finances to the end of 2004 and
cut shareholder equity by $720 million because of overvalued
assets. The company eventually paid $129 million to settle an
investor  lawsuit  and a $25 million fine to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  The case is U.S. v. Levis, 10-CR-4819, Second U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
