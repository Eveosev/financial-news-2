The cost of options to protect
against declines in  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  fell to near the
lowest level in a year before India’s second-largest company
reports earnings tomorrow amid speculation the shares already
reflect a slowdown in profit growth.  Implied volatility , the key gauge of options prices, for
30-day contracts closest to the Reliance stock price, was 21.73
at 4:28 p.m. in Mumbai, down 45 percent from this year’s high of
39.74, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s close to the
level of 21.70 reached on May 31, the lowest since June 2011.  Earnings for Reliance have  missed  analysts’ forecasts for
the last six quarters. That helped reduce the valuation for the
shares to 10.2 times profit in May, the lowest reading since
March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The stock has been battered too much because of falling
gas output and refining margins,” T.S. Harihar, co-head of
institutional derivatives at ICICI Securities Ltd., said by
telephone from Mumbai.  Reliance will  report  a net income of 43.85 billion rupees
($791 million) for the June quarter, compared with 56.6 billion
a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the most since the three
months ended in December.  Reliance shares have risen 5 percent this year, lagging the
12 percent gain in the benchmark BSE  India  Sensitive Index, as
the Mumbai-based company struggled to reverse a decline in
natural-gas output from India’s biggest field. Output at the
company’s KG-D6 deepwater block, which holds India’s largest
reserves, slumped 14 percent last quarter to 35 million cubic
meters a day, the company said in April.  Gas Production  Operating profit declined 5 percent to 228 billion rupees
in the year ended March 31, the first drop since 2003, as gas
production slid. Production peaked at about 60 million cubic
meters a day in June 2010 and has declined since then because of
technical difficulties, according to Reliance.  Oil-refining margins narrowed to $7.60 a barrel on average
in the March quarter from $9.20 a year earlier. The company’s
refining complex comprise two adjacent plants that can turn a
total 1.24 million barrels into fuels daily. Crude-processing
brought 70 percent of total revenue in the year ended March.  Reliance’s  shares  rose 1.7 percent to 727.8 rupees at the
close in Mumbai, ending two days of losses. The stock has the
second-highest weighting of 8.8 percent on the Sensex, which
gained 0.6 percent.  The India VIX, which gauges the cost of buying protection
against losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, slumped 6.1 percent
to 16.4, the lowest level in almost two years. The measure has
plunged 40 percent since May 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
