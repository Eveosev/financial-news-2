Iran’s economic difficulties are 20
percent the result of international sanctions, according to
Parliament Speaker  Ali Larijani , the  Iranian Students News
Agency  reported.  Larijani, who didn’t elaborate on the figure, said Iran’s
“main problem is economic,” the state-run  news agency 
reported, adding that he made the comments in a meeting with
clerics in Qom.  Iranian officials have hitherto played down and avoided
quantifying the effects of trade, financial and energy sanctions
imposed on the Persian Gulf country over its nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
