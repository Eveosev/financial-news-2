Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)  sold $731
million of bonds linked to automobile debt, 79 percent more than
it had planned, amid a surge in asset-backed bond issuance.  The  lender  paid 70 basis points more than the benchmark
swap rate on a top-ranked slice maturing in 2.89 years,
according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not
to be identified because terms aren’t public. The transaction,
backed by loans to dealerships, was initially marketed at $409.5
million, the person said.  Ally’s deal is part of about $6 billion in securities tied
to household and business borrowings being offered to investors
this week as rising vehicle sales fuel issuance, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc. boosted its 2012
asset-backed forecast by about 50 percent to $183 billion last
week, with sales linked to autos accounting for about 63 percent
of that, analysts led by Mary Kane said in a July 12 report.  U.S. auto sales for June beat analysts’ estimates,
accelerating to a 14.1 million seasonally adjusted annualized
rate, researcher Autodata Corp. said in a July 3 statement. The
pace exceeded the average 13.8 million light-vehicle estimate of
15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  yesterday boosted its sale of bonds backed
by auto loans to consumers to $1.6 billion from $1 billion, a
person familiar with that sale said. The Dearborn, Michigan-
based automaker paid 19 basis points more than the benchmark
swap rate on top-ranked securities maturing in 3.39 years. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Investors are lured to asset-backed bonds by short
durations and stable relative yields. Top-ranked securities tied
to auto debt are yielding 46 basis points more than Treasuries,
about the narrowest this year, according to a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch  index .  “The safe haven status of ABS will continue to be its best
quality,” Deutsche Bank analysts led by Harris Trifon said in a
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
