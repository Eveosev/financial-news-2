A political union in  Europe  that
allows for the joint issue of bonds is unrealistic, Claudia Buch, a member of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s council of economic
advisers, told  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung .  “Euro bonds in the framework of a political union, with
joint control and a surrendering of fiscal powers, would be
theoretically an alternative in the long term,” Buch told the
newspaper. “But this way seems politically unrealistic.”  Buch, an economist at the University of Tuebingen who
replaced Beatrice Weder di Mauro on the panel earlier this year,
promoted the debt-redemption fund as an alternative to European
Central Bank monetization of sovereign debt, FAZ said.  The fund, which would mutualize euro-area debt exceeding 60
percent of member states’ economic output in return for strict
conditions, would offer a temporary solution until the bloc
stabilize its finances, Buch told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
