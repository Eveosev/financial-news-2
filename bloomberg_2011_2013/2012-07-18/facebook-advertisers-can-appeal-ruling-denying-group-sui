Facebook Inc. (FB)  cost-per-click
advertisers won permission to appeal a ruling denying their bid
to proceed with a group lawsuit for alleged overcharges by the
world’s largest social-networking website.  A three-judge panel of a San Francisco-based federal
appeals court said yesterday the advertisers could seek review
of an April 13 lower-court ruling that they hadn’t shown their
claims have enough in common to justify certifying the case as a
class-action suit. The judges didn’t give a reason for their
decision.  Facebook was sued in 2009 over claims that advertisers,
charged based on the number of clicks or views they receive,
were wrongfully billed for nonexistent, fraudulent or invalid
clicks.  The plaintiffs are advertisers that contracted with  Menlo
Park , California-based Facebook through an automated self-
service process available to the general public. They sought to
represent all cost-per-click advertisers that paid Facebook from
May 2009 to the present.  Larry Yu, a Facebook spokesman, didn’t immediately reply to
an e-mail message seeking comment on the decision.  The lower-court case In Re Facebook PPC Advertising
Litigation, 4:09-cv-03043, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of  California  (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
