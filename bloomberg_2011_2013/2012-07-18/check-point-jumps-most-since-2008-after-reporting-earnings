Check Point  Software Technologies
Ltd., the world’s second-largest security networks maker, surged
the most in six months in New York as second-quarter sales met
estimates and after announcing a share buyback.  Check Point gained 7.5 percent to $49.06 at 1:30 p.m. in
New York, leading gains in the  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN) 
of the most-traded Israeli companies in the U.S. Shares of the
Tel Aviv-based company slumped 22 percent in the second quarter,
the worst three-month performance since 2004.  The company, which reported earnings of 71 cents per share,
plans to increase share repurchases by as much as $1 billion
over the next two years, according to a statement today. Second-
quarter revenue increased 9.3 percent to $328.7 million, about 1
percent shy of the $331.8 million mean estimate of 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Mounting concern a global economic
slowdown will reduce the technology company’s revenue sent
shares lower prior to the earnings report, FBR Capital Markets
said.  “Sentiment going into earnings on this name had been
Armageddon-like,”  Daniel Ives , an analyst at FBR, said by phone
from New York today. “They come through with numbers in line
with expectations, which is much better than feared given the
bear chatter. The share buyback is cherry on top of the
sundae.”  Check Point, which had about 204.8 million shares of common
stock outstanding as of June 30, has repurchased $2.2 billion of
shares since 2003,  the company  said in today’s statement. The
security networks-maker had $3.2 billion of cash and equivalents
as of June 30,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It’s just a way of enhancing  shareholder value  by
deploying their cash to benefit shareholders,” Ives said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
