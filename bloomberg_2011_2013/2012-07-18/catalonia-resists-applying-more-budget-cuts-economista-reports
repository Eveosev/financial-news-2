Spain ’s Catalonia region is
resisting applying more budget cuts to its radio and television
station even as Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  claimed an
additional 800 million euros ($983 million) in spending cuts to
cut the regional deficit to 1.5 percent,  El Economista  reported.  The region has also told the Spanish government it’s
impossible for Catalonia to carry out more budget cuts without
making more cuts in services such as education and health, the
newspaper reported today, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
