Russia had 16.8 million metric tons
of grain stockpiles as of July 1, 1.1 percent more than a year
earlier, the national statistics service known as Rosstat said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Russia sowed 44.9 million hectares (110 million acres) with
grain this year, 1.7 percent more than last year, according to
the statement. The area sowed with wheat shrank by 0.9 million
hectares or 3.6 percent, Rosstat said, without providing the
absolute figure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
