An African Development Bank-funded
water and sewage project has been inaugurated in Harar, the
first town in  Ethiopia  to get piped water and a UNESCO world
heritage site.  The town in southeastern Ethiopia got the country’s first
piped water supplies 110 years ago, then a decade ago water from
Lake Alemaya became insufficient due to irrigation, siltation
and rising population, the bank said.  With the lake’s existence itself in danger even with
restrictions on water use and rationing, the AfDB provided $33
million in funding for the Harar project that opened this month.
The source of water serving the project comes from 75 kilometers
(47 miles) away and involves four pumping stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
