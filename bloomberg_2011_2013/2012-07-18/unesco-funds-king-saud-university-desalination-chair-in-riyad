UNESCO funded a water desalination
research chair that will be based at King Saud University in the
desert kingdom of  Saudi Arabia .  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization funding of the chair in  Riyadh  will help officials
assess “long-term decisions involving capital necessary to
avert any shortage of water supply and resources,” the
university said in a statement.  Saudi Arabia, whose oilfields hold a fifth of the world’s
reserves, aims to use solar energy to desalinate seawater and
build nuclear reactors as it seeks to cut the amount of crude it
burns in generators for power and to increase water supplies.  Saudi Arabia has almost 30 desalination plants in which
salt and minerals are extracted from seawater and transported
through 2,500 miles of pipelines, according to Ziad Aldress,
Saudi’s ambassador to UNESCO, who said the new chair will help
boost the desalination industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
