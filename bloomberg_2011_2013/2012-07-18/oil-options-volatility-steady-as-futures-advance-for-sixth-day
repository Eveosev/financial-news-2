Oil options volatility was little
changed as underlying futures advanced for a sixth day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 32.1 percent at 4:10 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 32.4 percent yesterday.  Volatility has changed less than one percentage point since
July 12 as futures traded between $84.21 and $90.04.  The stagnant volatility indicates lowered expectations that
the  Federal Reserve  will institute a third round of quantitative
easing, or QE3, before the November presidential election, said
Vince Lanci, managing partner at Echobay Partners LLC, a
commodity investment firm in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  “Options participants are less likely to put on positions
as a result,” Lanci said. “Remember, this is implied
volatility and market perception of the future. It’s telling you
we’re going to be rangebound for awhile.”  Crude oil for September delivery rose 63 cents to settle at
