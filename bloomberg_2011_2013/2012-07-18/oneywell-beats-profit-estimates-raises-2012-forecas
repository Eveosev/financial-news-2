Honeywell International Inc. (HON) , a
maker of flight controls and thermostats, rose the most in more
than three years after reporting quarterly profit that beat
analysts’ estimates, driven by commercial aerospace sales.  The shares  advanced  6.7 percent to $58.18 at the close in
 New York , the biggest gain since April 2, 2009. Honeywell has
increased 7 percent this year.  Honeywell, which sells airplane parts from navigational
systems to brakes, is benefiting from an increase in aircraft
production as  Boeing Co. (BA) , Airbus SAS and other planemakers seek
to whittle down large backlogs of orders. Sales at Honeywell’s
aerospace division, its second-largest, advanced 7.7 percent to
$3.03 billion in the second quarter.  “We continue to see good growth in the commercial
businesses partially offset by manageable declines in defense,”
 David Anderson , Honeywell’s chief financial officer, said on a
conference call today. “We saw the benefits of growth in both
Boeing and Airbus deliveries resulting from the ongoing ramp in
production rates.”  Net income in the second quater rose 11 percent to $902
million, or $1.14 a share, from $810 million, or $1.02, a year
earlier, the  Morris Township , New Jersey-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts projected $1.11, the average of
20  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 3.8 percent to
$9.44 billion.  Profit margin expanded to 15.8 percent from 14.3 percent a
year earlier amid gains at the aerospace division and
performance materials unit, which sells equipment and chemicals
to the  energy industry .  Profit Margin  “The quality of the upside was encouraging,” Jeff Sprague, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners in New York,
said in a telephone interview. “The margins were better than
expected in three of the four business segments and in line on
the fourth.”  Automation & Control Solutions, Honeywell’s largest unit,
had second-quarter sales of $3.96 billion, a 2.1 percent
increase. The company’s transportation unit, which sells
turbochargers to European carmakers, saw sales drop 9.1 percent
to $900 million.  The company raised the low end of its annual profit
forecast today, and now anticipates 2012 earnings per share to
be $4.40 to $4.55 compared with $4.35 to $4.55 projected in
April. Analysts projected $4.49, the average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  The full-year sales forecast was lowered by $200 million to
$37.8 billion to $38.4 billion from $38 billion to $38.6
billion, according to the statement.  Sales Growth  “Segment margins are expanding more than we initially
expected at the beginning of the year despite slower sales
growth,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote said on the
conference call. “For 2012 and 2013, we have focused on margin
expansion as key to earnings growth as a way to leverage slower
sales growth in a tough macro environment.”  The company is preparing for a “tough economic landscape”
next year with restructuring that will benefit the company by
$150 million this year and more than $125 million next year,
Cote said.  Earnings per share in the third quarter are expected to be
$1.10 to $1.15 on sales of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, the
company said in a slide presentation on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
