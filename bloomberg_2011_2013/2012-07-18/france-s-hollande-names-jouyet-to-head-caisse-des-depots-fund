French President  Francois Hollande 
named  Jean-Pierre Jouyet , head of the country’s financial
markets regulator, to run Caisse des Depots et Consignations, a
state-run bank and investment fund.  The 58-year-old will become chief executive officer of CDC,
government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters
after the weekly cabinet meeting in Paris today. Jouyet, a top
adviser to former socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in the
late 1990s before heading the French Treasury from 2000 to 2004,
became head of market regulator AMF in 2008.  CDC, founded in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars,
manages tax-exempt deposits and helps fund public projects from
housing to infrastructure. The Paris-based fund is also an
investor in state-controlled companies such as  La Poste  and  CNP
Assurances SA (CNP) , the country’s largest life insurer.  In his five-year term, Jouyet will have to define CDC’s
involvement in Hollande’s plans to start a lender to aid small
companies. Together with Paris-based La Banque Postale, CDC is
also setting up a lender to municipalities to fill the gap left
by the collapse of the Franco-Belgian bank  Dexia SA. (DEXB)   CDC has total assets of 262 billion euros ($321 billion).
Net income fell 90 percent to 206 million euros last year, hurt
by writedowns on investments and losses from Dexia. By law, CDC
pays the state dividends equal to a third of its annual profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
