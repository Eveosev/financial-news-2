Residential Capital LLC, the
bankrupt mortgage unit of  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , asked a
 bankruptcy court  to approve $14.9 million in incentive payments
to key employees.  The company is seeking to pay 17 senior executives and 174
employees incentives for improving efficiency, meeting financial
goals and preserving or enhancing the sale price of ResCap’s
assets, according to papers filed yesterday in bankruptcy court
in New York. The plan for senior executives doesn’t include
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Marano, according to the filing.  “The total potential award payouts represent a reasonable
amount, especially when compared with the combined stalking
horse bids of nearly $4.0 billion,” ResCap said in the filing,
referring to offers for the unit’s assets.  ResCap filed for bankruptcy May 14 with plans to sell most
of its assets to Fortress Investment Group LLC and companies it
controls.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  will make the first offer for
the company’s mortgages.  Ally, the Detroit-based auto lender, supported the
bankruptcy filing as a way to resolve legal claims related to
mortgage-backed securities. Ally is 74 percent-owned by the U.S.
Treasury after receiving a bailout.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
