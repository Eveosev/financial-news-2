The Czech central bank doesn’t need
to cut  interest rates  this year as the move would have little
effect on economic growth, Dow Jones reported, citing policy
maker Kamil Janacek.  Households and businesses are holding back on spending as
real wages fall and demand in the country’s main exports markets
weakens amid  Europe ’s debt crisis, Janacek was quoted by the
newswire as saying in an  interview  published today.  “The biggest barrier is a lack of domestic demand and
uncertainty in the European Union, uncertainty of future demand
for Czech exports,” he said. Because of this, there are “very
few monetary instruments to help the economy. Quantitative
easing in this situation would have no effect.”  The bank lowered its benchmark two-week  repurchase rate  by
a quarter point to a record low of 0.5 percent on June 28.
Janacek was one of three board members to vote for no change at
the meeting. Four board members voted for the cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
