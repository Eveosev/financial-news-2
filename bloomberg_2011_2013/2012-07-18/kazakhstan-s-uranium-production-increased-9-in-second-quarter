Kazakhstan, the world’s biggest
uranium producer, increased second-quarter output of the
radioactive metal by 9 percent from the previous three months to
5,040 metric tons, state-owned Kazatomprom said.  Kazatomprom’s share of production totaled 2,896 tons, also
a gain of 9 percent from the first quarter, the Astana-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  ULBA Metallurgical Plant, a uranium pellet-producing unit
of Kazatomprom, reported a 23 percent slump in beryllium output
in the period, while more than doubling tantalum volumes, the
statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
