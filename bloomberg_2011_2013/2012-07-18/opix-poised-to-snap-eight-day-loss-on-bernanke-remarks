Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index capping its longest losing streak since July 2009, on
concern the global economic slowdown will weigh on corporate
earnings. Utilities plunged on amid renewed concern about
nuclear safety.  Sumco Corp. (3436) , a maker of silicon wafers for semiconductors,
lost 4.8 percent after industry bellwether  Intel Corp . forecast
sales will miss estimates. Hokuriku Electric Power Co. and
 Kansai Electric  Power Co. fell on a report regulators will
request studies of  fault lines  running the utilities’ nuclear
plants. Hulic Co. paced gains among real estate stocks after
 Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  reported that condominium sales may pick up.  The Topix fell 0.4 percent to 740.46 at the 3 p.m. trading
close in Tokyo, extending its losing streak to nine days. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 0.3 percent to 8,726.74 after
rising as much as 0.5 percent. The gauge dropped after failing
to break a resistance level, indicating the market’s lack of
upward momentum, according to Okasan Securities Co.  “What’s behind the downward trend is global economic
slowdown concern, with too many uncertain factors,” saidYoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at the online division of 89-
year-old Okasan Securities. “Government regulators’ actions
have been crashing utility shares.”  The Topix rebounded about 6 percent from a 29-year low on
June 4 as concern eased about Europe’s debt crisis and central
banks around the world cut  interest rates  to shore up growth.  Shares on the index are  valued  at 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means
investors can buy companies for less than the value of their
assets.  Intel Outlook  Semiconductor-related stocks fell after Intel, the world’s
largest chipmaker, cut its annual sales forecast yesterday amid
slumping demand for computers in the U.S. and Europe. Sumco slid
4.8 percent to 581 yen.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , a maker of memory-chip
testers, dropped 1.2 percent to 1,056 yen.  Power generators fell the most on the Topix after the
Nikkei newspaper reported that regulators will ask two utilities
to conduct geological studies after surveys showed that a fault
under a Hokuriku Electric nuclear plant is probably active.
Experts can’t rule out the possibility that a fault under Kansai
Electric’s Ohi plant is active, according to the report.  Utilities Drop  Kansai Electric slid 6.3 percent to 758 yen. Hokuriku
Electric plunged 21 percent to 877 yen, falling the most since
at least 1974.  Among other stocks that declined, department-store operator
Uny Co. plunged 9.9 percent to 815 yen after announcing a share
sale to raise as much as 29.8 billion yen ($377 million).  Stocks rose earlier after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said the central bank is prepared to act to
stimulate growth if the labor market doesn’t improve. The  S&P
500 (SPXL1)  closed 0.7 percent higher in  New York  yesterday after
Bernanke’s remarks boosted optimism for further easing.  Exporters to the U.S. advanced. Nissan Motor Co., an
automaker that gets almost a third of its sales in  North America ,
added 1.9 percent to 713 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751)  rose 0.6 percent to
2,896 yen.  Property Stocks  Real estate shares  gained after Nomura said condominium
sales are expected to climb ahead of the consumption tax
increase and as interest rates remain low. The number of
condominiums put up for sale in Tokyo rose 16 percent in June
from a year earlier, the Real Estate Economic Research Institute
Co. reported today.  Hulic Co. jumped 6.1 percent to 401 yen, while Tokyo
Tatemono Co. rose 1.4 percent to 286 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  declined 1 percent to 18.56,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.3 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
Nikkei was 2 percent above the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
