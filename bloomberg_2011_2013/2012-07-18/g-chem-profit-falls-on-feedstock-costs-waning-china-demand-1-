LG Chem Ltd. (051910) ,  South Korea ’s largest
chemicals maker, reported a 40 percent decline in second-quarter
profit as feedstock expenses gained amid weakening demand in
China, its biggest market.  Net income fell to 373.9 billion won ($327 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 624.5 billion won a year earlier,
the Seoul-based company said today in a regulatory filing. The
quarterly result, the smallest since it adopted international
accounting rules in 2011, fell short of the 382.8 billion won
average of 20 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 5.2 percent to 6 trillion won.  Demand for LG Chem’s products including ethylene and
polyvinyl chloride used in water-resistant fabrics and window
frames waned as  China ’s economic growth slowed for the sixth
straight quarter. Gross domestic product in China, which
accounts for more than a third of LG Chem’s sales, expanded 7.6
percent in the second quarter, a three-year low.  “Earnings continue to fall because of China,” said Yoo Young Kook, an analyst at KTB Securities Co. in  Seoul , who has a
“buy” recommendation on LG Chem. “Earnings may improve as
prices of products have started rebounding since the end of last
month.”  LG Chem fell 1.5 percent to 305,500 won at the close of
trading in Seoul before the announcement. The stock has declined
3.8 percent this year, compared with a 1.7 percent drop in the
benchmark Kospi index. Of the 43  analysts  tracking the company,
40 have “buy” ratings on the stock, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. None has a “sell” rating.  Naphtha Price  The price of naphtha, an oil product used in petrochemicals,
gained to $1,090 a ton in the first quarter from $912 a year
earlier, LG Chem said today in a statement. The company said
production typically lags behind raw material purchases by two
or three months.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, dropped 35 percent to 503 billion won,
LG Chem said. The  petrochemical division , which accounts for 75
percent of sales, had an operating profit of 343.6 billion won,
47 percent less than that of a year earlier.  Prices for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or ABS, used to
make cosmetic cases and sport goods, fell 13 percent to $1,944 a
ton in the second quarter from a year earlier, LG Chem said. ABS
accounted for 22 percent of second-quarter sales.  Operating profit for LG Chem’s information technologies
division, which makes polarizers and other electronics materials,
rose to 129.1 billion won from 115 billion won a year earlier.
The rechargeable battery business for electric cars and
notebooks reported a 61 percent gain in operating profit to 30.7
billion won.  Earnings from the petrochemical business may improve in the
third quarter as feedstock prices are stable and product prices
are rising, Chief Executive Officer Kim Bahn Suk told investors
in Seoul today.  The company may lower its full-year sales forecast for
electric  car batteries  by 30 percent from the 800 billion won
projected in January because of weak demand at automakers, Kim
said today. Last year, LG Chem posted 300 billion won in sales
of car batteries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
