VTB Capital, the investment banking
unit of  Russia ’s second-largest lender, hired Peter Stonor from
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  as global head of
infrastructure and transport.  Stonor, who will be based in  London , was a managing
director at RBS global banking and markets and held “senior
managing positions” at Macquarie Group Ltd. and ABN AMRO
Corporate Finance, according to an e-mailed statement today. He
was one of six new hires across the business, the company said.  VTB Capital was Russia’s largest organizer of debt and
equity sales last year, ahead of Troika Dialog, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its bankers are involved in a
consortium building the Western High-Speed Diameter highway in
 St. Petersburg  and a public-private partnership to upgrade the
city’s Pulkovo airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
