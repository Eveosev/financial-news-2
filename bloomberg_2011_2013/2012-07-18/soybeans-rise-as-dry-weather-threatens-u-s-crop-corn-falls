Soybeans resumed a rally that sent
prices to a four-year high yesterday on speculation that hot,
dry weather during the next 10 days will curb production in the
U.S., the world’s biggest producer. Corn fell.  Temperatures will approach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38
degrees Celsius) from  Texas  to  South Dakota  through July 28,
intensifying crop stress at a key stage of soybean growth,  World
Weather Inc.  said in a report. Showers in the northern and
eastern Midwest will provide temporary relief in the next week.
Soybeans  produce  pods and fill them with seeds during late July
and August. Prices are up 21 percent since mid-June.  “The forecast remains threatening, and the market is
assuming declining supplies,” said Brian Grete, the chief
market analyst for Professional Farmers of America newsletter in
 Cedar Falls ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “Until we get
concrete signs of slowing demand, the shrinking crops will
support prices.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.2 percent
$15.923 a bushel at 10:32 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after gaining as much as 0.9 percent. Yesterday, the price
reached $16.07, the highest for a most-active contract since
July 2008. The December-delivery contract for soybean meal, an
 animal feed , rose as much as 1.3 percent to a record $471.70 per
2,000 pounds.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$7.6875 a bushel on the CBOT. Yesterday, the price reached
$7.89, the highest for a most-active contract since June 9,
2011, before closing down 0.2 percent. The grain has rallied 52
percent since mid-June.  About 55 percent of the contiguous U.S. states were in
moderate to extreme drought at the end of June, the highest
percentage since December 1956, according to the National
Climatic Data Center. Crop conditions on July 15 fell to the
lowest since 1988, when a drought cut corn output by 30 percent
from a year earlier and the soybean harvest fell 20 percent,
data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
