AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
wireless carrier, will offer smartphone and tablet users shared-
data plans starting at $85 a month beginning in late August,
following a similar move by Verizon Wireless last month.  The new AT&T Mobile Share plans include unlimited calling
and messaging and let customers combine as many as 10 devices
under one monthly data allotment. Verizon started a similar plan
starting at $90 last month.  AT&T and Verizon Wireless are pushing a shared-plan
approach to encourage customers to use more devices and
ultimately buy bigger packages of data. By bundling services
onto one bill carriers are trying to stop erosion of calling and
messaging revenue as consumers who call less and use free
messaging services migrate to cheaper packages.  “These aren’t entry-level price plans,” said  Roger Entner 
with Recon Analytics of Dedham,  Massachusetts . “These are
forward-looking plans for people with multiple devices -- the
heavy data users of today, who will be more common down the
road,” he said.  The plan starts with $40 for 1 gigabyte of data and $45 per
smartphone, Dallas-based AT&T said in a statement. The next tier
is $70 for 4 gigabytes of data and $40 per smartphone, 6
gigabytes costs $90 and each smartphone is $35, 10 gigabytes is
$120 with $30 per smartphone, 15 gigabytes is $160 with a $30
smartphone charge and the maximum is a 20 gigabytes for $200.
Users can add phones that only make calls and texts for $30 a
month, laptops for $20 a month and tablets for $10 a month.  More Choices  The idea is to offer consumers more choice, said David Christopher, chief marketing officer for AT&T Mobility. “The
future is all about connecting mobile devices to the Internet
and we’re making it easier to do that,” Christopher said in a
telephone interview.  AT&T says isn’t discontinuing its existing individual and
family plans.  The shared-data offering also includes mobile hotspot and
tethering features that allow devices to share their data
connections.  AT&T gained 1 percent to $36.19 at the close in  New York .
The shares have risen 20 percent this year.  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) , which jointly owns  Verizon Wireless  with
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , rose less than 1 percent to $45.89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
