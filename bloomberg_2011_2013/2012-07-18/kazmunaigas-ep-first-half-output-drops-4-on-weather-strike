KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-listed unit of  Kazakhstan â€™s state energy company,
said first-half oil output fell 4 percent because of adverse
weather and strike action.  The company produced 6.1 million metric tons of crude in
the first six months of 2012, according to a statement today.  The production slowdown came mostly from its Uzenmunaigas
unit following poor weather, the impact from wells that were
idled during a strike last year, and obsolete equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
