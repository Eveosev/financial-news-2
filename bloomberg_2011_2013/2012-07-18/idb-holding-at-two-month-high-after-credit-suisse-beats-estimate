IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH)  rose to the
highest level in almost two months after  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
in which it holds a stake via  Koor Industries Ltd. (KOR) , reported
profit that topped estimates.  IDB, which owns a stake in Koor through its holdings in
 Discount Investment Corp. (DISI) , advanced 5.9 percent at the close in
Tel Aviv to 16.10 shekels, the highest level since May 28.  Koor
Industries Ltd., which holds a 2.9 percent stake in Credit
Suisse advanced 1.6 percent to 32.50 shekels, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark TA-25 index lost 0.2
percent.  IDB has advanced 23 percent in past three days after the
company said yesterday that shareholder Nochi Dankner raised his
direct stake in the company to 4.05 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
