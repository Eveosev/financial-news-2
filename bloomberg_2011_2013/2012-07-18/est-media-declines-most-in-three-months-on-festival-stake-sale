Est Media Vagyonkezelo Nyrt., a
Hungarian entertainment company, fell the most in three months
after agreeing to  sell a stake  in the countryâ€™s biggest outdoor
festival to its minority owners.  The shares dropped 15 percent to 23 forint by 9:22 a.m. in
Budapest, the biggest slump since April 11 and the worst
performance on the 11-member BUX  index .  Est Media signed the deal to sell a 49 percent stake in
Sziget Kft. after a public tender to dispose of the asset
failed, the company said in a statement to the Budapest Stock
Exchange yesterday, when the stock was suspended pending the
announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
