The  International Monetary Fund  said
it will seek to better account for the effect of member nations’
domestic policies on the rest of the world when monitoring their
economies.  “In the current challenging and highly interconnected
global economic environment, it is critical to have effective
surveillance to enable the early detection of risks and provide
timely policy advice,” IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde 
said in an e-mailed statement today after the IMF board
decision.  The Washington-based IMF has been criticized for missing
signs of fragility that led to the 2008 global financial crisis.
A report last year showed it also faced “dissatisfaction”
about how it assesses exchange rates, prompting a pledge to
include data such as capital flows when reviewing member
nations’ external stability.  Under today’s decision, the fund will focus on both
exchange rates and domestic policies when assessing a country’s
economy, Lagarde said. It will be able to look at the potential
spillover of countries’ policies when they affect global
stability, she said.  The IMF will also start a pilot report to make external
monitoring more effective, Lagarde said. With it, surveillance
will “ encompass more systematically, in addition to exchange
rates, developments in current accounts, capital accounts,
reserve accumulation, capital flow measures, and foreign assets
and liabilities,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
