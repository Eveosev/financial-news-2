The forint capped the biggest four-
day rally in almost a month as the government held talks with
the  International Monetary Fund  and European Commission on a
bailout package.  The forint appreciated 0.6 percent to 284.66 per euro by
5:04 p.m. in Budapest, bringing its advance in the past four
days to 1.8 percent. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-
year bonds fell seven basis points to 7.358 percent after
falling to 7.347 percent, the lowest level since September, on
July 16. Hungary’s credit-default swaps were little changed at
481 basis points, matching the lowest close since October 27.  The government began talks on a  credit line  yesterday,
eight months after requesting the aid, after resolving a dispute
on legislation which threatened the independence of the central
bank. Hungary wants to cooperate with the IMF as the country
needs a credit line to help cut borrowing costs, Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban  told reporters this week.  “The introductions happened, and despite the expected
difficulties the market is assigning an increasing probability
to a successful conclusion of talks,” Levente Blaho and Adam
Keszeg, Budapest-based analysts at  Raiffeisen Bank International
AG (RBI) , wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
