Oi SA (OIBR4)  and  Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3)  were
the biggest losers on the Bovespa after a newspaper reported
they may be blocked from selling mobile plans to new subscribers
as complaints mount.  Oi slid 4.5 percent to 9.17 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo, its biggest drop since May 23. Tim declined 2.8 percent
to 9.46 reais, the lowest since Feb. 10. The Bovespa advanced
1.3 percent.  “This is a bad sign for investors as such an extreme
measure would only be taken when the situation has really
deteriorated,” Karina Sanches, an analyst at Concordia SA, said
by phone from Sao Paulo. “The impact of the sanctions will
depend on its terms and duration.”  Anatel, the federal telecommunications regulator, has
decided to restrict Tim, Oi and Claro, the service controlled by
the billionaire  Carlos Slim , Folha de S.Paulo said today.  Tim, Oi and Anatel press officials declined to comment. A
Claro official didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail
messages from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
