Turkish bond  yields  declined for a
third day to their lowest in 10 months on speculation the
central bank may trim the upper end of its interest rate
corridor tomorrow.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.86 percent, the lowest on an
intraday basis since Sept. 20.  Governor Erdem Basci spurred expectations of a cut in the
11.5 percent overnight rate when he said the central bank may
reduce its inflation estimate for 2012 toward 5 percent from 6.5
percent on July 6.  Turkey ’s inflation has slowed from a 3 1/2-
year high in April as the economy shrank in the first quarter.
The bank will keep its one-week repo rate of 5.75 percent
unchanged in the monetary policy committee tomorrow, according
to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “There is room to trim the overnight lending rate by 50
basis points to 11.00 percent given that the outlook for CPI
improved, first-quarter GDP growth was soft, the current-account
deficit continues to narrow and we witnessed further
deterioration in the outlook for the global economy,”  Piotr Matys , a London-based economist at 4Cast Ltd., said in e-mailed
comments yesterday.  The lira depreciated for the first time in four days,
weakening less than 0.1 percent to 1.8082 per dollar at 11:18
a.m. in Istanbul. The cost of locking in borrowing for two years
using  interest-rate swaps  fell to 8.51 percent today, the lowest
level since Oct. 18, on bets average rates will drop.  Funding Cost  “We are expecting cut of the overnight lending rate of up
to 100 basis points,” said Daniel Lenz, chief strategist for
 emerging markets  at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “The market
expects 50 basis points but the Turkish central bank often
surprised by acting more aggressively than estimated.”  The average cost of funding for banks fell to 7.83 percent
yesterday, the least since April 10, from 10.2 percent on June
5. The borrowing costs have declined as the central bank has
lent at its lowest policy rate of 5.75 percent for the past six
weeks, the longest run of cheap lending since March 21. It
offered to lend 1.5 billion liras ($829.6 million) at its
cheapest rate today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
