The U.S. is helping fund a water
pump replacement program in Islamabad to improve water supplies
in the Pakistani capital and reduce power consumption.  USAID country director Jonathan Conly and Capital
Development Authority Chairman Farkhand Iqbal replaced the first
pump yesterday at Fatima Jinna Park as part of a $1.2 million
aid project, the CDA said in a statement.  The CDA has 187 tube well pumps in Islamabad. Only 132 are
working, the rest being out of order in a city suffering from
water shortages. Those still working operate with less than 30
percent efficiency, raising electric bills and failing to
provide enough water for residents, the CDA said.  Replacement of the pumps will save about 2 megawatts of
electricity, enough to power 4,500 Pakistani households, it
said. The AID project follows one in which the agency and
Ministry of Water and Power helped 2,600 farmers replace pumps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
