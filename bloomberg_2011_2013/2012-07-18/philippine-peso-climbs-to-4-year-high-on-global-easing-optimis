The Philippine peso rose to the
strongest level in more than four years after the  Federal
Reserve  signaled it is considering further monetary easing,
supporting demand for emerging-market assets. Bonds fell.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday possible
stimulus measures may include adding to two rounds of asset
purchases since the global financial crisis, as the U.S. weighs
joining countries from  Brazil  to China in loosening policy. The
$225 billion Philippine economy expanded 6.4 percent in the
first quarter, the fastest pace since 2010, official data show.  “The peso is a strong currency as the Philippines is one
of the few countries in  Asia  projecting accelerating growth,”
said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president of financial
markets at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “There is more room
for the peso to appreciate.”  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 41.67 per dollar as of the
4 p.m. close in Manila, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show. It
earlier touched 41.56, the strongest level since April 2008.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 6.2 percent.  The yield on the Philippine government’s 8 percent bonds
due July 2031 rose two basis points to 5.65 percent, according
to Tradition Financial Services. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  President  Benigno Aquino  aims to bolster growth to as much
as 7 percent next year from an estimated 6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
