Gasoline rose to a seven-week high
after U.S. stockpiles of the motor fuel declined unexpectedly
last week.  Futures climbed 1.4 percent as gasoline  supplies  fell 1.82
million barrels to 205.9 million in the seven days ended July
13, the first drop in five weeks, Energy Department data showed.
The median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a 1.2 million-barrel increase.  “It was a pretty big decline and it was unexpected,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  August-delivery gasoline gained 3.84 cents to $2.8834 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since May 29.  The largest portion of the inventory decline occurred in
Padd 1, which includes  New York  Harbor, the delivery point for
the Nymex contract. Padd 1 gasoline stockpiles fell 1.2 million
barrels to an eight-month low of 52.2 million, 6.2 percent below
a year earlier.  “People are worried about the drop in Padd 1, and lower
inventories there can make futures prices rise,” said  Hamza Khan , an analyst at the Schork Group Inc., a consulting company
in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .  East Coast supplies of reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, rose
643,000 barrels to 15.3 million. Inventories of the fuel are 9.2
percent below a year earlier, wider than the 8.8 percent
difference the prior week.  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline  demand  slipped to 8.63 million barrels a day, the
lowest level since April 20. Consumption over the past four
weeks was 3.3 percent below a year earlier.  “People are ignoring the demand figure and looking at the
supply constriction,” said  Sander Cohan , a global
transportation fuels analyst and principal with Energy Security
Analysis Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts.  Futures rose before the inventory report as equities
strengthened and  housing starts  increased 6.9 percent in June to
the highest level in almost four years, Commerce Department data
showed today. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4 percent
at 2:48 p.m. in New York.  “We did get a bigger draw than people were expecting,
equities were higher and housing starts were better than
expected,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Heating oil and diesel  supplies  rose 2.62 million barrels
to 123.5 million in the week ended July 13. Analysts in the
survey forecast a 1.3 million-barrel gain. Inventories are 17
percent below a year earlier, according to department data.  Distillate  demand  increased 3.8 percent to 3.37 million
barrels a day. Consumption over the past four weeks was 1.9
percent higher than a year earlier.  Heating oil for August delivery advanced 3.54 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.8776 a gallon, a nine-week high.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 2 cents to $3.426 a gallon, according to AAA. Prices
have risen every day but two since July 1, gaining 10 cents.
Gasoline reached a year-to-date high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
