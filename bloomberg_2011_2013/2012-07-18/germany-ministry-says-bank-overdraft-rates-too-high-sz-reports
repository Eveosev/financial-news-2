Germany’s banks are levying
excessively high interest rates on overdrafts,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  said, citing a report due to be presented today by
Federal Consumer Protection Minister  Ilse Aigner .  The 254-page report, drafted by the Center for European
Economic Research and the Institute of Financial Services, found
that the charges for overdrafts largely exceeded the cost and
that the extra money was used to cross subsidize other products
and boost profit, the newspaper said.  German banks charged on average 12.4 percent on overdrafts,
with some charging as much as 18.25 percent, SZ reported.  The two institutes rejected bank’s argument that the high
interest rates were needed because of the higher risk of default
on smaller loans, the newspaper said. There are about 40 billion
euros ($49 billion) in outstanding overdraft loans in  Germany ,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
