 Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, gained 24 percent in the week to July 15,
according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors rose to 81,476 bags
in the period, Hartmann said in a report yesterday. That
compares with the 65,443 bags reported a week earlier. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). Total arrivals across Brazil
were 118,608 bags compared to 118,866 bags a week earlier.  Bahia accounted for 74 percent of Brazil’s cocoa output and
94 percent of grindings in the past five years, Hartmann said in
an Oct. 12 e-mail. He’s a board member of the Commercial
Association of Bahia and heads the group’s statistical service
on Brazilian production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
