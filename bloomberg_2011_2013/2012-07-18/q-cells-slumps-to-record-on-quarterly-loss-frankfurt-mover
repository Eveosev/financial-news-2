Q-Cells SE (QCE)  slumped to a record
after the German solar-cell and module maker that filed for
involvency in April reported a quarterly loss.  Q-Cells slid 6.7 percent to 1.12 euro cents, the lowest
since the shares started trading in October 2005.  The company lost 6.7 million euros ($8.2 million) before
interest and taxes in the second quarter, based on calculations
from its insolvency administrator, the company said today in a
statement. The administrator expects an Ebit loss of 42 million
euros to 44 million euros this quarter.  Profit margins have been squeezed after a glut of cells and
panels dragged down prices, and at least six German solar
companies filed for insolvency since December.  Q-Cells said its creditors today approved the continuation
of the company’s business as two restructuring alternatives are
pursued. One includes a sale of almost the entire company. The
second alternative would result in creditor ownership.  “The liquidation of the business of Q-Cells would only
potentially be undertaken if and to the extent that neither of
the above alternatives can be realized,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
