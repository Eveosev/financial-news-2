Comerica Inc. (CMA)  customers may sue the
bank as a class over claims that banks wrongly charged overdraft
fees, a federal judge ruled.  More than 30 banks have been sued by customers claiming the
banks reordered their overdrafts to maximize the fees they paid.
Comerica is the sixth bank to lose a bid to force the customers
to pursue their claims individually.  “Surely you’re not saying the bank would welcome 50,000
cases in small claims court,” U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King told the attorney for Dallas-based Comerica today
in Miami federal court. “This is a question of whether there’s
a suit or none at all.”  The judge added that “there wouldn’t be lawyers to take
the cases and it would just go away.”  Several banks have already agreed to settle the claims,
with  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  agreeing to pay $410 million, the
highest settlement. The cases have been consolidated in Miami
for pre-trial proceedings.  “I thought Comerica fell into class certification just as
the other five had and the banks that have settled have,” said
Bruce Rogow, one of the lead attorneys for the bank customers.
“I was pleased with the ruling.”  Comerica spokesman Wayne J. Mielke said the bank
anticipated the ruling and will continue fighting the lawsuit.  The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  Florida 
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
