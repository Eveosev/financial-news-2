Foreign-born engineers and
scientists, long the prized recruits of companies in
California’s Silicon Valley, are now increasingly finding a home
in the U.S. Midwest.  A  report  released today by the  Brookings Institution  found
that while the  San Jose , California, metropolitan area still
leads the nation in hiring skilled foreign workers on temporary
visas, places such as Columbus,  Indiana , and Bloomington,
Illinois, are also becoming centers of activity for foreign-born
employees hired under the H-1B program.  The study highlights the nation’s growing reliance upon
workers from overseas to fill positions in science, technology
and engineering. Just 4 percent of the world’s undergraduate
degrees in engineering are awarded in the U.S., it said.  “The heartland is really looking for engineers,” Neil
Ruiz, the study’s co-author and a senior policy analyst at the
Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, said in a telephone
interview.  The study by the nonprofit Washington-based research
organization focused on hiring patterns in 106 metropolitan
areas under the H-1B program, which was created in 1990 to allow
U.S. companies to hire foreign workers for three to six years
while they seek permanent residency.  It found that demand for foreign workers was intense in
smaller Midwestern metropolitan areas such as Fayetteville,
Arkansas, which includes the corporate headquarters for  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT)   Driving Demand  In Columbus, a metro area of 76,794 people about 45 miles
south of Indianapolis, the demand was driven largely by  Cummins
Inc. (CMI) , which designs, manufactures and services diesel and
natural gas engines. Revenue grew to more than $18 billion last
year from $5.7 billion in 2001, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “About half of engineering graduates from U.S. colleges
are from outside the U.S., so that’s really shaping our pool of
employees,” said Janet Williams, a company spokeswoman. “We
really need a wide range -- mechanical engineers, chemical
engineers, electrical engineers.”  Demand for foreign-born workers has been strongest among
technology companies.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  led all employers in 2010-
2011, requesting an annual average of 4,109 H-1B workers.  The Redmond, Washington-based company was trailed by  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , a Mumbai-based division of Tata Sons
Ltd. that ranked No. 2 with an average of 3,179 requests a year.
Deloitte Consulting LLP, a subsidiary of Arlington, Virginia-
based Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu ILA Group Ltd., was third with an
average 2,981 requests during the 10-year period.  Changing Cap  The number of H-1B visas available during the last decade
has varied, with a cap of 195,000 from 2001 to 2003. The maximum
was lowered in 2004 to 65,000, with another 20,000 positions
allowed beginning in 2006 for foreign-born workers with graduate
degrees earned at U.S. schools. The limit doesn’t apply to
academic or research institutions.  The study found science, technology, engineering and
mathematics disciplines accounted for 64 percent of all H-1B
requests, even though they only made up 5.4 percent of U.S.
employment in 2010.  The top areas of demand for  H-1B visas  generally track
population. Employers in the  New York  metro area, the nation’s
largest, requested an average of 52,921 foreign-born workers in
2010 and 2011, or 16.3 percent of the national average.  LA, DC  Companies in the Los Angeles area ranked second, with
18,048 average requests per year, or 5.5 percent of the total.
The  Washington , D.C., metro area ranked No. 5, with 14,569
average visa requests, about 4.5 percent of the national total.  Nationwide, there has been an average of 2.4 H-1B requests
per 1,000 U.S. workers, Ruiz said. In San Jose, employers
requested 17.1 H-1B workers for every 1,000 domestic employees.
Columbus ranked No. 2, with 14.6 H-1B requests per 1,000 such
workers; Durham-Chapel Hill,  North Carolina , was third with
9.79; and Trenton,  New Jersey , fourth with 8.46.  At Cummins, Williams said, H-1B workers total about 1,300,
with 900 working at the company’s Columbus headquarters. The
company has about 44,900 employees. She said a substantial
amount of the company’s growth over the last decade has been
fueled by environmental regulations that affect diesel engines.  The company prefers to hire workers directly from college
to ensure they adopt its values, Williams said. The downside,
she said, is that the small city may be more attractive to
adults with families than 22-year-old college graduates.  “We call it ‘The Athens of the Prairie,”’ said Emily
Foster, a Washington-based Cummins spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
