China ’s yuan rose to a one-week high
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the
possibility of further monetary easing, supporting the outlook
for Asian economic growth.  The People’s Bank of China raised the currency’s  reference
rate  0.04 percent to 6.3140 per dollar, the strongest level
since July 4. China’s labor situation will become more
“severe,” according to a statement on the government’s website
yesterday from Premier  Wen Jiabao , while State Council may meet
today to set tone for monetary and fiscal policies as China
Securities Journal reported on July 16.  “The potential of more U.S. monetary easing is supporting
the yuan a bit,” said Stella Lee, Hong Kong-based president at
Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd. “However, investors
remain cautious as there aren’t clear signals China is returning
to its strong growth track.”  The  yuan  strengthened 0.04 percent to 6.3702 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
It touched 6.3681 earlier, the highest level since July 11. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the central bank’s daily fixing. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
1.35 percent. That’s the lowest level since August 2010.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.06
percent to 6.3720. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped
0.02 percent to 6.4165, a 0.66 percent discount to the onshore
spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts touched 6.4123 earlier, the strongest since July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
