China Mining United Fund  plans a
second fund to buy “significant” minority stakes in gold,
iron-ore and metal companies in  Africa  and elsewhere, said
Alistair Ruiters, an advisor to the fund.  “The first fund started at $1 billion and closed at about
$2 billion,” Ruiters, who is also executive chairman of  Ruukki
Group Oyj (RUG1V) ’s South African unit, said in a speech in Johannesburg
today. “I can only surmise the second fund will follow that
particular structure.” One of Ruukki’s biggest shareholders is
Kermas Group, China Mining United Fund’s partner in Africa.  China is the world’s biggest metals consumer. Chinese
funding could help mining companies finance projects in Africa,
which holds large reserves of platinum, copper and chrome.  CMUF is targeting stakes in companies that are close to
starting production in deals from $20 million to $100 million,
Ruiters said. The fund is also looking for transactions in
 Australia ,  Asia  and Europe, he said.  CMUF, formed in 2009, is one of China’s first private
equity funds to receive approval from the National Development
and Reform Commission to make investments abroad, Ruiters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
