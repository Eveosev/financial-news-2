Turkey  has renewed a request to the
French government that businessman Cem Uzan be extradited,  Sabah 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  It’s claimed that Turkey’s Savings Deposit Insurance Fund
is owed 8.5 billion liras ($4.7 billion) in connection with the
failure of Imar Bankasi AS, the Uzan family bank, Sabah said.  France  hasn’t yet made a decision on Cem Uzan’s request for
refuge in the country, where he has been living on a temporary
residence permit for three years, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
