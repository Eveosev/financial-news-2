Soybeans soared to the highest level
since 2008 and near to a record in  Chicago , while wheat gained
to the costliest since February last year and corn erased a
loss, on concern the worst U.S. drought in decades may persist
through the growing season, pummeling yields.  Soybeans for November delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent
to $16.32 a bushel, the highest level for a most-active contract
since July 2008, when the price peaked at $16.3675 during the
global food crisis. The oilseed traded at $16.315 at 3:09 p.m.
in  Singapore .  The drought in the Midwest may persist for the rest of the
growing season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the drought
may cause a “small decline” in corn and soybean exports. The
surge in grain and soybeans may spur a third wave of  food
inflation , after global price shocks in 2008 and 2011 that
incited civil unrest in  developing countries , Barclays Plc said.  “Market participants may be starting to think about how
high prices are going to begin to ration demand,” said  Michael Creed , an economist at  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)   Wheat for September delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent to
$9.1075 a bushel and traded at $9.0925. The most-active price
has rallied 39 percent this year.  Corn for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to $7.86 a
bushel after erasing a loss of 1 percent. The price rallied to
$7.89 on July 17, the highest level for a most-active contract
since June 9, 2011, and near the record $7.9925 set in 2008.  Weather Outlook  Mostly above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall
are expected to continue across the Midwest for at least the
next 10 days, Telvent DTN said in a report yesterday. That will
lead to  further deterioration  of corn and soybean crops, it
said.  “It looks like the dome of high pressure that has been
dominating the continental  United States  will continue to park
itself over the Plains and parts of the Midwest for at least the
next two weeks,” Brad Rippey, a USDA meteorologist, said in a
statement yesterday. “More than likely, this will persist
through the remainder of the 2012 crop season.”  The damage to crops and to grazing land for livestock
ultimately will affect food prices, Vilsack told reporters at
the White House. He described the drought as “the most serious
situation we’ve had probably in 25 years.”  About 55 percent of the contiguous U.S. states were in
moderate to extreme drought at the end of June, the highest
percentage since December 1956, according to the National
Climatic Data Center. Crop conditions on July 15 fell to the
lowest since 1988, when a drought cut corn output by 30 percent
from a year earlier and the soybean harvest fell 20 percent,
data from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  show.  Dry weather in the U.S., as well as the  Black Sea region ; a
poor start to the Indian monsoon and the possibility of emerging
El Nino conditions suggest agricultural products may rally,
Barclays said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  To contact the reporters for this story:
