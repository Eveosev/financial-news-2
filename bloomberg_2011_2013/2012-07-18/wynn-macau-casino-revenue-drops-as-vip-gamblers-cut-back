Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , the Hong Kong-
listed unit of billionaire  Steve Wynn ’s Las Vegas company,
reported a 7.1 percent drop in second-quarter revenue as high-
stake gamblers curbed spending amid a slower Chinese economy.  Revenue dropped to $907.6 million from $976.5 million at
the casino operator, according to filing today. The company’s
parent  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  reported results that missed analysts’
estimates because of lower winnings in Macau and Nevada.  The revenue decline reflects slowing growth in the world’s
largest gambling hub and is a reversal from Wynn Macau’s first
quarter when tourists from  China ’s mainland boosted sales. High-
rollers, otherwise known as VIPs, who contribute more than 70
percent of the city’s gambling revenue, are not spending as much
as they did in Macau’s 35  casinos , according to Grant Govertsen,
an analyst at Union Gaming Group LLC.  “With a global economic recession and leadership changes
in China, VIPs are cutting back,” Govertsen said before the
earnings announcement.  Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut their share price
forecast to HK$25.80 from HK$28.50 to factor in lower gaming
revenue growth growth in Macau and declining market share.  Wynn Macau   shares  rose 0.12 percent to HK$16.54 at the 4
p.m. close in  Hong Kong .  Slowing Growth  Net income for the three months ended in June was $220.6
million, compared with $120.3 million a year earlier, Wynn Macau
said in the filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. The
company’s profit was boosted by a $21 million writeback on a bad
loan provision, Simon Cheung, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in Hong Kong, said in a note to clients.  Profit for the second quarter of 2011 reflected a $107
million charge for a charitable contribution made to the
University of Macau Development Foundation, according to the
company’s year-earlier earnings statement. That donation is part
of a legal dispute between Wynn and Japanese billionaire Kazuo
Okada.  Growth in gambling revenue in the world’s largest gambling
hub has slowed, rising 7.3 percent in May, the weakest pace
since July 2009. Even though  Macau ’s gambling revenue increased
12.2 percent in June to 23.3 billion patacas ($2.9 billion), it
still lagged the 15.3 percent median estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Table games turnover in the VIP segment was $30.3 billion
for the second quarter, a 7.2 percent decline from $32.7 billion
a year earlier, the Macau company said. Excluding items, Las
Vegas-based Wynn Resorts’ profit totaled $1.38 a share, missing
the $1.50 a share average of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Wynn Macau said on May 2 that it won a land grant from
Macau’s government to build its second resort in the former
Portuguese colony. The company will join  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,
 Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) , and  Melco Crown Entertainment
Ltd. (MPEL)  in expanding into the city’s increasingly popular Cotai
Strip.  To contact the reporter on this story:
