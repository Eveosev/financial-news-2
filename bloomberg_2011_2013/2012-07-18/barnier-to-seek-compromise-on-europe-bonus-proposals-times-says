Michel Barnier , the European Union
financial services commissioner, wants shareholders to be given
the power to determine remuneration paid to banking executives,
the London-based Times reported, citing an interview.  A proposal by the European Parliament would see legislation
fixing a ratio between bankers’ pay and bonuses, a plan bank
executives oppose, arguing that it would tend to boost base
salaries and increase fixed costs in investment banking, the
Times said.  While Barnier told the Times he would pursue a compromise
with the lawmakers, he said that “doing nothing is not an
option,” and that the choice is between his proposal and that
of the Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
