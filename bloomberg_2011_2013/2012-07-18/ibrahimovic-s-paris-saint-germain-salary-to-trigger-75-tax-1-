Soccer player Zlatan Ibrahimovic,
who was signed today by  Paris Saint-Germain , will be subject to
French President  Francois Hollande ’s planned 75 percent income
tax rate.  The club’s announcement that it was signing the Swedish
striker from AC Milan on a three-year contract forced the French
government to clarify whether professional athletes will face
the “millionaire tax.” A rate of 75 percent on income of more
than 1 million euros ($1.23 million) was among Hollande’s
election campaign pledges.  Ibrahimovic will earn 14 million euros annually, sports
daily L’Equipe reported. Sports Minister Valerie Fourneyron said
that indicates that European football needs more regulation.  “These sums are astronomic and unreasonable,” Fourneyron
told journalists after a meeting of the French cabinet in Paris.
“They’re among the things that we can deplore today in
football, the complete lack of regulation.”  PSG finished second in  France ’s Ligue 1 last season, three
points behind champion Montpellier. Ibrahimovic is the second
player PSG has signed from AC Milan in as many weeks, after
Brazil defender  Thiago Silva .  To contact the reporters on this story:
