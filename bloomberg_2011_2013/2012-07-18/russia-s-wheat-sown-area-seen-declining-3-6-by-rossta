Russia’s farmers reduced the area
sown with wheat by 3.6 percent, or 900,000 hectares (2.2 million
acres), according to the state statistics service.  The area planted with all grains and legumes increased 1.7
percent to 44.9 million hectares for this year’s crop compared
with 2011, the service, known as Rosstat, said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Sunflower planting dropped more than 14 percent to 6.5
million hectares, and sugar-beets declined 11 percent to 1.1
million hectares, according to Rosstat.  The service didn’t provide a figure for the total area sown
with wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
