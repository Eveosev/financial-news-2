BHP Billiton  Plc, the world’s
largest mining company by market capitalization, said second-
quarter copper production rose 15 percent from a year earlier.  Copper production reached 312,500 metric tons, the
Melbourne-based miner said today in a statement. That’s above
the 303,700 ton median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The global copper surplus will total 18,500 tons, according
to the median of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, 85
percent less than a January forecast of 124,000 tons. Barclays
Plc expects shortages in the first half of next year and Morgan
Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. anticipate an annual deficit.
Prices will rally as much as 14 percent to $8,700 a ton by Dec.
31, the median in a survey of 15 analysts shows.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange
rose 0.3 percent to 253,575 tons today and have declined 45
percent in the past year, according to bourse data.  The price of copper for three-month delivery was little
changed at $7,590 a ton by 1:10 p.m. on the London Metal
Exchange.  Copper output for  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s third-
largest mining company, rose 5 percent to 133,500 tons in the
quarter compared with the same period in 2011, the company said
yesterday in its production report.  BHP Billiton said its zinc output fell 11 percent in the
quarter compared with last year and lead production rose 9
percent. Zinc dropped “as mining progressed through a copper-
rich ore zone,” according to the report.  Zinc and lead prices were down in LME trading today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
