Indian stocks surged the most in a
week amid optimism the government will announce measures to
boost growth and as a rally in European shares eased concerns.  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-largest motorcycle maker, rose
the most since January after its earnings.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) ,
the biggest engineering company, advanced for the first time in
five days. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  added 0.5 percent to
17,185.09, according to preliminary closing prices.  Mamata Banerjee, a mercurial ally of Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh , yesterday abandoned her opposition to the ruling
Congress party pick to be the countryâ€™s next president, ending
weeks of resistance and fueling optimism the government will
announce measures to boost growth. Lawmakers will vote tomorrow.
European stocks rose for the third time in four days as minutes
showed the Bank of England may reconsider the case for an
interest-rate cut.  Singh, who took over the finance ministry last month, has
pledged to revive growth after expansion slowed to 5.3 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in
almost a decade. The Sensex has risen 11 percent this year,
fueled partly by flows from overseas funds.  Foreign  investors  bought local shares for a 11th day on
July 16, the longest stretch of net purchases since February,
data from the regulator show. They have bought a net $9.9
billion of local stocks this year, the highest in  Asia  and a
record for the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
