The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of the close of trading. The
 Merval (MERVAL)  index rose 3.9 percent to 2,496.67.  YPF SA (YPFD)   rose 6.2 percent to 90.25 pesos for the
biggest advance on the Merval index. The Argentine state-run  oil
company  rallied after a newspaper reported the company is
seeking licenses to explore for crude in  Bolivia .  Cresud SA (CRES AF), Argentina’s largest publicly traded
farm company, rose 4.8 percent to 5.87 pesos, after soybeans
jumped to a four-year high and corn resumed this month’s rally
on signs that hot, dry weather during the next 10 days will
prolong a Midwest drought and may cut output in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer.  Pampa Energia SA (PAMP)   rose 5.2 percent to 1.21 pesos.
The company has rallied 10 percent since it announced July 16
that Central Termica Loma de la Lata SA, an Argentine

much as $25 million of outstanding 2015 notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
