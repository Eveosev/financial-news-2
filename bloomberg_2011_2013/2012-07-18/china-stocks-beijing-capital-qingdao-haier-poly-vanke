Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close in Shanghai.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 0.4 percent to 2,169.10. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  added less than 0.1 percent to 2,414.33.  Property stocks:  China Vanke Co. (000002)  (000002 CH), the nation’s

of the 70 cities tracked by the government, compared with six
cities posting month-on-month price gains in May, the National

makes it more difficult for the government to loosen property
curb measures, Zhang Zhiwei, an economist at Nomura Holdings
Inc., wrote in a report.  Beijing Capital Retailing Group Co. (600723)  (600723 CH), a
department-store operator, advanced 5.5 percent to 8.09 yuan,
rising the most since May 14. The company said first-half profit
may have climbed 20 percent from a year earlier.  China Shipping Container Lines Co. (601866)  (601866 CH), the
country’s second-largest carrier of sea-cargo boxes, rose 1.2
percent to 2.57 yuan, the most in a week. The company is
increasing some of its key shipping rates starting next week,
China Shipping Container said in a statement on its website.  Qingdao Haier Co. (600690)  (600690 CH), China’s biggest refrigerator
maker, jumped 6.2 percent to 11.08 yuan, its biggest gain since
May 15. The company said yesterday first-half profit probably
rose between 19 percent and 23 percent from a year earlier.
