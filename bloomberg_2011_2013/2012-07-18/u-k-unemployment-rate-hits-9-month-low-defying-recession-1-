U.K.  unemployment  fell to a nine-
month low in the quarter through May as the  London  Olympics
helped to create jobs, underlining the resilience of the labor
market in the face of a recession and  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The jobless rate based on International Labor Organization
methods fell to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent in the period
through April, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
London. Jobless-benefit  claims  rose 6,100 in June. The increase,
though larger than the 5,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg News
Survey, was inflated by a benefit-rule change that took effect
May 21.  The strength of the labor market is providing a boost for
Prime Minister  David Cameron  as his government axes hundreds of
thousands of state jobs to help cut the  budget deficit  and
struggles to lift the economy out of its second recession since
2009.  “The big question is can the labor market remain resilient
given the economy’s ongoing weakness and the current very
worrying and uncertain outlook,” said  Howard Archer , an
economist at IHS Global Insight in London. “In the very near
term, the staging of the Olympics is likely to help matters
further. However, further out the jobs outlook seems more
problematic.”  The pound extended declines against the dollar after
minutes showed  Bank of England  policy makers considered the case
for an interest-rate cut. Sterling was trading at $1.5609 as of
1:20 p.m. in London, down 0.3 percent on the day.  Stimulus Vote  The Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to increase
 quantitative easing  by 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) to 375
billion pounds, the minutes showed. Chief Economist  Spencer Dale 
and Ben Broadbent dissented in favor of no change to the asset-
purchase target.  The labor-market figures suggest firms are hoarding
workers, leaving scope for a renewed round of job shedding if
the economy fails to improve. Another possible explanation, say
economists, is that lost jobs are being replaced by new ones
with lower levels of pay and productivity.  ILO unemployment fell 65,000 to 2.58 million in the three
months through May, the lowest level since June to August last
year. The 8.1 percent jobless rate compares with 11.1 percent in
the euro region, 8.2 percent in the U.S. and 4.4 percent in
 Japan .  It is also below the peaks reached after recessions in the
early 1980s and early 1990s, when unemployment climbed above 10
percent.  Olympics Boost  The number of people in work climbed 181,000 to 29.4
million, the highest since September-November 2008, with full-
time work accounting for three-quarters of the increase. London
accounted for 61,000 of the gain, partly reflecting hiring for
the  Olympic Games  that open on July 27. London also posted the
biggest drop in unemployment.  The rise in the number of people claiming jobless benefits
last month left the claimant-count  rate  at 4.9 percent. Claims
rose 6,900 in May instead of the 8,100 rise initially reported.
June was affected by a rule change that restricted eligibility
for lone-parent income support, forcing more people onto
Jobseeker’s Allowance, the benefit on which the claims data are
based.  Long-term unemployment increased, with those out of work
for more than two years up by 18,000 since February to 441,000,
the most since 1997. The number without work for more than a
year rose by 3,000 to 885,000, a third of the total.
Unemployment among 16-24-year-olds fell 10,000 to 1.02 million.
The number of vacancies increased by 10,000 in the quarter
through June to 471,000.  ‘Encouraging’ News  Employment Minister Chris Grayling welcomed the figures as
he visited a postal delivery center in central London opened by
TNT Post UK. “This is an encouraging set of figures in what is
still an incredibly difficult economic climate,” he said.  The opposition  Labour Party  said the government is not
doing enough to get people back into work.  “The headline fall in unemployment is a welcome respite in
a blizzard of bad economic news, but it’s alarming that many
regions in Britain saw unemployment continue to spiral up, the
number of young people on the dole long-term has now quadrupled
in a year and long-term unemployment rose sharply again,” said
 Liam Byrne , Labour’s pensions spokesman.  Today’s report showed that pay growth quickened to 1.5
percent in the three months through May from 1.4 percent in the
period through April. Excluding bonuses it was unchanged at 1.8
percent. The figures underscore the squeeze on household budgets
at a time when inflation, though slowing, is running at 2.4
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
