Hokuriku Electric Power Co. (9505)  plunged
21 percent, the most since 1974, in Tokyo trading after
seismologists said there may be an active earthquake fault line
under the No. 1 reactor at its Shika power station.  The utility lost 238 yen to 877 yen, the lowest price since
Dec. 20, 1982, which followed an 8.3 percent fall in the stock
yesterday. The company’s shares are on a five-day losing streak,
the longest since May 9 this year.  Three geological scientists, including Toshifumi Imaizumi
from Tohoku University, said a fault line may be active beneath
the No. 1 reactor during a meeting with the Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency yesterday, Yukinari Nakagawa, an agency
official, said by phone in Tokyo today. The agency and the
scientists plan to meet Hokuriku Electric this month to discuss
the finding, he said. 　  Hokuriku would be forced to decommission the Shika reactor
if the existence of the active fault line was confirmed because
the Nuclear Safety Commission’s doesn’t allow utilities to build
reactors and other key facilities of nuclear power stations on
active  fault lines .  “Hokuriku Electric may be forced to treat this as an
impairment loss, which will have a big impact on the company,”
said Hidetoshi Shioda, an energy-sector analyst at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “Investors are concerned about the
lack of options for Hokuriku if the fault is confirmed as
active,” he said.  Hokuriku’s No. 1 unit at Shika station, which started
operation in 1993, has a generation capacity of 540 megawatts.
The other No. 2 unit at the plant, that can produce 1,206
megawatts, become operational in 2006.  Both units are offline for maintenance, along with
additional safety checks imposed following the March 11
earthquake and tsunami last year that crippled the Fukushima
nuclear plant, causing radiation leaks and mass evacuations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
