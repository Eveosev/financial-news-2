Linsanity is over in New York -- the
Knicks will not match the  Houston Rockets ’ contract offer to
point guard Jeremy Lin, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the situation who requsted anonymity because the
decision had not yet been made public.  The departure of Lin, who averaged 14.6 points and 6.2
assists in 35 National Basketball Association games for the
Knicks last season, was probable after New York signed point
guard  Jason Kidd  and re-acquired point guard  Raymond Felton  in a
trade.  The Knicks had until the end of today to decide whether to
match Houston’s three-year, $25 million offer -- a back-loaded
contract that, under the new collective bargaining agreement
would have cost New York $25 million to $35 million more in the
final season because of the league’s luxury tax.  Lin, the first Chinese- or Taiwanese-American to play in
the NBA, boosted Knicks’ television ratings as well as
merchandise and ticket sales after joining the team’s starting
lineup on Feb. 6.  The person with knowledge of the situation said Lin had
been informed of the decision.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
