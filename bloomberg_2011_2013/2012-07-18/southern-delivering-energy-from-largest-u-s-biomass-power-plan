Southern Co. (SO) , the second-largest
U.S. power company by market value, is delivering electricity to
the grid from its $500 million biomass-fueled plant in Texas.  Austin Energy, the municipal utility owned by Austin,
Texas, will purchase for 20 years the output of the 100-megawatt
Nacogdoches Generating Facility, the largest U.S. biomass plant,
Southern said today in a statement.  Southern, based in Atlanta, bought the plant from American
Renewables LLC in 2009. It also owns two solar power plants with
 Ted Turner  and has agreed to buy 202 megawatts of capacity from
a wind farm under construction in Oklahoma.  Nacogdoches is fueled by wood waste from sawmills and
forestry as well as diseased or other “non-commercial trees,”
Southern said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
