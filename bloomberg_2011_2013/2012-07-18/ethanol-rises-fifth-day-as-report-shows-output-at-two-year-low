Ethanol futures rose to an eight-
month high after the government reported  production  of the
biofuel dropped to the lowest level in more than two years.  Futures gained for the fifth straight day after the Energy
Department said output fell 2.3 percent to 802,000 barrels a day
last week, the least since the agency began tracking weekly data
in 2010 and the longest streak of declines since February 2011.  “There was another huge decline,” said Will Babler, a
broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois .
“The market may see that it’s rolling over and there has to be
a higher bid.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 3.6 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.725 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the highest settlement since Nov. 3. Prices have gained 24
percent this year.  Corn for December delivery advanced 13 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $7.8425 a bushel in Chicago, as the grain-rich
Midwest is mired in a drought. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Distillers are losing 21 cents on each gallon of ethanol
made based on the September contracts for the fuel and corn,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies including
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , Nedak Ethanol LLC,  Green Plains Renewable
Energy Inc. (GPRE)  and  Pacific Ethanol Inc. (PEIX)  have shut down or stopped
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
