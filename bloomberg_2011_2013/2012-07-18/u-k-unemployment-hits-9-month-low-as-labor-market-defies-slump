U.K. unemployment  fell to a nine-
month low in the quarter through May as the London Olympics
helped to create jobs, underlining the resilience of the labor
market in the face of a recession at home and Europe’s worsening
debt crisis.  Unemployment based on International Labour Organization
methods fell to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent in the period
through April,  Office for National Statistics  said today in
London. Unemployment benefit claims rose 6,100 in June. The
increase, though larger than the 5,000 median forecast in a
Bloomberg News Survey, was boosted by a benefit-rule change that
took effect May 21.  The strength of the labor market is providing a boost for
Prime Minister  David Cameron  as his government axes hundreds of
thousands of state jobs to help cut the  budget deficit  and
struggles to lift the economy out of its second recession since
2009.  “Unemployment has been limited in recent months by an
increase in people working part time, more people becoming self-
employed and restrained earnings growth,” said  Howard Archer ,
an economist at IHS Global Insight in London. “The big question
is can the  labour market  remain resilient given the economy’s
on-going weakness.”  The resilience suggests firms are hoarding workers, leaving
scope for a renewed round of job shedding if the economy fails
to improve. Another explanation, say economists, is that lost
jobs are being replaced by new ones with lower levels of pay and
productivity.  Jobless Rate  ILO unemployment fell 65,000 to 2.58 million in the three
months through May. The 8.1 percent jobless rate compares with
rates of 11.1 percent in the euro region, 8.2 percent in the
U.S. and 4.4 percent in  Japan .  It is also below the peaks reached after recessions in the
early 1980s and early 1990s, when unemployment climbed above 10
percent.  The number of people in work climbed 181,000 to 29.4
million, the highest since September-November 2008, with full-
time work accounting for most of the increase. Of the gain in
employment, London accounted for 61,000.  The rise in the number of people claiming jobless benefits
last month left the claimant-count rate at 4.9 percent. Claims
rose 6,900 in May instead of the 8,100 rise initially reported.
June was affected by a rule change that forced more lone parents
to claim Jobseeker’s Allowance.  Today’s report showed that pay growth quickened to 1.5
percent in the three months through May from 1.4 percent.
Excluding bonuses, pay growth was unchanged at 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
