Sicilian Governor Raffaele Lombardo,
under pressure from Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  to
safeguard the region from default, vowed to protect public-
sector jobs, citing the island’s 26,000 park rangers.  “If someone in  Rome  or some fake entrepreneur thinks that
I’m going to fire these people, they can go to hell,” Lombardo
said in a televised press conference yesterday, referring to the
rangers and about 18,500 others on the public payroll. “I won’t
destroy the lives of 50,000 people.”  Lombardo’s resistance demonstrates the challenge facing
Monti as he seeks to ensure Italy’s creditworthiness. The
premier, who forced budget cuts on Italy’s 20 regions by this
month, focused on Sicily this week when he warned the island was
at risk of default and pressed Lombardo to confirm his intention
to resign.  Lombardo said two days ago in a statement that he will step
down. He was elected in 2003 to lead  Italy ’s poorest region with
about 5 million people.  The Sicilian Forestry Department employs about 24,000
workers, according to its  website . That compares with 404 park
rangers employed by the Northern Italian region of Piedmont and
the 600 by Lombardy, according to the magazine Panorama.  “I think about half that number would be enough to do the
job they do,” Lombardo said of Sicily’s forestry staff in a
televised interview with Sky TG24. “But they were hired in the
past, they’re not fireable and they certainly can’t be
murdered.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
