Quarterback Robert Griffin III
signed a four-year, $21.1 million contract with the  Washington
Redskins  and the second pick in the National Football League
draft reported to rookie training camp today.  Griffin’s deal will be fully guaranteed and allows the team
an option to extend it for a fifth year, according to Ben Dogra,
his agent. Griffin signed this morning and will participate in
all activities today, Dogra said in an e-mail.  “Well people....It’s Time to go to Work!!! Off the
unemployment line and oh yeah HTTR!!!!” Griffin said on
Twitter, referencing the team’s fight song, “Hail to the
Redskins.”  The Redskins traded their first-round picks for the next
three years, along with a second-round choice, to the St. Louis
Rams to move up to draft the 2011 Heisman Trophy winner. The 22-
year-old quarterback threw for 4,293 yards and 37 touchdowns
with six interceptions while leading Baylor University to the
Alamo Bowl last season.  Coach  Mike Shanahan  has named Griffin the Redskins’
starter, the  Washington Post (WPO)  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
