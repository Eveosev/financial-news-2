Manchester United  Ltd., the English
soccer team with a record 19 national championships, seeks to
raise $300 million in its U.S. initial public offering and plans
to complete the sale in early August, said a person with
knowledge of the matter.  The club may begin meeting with prospective investors to
pitch the IPO as early as next week, said the person, who asked
not to be named because the plans are private.  Manchester United is moving ahead with its share sale in
the U.S. after scrapping plans for a Singapore offering. While
United received the Singapore stock exchange’s approval in
September to raise $1 billion in an IPO, the process was stalled
as volatile stock markets roiled equity sales.  Proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt, according
to regulatory filings. The club filed earlier this month to
raise $100 million in the U.S., a placeholder amount used to
calculate registration fees.  Jefferies Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. are leading the offering, United’s filing shows.
Philip Townsend, a spokesman for United, didn’t respond to a
phone message seeking comment that was left after regular
business hours in the U.K.  The size and timing of the offering were reported earlier
by the International Business Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
