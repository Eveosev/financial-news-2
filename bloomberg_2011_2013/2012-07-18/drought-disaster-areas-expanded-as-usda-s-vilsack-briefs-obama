Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack
widened the Obama administration’s drought-disaster declaration
as hot, dry conditions baked crops from  California  to Delaware.  Vilsack, who briefed President  Barack Obama  at the White
House today on the federal drought response, said in a statement
that 1,297 counties in 29 states now qualify for disaster
assistance, up from 1,016 counties in 26 states on July 11.  “President Obama and I are committed to ensuring that
agriculture remains a bright spot in our nation’s economy by
sustaining the successes of America’s farmers, ranchers, and
rural communities through these difficult times,” Vilsack said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
