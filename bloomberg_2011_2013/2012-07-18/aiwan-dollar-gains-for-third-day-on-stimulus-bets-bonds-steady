Taiwan ’s government bonds gained and
the overnight rate fell to the lowest level in more than three
months on speculation slowing economic growth will prompt the
central bank to ease monetary policy to spur expansion.  Data due July 20 may show Taiwan’s export orders fell for a
fourth month in June, dropping 2.75 percent from a year earlier,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The  overnight interbank lending rate  fell for a fifth
day, the longest stretch of declines since May 2009, on
speculation the island’s central bank will follow South  Korea  in
reducing borrowing costs.  “ South Korea  central bank’s move has ignited speculation
in the market that Taiwan will follow with a rate cut,” said
Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in
Taipei. “The falling overnight rate shows Taiwan’s monetary
easing has started.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.145 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  Benchmark 10-year rates 
reached a record-low 1.136 percent on July 13.  The  Bank of Korea  unexpectedly reduced borrowing costs to 3
percent on July 12. Its Taiwanese counterpart, which left
 interest rates  unchanged at 1.875 percent last month, is
scheduled to meet again in September.  The overnight rate slipped two basis points to 0.424
percent, the lowest since March 30.  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$30.002 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was little changed at 3.5 percent.  Taiwan’s economy expanded 0.39 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the weakest pace since 2009. The statistics
bureau in May cut its 2012 gross domestic product growth
forecast to 3.03 percent from 3.38 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
