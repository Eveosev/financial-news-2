Siberian Coal Energy Co., Russiaâ€™s
largest coal producer, said it arranged a $200 million six-year
 bank loan  backed by guarantees from Nippon Export & Investment
Insurance.  SUEK, as the coal miner is known, named the loan providers
as Sumitomo and Citibank, without giving further details. The
loan has an 18 months grace period and carries interest of
three-month Libor plus 1.3 percent, it said on its  website . The
company plans to use the proceeds to refinance funding for
developing its coal mines and a seaport terminal near Vanino in
far-eastern Russia.  SUEK, controlled by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko,
increased first-half coal output by 7 percent from a year
earlier to 47.7 million metric tons, it said in a separate
statement. Exports reached 18.3 million tons to markets
including China,  South Korea , the U.K.,  Japan , Taiwan, Germany
and Poland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
