Hong Kong   stocks  fell as Chinese
retailers and food companies retreated after Premier  Wen Jiabao 
warned the mainland’s labor situation will become more
“severe.” A rebound in  China ’s home prices was seen to
constrain the government’s ability to further promote growth.  China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291) , a brewer and operator of
supermarkets, dropped 2.7 percent for a 10th slide in 11 days.
China Resources Land Ltd. declined 5.9 percent. Techtronic
Industries Co., which makes Ryobi power tools and gets 72
percent of sales in  North America , added 4.9 percent as U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
is looking at ways to boost the world’s largest economy if the
labor market stalls.  The Hang Seng Index dropped 1.1 percent to 19,239.88 at the
close of trading in Hong Kong, with more three companies
retreating for each that advanced in the 49-member gauge. Volume
was 22 percent lower than the 30-day intraday average. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies slipped 0.9
percent to 9,292.55. China’s State Council met today.  “Wen’s comments confirmed to the market that the Chinese
economy is worsening and that the pace of the slowdown is much
faster than the government originally thought,” said Lewis Wan,
Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at Pride Investments
Group Ltd., which manages $250 million of assets. “If the
government shows the market that it is determined to provide
stimulus, that would help the market to improve.”  Relative Value  The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 11 percent from this
year’s high in February through today on signs Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening while growth slows in China and the U.S. The
drop cut the  value  of shares on the gauge to 10.1 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.1 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 10.8 for Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  “We will encourage long-term investors to buy at the
moment, especially the banks and developers,” said Pride
Investment’s Wan.  China Resources Enterprise dropped 2.7 percent to HK$20.10,
its lowest level since September 2009, after Wen’s comments
spurred speculation that a difficult labor market will hurt
earnings for companies that sell to consumers.  Tingyi ( Cayman Islands ) Holding Corp., a noodle maker,
slipped 1.5 percent to HK$19.42. Want Want China Holdings Ltd.,
which sells snack foods like rice crackers and beverages,
retreated 4 percent to HK$9.20.  Home Prices  China’s home-price rebound makes it more difficult for the
government to loosen policies aimed at restricting gains in the
property sector, said Nomura Holdings Inc. economist Zhang
Zhiwei. Prices climbed in 25 cities out of the 70 the government
looks at and fell in 21 from a month earlier, according to data
released by the statistics bureau today.  China Resources Land slid 5.9 percent to HK$14.92.  China
Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the biggest Hong Kong-listed
mainland developer by value, fell 4 percent to HK$17.80.  Among other stocks that retreated,  Huaneng Renewables
Corp. (958) , a clean-energy unit of China’s biggest electricity
producer, dropped 14 percent to HK$1, its lowest level since
listing last year. The company said that profit for the first
half of the year may fall by more than 50 percent due to output
constraints and a decrease in wind speed.  Companies that receive revenue from the U.S. increased
after Bernanke’s comments on speculation support for the labor
market will translate into better earnings.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a
supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., advanced 0.1 percent to
HK$14.04.  China Merchants Holdings International Co. (144) , climbed
1.4 percent to HK$24.50. Techtronic added 4.9 percent to
HK$9.90.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 1.4 percent to 19,209.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  rose 2.8 percent to 19.46, indicating
traders expect a swing of about 5.6 percent in the benchmark
index during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
