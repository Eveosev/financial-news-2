  Portucel-Empresa Produtora de Pasta
e Papel SA (PTI) , Portugal’s biggest paper company, is betting on
 Mozambique  to increase production as it lacks resources at home
to raise output, its chief executive officer said.  Mozambique is “clearly a project” that will become a
second platform for Portucel to grow, Chief Executive Jose
Honorio said at a conference in Lisbon today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
