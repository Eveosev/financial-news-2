Honda Motor Co. (7267) , reliant on U.S.
vehicle sales for more than half its profit, said it’s investing
$40 million at its Greensburg, Indiana, plant that produces the
Civic compact and will hire 300 more workers later this year.  The investment will increase the factory’s capacity by
50,000 vehicles to 250,000 a year, Honda said in a statement on
its website. The plant will add production of the Civic Hybrid.  Honda, rebounding from product and part shortages last
year, is on pace this year to break its 2007 record for North
American output. More than 87 percent of the Honda and Acura
models sold in the U.S. through June were made in  North America ,
up from 85 percent a year earlier. The 2011 shortages stemmed
from natural disasters in Japan and  Thailand .  “We’re getting to the point where in North America we can
build the whole line of Honda products and that is a big step
toward flexibility,” Rick Schostek, senior vice president of
the company’s Honda of America Manufacturing unit, told
reporters at an Automotive Press Association meeting in  Detroit .  The company is assembling vehicles at a rate that would
result in 1.7 million produced in North America this year. In
2007, it built 1.43 million units. Tokyo-based Honda assembled a
record 894,196 cars and light trucks in North America in the
first half, up from 510,658 a year ago.  Honda has nine automobile assembly lines in seven plant
sites in North America. Its annual capacity in the region is
1.63 million Honda and Acuras, which will expand to 1.92 million
units in 2014.  Honda’s American depositary receipts  rose  0.9 percent to
$31.65 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
