Egis Gyogyszergyar Nyrt. (EGIS) , a
Hungarian drugmaker, fell for the first time in four days as a
technical indicator showed the stock was overbought.  The shares dropped 0.9 percent to 15,665 forint by 11:24
a.m. in Budapest. The 4.3 percent advance in the past three days
pushed the stock’s 14-day  relative strength index  to 72, above
the 70 level which indicates to some analysts that a security is
oversold. The RSI last stood at 68.  “Egis is soon becoming overbought,” Erste Group Bank AG
wrote in a research report sent by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
