Alex Mallinson has left  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  in London, where he was the head trader
for collateralized debt obligations, three people with knowledge
of the matter said.  RBS spokeswoman Rebecca Nelson in London declined to
comment. Mallinson couldn’t be reached on his mobile phone.  Mallinson joined RBS in 2002, according to Financial
Services Authority’s website.  Collateralized debt obligations package bonds or loans into
a pool of assets that are divided into tranches of varying risk
and return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
