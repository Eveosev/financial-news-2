India , with about 17 percent of the
world’s population, issued a third draft of a National Water
Policy after states objected to the division of federal and
local legislative powers governing the use of water.  The draft follows efforts in January and May to devise a
nationwide legal framework regulating water in a country that
has only 4 percent of the world’s renewable water resources,
India’s water resources ministry said.  With a growing population, rising agricultural needs and
difficulties with wider access to safe water for drinking and
domestic demand, “there is a felt need to evolve a broad
overarching national legal framework of general principles on
water to lead the way for essential legislation on water
governance in every state,” the ministry said last month.  The latest draft echoed that statement, focusing on the
need to manage water as a community resource amid a national
legal framework,  Press Trust of India  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
