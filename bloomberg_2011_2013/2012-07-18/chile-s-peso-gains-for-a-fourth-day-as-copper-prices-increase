Chile’s peso rose for a fourth day
versus the  U.S. dollar , its longest winning streak in four
weeks, as gains in copper bolstered the outlook for export
revenue.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 488.97 per U.S. dollar at
10:26 a.m. Santiago time, extending its longest winning streak
since the five-day period ended June 19.  “The peso and copper are internalizing a relatively more
optimistic scenario,” Sergio Tricio, head of research at
ForexChile, said in an interview from Santiago.  The price of copper, Chile’s main export, rose 0.3 percent
in  New York .  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is speaking for a
second day today before Congress. Bernanke expressed concern
yesterday about the U.S. economic recovery and said he doesn’t
see inflation as a hindrance to providing more monetary
stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
