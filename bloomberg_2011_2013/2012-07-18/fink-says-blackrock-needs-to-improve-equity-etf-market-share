BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK)  Laurence D. Fink,
who heads the world’s largest asset manager, said his firm needs
to capture a larger share of the deposits that are going into
U.S. equity exchange-traded funds.  “We are not happy with our market share in the second
quarter in U.S. equity ETFs,” Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive
officer, said in a telephone interview today.  BlackRock today said second-quarter  profit  fell 11 percent
as slumping markets worldwide eroded fees for overseeing client
money. Assets fell 3 percent to $3.56 trillion, hurt by market
declines and $29.4 billion in client redemptions, including $5.5
billion from the firm’s iShares stock ETFs.  The iShares unit, which is the world’s largest ETF
provider, has more than 250 products, yet ETF flows during the
second quarter were into “commoditized ETFs,” or large index
products, Fink said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
