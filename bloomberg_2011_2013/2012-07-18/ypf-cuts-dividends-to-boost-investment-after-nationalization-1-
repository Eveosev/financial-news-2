YPF SA (YPFD)  decreased dividend payments
and raised investment as the company seized by  Argentina ’s
government in April seeks to bolster oil production.  The South American country’s biggest oil producer allocated
dividend payments of $66 million, or 5.7 percent of last year’s
profit, according to a regulatory filing distributed after a
shareholder meeting yesterday.  Argentina seized 51 percent of YPF from  Spain ’s Repsol SA
as President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government seeks
to halt declining oil output and stem fuel imports that doubled
to $9.4 billion last year. The government opposed YPF dividends
that exceeded 80 percent of profits.  Shareholders also expressed their opposition to “the
previous administration characterized by falling oil and gas
reserves, production and exploration,” the company said in the
statement.  Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio allocated $1.3
billion of earnings toward total planned investment in 2012 of
$3.5 billion. Investment last year was $3.1 billion, according
to a filing sent to the stock exchange in February.  YPF shares, unchanged at 85 pesos yesterday, have tumbled
49 percent in  Buenos Aires  trading this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
