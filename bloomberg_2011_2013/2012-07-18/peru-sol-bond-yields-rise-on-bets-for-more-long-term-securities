Peruvian bonds fell, pushing yields
on benchmark securities higher, on speculation the government
will issue more long-term debt as part of its financing plan for
this year.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 4.65 percent today, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.357 centimo to 121.118 centimos per
sol.  The  Finance Ministry  last month sold 216 million soles ($82
million) worth of new bonds due September 2023, the government’s
first local issue this year. The ministry said April 11 it will
also sell more of its 2015, 2017 and 2042 bonds as part of its
plan to sell $1.1 billion of local-currency debt this year.  “People are reducing some of their holdings in the 2020
bonds” on bets the government will issue 2023 or 2042
securities in its next auction, said Walther Benavides, a fixed-
income trader at  BBVA Banco Continental  in  Lima . “They are
looking to reallocate some of those holdings to longer-term
bonds.”  An official at the ministry’s press office said he didn’t
have details on the next auction.  The sol closed little changed at 2.6200 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.6195 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit.  The central bank  bought  $77 million in the  spot market 
today to slow the sol’s advance, extending its purchases this
month to $581 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
