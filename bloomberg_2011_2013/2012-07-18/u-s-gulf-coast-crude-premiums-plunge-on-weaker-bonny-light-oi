U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums
plunged a day after Nigerian Bonny Light oil weakened to the
lowest level versus Light Louisiana Sweet since March, boosting
the appeal of sending cargoes from West Africa to the U.S.  Bonny Light sank to $2.61 a barrel  below  the U.S. Gulf
Coast benchmark grade yesterday, the largest discount since
March 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bonny Light
competes with domestic light, sweet, crude grades, such as LLS.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
decreased $1.75 today to $16.10 a barrel at 2:14 p.m. in  New
York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet lost $1.80 to $15.45 over.  Poseidon’s premium decreased $2.35 to $10.55 a barrel,
while Southern Green Canyon lost $3 to $9.10 over WTI. Mars
Blend decreased $2.30 to $10.80 a barrel over the U.S.
benchmark.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, decreased $1.50 to a
$14.50 premium.  Syncrude strengthened 50 cents to a $3 premium to WTI.
Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in
 Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened $2.80 to $16.55 a
barrel below WTI.  Bakken oil’s discount was steady at 50 cents below the U.S.
benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
