Italian Finance Minister  Vittorio Grilli  said Europe has sufficient resources to rescue troubled
nations amid delays to the activation of the area’s new bailout
fund.  Even though the European Stability Mechanism “isn’t
operational already by this July, I don’t believe there is
reason to worry,” Grilli said today in testimony before the
 Foreign Affairs , Budget and European Affairs committees of the
parliament’s lower house in Rome. In the meantime, the European
Financial Stability Facility, the area’s existing bailout
program, is available, Grilli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
