Nordgold NV, billionaire  Alexey
Mordashov ’s mining company, cut its 2012 output target by about
10 percent because of “production bottlenecks” at mines
including Taparko and Lefa in West Africa and Berezitovy in
Russia.  The target was reduced to 720,000 to 770,000 ounces,
Nordgold said in a statement today. That’s about 10 percent
below the midpoint of the earlier guidance of 800,000 ounces to
850,000 ounces provided on April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
