Two- and five-year German government
notes advanced, pushing yields to record lows, as investors
sought the nation’s debt as a haven.  The five-year yield fell as much as 4 basis points to 0.254
percent, the lowest level since Bloomberg began tracking the
data in 1990. The two-year note yield fell to a record minus
0.074 percent.  Germany  today sold two-year securities at a negative yield
for the first time. The Frankfurt-based Bundesbank allotted 4.17
billion euros ($5.11 billion) of notes with an average rate of
minus 0.06 percent.  “Investors who bought the two-year notes were seeking
quality and security, for that they accept lower returns,” said
Boris Knapp, spokesman at Germany’s Finance Agency in  Frankfurt .
“The market is still under pressure,” he said in a telephone
interview today.  German borrowing costs have plunged over the past year as
investors sought the safest investments to shield themselves
from  Europe ’s financial turbulence. Such low borrowing costs
help German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  as she seeks to reduce
Germany’s  debt burden . Meantime, rates in Italy and Spain have
surged, with 10-year yields topping 6 and 7 percent
respectively.  “There is clear need for safety,” Citigroup Inc.
strategists  Tom Fitzpatrick  and Shyam Devani said in a note to
clients today. “We are increasingly seeing a more divided, two-
tier Europe.”  Merkel said today that the “European project” might be at
risk unless policy makers work harder. She spoke in an interview
on her party’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
