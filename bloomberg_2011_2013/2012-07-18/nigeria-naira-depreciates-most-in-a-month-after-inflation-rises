Nigeria ’s naira depreciated the most
in almost a month after inflation accelerated.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated as
much as 1.4 percent, the biggest intraday decline since June 22,
to 162.500 per dollar and traded 0.4 weaker at 160.8 as of 2:25
p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  inflation  rate rose to 12.9 percent in June, from 12.7
percent in May, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics
said today in an e-mailed statement. The  Central Bank of Nigeria 
held the  benchmark interest rate  at a record-high 12 percent
this year to curb the naira’s decline and combat inflation,
after raising it 5.75 percentage points in 2011.  “The depreciation is in reaction to the higher inflation
environment which has a tendency to slow inflows and put naira
under pressure,” Sewa Wusu, currency analyst at Lagos-based
Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.
“The increase in inflation may induce the  central bank  to raise
the benchmark rate.”  Nigeria sold $300 million at a foreign-currency auction
today, the most since July 2, at 155.87 per dollar, the Abuja-
based central bank said in an e-mailed statement.  The yield on Nigeria’s 7-year domestic bonds due June 2019
fell seven basis points to 16.12 percent, according to the July
17 data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 slid
seven basis points to 5.425 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.9550 per dollar in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
