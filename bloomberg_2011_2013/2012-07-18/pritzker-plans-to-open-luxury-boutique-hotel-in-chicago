John Pritzker, son of the late  Hyatt
Hotels Corp. (H)  founder Jay Pritzker, and investment company  AJ
Capital Partners  agreed to buy the  Chicago  Athletic Association
building and convert it to a luxury boutique hotel.  The partners will pay $13 million for the historic South
Michigan Avenue property, formerly home to a private club, and
spend $20 million on the conversion, John Pritzker said in a
telephone interview. The purchase from Dallas-based Lone Star
Funds is scheduled for completion by the end of the day on July
20, said Ben Weprin, founder of Chicago-based AJ Capital.  The hotel, which will have 240 to 260 rooms when it opens
in early 2014, will be operated as a Thompson Hotels property,
Pritzker said. Thompson, whose other locations include the
 Hollywood Roosevelt  hotel in  Los Angeles , is one of the brands
owned by closely held Commune Hotels & Resorts. Pritzker is co-
chairman of the New York-based company.  Commune has two other hotels in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
