Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
 Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank, plans to raise about 500
million francs ($509 million) this year by selling real estate,
part of a plan to increase capital by 15.3 billion francs.  The lender is in advanced talks to sell two major
properties and an undisclosed number of smaller buildings to
investors, Credit Suisse said in a  statement  today. The Zurich-
based bank will sell more real estate next year and in 2014,
according to a  presentation  to investors.  Marc Dosch , a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to
comment on the real estate sales beyond the statement.  European banks are trying to sell real estate to help meet
stricter capital rules. Credit Suisse is seeking to bolster its
balance sheet after the Swiss central bank said in June that it
required a “marked increase” in capital.  Credit Suisse sold its London headquarters to Qatar
Investment Authority earlier this year for an undisclosed
amount, according to a statement at the time by a unit of the
sovereign-wealth fund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
