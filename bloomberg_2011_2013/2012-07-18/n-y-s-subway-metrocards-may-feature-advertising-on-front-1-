New York  commuters may soon hold ads
in their hands again as the  Metropolitan Transportation
Authority  sells space on the front of MetroCards for the first
time since the subway-token replacement was introduced in 1993.  The cards, which riders swipe to board the subways and
buses, have had advertisements on their backs since 1995. Their
yellow-and-blue fronts have been decorated only with the MTA
logo, a magnetic strip and the words “Insert this way/This side
facing you.”  “Millions of  New Yorkers  carry MetroCards with them
everywhere they go, and use them multiple times a day,” MTA
Chairman Joseph J. Lhota said in a statement today. “For those
with a message and a desire to reach millions of people in a
novel, attention-getting way, there is no better way to
advertise.”  The change is part of an MTA effort to reap more revenue by
selling advertising space. Other initiatives include selling
space on the exteriors of trains -- including full coverage --
and digital ads inside the system.  No companies currently buy ads on MetroCards, said Aaron
Donovan, an agency spokesman. The ads on the back will cost from
18 cents to 51 cents per card, depending on quantity, or about
$25,500 to $450,000. An ad on the front will sell for more, the
agency said, without disclosing the premium.  Captive Audience  The agency estimates advertising revenue at $120 million
this year, up from $38 million in 1997. In recent years,
MetroCard advertising has netted as much as $165,000 and as
little as $16,000. Past advertisers include  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) ,
 Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ)  and  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)   The MTA, which carries 8.5 million riders daily on the New
York City subway and bus system and Metro-North and Long Island
Rail Road commuter rail lines, passed a $12.7 billion budget in
December. According to its February financial plan, the agency
projects a $1 million cash balance for 2012 and an $80 million
cash balance for 2013, which will be used to reduce deficits of
as much as $204 million in 2014 and 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
