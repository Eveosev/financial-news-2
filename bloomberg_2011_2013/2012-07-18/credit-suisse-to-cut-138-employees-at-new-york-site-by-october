Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-
biggest Swiss bank, told  New York  state regulators it will
eliminate 138 jobs in Manhattan starting next month.  The dismissals affect offices at 1 Madison Ave. and 11
Madison Ave. and will occur Aug. 7 through Oct. 14, the bank
wrote today in a Department of Labor filing. The firm said last
year it would cut 3,500 jobs as part of effort to reduce costs
in operations including its investment bank. In May, it filed
paperwork to cut 126 jobs through Aug. 6 at the same New York
location.  Financial companies, mainly in Western Europe and the U.S.,
disclosed plans last year to eliminate more than 200,000
positions as they adapt to  capital requirements  and prolonged
economic weakness. Jack Grone, a spokesman for Zurich-based
Credit Suisse, declined to comment beyond the filing.  The lender, led by Chief Executive Officer  Brady Dougan ,
said today itâ€™s seeking to cut an additional 1 billion francs
($1.02 billion) in costs by the end of 2013 as the firm
increases capital. It aims to cut costs by 550 million francs at
the investment bank and by about 450 million francs at the
private bank. Dougan declined to provide details on whether new
cost-cutting measures would result in job losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
