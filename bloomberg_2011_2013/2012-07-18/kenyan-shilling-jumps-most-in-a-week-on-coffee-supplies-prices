Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
third day, gaining the most in more than a week, on higher
dollar inflows from increased coffee supplies at the weekly
auction and higher tea prices.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
0.1 percent to 83.95 by 2:41 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, the
most on a closing basis since July 9, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Kenya’s coffee supplies rose 68 percent to 32,581 bags of
50-kilograms (110-pound) each from 19,389 bags at the previous
sale on July 3, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said in an e-mailed
statement today. Sales at the auction almost doubled to $3.94
million from $1.98 million over the same period as buyers
replenished stocks before a four-week break that began
yesterday, the exchange said. The auction will resume on Aug.
14, it said.  African tea prices rose to an average of $2.98 a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) at a weekly sale in  Mombasa , Kenya, Tea Brokers
East Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement today. Prices
climbed from $2.92 a week earlier.  “The shilling recouped its losses after dollars from tea
and coffee sector,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in a note
to clients today.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 500 million shillings
($5.9 million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a weighted
average rate of 14.5 percent, a bank official who declined to be
identified in line with policy said by phone from Nairobi. It
also accepted 500 million shillings of 11-day term-auction
deposits at 14.3 percent, the official said.  Uganda ’s shilling gained for a second day, rising 0.1
percent to 2,467.50 per dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling
strengthened by less than 0.1 percent to 1,585 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
