Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second-biggest bank, is offering to buy back some
of its bonds as part of its plan to increase capital.  The buyback targets 11 capital instruments in dollars,
euros and pounds, and five senior bonds in dollars, the Zurich-
based bank said today in a statement. Credit Suisse bought back
4.7 billion francs of bonds in March.  Credit Suisse announced today it plans to increase capital
by 15.3 billion francs ($15.6 billion) this year and cut an
additional 1 billion francs in costs by the end of 2013.  Chief Executive Officer  Brady Dougan  said the measures will
almost double the bank’s capital ratio from levels at the end of
March, which the  Swiss National Bank  said required a “marked
increase.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
