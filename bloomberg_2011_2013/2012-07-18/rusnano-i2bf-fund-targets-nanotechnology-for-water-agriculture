Rusnano Capital LLC  teamed up with
New York-based I2BF Global Ventures to invest $150 million in
nanotechnologies for  Russia ’s agriculture and water industries.  Rusnano Capital, a unit of Russia’s state-owned OAO
Rusnano, and clean-technology investor I2BF started a seven-year
fund to invest in international businesses whose applications
can be used in Russia, they said in an e-mailed statement. The
I2BF-RNC Strategic Resources Fund, with a target size of $150
million, has $53 million already committed, they said.  Nanotechnology, which deals with matter on a scale
comparable to the diameter of a strand of DNA, can be used to
remove pollutants and salt from water, improve soil fertility
and boost crops. Drought, still affecting nine regions in
Russia, has damaged grains on 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million
acres) of land this year, according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  “Agriculture and water-supply industries in Russia offer
an immense source for growth,” Irina Rapoport, chief executive
officer of Rusnano Capital, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
