A bomb destroyed 22 fuel tankers and
trailers carrying NATO supplies in the northern Afghan province
of Samangan today. Taliban spokesman  Zabihullah Mujahed  said the
guerrilla movement planted the device.  The vehicles’ drivers were sleeping as the explosion set
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization convoy ablaze at about 2
a.m. local time, Siddiq Azizi, the spokesman for the province’s
governor, said by phone. The tankers had arrived from Mazar-e-
Sharif after crossing the border from the central Asian nation
of Uzbekistan, he said.  Martyn Crichton, a spokesman for the U.S.-led International
Security Force in  Afghanistan , said police were investigating
the attack on what he said were civilian tankers.  Pakistan  this month allowed supplies to be transported
across its border with Afghanistan, seven months after routes
were closed to protest the November killing of 24 Pakistani
troops by U.S. helicopters in a nighttime strike.  The closing of the supply routes forced the U.S. and NATO
to send more material and equipment from the north, through
Central Asia, at an added cost that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta estimated at about $100 million a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
