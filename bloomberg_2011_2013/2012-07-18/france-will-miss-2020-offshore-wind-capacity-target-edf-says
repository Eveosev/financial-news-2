France  will fail to meet a target to
develop 6,000 megawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2020,
according to Electricite de France SA, the country’s biggest
developer of the renewable energy.  By the start of the next decade, France will be on the way
to having 3,928 megawatts, according to EDF estimates in a
report published today by the French Senate. Half of that
capacity will begin producing power after 2020, the report
quoted EDF as saying.  France’s offshore wind target is part of goals set by the
country to raise renewable energy production to 23 percent of
output by the next decade from 13 percent last year. EDF and
partners including turbine maker  Alstom SA (ALO)  in April won three of
the four orders for offshore wind farms awarded in the first
French government bidding round for the energy.  The projects will require about 7 billion euros ($8.6
billion) of investment for 1,920 megawatts off Normandy and
Brittany.  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  got the fourth contract.  EDF’s estimate of French offshore wind capacity in 2020 was
contained a report published today on the costs of electricity
production in France. One chapter submitted by the Cour des
Comptes state auditor examined the expected costs of subsidies
for renewable energy output, with EDF forecasting offshore wind
power costs at 1.2 billion euros in 2020 compared with estimates
of 2.6 billion euros by the French energy regulator and 2.3
billion euros by the energy ministry.  Subsidies for renewable power will increase 10-fold to as
much as 7.5 billion euros by 2020 compared with 2010, the report
said. A tax on household power bills known as the CSPE would
have to double to pay for it.  The former government said another round of tenders for
offshore wind farms would take place this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
