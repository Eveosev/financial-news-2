Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP was assailed by
the U.S. trustee who supervises bankruptcies over bonus and
retention plans that she said may not be cost effective or
economically feasible for a liquidating  law firm .  Dewey, which owes secured lenders more than $225 million,
now employs 52 people, plus managers, to bill former clients and
collect money with help from an operational staff. Retention
payments of $450,000 might not be economically feasible and the
liquidating firm hasn’t provided information to support its
bonus plan, the trustee, Tracy Hope Davis, said in a filing
today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  The defunct firm is proposing to pay as much as $700,000 in
bonuses. Davis, who oversees bankruptcies in the  New York 
region, earlier criticized nine of Dewey’s proposals to hire
advisers, including the law firm Togut Segal & Segal LLP, and a
six-week budget of $7 million for paying the firms. A judge
approved several of the hirings anyway.  Albert Togut declined to comment on the trustee’s latest
objections.  The case is In re Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 12-12321,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
