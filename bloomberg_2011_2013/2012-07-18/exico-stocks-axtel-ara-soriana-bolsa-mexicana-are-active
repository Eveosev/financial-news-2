The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico City trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IPC index  fell 1.3 percent to 40,747.47.  Consorcio Ara SAB (ARA*)  ,  Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO)  ,
 Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB)   and  Controladora
Comercial Mexicana SAB (COMERUBC)   are likely to leave the
nation’s benchmark index in the next rebalancing in September,
Santander analysts including  Gonzalo Fernandez  said in a
research note today. The projected changes assume the use of a
new methodology, which is subject to the outcome of a lawsuit,
according to Santander.  Ara fell 1.4 percent to 4.25 pesos. Axtel declined 3.6
percent to 2.93 pesos. Soriana retreated 1.2 percent to 39.90
pesos. Comercial Mexicana rose 2.5 percent to 31.49 pesos.  Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB  (BOLSAA MM), the operator of
Mexico’s securities exchange, fell 3.7 percent to 25.12 pesos.
The exchange lowered its forecast for full-year net income to a
range of 720 million pesos ($55 million) to 725 million pesos,
down from 745 million pesos to 750 million pesos, officials said
on a conference call with analysts today. The change reflects
lower expectations for derivatives volumes and increased
expenses for technology, Ramon Guemez, the company’s investor
relations chief, said on the call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
