Nordgold NV (NORD) , the Russian gold
producer that controls three-quarters of  High River Gold Mines
Ltd. (HRG) , said it will bid for the remaining shares in an offer
valuing the Canadian miner at about $1.2 billion.  Nordgold, spun off from steelmaker  OAO Severstal (SVST)  this year,
will offer C$1.40 ($1.38), or 0.285 global depositary receipt,
for each High River share, it said today in a statement. The GDR
offer represents a 17 percent premium to the price on July 17
and a 30 percent premium to the three-month average, it said.  High River, based in Toronto, operates in Nordgold’s main
areas of focus in  Russia  and West Africa. The acquisition will
allow Nordgold, controlled by billionaire Alexey Mordashov, to
increase its tradable shares, or free float, after the company’s
London-traded GDRs slumped 37 percent since the spinoff.  A swap may raise the number of shares traded and held by
minorities to about 23 percent, Chief Executive Officer Nikolai Zelenski said on a conference call. He said he expects the
majority of High River minority holders to favor the share swap
over cash. About a third of High River minorities have already
agreed to swap their stock for Nordgold GDRs, according to the
statement.  “The low liquidity of the shares is the main reason why
Nordgold trades at a 50 percent discount to its global
competitors,” said Alexei Morozov, a UBS AG analyst. Minority
holders account for about 10 percent of the company, compared
with a targeted 17 percent when Severstal announced the spinoff.  Nordgold GDRs dropped as much as 4 percent in  London  to
$4.80, and traded at $4.95 as of 1:54 p.m. local time. High
River closed at C$1.23 yesterday in Toronto.  Nordgold, which increased second-quarter output 6 percent
from the previous three months to 165,300 gold equivalent ounces
and reduced 2012 production target by 10 percet to as much as
770,000 ounce, will use existing cash to fund the bid, which
will be open for 35 days after it’s mailed to shareholders. The
company didn’t specify a date.  Nordgold has appointed Jefferies International Ltd. and
Troika Dialog as advisers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
