OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY)  climbed in  New
York  to trade at the biggest premium versus Moscow shares in two
weeks and Russian futures rallied as a pledge by Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to stimulate growth sent Brent higher.  American depositary receipts of Surgut, as Russia’s fourth-
largest oil producer is known, jumped yesterday to the highest
level since May 4, trading 3.6 percent higher than the shares in
Moscow. Futures expiring in September on the dollar-denominated
 RTS index (RTSI$)  gained 1.1 percent to 138,940 as the  Bloomberg Russia-
US 14 Index (RUS14BN)  of the most traded Russian companies in New York
rose for a third day.  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  surged the most in two
months after the company said it began broadcasting in  Asia .  Brent, the grade that underpins prices for Russia’s Urals
export blend, capped the longest stretch of gains since February
after Bernanke told U.S. lawmakers the central bank is ready to
take further action to support an economic recovery. Russia, the
world’s largest oil producer outside of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, received about half of its 2011
budget revenue from sales of oil and natural gas, according to
government data.  “Russian stocks and oil are benefiting from the belief
that the Fed will undertake another round of quantitative
easing,” Ian Hague, who helps oversee $1.3 billion as a partner
at Firebird Management LLC, said by phone yesterday in New York.
“The price of oil will continue to be weighed by concerns over
global growth, so any evidence that growth is reviving will be
very supportive.”  Bernanke’s Speech  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded fund
that holds Russian shares, advanced for a third day, adding 1.6
percent to $26.90. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the index futures, rose for the second day in
three, adding 1.8 percent to 31.20 points. The Bloomberg Russia-
US 14 Index increased 1 percent to 90.84.  Bernanke spoke in Washington after data made public on July
16 showed that U.S. retail sales contracted in June. The Fed
will consider asset purchases as well as interest-rate
reductions to spur growth in the world’s largest economy, he
said.  Chinese authorities may also announce measures to support
their economy after the  International Monetary Fund  cut on July
16 its forecast for China’s growth this year to 8 percent from
8.2 percent three months ago.  ‘Behind the Curve’  “Investors are looking for signs that bankers are ahead of
the curve instead of behind the curve,”  Bruce Bower , a partner
at Moscow-based hedge fund Verno Capital, which manages more
than $200 million in Russia, said by phone yesterday. “Any
moves to loosen monetary policy shows that banks are being
aggressive, which is a real positive.”  Surgut gained 3.2 percent to $6.11. Shares in Moscow fell
0.7 percent to 19.14 rubles, or 59 U.S. cents yesterday. One ADR
equals to 10 common shares.  OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY) , the oil arm of Russia’s gas export
monopoly, jumped 2.4 percent to $23.94, an 11-week high, after
 shares  in Moscow gained 1.8 percent to 155.06 rubles, or the
equivalent of $4.78. One ADR equals five ordinary shares.  “The biggest component for  Russia  is the price of oil and
global risk appetite, and both have been favorable lately,”
Bower said.  Crude for August delivery rose 0.9 percent to settle at
$89.22 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Crude was
supported by a forecast that U.S. oil  supplies  probably fell in
the week ended July 13 as refineries processed more crude into
gasoline, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Brent oil for September settlement advanced for a fifth
day, climbing 0.6 percent to $104 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals crude was little changed at
$104.40.  CTC Expansion  CTC Media climbed the most since May 3, adding 2.5 percent
to $7.69. The Moscow-based broadcaster said it signed an
agreement with Thai Media Export Co. to begin operating CTC-
International in Phuket,  Thailand .  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s biggest natural gas exporter,
gained 1.8 percent to $9.54 after Troika reiterated its buy
recommendation on the stock. Gazprom  shares  in Moscow rose 0.8
percent to 154.96 rubles, or the equivalent of $4.78. One ADR
represents two ordinary shares.  The RTS Index in Moscow advanced for a fourth day, rising
0.4 percent to 1,387.61 while the 30-stock  Micex (INDEXCF)  Index gained
0.6 percent to 1,430.17, its highest since July 5.  The Micex has gained 2 percent in 2012 and trades at 5.3
times analysts’ earnings estimates for companies in the index.
That compares with a 5 percent decline for Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV) 
gauge, which trades at 10 times estimated earnings, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades
at 9.6 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India Sensitive
Index (SENSEX)  has a ratio of 13.4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
