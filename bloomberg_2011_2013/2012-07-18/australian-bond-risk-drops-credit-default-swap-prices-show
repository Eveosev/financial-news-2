The cost of protecting Australian
corporate bonds from default declined, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
175 as of 10:52 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  The index was set for its lowest
closing level since July 11, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 166 basis points
as of 8:36 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show.
The measure has traded between 210 and 132.5 basis points this
year, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 179.5
basis points as of 9:32 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The index has declined from this yearâ€™s peak of 217 basis
points on May 18, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
