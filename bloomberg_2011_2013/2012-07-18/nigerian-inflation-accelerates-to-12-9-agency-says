Nigeria’s inflation rate rose to
12.9 percent in June, adding to pressure on the central bank to
keep interests rates unchanged at a record high next week.  Inflation in  Africa ’s top oil producer accelerated from
12.7 percent in May, the Abuja-based  National Bureau of
Statistics  said today in an e-mailed report. Prices rose 1.2
percent in the month.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria , led by Governor Lamido Sanusi,
has kept its policy rate unchanged at 12 percent this year,
after raising it by 5.75 percentage points in 2011, to curb
price pressures. The Monetary Policy Committee has forecast
inflation will peak at 14.5 percent in the third quarter,
boosted by fuel costs after the government partially removed
subsidies.  “Governor Sanusi and his committee will remain quite
comfortable holding rates steady for now,” Andrea Masia, an
economist at Morgan Stanley in Johannesburg, said in a note to
clients before today’s data. “Further tightening does not
appear high on the agenda either.”  The central bank expects inflation to ease below 10
percent, its target, by the end of 2013.  Gasoline prices were increased to 97 naira ($0.61) a liter
(0.26 gallon) from 65 naira in January. The government in June
raised electricity prices by at least 40 percent for most
middle-income consumers.  Inflation accelerated last month because of higher food and
energy costs, the statistics office said. Food prices rose 0.5
percent in June from the previous month, compared with a 1.2
percent increase in May. The core inflation rate, which excludes
food, rose to 15.2 percent from 14.9 percent, it said.  Nigeria ’s economic growth is forecast to slow to 6.5
percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2011 as the global
recovery loses momentum, the statistics agency said on May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
