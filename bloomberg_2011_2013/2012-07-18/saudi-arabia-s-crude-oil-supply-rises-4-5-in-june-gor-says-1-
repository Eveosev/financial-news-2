The quantity of oil supplied to the
market by  Saudi Arabia  in June rose by 445,000 barrels a day to
10.3 million barrels a day, according to the Gulf Oil Review.  The kingdom’s actual production rate was 10.1 million
barrels a day last month, compared with 9.8 million in May, the
report, published by Petroleum Policy Intelligence, showed.  Upward momentum in the oil price “will need a major
improvement in the global outlook, a larger-than-expected supply
shock, and an unlikely reversal of output policy from Saudi
Arabia,” according to the report. Prices over the next two
weeks will probably trade “slightly above the producers’
preferred price of $100 a barrel, as uncertainties about  Iran 
and expectations for stimulus measures outweigh concern about
the global economy.”  Brent oil, the benchmark grade for more than half the
world’s crude, dropped below $100 a barrel in June for the first
time in eight months amid concern that the European crisis will
hamper economic growth in  Asia  and the U.S. Brent traded at
$103.91 a barrel as of 12.29 p.m. in  London .  Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, is pumping
at the highest rate in more than three decades to calm prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
