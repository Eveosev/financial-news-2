Gold futures fell the most in a week
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  provided no
specific plans for more purchases of  U.S. debt  to bolster the
economy.  Bernanke told lawmakers yesterday that policy makers are
studying options for further easing. The dollar rebounded
against a basket of currencies, eroding the appeal of precious
metals as alternative investments.  “Gold came under pressure as the dollar resumed its ascent
in the wake of an uncooperative Fed,” Jon Nadler, an analyst at
Kitco Inc., a precious-metal refiner and research company in
 Montreal , said in a report.  On the Comex in  New York , gold futures for August delivery
fell 1.2 percent to close at $1,570.80 an ounce at 1:42 p.m.,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since July 6. The
price has dropped 17 percent from the record settlement on Aug.
22.  Gold surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the central bank kept borrowing costs at a record
low and bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing. Policy makers are scheduled to announce a
rate decision on Aug. 1.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 0.8 percent
to $27.095 an ounce. The metal has slumped 33 percent in the
past 12 months.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 1.2 percent to $1,404.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery slipped 1 percent to
$577.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
