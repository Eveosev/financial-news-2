Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, will halt sales of group long-
term care coverage as low interest rates pressure returns.  Policies already sold remain in effect and are renewable,
the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer said today in a statement.  Prudential said in March it would stop selling individual
long-term care policies and joins rivals in retreating from the
industry as low interest rates limit investment income on funds
set aside to cover claims that may not arise for decades.
 MetLife Inc. (MET) , the No. 1 U.S. life insurer, said it would stop
selling the coverage in 2010 and  Unum Group (UNM)  said this year it
would exit the group business.  “The decision reflects the impact of the continued low
interest-rate environment,” Prudential said in the statement.
Stopping sales will help the insurer “further its longer-term
goal of sustainable, profitable growth in its core group life
and disability lines of business.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said the
central bank will keep U.S.  interest rates  low through at least
2014 to stimulate growth in the world’s largest economy. Low
rates can pressure income at insurers that rely on bond
investments to back liabilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
