U.S.  stocks  rose for a second day
after companies from  Intel Corp. (INTC)  to  Honeywell (HON)  International Inc.
reported profit that beat estimates and housing starts increased
to the fastest rate in almost four years.  Technology stocks had the  biggest advance  out of 10 groups
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as Intel jumped 3.3 percent
after posting profit that topped projections while scaling back
its annual sales forecast. Honeywell surged 6.7 percent, pacing
gains in industrial companies. EMC Corp. rallied 9.4 percent
after announcing a new chief executive officer at  VMWare Inc. (VMW) ,
the software maker in which it owns a majority stake.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  gained 0.7 percent to 1,372.78 at 4 p.m. in  New
York . The benchmark gauge rose 0.7 percent yesterday. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  added 103.16 points, or 0.8 percent, to
12,908.7.  “There’s some reduced pessimism about earnings season and
the outlook going forward,” Peter Tuz, who helps manage about
$800 million as president of Chase Investment Counsel Corp. in
Charlottesville,  Virginia , said in a telephone interview.
“People were expecting worse numbers from lots of companies.”  Housing starts rose 6.9 percent last month to a 760,000
annual pace after a revised 711,000 rate in May that was faster
than initially estimated, the Commerce Department reported. The
median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a 745,000 rate. Building permits fell, reflecting a
drop in applications for apartment construction.  Bernanke Testimony  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  reiterated during
his second day of testimony to Congress that the U.S. fiscal
situation is “unsustainable.” The central bank said in its
survey that is based on reports from its 12 district banks that
the world’s largest economy expanded at a “modest to moderate”
pace in June and early July, as retail sales and manufacturing
cooled in some regions.  Stocks rallied yesterday after Bernanke told senators the
central bank is prepared to act to boost growth if the labor
market doesn’t improve. The  S&P 500  has fallen 3.3 percent since
reaching a four-year high in April, as technology and financial
companies led declines in equities amid deteriorating economic
data and as investors braced for the first decline in quarterly
profits since 2009.  Credit Suisse Group AG cut its year-end forecast for the
S&P 500 to 1,425 from 1,440, citing the potential of a U.S.
economic recession induced by so-called fiscal cliff.  Andrew Garthwaite , global equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said he
sees a 10 percent chance of the economy contracting should
lawmakers do nothing to prevent about $607 billion of tax
increases and spending cuts from kicking in at the end of the
year. He lowered the 2012 per-share earnings estimate for S&P
500 companies by $1 to $99.6.  Earnings Season  Earnings have  exceeded  analyst estimates at 73 percent of
the 63 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results so
far, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profits have
slumped 4.6 percent for the group and the entire index is
projected to report a 2.1 percent decrease in earnings.  Technology and industrial companies had the biggest gains
today, rising 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. Intel,
 Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , Microsoft Corp.,  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  advanced at least 2.3
percent for the biggest gains in the Dow.  Technology companies “were oversold and due for a
bounce,” Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for
Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages
about $54 billion, said by phone. Earnings reports weren’t “as
bad as people had expected them to be. That was enough to invite
investors to come in and scoop up some attractive names.”  Intel Growth  Intel rallied 3.3 percent to $26.21 after reporting second-
quarter profit was 54 cents a share, exceeding the average
analyst estimate by 2 cents. The world’s largest semiconductor
maker also scaled back its annual  sales forecast  as personal-
computer demand fails to rebound among consumers in the U.S. and
 Europe .  “Intel lowered guidance but it was not unexpected and not
disastrous,”  Michael James , a managing director of equity
trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in  Los Angeles , said in an e-
mail. “Pessimism was pretty high and we’re now seeing people
both covering and getting long some names. Intel’s leading the
the technology group higher.”  Honeywell gained 6.7 percent to $58.18. The company
reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates,
driven by sales in its aerospace unit. The company, which sells
airplane parts from navigational systems to brakes, is
benefiting from an increase in aircraft production as Boeing
Co., Airbus SAS and other plane makers seek to whittle down
large backlogs of orders.  EMC Surges  EMC surged 9.4 percent to $25.08. The  software company  said
Pat Gelsinger will succeed Paul Maritz as chief executive
officer of VMware, giving new management the task of pursuing
new products and stepping up growth at the software maker under
its control. Maritz will return to EMC, which owns 79 percent of
VMware, as chief strategist. VMWare jumped 12 percent to $89.98.  Amphenol (APH)  Corp. rallied 15 percent to $58.94 for the biggest
gain in the S&P 500. The maker of fiber-optic cables lifted its
forecast for earnings this year to as much as $3.44 a share from
no more than $3.38. That compares with the average analyst
estimate of $3.34.  W.W. Grainger Inc. led gains in industrial stocks, rising
11 percent to $210.57. The distributor of building maintenance
supplies boosted the lower end of its profit forecast for 2012
to at least $10.50 a share from as little as $10.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
