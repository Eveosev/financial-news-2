Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank won’t raise its inflation target
to 3 percent, a move he said may unsettle consumers, destabilize
markets and undermine confidence in the Fed.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  couldn’t boost its 2
percent target for price increases “without losing control of
the inflation process,” Bernanke said to the House Financial
Services Committee today in Washington in semi-annual testimony
to Congress. Policy makers wouldn’t support cutting the goal to
1 percent because that would risk deflation, Bernanke said.  “Both are concerns, because 3 percent of course means that
we’re moving toward a more inflationary situation but 1 percent
is closer to the deflation range which is also not healthy for
the economy,” Bernanke said.  “I’m very skeptical that it would increase confidence
among businesses and households and increase economic
activity,” the Fed chairman said.  Setting the inflation goal higher “would create a lot of
problems in financial markets,” partly by prompting speculation
the Fed would increase the inflation target yet again, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
