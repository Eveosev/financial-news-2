Former  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  banker
Alexander Wright pleaded guilty to conspiring with a former UBS
AG broker in 2002 to rig bids on a bond deal involving a New
Jersey hospital.  Wright, 45, pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiring
to commit wire fraud in a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Frank Maas in federal court in  Manhattan  today. Rebecca Meiklejohn, a lawyer with the  Justice Department ’s Antitrust
Division, told Maas that Wright will testify in the criminal
trial of three former UBS bankers, including Gary Heinz, whom
Wright identified as his partner in the conspiracy.  Wright told Maas that in June 2002 he and Heinz agreed to
fix the bidding for a transaction involving a New Jersey
hospital, which he didn’t name. Wright submitted a low bid, then
raised the bid to a price suggested by Heinz, so he would win on
behalf of JPMorgan.  “I knew at the time that my actions were wrong and against
the law,” Wright told Maas.  Wright will pay $29,600 in victim restitution under the
terms of his plea agreement with prosecutors. He faces as long
as five years in prison when he’s sentenced.  Peter Ghavami, former co-head of UBS’s municipal
derivatives group, Heinz and Michael Welty are scheduled to be
tried July 30 on bid-rigging charges.  Wright was released on $100,000 bond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
