Britons’ confidence in the housing
market fell in June compared with three months earlier as the
outlook for the economy worsened, according to Halifax.  A gauge of the outlook for property prices slipped to 15
from 19 in March, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc
said in a report in  London  today. Thirty-four percent of those
surveyed expect prices to rise in the coming 12 months, while 19
percent forecast a decline.  Britain’s economy  shrank for a third straight quarter in
the three months through June, according to an estimate from the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The  Bank of
England  restarted  bond purchases  this month to aid the economy
and said the near-term outlook had “weakened.”  The decline in housing confidence reflects “increased
uncertainty regarding the economic outlook,” said  Martin Ellis ,
housing economist at Halifax. He forecast “little change in
prices and sales over the remainder of the year provided that
the U.K.’s economic outlook does not deteriorate
significantly.”  Halifax’s monthly  house-price report  on July 5 showed that
values increased 1 percent in June from the previous month. That
compares with Hometrack Ltd., which said that prices stagnated,
and  Nationwide Building Society , which recorded a 0.6 percent
drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
