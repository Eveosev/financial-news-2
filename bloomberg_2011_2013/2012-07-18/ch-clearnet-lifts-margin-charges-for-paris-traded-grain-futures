LCH Clearnet SA, the French arm of
 Europe ’s biggest clearing house, raised the deposits it demands
from clients to trade grain and oilseed futures on NYSE Liffe in
Paris.  The margin for milling wheat futures will climb to 950
euros ($1,166) from 800 euros, LCH Clearnet wrote in a  statement 
on its website yesterday.  Margin requirements will rise to 1,400 euros from 1,150
euros for rapeseed, to 700 euros from 625 euros for corn and to
1,500 euros from 1,400 euros for malting barley, the clearing
house said.  The changes will come into effect with the margin call
tomorrow morning for positions at today’s close, LCH Clearnet
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
