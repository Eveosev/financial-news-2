Amphenol Corp. (APH)  jumped the most in
more than three years, leading gains in the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX) , after the maker of electronic and fiber-optic
connectors raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts.  Earnings this year may be $3.38 to $3.44 a share, up from
a previous estimate of $3.30 to $3.38 a share, the Wallingford,
Connecticut-based company said today. Sales may be $4.21 billion
to $4.25 billion, compared with a previous target of
$4.11 billion to $4.19 billion, Amphenol said.  Amphenol “continues to execute with impressive
stability,”  Amit Daryanani , an RBC Capital Markets analyst in
 San Francisco , said in a note to clients. “We sense Amphenol is
being conservative with the modest increase” to its full-year
outlook, “which should yield further upside versus expectations
should the macro stabilize and improve.”  The  shares  advanced 15 percent to $58.94 at the close in
 New York , their biggest single-day increase since January 2009.  Second-quarter earnings climbed to 86 cents a share,
Amphenol said today, beating the 84-cent average estimate in a
Bloomberg  survey  of 14 analysts. Profit a year earlier was
85 cents.  Amphenol “remains well positioned to sustain 10 percent
plus revenue and high teens EPS growth going forward,”
Daryanani said. He has a top pick rating on its shares.  “Despite the widely reported uncertainties in many global
economies, we believe we can perform well,” Chief Executive
Officer R. Adam Norwitt said in a statement. “The electronics
revolution continues to accelerate, with new applications and
higher performance requirements driving increased demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
