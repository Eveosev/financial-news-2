Portugal sold 1.25 billion euros
($1.5 billion) of 12-month bills as borrowing costs fell to the
lowest since 2010 and below the rate paid by  Spain  yesterday.  The securities due in July 2013 were issued at an average
yield of 3.505 percent, the lowest since November 2010, the debt
management agency said. That compares with an average yield of
3.834 percent at a previous auction of 12-month bills on June 6.
The sale attracted bids for 2.4 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.7 in June.  Spain, which is getting a 100 billion-euro bank bailout,
yesterday sold 12-month bills at a yield of 3.918 percent.
Cyprus on June 25 became the fifth euro country to request a
bailout since  Greece  triggered the European fiscal crisis.  Portugal is cutting spending and raising taxes to comply
with the terms of a 78 billion-euro aid plan requested in April
2011 from the European Union and the  International Monetary
Fund . Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said on March 5 that if
the country can’t tap bond markets by September 2013 because of
“external reasons,” it would be able to count on continued
support from the IMF and the EU.  IMF Report  Borrowing costs also fell at an auction of six-month debt
today. The debt agency sold 750 million euros of bills due in
January 2013 at an average yield of 2.292 percent, attracting
bids for 3.8 times the amount offered. That compares with an
average yield of 2.653 percent at a previous auction of six-
month bills on June 6, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 4.3.  The IGCP, as the Lisbon-based debt agency is known, said
last week that the total indicative amount for today’s auctions
was between 1.75 billion euros and 2 billion euros. The IGCP
said on July 2 it plans to sell as much as 3.75 billion euros of
bills in the third quarter.  The IMF said in a report released yesterday that  Portugal 
plans to issue medium-term notes with maturities of one to five
years that are designed for specific creditors as it seeks to
regain access to bond markets. The government is also expected
to sell treasury bills with maturities of more than one year in
the coming months, the Washington-based fund said.  Portugal’s two-year note yield fell 1 basis point to 7.598
percent as of 11:48 a.m. in  London  today. Ten-year bond yields
rose 11 basis points to 10.56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
