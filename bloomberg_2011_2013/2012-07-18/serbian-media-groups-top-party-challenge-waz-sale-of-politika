Serbian media groups and the biggest
political party demanded an investigation into the sale of
 Politika Novine i Magazini DOO , the country’s oldest  newspaper ,
following reports that Germany’s  WAZ Mediengruppe  divested its
stake.  Two Serbian journalist associations and the  Serbian
Progessive Party  of President  Tomislav Nikolic  questioned the
legality of the sale of a 50 percent stake to Moscow-based OOO
East Media Group. The ownership change was published on the
 Serbian Business Registers Agency ’s website yesterday.  They want the new government, due to be formed next week
with the participation of the Progressives, to investigate the
sale, and said that businesses close to former Serbian President
 Boris Tadic ’s  Democratic Party  were behind the transaction.  “It’s an absolute violation of regulations that the
publisher of our oldest and most respected daily  newspaper  gets
a new owner so suddenly, practically overnight,” Nebojsa
Stefanovic, the Progressives’ vice-president, told reporters in
Belgrade today.  Earlier this year, WAZ offered  Politika AD (PLTK) , the state-
controlled publisher that owns 50 percent of the newspaper unit,
to buy back the stake, as the German company decided to pull out
of operations in southeast  Europe , Dragan Bujosevic, chief
editor of Politika newspaper, said in a phone interview today.
The sale fell through after Politika AD wanted more details, he
said.  “We sold the stake to East Media Group in accordance with
all legal requirements,” WAZ spokeswoman Simone Bellingroer
said in an e-mailed statement, declining to comment on criticism
regarding the transparency of the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
