Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said a number of market rates could replace the London
interbank offered rate as a benchmark for lending rates.  There “still are problems with the current Libor system,”
Bernanke told the House Financial Service Committee today in
 Washington  during his semi-annual testimony to Congress. The
index “doesn’t reflect actual market transactions.”  “One strategy would be to switch to a market-based
indicator,” he said. Bernanke declined to endorse a specific
rate, though he said possibilities include “repo rates, the OIS
index, even potentially Treasury bill rates.” He was referring
to the overnight indexed swap rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
