Multiplus SA, the frequent-flier
unit of  Latam Airlines Group SA (LFL) ’s Brazil subsidiary, rallied
after the stock was raised to the equivalent of a buy at  Raymond
James  & Associates Inc. on a stronger U.S. dollar.  Shares advanced 3.1 percent to 47.41 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa index gained 1.2 percent.  “A stronger U.S. dollar is a positive driver for
Multiplus,” Daniela Bretthauer and Claudia Guimaraes, analysts
at Raymond James in Sao Paulo, wrote in a research note
yesterday. “The point price sold to financial partners is
determined in dollars,” they wrote, referring to sales of
frequent-flier mileage points to Brazil’s largest banks and
credit card companies.  The dollar rallied 8.4 percent versus the Brazilian real
this year. Multiplus gained 47 percent during the same period,
while the Bovespa slid 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
