OAO Transneft, Russia’s oil pipeline
operator, will begin loading its first tanker of Kazakh crude
from Ust-Luga port on the  Baltic Sea  on July 20, Igor Dyomin, a
company spokesman, said by telephone today.  The port, which opened in March, is the end point of the
Baltic Pipeline System-2, which allows Russian exports to bypass
Belarus. Transneft also delivers Kazakh oil to Russia’s Baltic
Primorsk terminal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
