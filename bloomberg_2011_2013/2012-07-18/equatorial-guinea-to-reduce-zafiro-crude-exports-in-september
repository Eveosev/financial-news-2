Equatorial Guinea  will reduce
exports of its Zafiro crude for September to three cargoes, one
less than August, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The West African nation will also ship three consignments
of Ceiba grade, one more than next month, a separate schedule
showed. All cargoes are for 1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
