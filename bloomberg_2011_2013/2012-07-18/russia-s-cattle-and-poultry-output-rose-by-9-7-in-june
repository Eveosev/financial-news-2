Russiaâ€™s production of cattle and
poultry in so-called live weight, which includes meat, bones and
byproducts, increased 9.7 percent to 800,000 metric tons in June
compared with a year earlier, the state statistics service said.  Cattle and poultry output was 5 million tons in the six
months from January through June, 4 percent more than a year
earlier, the service, known as Rosstat, said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Cattle numbers increased 1.3 percent to 21.4 million head
by the end of June compared with a year earlier, the service
said. That number included 9.2 million cows. The hog count rose
3.7 percent to 19.3 million, while sheep and goats increased 7.1
percent to 27.5 million, Rosstat said.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
