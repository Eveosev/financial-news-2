Thailand ’s baht fell from a one-week
high on speculation importers will step up dollar purchases to
take advantage of a more favorable exchange rate. Bonds held
steady.  A government report due as early as this week may show
imports climbed 13.4 percent in June after an increase of 18.2
percent the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Southeast Asia’s second-
largest economy probably posted a fourth monthly trade deficit
amounting to $1.2 billion, the analysts estimated.  “Importers, including gold companies, may want to buy the
dollar as the baht strengthened lately,” said Norawit Suparinayok, a foreign-exchange trader at  Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL) 
“Risk sentiment is quite stable and some investors may think
 gold prices  will go up.”  The baht dropped 0.4 percent to 31.69 per dollar as of 3:22
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 31.54 yesterday, the strongest level since July
6. Its one-month implied volatility, a measure of  exchange-rate 
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 5.02 percent.  The yield on 3.25 percent government bonds due June 2017
held at 3.23 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold dropped 0.4 percent this week to $1,582.75 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
