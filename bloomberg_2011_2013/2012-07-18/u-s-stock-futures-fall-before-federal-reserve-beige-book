U.S. stocks fell, paring yesterday’s
gain, as earnings reports disappointed investors before the
release of the  Federal Reserve ’s  Beige Book  survey of business
conditions.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent to
1,360.37 at 9:31 a.m. in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  dropped 47.75 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,757.79
today. The  S&P 500  rose 0.7 percent yesterday as Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  told senators the central bank is prepared to
act to boost the economy if the labor market doesn’t improve.  “Intel’s announcement is confirmation of what we’re seeing
and that’s slowing economic growth,” Kevin Caron, a market
strategist in Florham Park,  New Jersey , at Stifel Nicolaus &
Co., which has more than $120 billion in client assets, said in
a telephone interview.  Bernanke will deliver the second part of his semi-annual
testimony on the economy and monetary policy to the House
Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. today. The Fed will
release its Beige Book today, two weeks before the Federal Open
Market Committee meets to set monetary policy. The  U.S. economy 
was described as growing at a “moderate pace” in the Fed’s
June Beige Book survey.  Intel slid 0.9 percent to $25.15. The world’s largest
semiconductor maker scaled back its annual sales forecast as
personal-computer demand fails to rebound among consumers in the
U.S. and Europe.  Intel Earnings  Revenue will rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 2012, the
company said in a statement yesterday. That was lower than an
earlier projection for a gain at a percentage in the high single
digits. Santa Clara, California-based Intel posted $54 billion
in sales last year, and analysts on average estimated growth of
4.8 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  lost 0.3 percent to $15.55. The biggest U.S.
Web portal said second-quarter revenue, excluding sales passed
on to partner sites, rose less than 1 percent to $1.08 billion.
That compares with the $1.1 billion average analysts’ projection
compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks declined even after a report showed U.S. housing
starts rose more than forecast in June to the fastest rate in
almost four years, indicating a brighter outlook for the
residential real estate market. Starts rose 6.9 percent last
month to a 760,000 annual pace after a revised 711,000 rate in
May that was faster than initially estimated, Commerce
Department data showed. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 745,000 rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
