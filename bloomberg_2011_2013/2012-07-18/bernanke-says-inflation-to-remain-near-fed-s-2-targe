Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said inflation will probably remain at or below the
central bank’s 2 percent target after energy prices reversed
their gains from earlier this year.  “The sharp drop in crude  oil prices  in the past few months
has brought inflation down,” Bernanke said today in testimony
to a House committee, repeating written remarks to a Senate
panel yesterday. Bernanke also said the Fed is ready to take
further action to boost the recovery if necessary.  Fed officials project that inflation will be 1.2 percent to
1.7 percent this year, compared with the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s 2 percent goal. Crude oil futures have declined 9.9
percent this year after posting a gain of as much as 11 percent
in February. Oil for August delivery rose 0.2 percent to $89.30
a barrel as of 9:30 a.m. in  New York .  “The  U.S. economy  has continued to recover, but economic
activity appears to have decelerated somewhat during the first
half of this year,” Bernanke said in his remarks. He said the
Fed is “prepared to take further action as appropriate to
promote a stronger economic recovery.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,367.67 as of 9:57 a.m. in New York after climbing 0.7 percent
yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained near
a record low, losing three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 1.48 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
