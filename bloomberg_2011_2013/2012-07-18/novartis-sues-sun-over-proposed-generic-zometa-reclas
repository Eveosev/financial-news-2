Swiss drugmaker  Novartis AG (NOVN)  sued  Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP)  to block it from selling generic
forms of the bone-strengthening medications Zometa and Reclast.  Sun, based in Mumbai, has sought U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval to sell copies, according to a complaint
filed July 14 in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Novartis
claims the Sun drugs would infringe its patent, which expires in
2028. Basel-based Novartis requested a court order to block the
generic drugs until then.  Novartis reported Zometa sales of $1.49 billion last year
and Reclast  sales  of $613 million.  Uday Baldota and Mira Desai, representatives of Sun, didnâ€™t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit
outside regular business hours in India.  The case is Novartis v. Sun Pharmaceuticals, 12-cv-4393,
U.S. District Court, District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporters on this story:
