Preet Bharara, the top federal
prosecutor in Manhattan whose office has sent inside traders and
terrorists to prison, told attendees at a hedge fund conference
that prosecutions foster confidence in the market.  “If you have open and aggressive and fair and proper and
proven cases that you bring, and you show that in the kinds of
cases that I’ve brought, that’s the kind of thing that over time
gives people more confidence in the market,” Bharara said today
at the annual Delivering Alpha Conference in New York sponsored
by CNBC and Institutional Investor.  Bharara, previously Senator  Charles Schumer ’s chief counsel
on the Senate Judiciary Committee, became the U.S. Attorney for
Manhattan in 2009.  In June, Bharara’s office won the conviction of former 
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Director  Rajat Gupta  for passing inside 
tips to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Last year,
prosecutors in his office won the conviction of Rajaratnam.  Since August 2009, at least 70 people have been charged and
64 have been convicted in the largest insider-trading
prosecution in U.S. history.  Bharara’s successful prosecutions also include Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty to driving a bomb-laden car into New
York’s Times Square in 2010. Shahzad was sentenced to life in
prison.  The audience at today’s speech included fund managers and
analysts. Other speakers included KKR & Co. co-founder  Henry Kravis  and former Treasury Secretary  Hank Paulson .  To contact the reporter on this story:
