Natural-gas compressors, pipelines
and plants released more than 70,000 tons of pollutants in  Texas 
over the past three years due to accidents or other “abnormal”
events, a watchdog group said today.  These “emission events,” which also occurred at
refineries and chemical plants, accounted for about 15 percent
of the sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds released by
those facilities in Texas, the Environmental Integrity Project
said in a report. The group compiled the data from reports the
companies filed with state regulators.  “Too many of these ‘accidents’ are the norm at some
natural gas and chemical plants,”  Eric Schaeffer , the
Washington-based group’s director, said in a statement. The
“EPA needs to crack down on polluters who seem to think that
these events -- no matter how many or how severe -- somehow
excuse them.”  The group filed two legal notices with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, threatening to sue the
government unless it toughens enforcement of those polluters.  The EPA hasn’t received the report, yet, agency spokesman
David Bary said in an e-mail.  “‘Texas air rules and permits are vigorously enforced, and
all emission events are reviewed,” Terry Clawson, a spokesman
for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in an e-
mail. Even including these events, “emissions from major point
sources have decreased significantly over the last decade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
