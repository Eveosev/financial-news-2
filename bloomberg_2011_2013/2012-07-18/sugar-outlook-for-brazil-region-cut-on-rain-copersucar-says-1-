Sugar output in  Brazil ’s center
south, the world’s largest producing region, will be lower than
forecast as rain reduces the crop’s sugar content, said
Copersucar SA, the world’s second-largest sugar trader.  The region’s mills will produce 30.5 million tons of sugar
this crop year, less than a June 28 forecast of 31 million tons,
Chief Executive Officer Paulo Roberto de Souza told reporters
today in Sao Paulo. The crop year started April 1.  “Excessive rainfall is delaying harvest and diluting sugar
content of the crop,” Souza said. “About 42 percent of our
mills have halted crushing due to rain.”  Precipitation hinders
harvesting as machines can’t work in muddy fields.  Brazil is the world’s biggest producer and exporter of the
sweetener.  Latin America ’s largest economy accounts for about
half of global shipments. The center south region, producer of
90 percent of the country’s sugar and ethanol, processed 31.3
million tons of sugar in the last crop year.  The forecast for the region’s ethanol output was raised to
21.5 billion liters (5.67 billion gallons), from 21.4 billion
liters, as poor sugar content prompts mills to convert more cane
into biofuel, Souza said. He reiterated the region’s cane output
forecast of 505 million tons.  Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc., America’s largest closely
held company, is the world’s largest sugar-trading company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
