Indonesia ’s rupiah snapped a two-day
drop and bonds gained on speculation further measures to
stimulate the  U.S. economy  may increase demand for riskier
assets. Ten-year yields fell to a four-month low.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers
are studying options for further easing in case economic growth
remains too weak to produce a sustained decline in unemployment.
Indonesia raised 9 trillion rupiah ($952 million) in a bond
auction yesterday, exceeding its 6 trillion rupiah target, with
investors bidding for 4.6 times the amount offered, the debt
management office said.  “There is greater anticipation for stimulus from the Fed,
driving funds to emerging-market currencies,” said Rully Nova,
a currency analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta.
“Pressure on the rupiah remains strong as export growth is
still a concern. We expect  Bank Indonesia  to support it near
current levels.”  The rupiah advanced 0.1 percent to 9,450 per dollar as of
4:05 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 8 percent,
the lowest level since May 15.  Moody’s Investors Service maintained the nation’s credit
rating at the lowest investment-grade level, the agency said
July 16. The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May
2022 fell 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5.83
percent, the lowest since March 9, according to closing prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
