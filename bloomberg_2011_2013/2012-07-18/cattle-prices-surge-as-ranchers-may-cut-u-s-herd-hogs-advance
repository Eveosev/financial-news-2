Cattle futures rose to a four-month
high on speculation that surging feed costs will force ranchers
to cull herds, cutting the outlook for meat supply. Hogs gained.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed,
advanced 52 percent from mid-June through yesterday. As feed
costs increase, cattle producers may sell their animals rather
than pay more to fatten them for slaughter, said  Lane Broadbent ,
a vice president at KIS Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma City .  “It makes no sense for them to keep feeding cattle, so
longer-term the question is, will they have less tonnage on the
market,” Broadbent said by telephone.  Cattle futures for October delivery jumped 2.4 percent to
settle at $1.22825 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price earlier rose by the exchange limit of 3
cents to $1.22975, the highest since March 19.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed by the
exchange limit of 3 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $1.372 a pound in
Chicago.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 3.1 percent to
80.05 cents a pound on the CME, the biggest gain since May 31.
The price of wholesale pork rose 1.4 percent yesterday, the
first gain since June 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
