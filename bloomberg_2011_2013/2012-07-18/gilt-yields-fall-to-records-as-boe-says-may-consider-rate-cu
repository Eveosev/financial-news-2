U.K. government bonds rose, with
two- and five-year yields falling to records, after  Bank of
England  policy makers said they may consider the case for
cutting interest rates again.  Ten-year yields  fell to the lowest level in six weeks after
minutes of the central bank’s July meeting released today showed
the Monetary Policy Committee may review the case for more rate
cuts after assessing the impact of new liquidity measures.
Policy makers voted 7-2 to boost asset purchases at the meeting,
the minutes showed. The pound fell versus the dollar as traders
added to bets the central bank will lower borrowing costs.  “The minutes were slightly more dovish than expected,”
said Vatsala Datta, an  interest-rate  strategist at  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  in  London . “The probability of a rate cut has
increased after the November meeting. The market is definitely
pricing in a possibility of that.”  The two-year gilt yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 0.16 percent at 4:10 p.m. in London after
dropping to 0.144 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began
tracking the securities in 1992. The 2.25 percent note due in
March 2014 rose 0.065, or 65 pence per 1,000-pound ($1,566) face
amount, to 103.41.  The  five-year yield  slid five basis points to 0.5 percent,
after dropping to a record 0.472 percent. The 10-year yield fell
as low as 1.45 percent, the least since June 1, when it declined
to a record 1.439 percent.  Two Dissenters  The Bank of England increased asset purchases by 50 billion
pounds to 375 billion pounds at its July 4-5 meeting and kept
its benchmark interest rate at a record low 0.5 percent.  Spencer Dale  and Ben Broadbent dissented in favor of no change to the
target for so-called quantitative easing, according to the
minutes published today.  So-called Sonia rates indicate the central bank will reduce
its benchmark to 0.234 percent by April, according to Tullett
Prebon Plc. Sonia, or the Sterling Overnight Index Average, is
the  reference rate  for overnight unsecured transactions in
sterling and is endorsed by the British Bankers’ Association.  Shorter-maturity gilts are “discounting a significant
probability of a rate cut,” Lloyds’ Datta said. “They have
already done quantitative easing and there is some expectation
of further QE at the November meeting.”  Pound Weakens  Sterling dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5631 after rising to
$1.5678 yesterday, the strongest since July 4. The pound gained
0.2 percent at 78.40 pence per euro, after rising to 78.30
pence, the most since October 2008.  The pound has appreciated 3.3 percent in the past six
months, the best performer of the 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
dropped 3.5 percent in the same period.  Ten-year gilt futures may extend gains should they remain
above a level of so-called support, according to UBS AG, citing
trading patterns.  “Gilts are bullish while they trade above 120.83,” which
is their low of July 13,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income
technical strategy in London, wrote in a note to clients. The
securities may initially advance to 121.86, the June 1 session
high, he said.  The 10-year futures contract expiring in September rose 0.3
percent to 121.67.  Gilts have returned 3.9 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained 4.2 percent,
and U.S. Treasuries rose 2.6 percent, the indexes show.  The Bank of England bought 1 billion pounds of gilts
maturing between seven and 15 years today as part of its bond-
purchase plan. The Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell
1.75 billion pounds of bonds due in July 2052 tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
