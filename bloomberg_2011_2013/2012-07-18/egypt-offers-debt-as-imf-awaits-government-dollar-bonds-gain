Egypt will offer 12.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($2.1 billion) of debt by July 22 as the
 International Monetary Fund  said it’s awaiting the appointment
of a new cabinet before resuming loan talks. Dollar bonds rose.  The Arab country will tomorrow offer  six-  and 12-month
notes valued at 2 billion and 3.5 billion pounds, respectively,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg. It will seek bids
on July 22 for 4 billion pounds of  nine-month bills  and 1
billion pounds each of  three-month , five-year and 10-year
securities.  Egypt’s new leaders haven’t “indicated that they will seek
financial support,” the IMF said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday as President Mohamed Mursi has yet to appoint a
government almost a month after his election win. Negotiations
for a $3.2 billion loan from the lender have been held on and
off for more than a year.  The 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April 2020 advanced for
the third time in four days, pushing the yield five basis points
lower to 6.2 percent at 10:42 a.m. in Cairo, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The pound, subject to a managed float,
was little changed at 6.0643 a dollar.  Egypt  has sold the targeted 44 billion pounds of debt so
far this quarter, part of a plan to raise a record 175 billion
pounds in the three-month period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
