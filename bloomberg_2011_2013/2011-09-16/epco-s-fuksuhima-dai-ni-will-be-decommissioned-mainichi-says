Tokyo Electric Power Co. will need
to decommission its Fukushima Dai-Ni nuclear power plant, the
 Mainichi newspaper  reported, citing  Japan ’s trade and industry
minister  Yukio Edano .  The government is unlikely to get agreement from residents
of Fukushima prefecture to restart the Dai-Ni station, Edano
told the Mainichi.  The Dai-Ni plant is located to the south of the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi station, which has been emitting radiation since March
11 when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling, causing
three reactors to meltdown. The Dai-Ni station was also shut
down in the disaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
