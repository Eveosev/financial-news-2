U.S. stocks advanced, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the third-biggest weekly gain
since 2009, as government officials and central bankers took
steps to ease the European debt crisis.  Dell Inc. (DELL)  climbed 8.8 percent after boosting its share
buyback program, helping send technology companies in the S&P
500 to a 7.1 percent increase, the most since July 2009.
 Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG)  rallied 14 percent after
Credit Suisse Group AG boosted its rating, and  Aetna Inc. (AET) 
advanced 9.3 percent after saying profit will probably beat its
forecast. Goodrich Corp. surged 10 percent amid speculation
United Technologies Corp. may buy the company.  The S&P 500 climbed 5.4 percent to 1,216.01 this week,
trimming its 2011 loss to 3.3 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  increased 516.96 points, or 4.7 percent, to 11,509.09,
leaving it down 0.6 percent since Dec. 31.  “It looks like the various political leaders and finance
leaders are getting together and working in a consorted fashion,
which is what’s necessary to get through this situation,”  Peter Jankovskis , who helps manage about $2.6 billion at Oakbrook
Investments in Lisle, Illinois, said in a telephone interview.
“The equity market is likely to move higher here, and I think
we will see a rally by year’s end.”  The  S&P 500  climbed to the highest level since Aug. 31
after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
pressed euro-area governments yesterday to take decisive action
to halt the debt crisis. Two days ago, the ECB bought more time
by extending an emergency lifeline to banks, driving the week’s
biggest advance in the stock market. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said they are
convinced  Greece  will remain in the euro zone.  Stock Valuations  Stocks have recovered after the S&P 500 sank to 1,119.46 on
Aug. 8, down 11 percent for the year. The retreat drove the
index to 12.2 times reported earnings, the cheapest valuation
since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Companies most-tied to the economy rallied this week, with the
Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index advancing 5.5 percent.  Intel
Corp. (INTC) ,  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  led gains in the
Dow, increasing at least 8.2 percent.  “Headlines from  Europe  are certainly driving the short-
term direction of the market,” Peter Vanderlee, a  money manager 
at ClearBridge Advisors, a unit of Baltimore-based Legg Mason
Inc., said in a telephone interview. Legg Mason manages about
$640 billion. “We don’t have a magic bullet for solving
Europe’s woes, but against that backdrop, having a portfolio
with companies that tend to be more quality-based, have
international exposure, it dampens a lot of that volatility.”  EBay, Dell  Technology shares rose the most among 10 S&P 500
industries, led by EBay Inc., the world’s largest online
marketplace. The shares climbed 18 percent to $33.69. Dell, the
second-largest personal-computer maker, added 8.8 percent to
$15.20. Dell added $5 billion to its stock repurchase program,
citing a resurgence in  cash flow .  “Valuations in that space are exceedingly attractive,”
Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Philadelphia-based
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages $54 billion, said
during a Sept. 16 Bloomberg Television interview. “And of
course we know that business investment and spending on software
and hardware has been the one bright spot in terms of economic
activity over the last couple of quarters.”  Technology companies in the index are trading at 12.3 times
estimated 2011 income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with the average price-earnings ratio using
analyst estimates for the current year of 15.4 between March 9,
2009, when the bull market began, and April 29 of this year,
when the S&P 500 peaked.  Hartford, Aetna  Hartford was raised by Credit Suisse to “outperform” from
“neutral.” The shares gained 14 percent, the most among
insurers in the S&P 500, to $18.94. Financial companies in the
index advanced 6 percent.  Aetna shares climbed 9.3 percent to $41.53 in its biggest
weekly rally since February. The third-largest U.S. health
insurer said full-year profit will probably beat its forecast as
demand for medical care continues to be lower than previous
expectations, helping to contain costs.  Goodrich rallied 10 percent to $92.89, the highest price
since Aug. 1. After U.S. exchanges closed yesterday, three
people with knowledge of the matter said United Technologies is
in talks to buy the aerospace equipment maker Goodrich. A deal
may be announced as soon as next week, said one of the people,
who declined to be identified because the discussions are
private. Goodrich is the most likely of the takeover targets
United Technologies is studying, one person said.  Rockwell Collins Inc.,  Textron Inc. (TXT)  and  Tyco International
Ltd. (TYC)  gained amid speculation United Technologies is also
evaluating them. Rockwell surged a record 17 percent to $56.21.
Textron jumped 22 percent, the most since April 2009, to $18.63.
Tyco increased 10 percent, the most since February 2009, to
$43.70.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the mail-order and online film-rental
service, fell the most in the S&P 500 after cutting its U.S.
subscriber forecast following a price increase. Netflix slid 24
percent, the most since October 2004, to $155.19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
