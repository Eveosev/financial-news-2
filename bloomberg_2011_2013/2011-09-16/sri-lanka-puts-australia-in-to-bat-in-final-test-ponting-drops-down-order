Australia in to bat in the series-deciding cricket Test in
Colombo, where a wet outfield delayed the start of play by 30
minutes.  Sri Lanka dropped batsman Thilan Samaraweera and selected
three fast bowlers, while Peter Siddlereplaced the injured Ryan
Harris in the Australian bowling attack.  Ricky Ponting returns for Australia after attending the
birth of his second child, though drops down a place in the
batting order to No. 4. Shaun Marsh retains the No. 3 spot after
hitting 141 on debut in the drawn second Test.  Australia leads the best-of-three series 1-0 after winning
the opening match by 125 runs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
