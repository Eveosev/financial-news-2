The  National Basketball Association 
and its referees reached an agreement on a five-year labor
contract, even as owners and players remain far apart on a new
collective bargaining deal.  “We didn’t get everything we wanted,” said Lee Seham,
General Counsel for the National Basketball Referees Association.
“But given the current economic climate and the continuing
players’ lockout, we’re satisfied that this deal was in the best
interests of our members.”  The agreement comes two years after a lockout during which
the NBA threatened to start the 2009-10 regular season with
replacement referees. The two sides agreed to a two-year
contract that expired after last season.  The start of this season may be delayed after the NBA and
its players made “little or no progress” on a new labor
contract, players union executive director  Billy Hunter  told
reporters yesterday. The regular season is scheduled to start
Nov. 1 and no negotiations are scheduled.  NBA owners, who are seeking a new salary-cap system,
imposed a lockout on July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
