Gold is in the “final,
overheated” phase of a protracted bull market, Tiberius Asset
Management AG said today in an e-mailed report.  “Although we may not see the strategic top for some months
to come, gold is already so overbought in the wake of the panic
selling of bank stocks that a calming of the European financial
markets could well trigger a tactical pullback by about
$200-$300 a troy ounce,” Tiberius wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
