MetLife Inc. (MET) , the biggest U.S. life
insurer, was pressed by regulators to give more details on the
causes of reserve shortfalls at the non-U.S. unit acquired from
 American International Group Inc. (AIG)  last year.  MetLife agreed to disclose which products provoked the
deficiencies and the periods of time over which costs will be
amortized, Executive Vice President Peter Carlson told the
Securities and Exchange Commission in a July 22 letter, released
today. Carlson was responding to questions raised by the SEC on
May 27 amid a regulatory review of the New York-based insurer’s
10-K annual filing.  MetLife Chairman Robert Henrikson bought American Life
Insurance Co. from AIG in November for about $16 billion. The
deal led to a negative  $4.4 billion  adjustment to MetLife’s so-
called value of business acquired, or VOBA, the insurer said in
its annual report.  “We always welcome the interaction with the SEC staff on
our 10-K filing,”  Christopher Breslin , a spokesman for MetLife,
said in an e-mail. “The exchange of letters with the SEC
related to a 10-K filing is a routine and typical interaction
between the SEC and all large publicly traded companies. The SEC
comments regarding MetLife’s 10-K were innocuous and did not
result in any changes in MetLife’s accounting.”  The VOBA adjustment was mainly tied to Alico’s business in
 Japan  and products written over almost two decades including
fixed annuities, interest-sensitive whole life policies and
retirement savings products, Carlson said in a June 13 letter,
which was also released today. A decline in  interest rates 
contributed to the VOBA adjustment, Carlson said.  The SEC told MetLife in an Aug. 2 letter that it had
completed its review of the insurer’s filing. Such
correspondence is typically released about 45 days after a
review is completed. Mark Herr, a spokesman for New York-based
AIG, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
