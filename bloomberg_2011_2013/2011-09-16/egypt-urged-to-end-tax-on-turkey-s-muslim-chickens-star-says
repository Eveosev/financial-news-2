Egypt  under former president  Hosni Mubarak  was “jealous” of Turkey and economic ties will become
stronger as relations improve and punitive trade measures are
dropped, according to Turkish Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan, the
Star reported.  Egypt imposes as much as 30 percent tax on Turkish “Muslim
chickens,” while imposing zero tax on imported European
chickens, the newspaper quoted Caglayan as saying after meeting
with Egyptian officials in Cairo.  Trade relations are now expected to improve, Caglayan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
