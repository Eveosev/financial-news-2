The euro area plans to decide Oct.
3 on whether to approve the next aid payment for  Greece  from
last year’s 110 billion-euro ($152 billion) rescue, Austrian
Finance Minister Maria Fekter said.  The decision will depend on the outcome of a review by
European and International Monetary Fund officials of the Greek
government’s progress in tackling the  budget deficit , Fekter
told reporters today in Wroclaw, Poland.   She declined to speculate about the outcome of the review
or of the planned decision by euro-area finance ministers.
Approval of the payment on Oct. 3 would allow the money to reach
Greece by Oct. 14, according to Fekter.     To contact the reporter on this story:
