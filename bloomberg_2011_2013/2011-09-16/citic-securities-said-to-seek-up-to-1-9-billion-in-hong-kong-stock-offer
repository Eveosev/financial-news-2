Citic Securities Co. will attempt
Hong Kong’s biggest initial share sale since June, testing
demand for new shares after the city’s benchmark index dropped
11 percent in three months.  China’s largest brokerage by market value is seeking to
raise HK$15.1 billion ($1.9 billion) by offering 995.3 million
shares at HK$12.84 to HK$15.20 apiece, two people with knowledge
of the matter said. Citic Securities executives will start
meeting potential investors today, they said.  The sale would be Hong Kong’s biggest since Italian fashion
retailer Prada SpA raised $2.5 billion in June. The Hang Seng
Index is down 11 percent since Prada’s initial public offering
was priced, and stock offerings have dwindled amid Europe’s
escalating sovereign debt crisis and a faltering U.S. recovery.
China Everbright Bank Co. canceled a share sale of about $3
billion in August.  “A few IPOs got pulled recently and investor appetite for
new stock is not as strong as in the first half,” said Binay Chandgothia, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Principal Global
Investors, which oversees more than $200 billion. “People will
look at it as an indicator for the IPO market.”  The offering price range values Citic Securities at 1.18 to
1.39 times estimated 2011 book value and at 13.4 to 15.9 times
forecast 2011 earnings, according to a term sheet for the deal
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Eleven Chinese brokerages listed in Shanghai trade at an
average price-to-book multiple of 1.73 for 2011 and at 15.2
times estimated full-year earnings, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Oct. 6 Debut  Citic Securities, which sold shares in an initial public
offering in Shanghai in 2003, has a market value of 122 billion
yuan ($19 billion) as of yesterday’s close. It is 24 percent
owned by Citic Group, China’s first state-owned investment
corporation that was created in 1979.  Shares of Citic Securities fell 0.2 percent to 12.25 yuan
at 1:12 p.m. in Shanghai today. The Beijing-based company aims
to start trading in Hong Kong on Oct. 6, the people said.
Raymond Tang, a Citic Securities spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to a phone call seeking comment on the share sale.  Temasek Holdings Pte and Kuwait Investment Authority are
among early investors who agreed to buy $850 million of stock in
the share sale, according to the term sheet. They are among so-
called cornerstone investors who get guaranteed shares in the
offering in return for a pledge not to sell their stock
immediately.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , BOC International Holdings Ltd.,
Bocom International Holdings Ltd., CCB International (Holdings)
Ltd., Citic Securities International, CLSA Ltd.,  HSBC Holdings
Plc. (5) , Haitong International Securities Group Ltd., ICBC
International Holdings Ltd. and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  are managing the
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
