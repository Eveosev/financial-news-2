Ukraine “hopes” to review
natural-gas contracts with  Russia  by the end of October, First
Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Klyuev said.  “We are holding talks with Russia now and hope that we
will reach an agreement to change terms of the contract,”
Klyuev told reporters today in Yalta, Crimea.  The government hopes to solve all gas-price issues before
the end of October, Klyuev said. “Once this is done, we will
see what the situation is for domestic tariffs for natural gas”
and whether to increase local rates, Klyuev said.  The  International Monetary Fund  postponed a visit to
Ukraine planned for early September to late October saying the
authorities of the eastern European nation need to have stronger
policies. The Washington-based IMF’s second review of the $15.6
billion loan agreement with  Ukraine  has been delayed since March
since the government failed to increase domestic fees for
natural gas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
