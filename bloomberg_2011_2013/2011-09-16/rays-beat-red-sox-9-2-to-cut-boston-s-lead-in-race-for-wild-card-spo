The Tampa Bay Rays pulled within
three games of Boston in the race for the American League’s wild
card playoff berth with a 9-2 win over the  Red Sox .  Evan Longoria, B.J. Upton and Casey Kotchman each hit a
home run and drove in three runs yesterday at Fenway Park in
Boston.  The Red Sox have lost 11 of their past 14 Major League
Baseball games to fall to 86-63, 4 1/2 games behind the first-
place New York Yankees in the AL Eastern Division.  Boston hosts three more games against the Rays (83-66) in a
series that may help decide the AL wild card, which goes to the
second-place team with the best record. Both teams have 13
regular-season games left.  The Yankees were off yesterday and begin a three-game
series tonight in Toronto.  The  Philadelphia Phillies  swept a double-header against the
Florida Marlins, winning the opener 3-1 and the nightcap 2-1 in
10 innings.  The Phillies lowered their so-called magic number to win
the National League East to two, meaning any combination of
their wins and losses by the  Atlanta Braves  totaling two gives
Philadelphia a fifth straight division title. The Braves didn’t
play yesterday.  The  Detroit Tigers  had their 12-game winning streak snapped
with a 6-1 loss to the  Oakland Athletics . It was the Tigers’
longest winning streak since 1934.  The Texas Rangers beat the Cleveland Indians 7-4 to extend
their AL West lead over the idle Los Angeles Angels to 3 1/2
games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
