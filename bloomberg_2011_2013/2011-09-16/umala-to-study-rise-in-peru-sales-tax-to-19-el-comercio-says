Peru’s President Ollanta Humala
will study an increase in the  sales tax  to 19 percent from 18
percent, El Comercio  reported .  The increase in tax would be used to pay for measures to
combat street crime, the Lima-based newspaper said, citing
comments by Humala during an event in Lima yesterday. A 1
percentage point increase would generate 355 million soles ($130
million) in additional revenue based on last year’s tax
collection, El Comercio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
