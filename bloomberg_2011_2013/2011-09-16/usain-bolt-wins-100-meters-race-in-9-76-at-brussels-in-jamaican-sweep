Usain Bolt won the 100 meters at
the Diamond League track meet in Brussels, finishing in 9.76
seconds, the fastest time of the year.  The Olympic champion and world record-holder led a Jamaican
sweep. Nesta Carter finished second in 9.89 seconds followed by
Lerone Clarke in 10.05. Justin Gatlin of the U.S. was fourth in
10.12.  Asafa Powell of  Jamaica  had run the year’s fastest 100
before tonight, 9.78 seconds on June 30. Powell wasn’t in
tonight’s race.  Bolt was disqualified for a false start last month at the
world championships in Daegu,  South Korea . He had a season-best
9.85 seconds at the Zagreb World Challenge three days ago in his
first start since the worlds.  Bolt ran a world-record 9.69 seconds in the 100 meters
final at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. He lowered the mark to
9.58 seconds at the world championships the following year in
Berlin, where he also set a world record in the 200 meters with
a time of 19.19 seconds.  Bolt retained his 200-meter world title in Daegu and ran
the anchor leg as Jamaica broke its own world record in the 400-
meter relay with a time of 37.04 seconds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
