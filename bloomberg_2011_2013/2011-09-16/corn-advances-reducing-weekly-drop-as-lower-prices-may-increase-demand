Corn rose in  Chicago , reducing a
third weekly drop, on speculation lower prices will stoke
demand. Wheat and soybeans climbed.  U.S. exporters, the top global growers and shippers of
corn, sold 1.17 million metric tons of the grain in the week
ended Sept. 8, up 34 percent from the prior seven days, the
Department of Agriculture said in a report yesterday. Prices are
down 8.2 percent this month, potentially encouraging buyers to
make purchases.  “In the last few days, we’ve seen price pressure on
grains,” said  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an analyst at  Barclays
Capital  in London. “Export sales yesterday were good for corn.
Lower prices and price corrections have been viewed as buying
opportunities.”  Corn for December delivery advanced 3.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $7.0475 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade, narrowing the weekly drop to 4.3
percent.  Wheat for December delivery gained 5.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $7.015 a bushel. The grain is down 3.9 percent this
week, on course for a third straight retreat. Milling wheat for
November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris rose 3 euros, or
1.5 percent, to 199.75 euros ($275.25) a ton.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 7.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $13.66 a bushel in Chicago, trimming the weekly
decline to 4.3 percent. The oilseed is set to retreat for a
second week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
