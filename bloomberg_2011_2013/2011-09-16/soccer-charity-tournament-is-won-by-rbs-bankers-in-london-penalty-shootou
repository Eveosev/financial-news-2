A team of high-yield and leveraged
finance bankers from  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  clinched
the championship of a charity soccer match sponsored by private-
equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and  Impetus Trust .  RBS bankers beat 27 teams to win the  Street League  soccer
tournament in London yesterday. The players came from high-yield
and leveraged finance units of the city’s investment banks.  RBS goalkeeper Kunal Dusad’s saves in penalty shoot-outs in
the semi-final and final nailed the tournament. Dusad, an
associate of European high-yield bond and loan origination, was
captained by Nathan Stromberg, executive Director of European
high-yield bond and loan origination.  The team also includes Eric Capp, RBS’s global head of
high-yield syndicate, Sarah Mackey, head of financial sponsors
for the EMEA region, and Alison Rose, chief of corporate
coverage and client management.  They beat Deutsche Bank AG in the quarter final, UBS AG in
the semi-final and then Bank of America Corp. in the final,
Edinburgh-based RBS said.  Street League works with disadvantaged 16- to 25-year old
young adults who are not in employment, education, or training -
- known as neets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
