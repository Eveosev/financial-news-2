The U.K. police are trying to force
the  Guardian newspaper  to reveal information about its reporting
on the phone-hacking at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s News of the World tabloid,
the newspaper  said  today.  The Metropolitan Police are seeking a court order to force
the publication to reveal its sources for stories about how the
now-defunct tabloid listened into voicemail messages of murdered
schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the Guardian said. The police didn’t
comment when contacted by Bloomberg today.  The Guardian “shall resist this extraordinary demand to
the utmost,” Editor Alan Rusbridger said.  The revelations by the Guardian in July forced News Corp.
to shut the News of the World, the U.K.’s most-popular Sunday
newspaper, and end a bid for the rest of  British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY)  Subsequent scoops on police corruption
and other hacking victims, led to the resignation and arrest of
News Corp. executives including Rebekah Brooks, CEO of the News
International U.K. newspapers unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
