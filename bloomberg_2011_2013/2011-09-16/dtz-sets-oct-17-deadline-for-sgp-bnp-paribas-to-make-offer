DTZ Holdings Plc (DTZ) , the unprofitable
U.K. real estate broker that lost its two most senior executives
last month, set an Oct. 17 deadline for a formal offer backed by
 BNP Paribas (BNP)  Real Estate after saying it received other
approaches.  DTZ’s largest shareholder,  France ’s Mathy family-owned
Saint George Participations SAS, has been in talks since May
about making an offer for the 47 percent of the company it
doesn’t already own. SGP is backed by the property brokerage arm
of Paris-based bank BNP Paribas SA.  “DTZ continues to evaluate alternative strategic options
in the event that no satisfactory offer from SGP is received,”
the London-based company said today in a statement.  Shares of London-based DTZ have climbed about 13 percent
since May 10, the day before the company first said it received
approaches. The stock fell 0.25 of a penny to 36 pence
yesterday, valuing the company at 97.3 million pounds ($154
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
