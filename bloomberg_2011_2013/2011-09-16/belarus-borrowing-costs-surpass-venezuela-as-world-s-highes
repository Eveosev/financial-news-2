Belarus’s borrowing costs rose to
the highest in the world, surpassing  Venezuela , as the former
Soviet republic grapples with a balance-of-payments crisis.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Belarusian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries reached 1,396 basis points today,
according to JPMorgan EMBIG indexes. That is up 29 basis points
from yesterday and compares with 1,350 for Venezuela and 619 and
293 for neighbors Ukraine and  Russia .  Belarus is selling state assets and has sought
international bailout loans to help close a current-account
deficit that reached 16 percent of gross domestic product in
2010 after the government raised public wages and pensions. It
devalued its ruble 36 percent in May and let the currency float
freely Sept. 14, resulting in a further 38 percent decline.  At 30 percent, Belarus’s refinancing rate is the highest
among 55 countries tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
