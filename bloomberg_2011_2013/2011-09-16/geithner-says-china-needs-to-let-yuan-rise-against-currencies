U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said China needs to let the yuan gain against
currencies other than the dollar.  “They’re not letting it move much against the currencies
in the rest of the world, and that’ll have to change over
time,” Geithner said today at a financial conference in
Wroclaw, Poland. “I think that’s going to have to happen.”  Geithner said Chinese leaders need to make “further
progress to let their  exchange rate  reflect market forces” so
their monetary policy can be more independent and they can fight
inflation. It also will give other emerging-market nations more
room to let their currencies move, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
