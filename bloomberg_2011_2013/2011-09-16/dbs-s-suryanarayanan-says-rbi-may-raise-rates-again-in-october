Ramya Suryanarayanan, an economist
with DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, comments after
India’s central bank raised  interest rates  for the 12th time
since the start of March 2010.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
8.25 percent from 8 percent, it said in a statement today.  “It is a more hawkish statement than I expected. There may
be another 25 basis points increase in the next meeting in late
October and then they may stand pat. Headline inflation should
begin to moderate after that.”  “After the October hike, they could keep rates unchanged
for a while but not sound neutral or dovish but rather indicate
that they remain vigilant for inflation risks. The problem is
suppressed inflation or the incomplete pass through, right from
global fuel prices to local. That is the risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
