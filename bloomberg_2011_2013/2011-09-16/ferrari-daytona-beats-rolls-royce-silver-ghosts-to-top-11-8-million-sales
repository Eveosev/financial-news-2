A Ferrari convertible and two
Rolls-Royce Silver Ghosts stole the limelight at $11.8 million
U.K. auctions as collectors competed for the finest classic cars
and passed on others. Two high-value Jaguars failed to sell.  The Ferrari 365GTS/4 Daytona Spyder last night took a top
price of 595,500 pounds ($940,592) with fees at  Bonhams’s  annual
auction during the  Goodwood Revival  festival. The 1971 car
overtook the veteran Rolls-Royces, which fetched 485,500 pounds
and 419,500 pounds.  “There’s a good market for collectors’ cars that excite
people,”  James Knight , Bonhams’s international managing director
of autos, said in an interview. “Buyers are price sensitive,
though.”  The week’s sales of 230 vehicles, at Goodwood and  Beaulieu ,
raised 7.5 million pounds. Yesterday’s sale alone made 4.7
million pounds -- less than an estimate of as much as 11 million
pounds, and with just 60 percent of the offered cars successful.  Last month, Gooding & Co., RM Auctions and Bonhams raised
$166.7 million from their car auctions in Monterey,  California .
Though the total was up from $150.2 million in 2010 and some
prices rose to records, demand was selective for more routine
models, said dealers.  The top-selling Ferrari yesterday, with red coachwork by
 Pininfarina , was the world’s fastest production car at the time
of its launch, with a maximum speed of more than 170mph. This
particular example was one of only 25 left-hand drive examples
built for the European market, said the London-based auction
house. It sold to a Far Eastern buyer in the room after being
estimated at 500,000 pounds to 600,000 pounds.  Jaguars Unsold  Much of the auction’s presale publicity was focused on a
rare 1963 “Semi-Lightweight” hardtop Jaguar E-Type that was one
of two road models built as variants of the 12 competition cars
the factory created to take on Ferrari at  Le Mans . Estimated to
fetch as much as 2 million pounds, it failed to find a buyer.  A similar fate befell a Lister-Jaguar racer that had
dominated the Sports Car Club of America championships of 1958
and 1959, valued at as much as 1 million pounds.  “They were undoubtedly brilliant cars,” Knight said of the
Jaguars. “The owners’ expectations were just a bit ahead of
where the market was.”  A 1964 Aston Martin DB5 offered by singer Shane Filan, of
the Irish pop band  Westlife , sold for 348,000 pounds to a
telephone bidder against a low valuation of 250,000 pounds. The
car had undergone three years of restoration for Filan, having
been found in dilapidated condition in  Kuala Lumpur ,  Malaysia ,
several years ago by the Aston specialist dealer  Desmond J.
Smail , said Bonhams.  Aston Restoration  “I think the seller probably made a profit,” said Knight.
“You can renovate an Aston for less than 200,000 pounds and if
you’re going to spend that kind of money restoring a car, you
may as well do it with a DB5.”  An Aston Martin DB5 was the runaround of choice for  James
Bond  in five movies, beginning with “Goldfinger” in 1964.  The more expensive Edwardian Silver Ghost was one of only
five surviving examples from 1908, and the other dated from 1911
and was a ceremonial car emblazoned with the coat of arms of the
Maharaja of Mysore. Both cars were in blue livery and had been
formerly owned by the Ohio collector Richard Solove, according
to the Bonhams catalog.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
