Taiwan ’s dollar posted its biggest
weekly decline in more than a year as concern  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis will worsen reduced demand for higher-
yielding assets.  International investors sold $409 million more of the
island’s stocks than they bought this week, according to
exchange data. Export orders, an indication of shipments in the
next one to three months, increased 7.6 percent in August from a
year earlier, slower than 11.1 percent in July, according to the
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before
official data due on Sept. 20.  “With the European debt issues, investors remain risk
averse, damping demand for emerging-market assets,” said Minori Uchida, a senior analyst in  Tokyo  at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. “The economy is cooling globally and that may hurt
 Asia ’s exports.”  The  Taiwan dollar  dropped 1.2 percent this week, the most
since May 2010, to NT$29.584 against the greenback as of 4 p.m.
local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency, which
advanced 0.2 percent today, touched NT$29.70 on Sept. 14, the
weakest level since March 1.  The currency strengthened today, snapping nine days of
losses, after the European  Central bank  said yesterday it will
coordinate with international policy makers to lend dollars to
euro-area banks to ensure they have enough cash.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent bonds due September 2021
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, this week to
1.28 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate
rose four basis points today.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was 0.398 percent, compared with 0.394
percent yesterday and a week ago, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
