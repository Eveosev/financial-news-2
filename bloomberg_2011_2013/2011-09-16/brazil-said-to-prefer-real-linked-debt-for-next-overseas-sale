Brazil ’s government prefers to sell
real-linked bonds overseas rather than dollar-denominated debt
as officials prepare the country’s second international offering
this year, said a person familiar with the matter.  Issuing a bond tied to the local currency will make it
easier for Brazilian companies to sell real-denominated notes
abroad, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
he wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. A real-
linked sale would also fit with the government’s goal of
extending maturities for local-currency debt, the person said.  A final decision hasn’t been made about what type of bonds
will be issued, he said.  Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin said Sept. 14 that the
government was considering a sale of international debt. The
choice of currency for the bond will depend on market
conditions, Augustin said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
