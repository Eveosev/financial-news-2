Yields on South African inflation-
linked bonds climbed at an auction of debt where supply exceeded
demand. The central bank received bids for 160 million rand of
the 600 million rand of notes it offered, and allocated 95
million rand of debt.  It sold 10 million rand of 2.6 percent debt maturing in
2028, with the yield rising to 2.44 percent compared with 2.27
percent at least weekâ€™s sale, the Pretoria-based South African
Reserve Bank said on its page on Bloomberg today.  The central bank sold 55 million rand of 2.75 percent bonds
due 2022 at 2.38 percent compared with 2.26 percent at the Sept.
9 sale. It also allocated 30 million rand of 3.45 percent bonds
due in 2033 at 2.4 percent compared with 2.29 percent at Sept. 9
sale.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
