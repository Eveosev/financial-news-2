Sudhakar Shanbhag, chief investment
officer at Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Ltd. in
Mumbai, comments on the outlook for Indian equities.  Shanbhag made his comments in a note to clients after the
nation’s central bank raised  interest rates  for the 12th time
since the start of March 2010.  “The increase in repo rate by 25 basis points is largely
in line with the market expectation. There’s been an effective
increase of 500 basis points from a low of 3.25 percent in the
reverse repo rate in the first quarter of calendar 2010 to the
current rate of 8.25 percent. The RBI will watch the impact of
rate increases on the inflation trajectory and implications of
global developments to change its course.”  “Equity markets have largely discounted higher inflation,
interest rate environment and lesser growth relative to the
previous year. Moderation in earnings for fiscal year 2012 and
2013 is also being discussed. The government focusing back on
some of the reforms can get interest back in the market. Global
uncertainty and continued lack of movement on the development
front locally can lead to corrections.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
