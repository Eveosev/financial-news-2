Brazilian auto-parts industry
workers said they may strike next week to back demands for a pay
increase similar to the 10 percent awarded to carmaker
employees.  About 70,000 members of the auto-parts workers’ union in
the  Sao Paulo  metropolitan area, where  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,  General
Motors Co. (GM)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  have factories, may stop work as
soon as Sept. 20, the union said in an e-mailed statement.  “We demand an agreement equal to the one reached by
workers at the car manufacturers,” union leader Sergio Nobre
said in the statement.  Another auto-parts workers union in  Sao Jose dos Campos ,
about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Sao Paulo, said it may take
similar action. GM also has a plant in Sao Jose dos Campos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
