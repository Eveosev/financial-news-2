The white, or refined sugar
delivered into the October contract in  London  may be just above
100,000 metric tons, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  “Our reading from this delivery is neither bullish nor
bearish,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at the company said in a
report e-mailed yesterday. The receiver probably needs the sugar
to cover previously agreed sales, he said.  The October contract on the NYSE Liffe exchange expired
yesterday and first notice for delivery will be today. White
sugar for October delivery was $30.20 a metric ton more
expensive than the sweetener for December delivery at the close
yesterday, data on Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
