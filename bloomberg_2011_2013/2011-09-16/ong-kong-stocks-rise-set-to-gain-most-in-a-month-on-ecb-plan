Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose,
paring its weekly loss, amid optimism a coordinated effort led
by the European Central Bank to lend dollars to euro-area banks
will contain the region’s debt crisis.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest bank by market value,
gained 3.1 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil
producer by market value, increased 3.4 percent after crude

2.1 percent. About three stocks gained for each that declined in
the 46-member gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong gained 2 percent to
10,249.20.  “Right now we have five countries joining together to
intervene, meaning that the government is showing it has strong
determination to make a change and rescue the market,” said
Lewis Wan, chief investment officer at Pride Investments Group
Ltd. in Hong Kong. “That greatly improved the market sentiment,
as everyone was worried about the European credit crisis in the
past few weeks.”  Bear Market  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  tumbled more than 20 percent from its
November high on concern the global recovery will falter amid
Europe’s debt crisis and a slowing U.S. economy. Shares on the

its revenue from Europe, increased 1.1 percent to HK$67.35.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent
today. In  New York , the index advanced 1.7 percent yesterday as
the  European Central Bank  said that in coordination with the
 Federal Reserve , the  Bank of England , the Bank of Japan and the
Swiss National Bank, it will lend dollars to euro-area banks in
three separate three-month loans to ensure they have enough of
the U.S. currency through the end of the year.  Crude Oil  Cnooc rose 3.4 percent to HK$13.86, while PetroChina Co.,
the nation’s largest oil company by market value, increased 2
percent to HK$9.84.  Crude oil for October delivery rose 0.6 percent to settle
at $89.40 a barrel in New York yesterday as investors speculated
that a coordinated international plan to contain Europe’s debt
crisis will support economic growth and boost fuel demand.  Among stocks that fell, Esprit tumbled 19 percent to
HK$12.22, its biggest two-day retreat since October 1997. The
company yesterday said its full-year net income sank 98 percent.
