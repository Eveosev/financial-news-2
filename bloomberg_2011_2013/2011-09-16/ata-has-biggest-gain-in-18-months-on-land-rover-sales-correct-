(Corrects headline to show gain is biggest in 18 months.)  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of the
Jaguar and  Land Rover  brands, headed for its biggest gain in 18
months after August sales of the luxury sports utility vehicle
increased at the fastest pace in more than a year.  Tata Motors gained 7.7 percent to 162.95 rupees at 2:58
p.m. Mumbai time, the steepest gain since March 2, 2010. The
stock tumbled 38 percent this year before today, falling as much
as 6.2 percent Sept. 12 after Chief Executive Officer Carl-Peter Forster, who helped Jaguar Land Rover unit return to profit in
the year ended March 31, resigned Sept. 9.  Land Rover sales have increased every month since November
2009, when Tata Motors starting reporting its monthly global
sales, helping counter waning demand for Jaguar and the Nano,
the world’s cheapest car. The company began delivering the
Evoque compact sport utility vehicle on Sept. 9 and plans to
introduce a new Defender model in 2015.  “Sales have been very good especially in emerging markets,
where people prefer luxury sports utility vehicles over
sedans,” said Umesh Karne, a Mumbai-based analyst with Brics
Securities Ltd. “Next month too, sales will increase as the
deliveries of the Evoque have started.”  Global sales of trucks and buses rose 17 percent to 48,023
vehicles in August, the company said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday after markets closed. The sales of Jaguar Land Rover
rose 31 percent to 21,242 vehicles, propelled by a 43 percent
increase in Land Rover sales, the fastest pace since May 2010.  The Jaguar Land Rover unit, based in Gaydon,  England ,
generated 57 percent of Tata Motors’ revenue for the year ended
March 31, up from 53 percent a year earlier.  Jaguar aims to challenge Bayerische Motoren Werke AG with a
hybrid supercar and an entry-level sedan to compete with the 3-
Series. The new models are part of Tata’s plans to invest 1.5
billion pounds ($2.4 billion) annually in product development at
Jaguar and Land Rover over the next five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
