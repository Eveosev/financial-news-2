China  will raise the threshold next
month for subsidies to automakers making energy-saving vehicles
as it continues to unwind stimulus measures imposed in the wake
of the global recession.  From Oct. 1, cars weighing 1,205 kilograms to 1,320
kilograms must have average fuel consumption of at least 6.3
liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers to qualify for state
subsidies of 3,000 yuan ($470) a vehicle, according to a
 statement  posted by the Ministry of Finance on its website today.
The new rule will replace the existing fuel criterion of 6.9
liters per 100 kilometers, in place since June 1, 2010.  Under the new rules, the finance ministry reduced 16
vehicle weight categories to seven classes. All qualifying
automobiles must have 1.6-liter engines or smaller.  Vehicle sales in China are forecast to slow this year from
the 32 percent growth rate in 2010, after the government removed
sales-tax breaks and rebates for rural buyers in January. Auto
demand also waned after the central bank raised  interest rates 
five times since October and ordered lenders to set aside a
record amount as reserves, according to industry analyst Dunne &
Co.  The government disbursed subsidies for 2.15 million energy-
saving cars as of the end of May, according to the  finance
ministry .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
