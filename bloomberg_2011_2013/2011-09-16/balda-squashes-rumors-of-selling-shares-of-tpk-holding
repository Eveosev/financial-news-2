shares of  TPK Holding Co., a supplier of touch-panels for  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)   It said it had not done “this kind of transaction due to
the current market volatility and the current market price,”
adding that it “will monitor the market situation and
coordinate closely with TPK to ensure a smooth exit process and
to minimize market impact.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
