Commodities may drop to the lowest
level since November after failing to breach key resistance
levels, according to  technical analysis  by Commerzbank AG.  The S&P GSCI Total Return Index of 24 commodities has
failed at the downtrend and 200-day moving average resistance at
5,090 and 5,150, London-based Karen Jones, head of fixed-income,
commodity and currency technical analysis, wrote in a Sept. 14
report. A resistance level indicates a price at which sell
orders may accumulate when a security is rising.  “We favor failure here and will maintain a negative
bias,” Jones wrote. “Failure here should initiate a slide back
to the August 19th low of 4,723 and then the August low at
4,530.”  Further losses could then take the index back to the 50
percent retracement of the 2010 and 2011 advance at 4,446, the
report said. A fall below that level may spur a decline to the
4,268 November low and the 2009 and 2011 support line at 4,293,
it said.  The index has risen 1.1 percent this year after advancing 9
percent last year. The gauge rose 0.6 percent to 4,996.400
yesterday.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
