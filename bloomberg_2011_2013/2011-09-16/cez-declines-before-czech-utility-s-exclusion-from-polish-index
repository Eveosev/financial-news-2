CEZ AS (CEZ) , the largest Czech power
utility, fell to its lowest in 2 1/2 years as its exclusion from
 Poland ’s benchmark equity index may prompt some investors to
reduce holdings of the stock.  The shares slid 3.4 percent, the most since Aug. 8, to 741
koruna at the 4:24 p.m. close in  Prague , the lowest since April
2009. The Czech Republic’s PX gauge of companies, where CEZ has
a 21 percent weighting, fell 1.8 percent. In Warsaw, CEZ was
last trading down 3.7 percent to 129 zloty.  Poland’s Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA, the biggest coking-
coal producer in the European Union that sold 33 percent of its
shares in an initial public offering in June, will replace CEZ
in the country’s WIG20 index today after the close of trading,
the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  said in a statement in August.  “We could see higher trading activity in CEZ today by
investors following the Polish index,” analysts at J&T Banka AS
led by Milan Vanicek wrote in an e-mailed report. “A removal
from an index is usually negative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
