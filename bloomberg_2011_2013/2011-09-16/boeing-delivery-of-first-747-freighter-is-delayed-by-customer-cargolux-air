Boeing Co. (BA)  said the first delivery
of its 747-8 freighter has been postponed by Cargolux Airlines
International SA because of “unresolved issues.”  “Boeing will not deliver our first freighter on Monday,
Sept. 19 as previously announced,”  Jim Proulx , a spokesman for
the Chicago-based planemaker, said, declining to be specific
about the reasons for Cargolux’s delay. “We continue to work
with Cargolux and look forward to delivering its airplanes.”  The 747-8 freighter won certification last month from the
U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  to enter commercial
service, capping a two-year, $2.04 billion delay for Boeing’s
biggest plane ever. Luxembourg-based Cargolux was to be the
first to receive the jumbo jets, with two scheduled to have been
delivered next week.  Boeing has postponed two days of ceremonies and events that
were planned, Proulx said.  Martine Scheuren, a spokeswoman for Cargolux, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
