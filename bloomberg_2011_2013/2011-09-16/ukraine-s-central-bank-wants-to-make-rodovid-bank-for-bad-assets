Ukraine’s central bank proposed
that state lender PAT Rodovid Bank become a bank for bad assets.  Rodovid will accumulate bad assets of other state lenders
if the government approves the plan, the Kiev-based central bank
said in a statement on its website today. Temporary state
management over Rodovid was removed yesterday, according to the
statement.  The government nationalized troubled lenders PAT Rodovid,
VAT Ukrgazbank and AK Bank Kiev in 2009 after the banks ran into
liquidity problems. The bank rescue was a part of an
International Monetary Fund loan agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
