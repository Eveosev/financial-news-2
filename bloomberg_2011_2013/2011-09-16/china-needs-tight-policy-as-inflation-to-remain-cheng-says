China should maintain a tight
monetary policy as inflation is unlikely to ease soon, Cheng
Siwei, a former vice chairman of the National Peopleâ€™s Congress,
said at the  World Economic Forum  in the northeastern Chinese
city of Dalian today.  Gross domestic product for the Asian nation is expected to
increase by a little more than 9 percent this year, while growth
in the consumer price index will likely exceed 5 percent, Cheng
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
