Oil options volatility declined as
the underlying futures tumbled in  New York  on concern that
European leaders meeting today haven’t taken sufficient steps to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 37 percent at 1 p.m. in New York,
down from 37.4 percent yesterday.  Oil for October delivery fell $1.57, or 1.8 percent, to
$87.83 a barrel at 1:11 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures have fallen 3.9 percent this year. November
futures retreated $1.50, or 1.8 percent, to $88.08 a barrel.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
November $75 puts, with 2,789 lots changing hands. The options
rose 5 cents to 80 cents a barrel. November $110 calls, the
next-most-active options, slipped 2 cents to 11 cents a barrel
on volume of 1,386 lots. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of
crude.  October options expired at the close of Nymex floor trading
yesterday.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  November $80 puts were the most active non-October options
traded in the previous session, with 2,710 lots changing hands.
They fell 25 cents to $1.36 a barrel. The next-most active
options, December $85 puts, retreated 43 cents to $4.14 a barrel
on volume of 2,671.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
