Gold rose the most in a week on
renewed concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will threaten
economies, boosting demand for a haven.  European finance ministers ruled out efforts to prop up the
faltering economy and gave no indication of providing aid for
lenders at a meeting today. Gold has jumped 28 percent this
year, reaching a record $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6, on
mounting signs the global economy will slow.  “People realize that the background problems have not
disappeared, and the crisis in Europe has not been resolved,”
 William O’Neill , a partner at Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle
River,  New Jersey , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $33.30, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $1,814.70 on the Comex at 1:49 p.m. in New
York, the biggest gain since Sept. 8.  Still, prices declined 2.4 percent this week. Yesterday,
the  European Central Bank  said it will coordinate with other
central banks to ensure euro-area lenders have enough dollars.  “They’re only really geared to put out spot fires and play
brinkmanship, rather than to deliver a killer package that will
actually resolve all their issues,” Tom Price, an analyst at
UBS AG, said by telephone from Sydney. “In that environment,
the problem drags on for years, not months, and it’s a great
environment for gold.”  Eighteen months of crisis-fighting and 256 billion euros
($352 billion) in aid for Greece, Ireland and Portugal have
failed to stabilize markets as the turmoil spread to Italy and
Spain.  ‘Orderly Default’  “They are moving to facilitate an orderly default for
 Greece , and then rallying around the remaining countries and
banking system,” James Dailey, who manages $215 million at TEAM
Financial Management LLC in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said in a
telephone interview. “They can’t fix a problem that has no
answer, but they can get rid of some of the degree of
uncertainty by acting.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose $1.33, or 3.4
percent, to settle at $40.831 an ounce on the Comex. The metal
retreated 1.9 percent this week, a second straight loss.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed $33.30, or 1.9 percent, to $1,813.90 an
ounce, the biggest jump since Aug. 9. Palladium futures for
December delivery rose $9.45, or 1.3 percent, to $732.95 an
ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
