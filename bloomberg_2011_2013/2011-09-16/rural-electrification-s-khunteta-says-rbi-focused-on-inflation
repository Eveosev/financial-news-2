Hari Das Khunteta, Chairman of
Rural Electrification Corp., a state-controlled lender to power
projects, comments on the Indian central bank’s decision to
increase benchmark  interest rates  by 25 basis points today.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  raised its repurchase rate to
8.25 percent from 8 percent, the bank said in a statement.
Fourteen of 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted
the decision and three expected no change.  “I had thought the RBI will give a surprise by not
increasing rates, but they have given importance to inflation.
For them, controlling inflation is more important than growth.”  “We have raised lending rates by 75 basis points since
April 1, the start of this financial year. We will wait and
watch and see whether banks are raising interest rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
