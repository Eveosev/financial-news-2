Niger’s  army attacked a base
belonging to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the terror group’s
North African branch, near the country’s border with  Libya ,
killing three fighters, according to the Ministry of Defense.  The clash yesterday came amid Niger’s attempts to increase
security along its desert border with Libya, the Niamey-based
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. A group of 59
young fighters who the military said were recruited by the group
known as AQIM were released.  Last week, one soldier died and three others were killed in
fighting between an army patrol and alleged drug dealers,
according to the statement. The military seized three vehicles
containing cannabis, weapons and ammunition, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
