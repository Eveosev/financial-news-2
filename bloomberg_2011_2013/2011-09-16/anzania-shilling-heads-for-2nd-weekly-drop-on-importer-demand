Tanzania’s shilling headed for a
second weekly drop against the dollar as oil importers increased
demand for the greenback.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy added
0.3 percent to 1,635.5 per dollar by 1:05 p.m in Dar es Salaam,
the commercial capital, paring its retreat this week to 0.2
percent. Earlier, the currency fell as much as 0.5 percent.  “Demand from oil importers has been on for most of the
trading sessions this week,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with
National Bank of Commerce Ltd., Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian
unit. said by phone from Dar es Salaam.  The shilling slipped to 1,659.75 on Sept. 12, the weakest
on record. Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 14.1 percent in
August from 13 percent a month earlier on higher energy and food
