Deepali Bhargava, chief economist
at Espirito Santo Securities in Mumbai, comments on India’s
interest rates and inflation after the central bank increased
the benchmark borrowing cost for the sixth time this year.  The  Reserve Bank  of India today raised the repurchase rate
by a quarter-percentage point to 8.25 percent after data this
week showed the wholesale-price index rose 9.78 percent in
August from a year, the most in 13 months. Bhargava spoke in a
telephone interview  “The central bank has made it clear that it can’t give up
its present stance of containing inflation as the situation is
going to get uglier in coming months after the recent increase
in fuel prices.  ‘‘I was expecting the central bank will elaborate more on
the global developments and how growth estimates are being
revised downward, how macro-economic conditions are
deteriorating.  ‘‘They will have to take into consideration what stance the
U.S. Federal Reserve takes next week. If the Fed decides on
further quantitative easing, commodity prices will accelerate.
That will be of concern for  India .  ‘‘So, it’s a bit early to predict what India will do in the
October policy statement.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
