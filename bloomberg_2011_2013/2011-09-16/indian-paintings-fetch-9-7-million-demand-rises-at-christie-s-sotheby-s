Paintings by Indian artists
including Maqbool Fida Husain and  Jehangir Sabavala , who both
died this year, fetched $9.7 million in auctions by  Sotheby’s (BID) 
and Christie’s International this week as U.S., European and
Asian buyers bid above estimates.  A private U.S. buyer paid the top price of $1.1 million for
Husain’s oil painting “Sprinkling Horses.” Husain, who began
his career painting movie posters and had no formal training,
died in June at the age of 95.  The painting was part of a Christie’s sale this week of
South Asian modern and contemporary art that was worth $7.4
million, according to a statement from the auction house. A
similar sale by Sotheby’s yesterday in  New York  was worth $2.3
million, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  Raja Ravi Varma’s picture of a “ Himalayan Beauty ” went to
a private European buyer for $266,500, 78 percent more than its
high estimate, Sotheby’s said. The painting passed though the
family collection of Varma’s German printing technician. Varma
was a self-taught artist who died in 1906.  Syed Haider Raza’s abstract work “Eglise” sold for
$362,500 at the Sotheby’s sale. His “Saurashtra” sold for 2.4
million pounds in June 2010 in a Christie’s auction, a record
for a modern or contemporary Indian work of art. Raza, 89,
graduated from the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  “The Cobweb Cloud” by Jehangir Sabavala, whose pictures
feature subdued tones and dreamy landscapes, sold for $266,500
at Sotheby’s. The painter, who studied at the Heatherley School
of Fine Art in  London  and Academie Julian in Paris, died on
Sept. 2.  The Christie’s sale sold 13 of Husain’s works, which
fetched a total of $4.2 million. His works sold for a total of
$557,500 at the Sotheby’s auction.  In June, a painting of the Hindu goddess Kali by Tyeb
Mehta, who died in 2009, sold for $1.3 million, more than three
times its estimate, at a $4 million online auction by Mumbai-
based  Saffronart  as demand for Indian artworks increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
