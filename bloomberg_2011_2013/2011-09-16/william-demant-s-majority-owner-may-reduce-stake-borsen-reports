Oticon Fonden, which owns about 60
percent of William Demant Holding A/S, may reduce its stake in
the hearing-aid maker if it finds investment opportunities for
its other unit, newspaper Borsen reported, citing Oticon
Chairman Niels Boserup.  The fund may lower its stake to 50 percent or 55 percent
and use proceeds for its William Demant Invest division, Boserup
said, according to the Copenhagen-based newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
