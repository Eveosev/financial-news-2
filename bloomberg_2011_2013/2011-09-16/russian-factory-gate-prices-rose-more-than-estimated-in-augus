Russian producer prices rose more
than economists estimated last month.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines grew 18.5
percent from a year earlier after a 16.1 percent advance in
July, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said in an e-
mailed statement today. The median forecast of 11 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 14 percent.  Factory-gate prices advanced 4.6 percent in August from the
previous month after a 1 percent drop in July, the service said.
Economists predicted an increase of 0.9 percent, according to
the median of nine estimates in a separate Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
