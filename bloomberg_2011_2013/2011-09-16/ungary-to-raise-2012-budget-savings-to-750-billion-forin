Hungary is targeting to improve the
2012 budget balance by 750 billion forint, 200 billion forint
more than planned, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said.  Of the planned savings, 450 billion forint will come from
higher revenue, including a value-added tax increase to 27
percent from 25 percent, Matolcsy said at a press conference in
Budapest today.  The higher VAT rate will yield 150 billion forint in extra
revenues, which the government will set aside in a special
budget reserve, Matolcsy said. Total budget reserves will amount
to 300 billion forint next year, according to the minister.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
