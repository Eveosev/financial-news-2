Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FLOURMIL) , which
processes grains and sells cement, will offer shares to existing
investors at 62 naira apiece, said Walter Bassey, an equity
trader at CSL Stockbrokers Ltd.  Flour Mills is selling 455.6 million shares in the rights
offer, and shareholders will be entitled to buy eight new shares
for every 33 already held, Bassey said in an e-mailed statement,
citing information provided to brokers by the stock exchange.
The qualifying date is Oct. 7, he said.  The company plans to raise as much as 28 billion naira
($179 million) from the rights offer, Chief Executive Officer
Emmanuel Ukpabi told shareholders at an annual general meeting
in Lagos,  Nigeria â€™s commercial capital, on Sept. 7. The money
will be used to diversify into new markets including power
generation, he said.  Shares in the company closed unchanged at 78.99 naira in
Lagos yesterday. The stock has gained 14 percent so far this
year, compared with a 15 percent decline by the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
