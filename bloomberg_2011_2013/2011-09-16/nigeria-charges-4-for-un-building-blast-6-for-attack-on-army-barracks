Nigerian prosecutors charged four
suspected Islamic militants today in court for a car-bomb attack
last month on the United Nations building in the capital Abuja
which killed 23 people, according to court proceedings.  Six other suspected militants were also charged for bomb
attacks on military barracks in the northern city of Bauchi and
Abuja.  Presiding Magistrate Azubike Okegu said his court lacked
the jurisdiction to try the suspects and ordered that they will
be remanded in prison until the trial is assigned to a competent
high court.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
