California Governor  Jerry Brown 
vetoed a bill that he said would have “undermined” investor
confidence in the state.  The vetoed bill would have altered the trigger cuts
mechanism in the fiscal 2011 state budget, according to an e-
mailed statement from the governor’s office.  Brown also signed a bill that will provide funds to
hospitals and another that extends a tax on Medi-Cal managed
health-care plans for an additional year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
