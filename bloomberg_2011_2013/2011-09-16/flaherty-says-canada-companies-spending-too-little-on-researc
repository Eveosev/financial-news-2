Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said “unacceptably low” levels of investment in
research and development by companies is weighing down the
nation’s competitiveness.  “We have unacceptably low levels of support for R&D and
innovation in many parts of the Canadian private sector,”
Flaherty said today in the text of a speech he’s giving in
Waterloo, Ontario, home of  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)   While the global economy is “increasingly driven by new
ideas and knowledge-based industries,”  Canada  trails other
nations in overall business spending on research and
development, Flaherty said. Such spending has been decreasing in
real terms since 2006, he said.  “Our greatest renewable national resource is our grey
matter, and our government has gone to great lengths to nurture
it. It is plain to all that Canada’s private sector cannot rest
on its laurels,” Flaherty said.  Flaherty noted that the Geneva-based World Economic Forum
cited spending by Canadian businesses on research and
development as an area for improvement in a Sept. 7 report.  The government appointed a panel in October headed by
Thomas Jenkins, chairman of software company  Open Text Corp. (OTC) , to
review federal financial support of research and development.
The panel is expected to report in October, Flaherty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
