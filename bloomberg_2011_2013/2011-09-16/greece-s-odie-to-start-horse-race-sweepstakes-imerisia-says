Greece  will revive a 1948 license
that allows the country’s state-run horse-betting and racing
operator,  ODIE , to offer sweepstakes, Imerisia reported, without
citing anyone.  The move, to be applied from next month for horse-races in
Greece, France and the U.K., is to help ODIE boost revenue
without the need for any investment; the company is scheduled to
be sold to investors before the end of the year, the newspaper
 said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
