Asian currencies fell this week,
with Indonesia’s rupiah sliding the most since June 2009, as
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen led investors to favor
safer bets than emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index touched a five-
month low on Sept. 15 as global funds pulled more than $2
billion from equities in  South Korea , Taiwan and Indonesia since
the end of last week. The Asian Development Bank this week cut
its 2011 growth forecast for the region excluding  Japan  to 7.5
percent, from an April estimate of 7.8 percent.  The Asia Dollar Index slumped 0.7 percent this week to
117.56 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupiah declined 2.4 percent to 8,800 and South Korea’s won
tumbled 3.1 percent to 1,112.10 per dollar, the region’s worst
performance.  India ’s rupee slid 1.5 percent to 47.2650,
Malaysia’s ringgit dropped 2.3 percent to 3.08 and Taiwan’s
dollar fell 1.2 percent to NT$29.584. Losses for the won, rupee,
ringgit and Taiwan dollar were the worst since mid-2010.  “Asian currencies are under downward pressure as the
European debt crisis prevails in the market and deters risk-
taking,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a currency trader at Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “There is growing concern
about the outlook for exports from Asia given conditions in the
U.S. and Europe.”  Economic Risks  India’s industrial production expanded in July at the
slowest pace since October 2009 and Philippine exports fell for
a third straight month, reports showed this week.  Taiwan ’s
export orders, an indication of shipments in the next one to
three months, increased 7.6 percent in August from a year
earlier, compared with growth of 11.1 percent in July, according
to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey
before official data due on Sept. 20.  South Korean Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said at a
meeting yesterday that global economic risks are growing. His
ministry phoned media outlets including Bloomberg News Sept. 15
to signal possible intervention in the currency market, the
first time it’s done so since April 2010.  The won gained 0.4 percent yesterday after the  European
Central Bank  said it will coordinate with the  Federal Reserve 
and international policy makers in lending dollars to euro-area
banks to ensure they have enough cash through year-end. U.S.
retail sales stagnated in August and manufacturing in the New
York region is contracting at the fastest pace since November,
data showed this week.  “The international policy makers’ pledge to lend dollars
to euro-zone banks helped calm investor sentiment,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul.
“Still, it’s not a fundamental solution, and will only support
markets for the short term.”  Intervention  Bank  Indonesia  intervened in the rupiah and bond markets,
Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said on Sept. 14, when the
currency declined as much as 2.6 percent and reached 8,939, the
weakest level since February.  “Talk of a possible Greek default and the country exiting
from the euro region” deterred risk-taking, said Wiwig Santoso,
head of treasury and markets at PT Bank DBS Indonesia in Jakarta.
“There are concerns of a global economic slowdown, and the
rupiah isn’t isolated from market developments.”  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht fell 1 percent this week to
30.37 per dollar and the Philippine peso dropped 1.9 percent to
43.26.  China ’s yuan strengthened 0.08 percent to 6.3834.  -- Judy Chen . With assistance from Jiyeun Lee in  Seoul  and
