(Corrects story from 10:28 a.m. London time to show company
is no longer selling shares.)  Balda AG (BAF)  jumped the most in more
than a month in Frankfurt trading before the company said it
isn’t selling a $215 million stake in TPK Holding Co., a
supplier of touch-panels for Apple Inc.  Balda surged as much as 16 percent to 8.12 euros, the
biggest gain since Aug. 9, and traded 8.7 percent higher at 7.60
euros as of 2:52 p.m. local time.  The Bad Oeynhausen, Germany-based company said in an OTS
statement that it hasn’t made “the necessary filing with the
Taiwanese Stock Exchange” to sell a stake in TPK. Balda said it
will “monitor the market situation and coordinate closely with
TPK to ensure a smooth exit process,” according to the
statement.  Clas Roehl, a spokesman for Balda, was not available to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
