Home sales in the  San Francisco  Bay
area rose 12 percent in August from a year earlier as properties
in foreclosure attracted buyers, according to  DataQuick .  A total of 7,513 houses and condominiums sold in the nine-
county region last month, a 9.1 percent increase from July, the
San Diego-based data seller said today in a statement.
Foreclosures and short sales, where the price is less than the
amount owned on the loan, made up almost half of transactions.  “Lower prices and mortgage rates lured some homebuyers off
the sidelines last month, but too many others lacked the
confidence to step into the game,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said in the statement. “They worried about their job, or
about prices falling more.”  The median price paid was $370,000, down 3.9 percent from
August 2010 and 1.1 percent from the previous month. It was the
11th consecutive decline on a year-over-year basis, and all nine
counties showed price drops, DataQuick said.  Eight of the nine counties had sales increases from a year
earlier, with Napa unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
