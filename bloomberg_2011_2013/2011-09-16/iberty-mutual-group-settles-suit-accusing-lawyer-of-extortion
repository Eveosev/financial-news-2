Liberty Mutual  Insurance Co.
settled a lawsuit the insurer filed against one of its former
outside lawyers claiming he tried to extort new legal work with
a threat to expose misconduct by an unidentified company
executive.  U.S. District Judge Richard J. Sullivan in  Manhattan 
ordered the case dismissed after receiving a letter on Sept. 8
from Boston-based Liberty Mutual informing the court that they
had reached an agreement with Michael J. Devereaux and his law
firm Devereaux & Associates, according to a court filing.  Liberty Mutual sued Devereaux in January, saying the  New
York  lawyer threatened to file a suit claiming the executive had
engaged in “personal misconduct” and demanded a 5 percent
kickback of all fees the company paid the  law firm .  “We are pleased that the litigation has been resolved and
that we have concluded our relationship with the Devereaux
firm,” Liberty Mutual said in a statement.  Devereaux didn’t immediately return a message seeking
comment on the settlement.  The case is Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. vs. Michael J.
Devereaux & Associates PC, 11-cv-359, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
