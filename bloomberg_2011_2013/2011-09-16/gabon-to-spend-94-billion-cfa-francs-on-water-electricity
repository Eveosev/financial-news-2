Gabon will spend 94 billion  CFA
francs  ($197 million) to ease a shortage of water and
electricity in the capital, Libreville, and nearby areas, the
central African nation’s Council of Ministers said today.  Part of the money will be used to install a water pipe
between the city and Ntoum, 80 kilometers (50 miles) away,
according to an e-mailed statement. Gabon has also paid 11.5
billion francs of debt owed by the state to the Societe
d’Energie et d’Eau du Gabon, the utility monopoly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
