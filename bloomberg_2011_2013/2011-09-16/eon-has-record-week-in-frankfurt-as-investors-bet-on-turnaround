EON AG,  Germany ’s largest power
utility, had a record weekly gain in Frankfurt trading as
investors expect a turnaround in the industry.  EON gained 17 percent this week, the most since the company
was formed in 2000. Shares in the Duesseldorf-based company rose
3.5 percent to 15.62 euros a share at the 5:30 p.m. close.  RWE
AG (RWE) , the No. 2 utility, was up 2.8 percent to close at 25.54
euros a share. The stock gained 13 percent this week, the most
since November 2008.  “The utilities have seen disproportionate losses in the
past months and that is being corrected now as investors expect
an end to negative surprises and dividend yields near the 7
percent range, which has some charm indeed,” Peter Wirtz, a
WestLB AG analyst, said by phone.  EON, RWE, EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG and Vattenfall
AB have extended cost-cutting and asset sale programs in what
they say is a way to mitigate losses from  Chancellor Angela
Merkel ’s decision to close the country’s atomic reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
