OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s largest
producer of potash, agreed to borrow $1 billion for five years
from banks led by  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  ING Groep NV (INGA)  to cut
financing costs.  The loan, with a rate of 180 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate, will go toward refinancing an earlier
OAO Sberbank loan that Silvinit, now a unit of Uralkali, took to
fund the development of the Polovodovsky potash deposit. The
Sberbank loan was for 45 billion rubles ($1.5 billion) at 8.9
percent including bank fees, according to a company report.  “The interest rate is low as Uralkali probably started to
negotiate it some time ago,”  Mikhail Stiskin , a Moscow-based
analyst at Troika Dialog, said by phone today. “The company has
very strong balance, which helped.”  With the new loan, Uralkali lowered its average  interest
rate  to about 3 percent, while decreasing currency risks, Chief
Financial Officer Viktor Belyakov said in the statement.  Uralkali is using rising potash prices and benefits it
expects from the Silvinit acquisition completed in June to cut
borrowing costs for the combined company. In August, Uralkali’s
trading arm increased potash prices for India by 32 percent from
a year earlier to $490 a metric ton. Uralkali raised prices for
China twice this year, in January and July. The China price is
now $470 a ton, 34 percent higher than in the same period in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
