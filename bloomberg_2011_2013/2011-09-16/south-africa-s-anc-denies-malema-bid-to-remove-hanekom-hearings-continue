South Africa ’s  African National
Congress  denied a bid by  Julius Malema , the leader of the ruling
party’s youth wing, to remove the head of a disciplinary
committee that’s due to rule on whether he broke party rules.  The panel withdrew a second charge against Malema, saying
it should be heard separately, the committee, which will
complete its hearings next week, said in an e-mailed statement
today. ANC spokesman Keith Khoza couldn’t immediately give
details of the charge when called on his mobile phone today.  Malema, 30, had applied for Derek Hanekom to be removed as
chairman of the committee, arguing that previous comments he
made on land expropriation meant he could be “conflicted,” the
ANC said. He unsuccessfully sought to remove three members of
the panel on Aug. 30.  Malema, who is lobbying the government to nationalize the
country’s mines, faces disciplinary action, including suspension
from the party, for charges including bringing the party into
disrepute. He’s been accused of criticizing ANC leaders and on
July 31 called for the removal of the administration of
Botswana’s President Ian Khama for being a “puppet of the
West.”  The disciplinary committee will proceed with Malema’s
hearing today and tomorrow, the party said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
