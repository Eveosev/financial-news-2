Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the
nation’s biggest carmaker, said it expects the central bank’s
decision to raise  interest rates  to damp demand for automobiles.  “This will hurt the sentiment for the auto industry going
forward,” Maruti’s Chief Financial Officer Ajay Seth said in a
telephone interview today after the  Reserve Bank  of India raised
interest rates for the 12th time since the start of March 2010.  About 80 percent of car purchases in India are funded
through bank loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
