Charles Macgregor, Singapore-based
senior vice president for Asian fixed income at Aviva Investors,
comments on demand for higher-grade Asian bonds at a Euromoney
conference in Singapore:  “As far as triple-As are concerned, it’s relatively
limited to the Singaporean government and the Hong Kong
government. There’s not a lot supply at the high end of the
market. It’s probably a space where people would like to invest.  ‘‘What we’ve seen is more money going into sovereigns and
pricing has become quite tight compared to what we see the
credit risk is.  ‘‘The flipside is that when you look at what’s been
happening with ratings in  Europe  and how the agencies have been
quite quick to downgrade countries there and you look at the
Asian nations that have been extremely stable throughout this
whole crisis, you have to ask the question whether they should
be rated a little bit higher.  ‘‘Probably Thailand and  Malaysia  could be more highly
rated. There’s a lot of interest in the  Philippines  and
 Indonesia  as to when they will actually cross over to investment
grade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
