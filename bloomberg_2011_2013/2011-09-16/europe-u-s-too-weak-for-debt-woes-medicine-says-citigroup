Europe  and the U.S. are not
economically strong enough to “endure the austerity that’s
necessary to resolve” their debt problems, said  Greg Anderson ,
a senior currency strategist at Citigroup Inc.  Kicking the can down the road, or implementing measures to
temporarily staunch the crises, is the “best you could hope to
do in both Europe’s situation and the U.S.’s situation,” New
York-based Anderson said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio’s
“Surveillance” with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.  Anderson spoke as European finance ministers and central
bankers were joined by U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner 
in Wroclaw, Poland, to discuss possible solutions to the euro-
region’s debt crisis.  The European Central Bank yesterday said it will coordinate
with the  Federal Reserve  and other central banks to conduct
three separate dollar liquidity operations to ensure lenders
have enough of the currency through the end of the year.  The measures show “policy makers are gearing up for the
potential of major volatility like we saw in 2008 and they’re
proactively going back to 2008-type measures,” Anderson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
