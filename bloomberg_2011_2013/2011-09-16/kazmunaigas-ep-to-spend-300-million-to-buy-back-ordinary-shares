KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) 
plans to spend as much as $300 million to buy back ordinary
shares through the end of 2012, the oil unit of  Kazakhstan ’s
state energy company said.  The board believes that the current share price doesn’t
reflect the true underlying value of the business, KazMunaiGas
EP said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Astana-based oil producer said it will continue an
earlier approved buyback of preferred shares until the end of
this year. The parent company, KazMunaiGaz National Co., will
not be selling its shares in KazMunaiGas EP, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
