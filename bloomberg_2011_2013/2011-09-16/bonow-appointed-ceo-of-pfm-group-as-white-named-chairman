John Bonow has been named chief
executive officer of PFM Group, owner of the largest  investment
adviser  in the U.S. municipal bond market.  Bonow, 42, a 20-year company veteran, has been managing
PFM’s West Coast utilities practices. He will replace F. John White, 64, who will become chairman, the Philadelphia-based
company said in an e-mailed statement.  “My priorities for the coming year are to build on PFM’s
outstanding culture of independence and dedication to client
service, and to expand our service capacity,” Bonow said in the
statement.  Bonow joined PFM Group, the parent of advisory firm Public
Financial Management, in 1991 after graduating from  Yale
University , where he majored in economics, the statement said.
He has spent his career with PFM on the West Coast, first
expanding its financial-advising practice in  San Francisco  and
then opening PFM’s Seattle office in 2002. Bonow and his family
will move to Philadelphia, the statement said.  Public Financial Management was ranked first in proceeds
among U.S. municipal advisers in the first quarter by  Thomson
Reuters . The unit advised on 988 transactions involving $57.5
billion last year, the company  says  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
