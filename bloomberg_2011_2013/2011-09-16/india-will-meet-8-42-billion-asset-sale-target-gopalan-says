The Indian government will meet its
target of raising 400 billion rupees ($8.42 billion) from stake
sales in state-run companies in the year through March, a top
bureaucrat in the  finance ministry  said.  “India is confident of meeting the share sale target for
the current financial year,” R. Gopalan, economic affairs
secretary in the finance ministry, said in an interview in  New
Delhi  today. “We expect to stick to the borrowing targets for
the current year.”  Oil & Natural Gas Corp., India’s largest energy exploration
company, today deferred a planned offering amid a stock slump
that is threatening to derail Finance Minister  Pranab
Mukherjee ’s aim to curb the  budget deficit . The government has
raised 11.4 billion rupees in this fiscal year, or 2.9 percent
of the target.  The decision on ONGC follows a similar one in June when the
government put off an offering by Steel Authority of  India  Ltd.
as the benchmark Sensitive Index slid 17 percent in 2011. The
number of Indian companies that sold shares since April fell to
29 from 44 in the same period a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The government plans to reduce its fiscal deficit to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product in the year ending March 31,
the lowest in four years on expectation of higher revenue
collection and lower subsidy payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
