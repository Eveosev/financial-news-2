Hurricane Maria crossed
Newfoundlandâ€™s Avalon Peninsula and weakened to a post-tropical
storm, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at
about 4:40 p.m. East Coast time.  Hurricane and storm watches for the Newfoundland coast have
been dropped, the center said. Maria, now in the Atlantic 145
miles (233 kilometers) north-northeast of Cape Race, is forecast
to be absorbed by a cold front later today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
