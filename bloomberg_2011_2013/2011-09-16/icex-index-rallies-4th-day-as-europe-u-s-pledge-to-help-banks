Russian stocks retreated for the
first week in four as oil dropped and OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,
the country’s biggest miner, retreated the most in 4 1/2 months
after announcing plans to sell convertible bonds.  Norilsk dropped 6.2 percent, the most since May 7, after
Chief Executive Vladimir Strzhalkovsky said the company will
fund a $4.5 billion share buyback using Eurobonds convertible
into shares. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, fell
1.7 percent. Those movements lifted the 30-stock Micex gauge 0.9
percent to 1,511.50 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, pushing it
to a 0.4 percent loss in the week.  Crude, Russia’s chief export earner, retreated as much as
2.7 percent to $112.22 a barrel in London on concern European
leaders meeting today haven’t taken sufficient steps to contain
the region’s debt crisis. Clashing with U.S. Treasury Secretary
 Timothy Geithner , finance chiefs from the euro region said the
18-month debt crisis leaves no room for tax cuts or extra
spending to spur an economy on the brink of stagnation.  OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest potash producer, rose 1.1
percent to 289.43 rubles. The company agreed to borrow as much
as $1 billion for five years at 180 basis points over the  London 
interbank offered rate, or Libor, according to a statement
today. The loan will go toward refinancing an earlier loan from
OAO Sberbank that Silvinit, now a unit of Uralkali, took to fund
the development of the Polovodovsky potash deposit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
