Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei.  The Taiex Index rose 191.72 points, or 2.6 percent, to
7,577.40. The benchmark dropped 0.4 percent this week.  Catcher Technology Co. (2474 TT), maker of metal casings
for phones and computers, fell for the fifth day, dropping 2.5
percent to NT$199, the lowest close since July 12. Concerns
about client HTC Corp.’s reduction of the use of metal casings
are “overdone,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  Catcher’s outlook for the next few quarters is “even
better than we had expected,” the brokerage said. It maintained
its “buy” recommendation with a share-price estimate of
NT$300.  Taiwan Hon Chuan Enterprise Co. (9939 TT) gained 1.1
percent to NT$72.30. The bottle cap maker received orders from
Coca-Cola Co. to bottle 250 cc bottles for Coke and Sprite, the
Taipei-based Commercial Times reported, without saying where it
got the information. C.C. Yen, spokesman for the company, didn’t
return calls seeking comment.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330 TT) advanced
2.9 percent to NT$71.10. The world’s largest contract chip maker
has signed a contract with Apple Inc. to manufacture a new
generation of processors, the Taipei-based DigiTimes reported,
citing unidentified people in the chip industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
