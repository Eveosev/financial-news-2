The  National Football League  has
implemented “enhanced security procedures,” including
increased patdowns, at stadiums for games this weekend,
according to New York Jets spokesman Bruce Speight.  The announcement, distributed today by clubs, comes a week
after a fan was arrested for using an illegal stun gun during
the game between the New York Jets and  Dallas Cowboys  at MetLife
Stadium on Sept. 11.  “This modification is not based on any specific threat,
but part of an ongoing effort to provide a safe environment for
fans attending the games,” the Jets said in a statement.  The heightened precautions will extend the time it takes
for fans to enter the stadium, according to the Jets, who host
the  Jacksonville Jaguars  on Sept. 18. The team suggested that
fans arrive 30 minutes earlier than normal. Gates open two hours
before the game.  “We are always refining and improving our security
procedures,” league spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
