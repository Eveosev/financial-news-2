Greek two-year debt surged the past
two days, driving the difference in yield with 10-year bonds to
the least since Sept. 2, indicating investors are less concerned
that the nation will default.  The difference in yield, or spread, between the two
securities narrowed by 1,876 basis points, or 18.76 percentage
points, to 3,005 basis points as of 1:11 p.m. in  London . That’s
down from a euro-era record of 52.26 percentage points on Sept.
13, and compares with the 12-month average of 6.93 percentage
points. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said on Sept. 14 that they’re “convinced” Greece
will remain in the currency union.  Greek two-year yields sank yesterday as the Frankfurt-based
ECB said it will coordinate with the  Federal Reserve  and other
central banks to conduct three dollar liquidity-providing
operations to ensure lenders in the region have enough U.S.
currency through year-end. The notes pared gains today as
European finance ministers ruled out efforts to prop up the
region’s economy and gave no indication of more aid for banks.  Greece ’s two-year note yield dropped as much as 11.99
percentage points to 49.54 percent, after rising to an all-time
high 84.52 percent on Sept. 14. The nation’s 10-year yield
tumbled 2.29 percentage points to 20.57 percent.  Sarkozy and Merkel signaled they’re ready to keep
supporting Greece. That followed a telephone discussion with
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou , who committed to meet
deficit-reduction targets demanded as a condition for further
bailouts, according to the statements distributed by the
governments in Athens, Berlin and Paris.  It cost $6 million upfront and $100,000 annually to insure
$10 million of Greek debt for five years, up from $5.9 million
in advance yesterday and $5.3 million Sept. 9, according to BNP
Paribas SA prices for credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
