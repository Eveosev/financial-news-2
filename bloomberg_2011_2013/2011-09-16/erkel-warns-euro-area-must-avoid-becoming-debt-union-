Chancellor Angela Merkel  warned
that the euro area must not transform into a “debt union” and
said the onus lies on individual governments to tackle their
deficit problems.   “Every single country in  Europe , especially in the euro
area, must do its homework, otherwise they can’t rely on
solidarity from others,” Merkel told a political rally today in
Berlin. She also reiterated her rejection of joint European
bonds.   To contact the reporter on this story:
