Tokyo Electric Power Co. may raise
10 billion yen ($130 million) selling staff dormitories and
other housing to help pay for the Fukushima nuclear disaster,
the  Yomiuri newspaper  said, citing an unidentified official.  Tepco needs to raise funds for compensation after the March
11 earthquake and tsunami caused three meltdowns at its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi station, forcing about 160,000 people to
evacuate their homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
