Stocks rose, driving the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index to the third-biggest weekly gain since 2009, as
finance ministers met to tackle Europe’s debt crisis. The euro
weakened, Treasuries advanced and commodities fell.  The  S&P 500  climbed 0.6 percent to 1,216.01 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time, completing a five-day advance of 5.4 percent. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.6 percent. The euro lost 0.6
percent to $1.3786 and weakened against 13 of 16 major peers,
while the Dollar Index advanced 0.5 percent to 76.618 to halt a
three-day slide. Ten-year Treasury yields lost two basis points
to 2.06 percent, paring the biggest weekly gain in two months.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  pressed
euro-area governments to take decisive action to halt the debt
crisis, after the ECB bought them more time by yesterday
extending an emergency lifeline to banks. Ministers from the
euro region meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  said today the 18-month debt crisis leaves no room for
tax cuts or extra spending to spur growth.  “There needs to be more coordinated action and I think
markets are taking this very positively,” Kirk Hartman, who
oversees $355 billion as the Los Angeles-based chief investment
officer of Wells Capital Management, told Susan Li on Bloomberg
Television’s “First Up.” “I don’t think we’re going to have a
banking crisis, but I think we are going to have more turmoil.
Clearly there are issues, but I think over time it will work
itself out.”  Weekly Rally  The S&P 500 climbed more than 5 percent in five days, its
biggest rally since the week ended July 1.  Procter & Gamble Co .,
 Intel Corp . and International Business Machines Corp. climbed at
least 1.7 percent to lead gains in 21 of 30 stocks in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average . Research In Motion Ltd. sank 19
percent, the most since June, as the maker of BlackBerry devices
reported earnings below analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 briefly erased gains in late-morning trading ,
falling as much as 0.4 percent before resuming its advance.
Today was the expiration for U.S. futures and options contracts
on indexes and individual stocks. So-called quadruple witching
occurs once every three months.  Gauges of retailers and household-products makers jumped at
least 1.7 percent for the biggest gains among 24 groups in the
S&P 500 after  consumer confidence  topped forecasts. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary September index of
consumer sentiment rose to 57.8 from 55.7 a month earlier,
topping the median forecast of 57 from economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The index averaged 89 in the five years leading
up to the recession that began in December 2007.  European Banks  Automakers and real-estate companies led gains in European
equities. Banking shares also climbed, rising 0.5 percent as a
group after climbing as much as 2.9 percent. Barclays Plc, the
U.K.’s second-biggest bank by assets, jumped 3.4 percent, while
Deutsche Bank AG,  Germany ’s largest lender, increased 0.8
percent. Stoxx 600 banks rallied 4.6 percent over two days after
the ECB announced coordinated measures with the U.S. Federal
Reserve yesterday to ensure lenders have enough dollars.  The Stoxx 600 rallied 5.1 percent in four days after
sinking to a two-year low on Sept. 12, and the S&P 500 has
rebounded 8.6 percent after tumbling 18 percent from a three-
year high at the end of April through this year’s low on Aug. 8.
Both gauges were trading at their cheapest price-to-earnings
valuations in more than two years before their rebounds.  ‘More Normal Valuation’  “The stock market is extremely undervalued,”  David Goerz ,
the San Francisco-based chief investment officer at Highmark
Capital Management Inc., said in a telephone interview. The firm
manages $17.2 billion. “As things begin to improve, the equity
market can rise back to a more normal valuation. The fact that
we got some moderation in terms of thinking about the ECB and
how it’s going to address the crisis in  Europe  helped reduce
some of the risk,” he said. “The most recent data points
suggest that this pause in economic activity is in fact
transitory.”  Ten-year Treasury yields increased 14 basis points this
week, the most since the five days ending July 1. The 30-year
U.S. bond yield fell four basis points to 3.32 percent today and
the yield on the Greek two-year note tumbled for the third day,
dropping 6.39 percentage points, or 639 basis points, to 55.133
percent.  Oil slipped 1.6 percent to $87.96 a barrel, while gold
futures rallied the most in a week, gaining 1.9 percent to
$1,814.70 an ounce. Sugar prices tumbled to a two-month low in
New York, losing 6.7 percent to 27.52 cents a pound, on signs
that global supplies will top demand. Coffee fell, while cocoa
was little changed.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 1.1 percent. The BSE
India Sensitive Index gained 0.3 percent, trimming earlier jump
of as much as 1.5 percent after the central bank raised its
repurchase rate.  South Korea ’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  climbed 3.7 percent,
led by exporters including Samsung Electronics Co. and  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380)  Russia’s Micex Index fell 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
