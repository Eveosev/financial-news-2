India’s central bank monetary
policy is ignoring the turmoil in global markets, according to
IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. The  Reserve Bank  of India
raised  interest rates  for the 12th time since the start
of March 2010 today.  “Rising rates would delay capacity creation and have
negative implications for economic expansion and corporate
profit growth,” Aneesh Srivastava, who  oversees 21 billion
rupees ($442 million) as chief investment officer at IDBI
Federal, said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
