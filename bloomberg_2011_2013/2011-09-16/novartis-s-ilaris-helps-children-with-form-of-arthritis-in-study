Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Ilaris, rejected by a
U.S. advisory panel in June as a treatment for gout, helped
children with a rare form of arthritis in a late-stage study.  Ilaris improved symptoms of systemic juvenile idiopathic
arthritis, or SJIA, by at least 30 percent for 84 percent of
children who received the injection after 15 days, compared with
10 percent of those who got a placebo, the Basel, Switzerland-
based drugmaker said in a statement today. There was a 100
percent improvement for 33 percent of the children, Novartis
said. The results were presented at a conference in  Belgium 
today.  If approved, Ilaris would compete with  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s
Actemra, cleared in the U.S. in April as a treatment for a
disease that affects fewer than one in every 100,000 children.
Novartis is running a second study on Ilaris in children with
SJIA, and plans to use the data from both trials to apply for
U.S. regulatory approval next year, said John Hohneker, the
company’s head of development for its integrated hospital care
business.  “Rarely do we see drugs that work in over 80 percent of
patients,” Hohneker said in an interview. “We think that
Ilaris is a very competitive product in this space.”  SJIA attacks children as young as 6 months old, and is
characterized by skin rash, daily spiking fever, joint pain and
swelling. Its cause isn’t known.  To contact the reporter on this story:
