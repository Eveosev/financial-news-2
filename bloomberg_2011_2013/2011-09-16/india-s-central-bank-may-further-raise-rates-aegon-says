Saibal Ghosh, chief investment
officer at Aegon Religare Life Insurance Co., comments on the
outlook for Indian equities. Ghosh spoke in a phone interview
from Mumbai today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, gained
181.22, or 1.1 percent, to 17,057.76 at 1:15 p.m. in Mumbai.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
8.25 percent from 8 percent, it said in a statement today.
Fourteen of 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted
the decision and three expected no change.  On the repo rate increase:  “It is very much as per what we expected. And I think the
RBI is still open for further rate hike in days to come.
Inflation continues to remain a challenge, I don’t see any major
earnings downgrade but the biggest risk in the market is the
 interest rate  at an elevated level for a prolong period of
time.”  On recommendations:  “Investors should go for the long-term, as the long-term
will give superior returns. But fixed-income will give more
returns in the short to medium term. We cannot time the market,
so if there is a long term horizon then anytime is a good
investment opportunity.”  Ghosh recommends consumption, pharmaceutical and certain
stocks in the banking, software and metal industries. He
recommendd avoiding real-estate companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
