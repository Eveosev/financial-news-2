Zimbabwe hasn’t canceled any mining
licenses for not meeting the country’s black ownership laws and
doesn’t plan to close foreign-owned mines in the future, the
 Daily News  reported.  Foreign-owned mines are able to negotiate “long-standing
solutions” that increase black ownership in their companies,
the Harare-based newspaper said, citing  Saviour Kasukuwere ,
indigenization minister, and Obert Mpofu, minister of mines.  Kasukuwere has previously said he would withdraw licenses
from foreign-owned companies that didn’t show how they would
sell or cede 51 percent of their shares to black Zimbabweans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
