Benchmark European coal was little
changed as crude prices were stable.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year declined 20 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $127 a metric ton at 10:45 a.m. in  London , according
to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil for October lost 0.1 percent to $89.28 a barrel in  New
York . Sales of gas, which competes with coal in power
generation, are often linked to crude prices.  Bloomberg tracks data from information supplied by ICAP
