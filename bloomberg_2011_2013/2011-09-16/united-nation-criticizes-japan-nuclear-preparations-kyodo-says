(Corrects name of organization in headline)  The United Nations criticized
Japan’s preparedness for disasters that may affect nuclear  power
plants  as being “too modest,”  Kyodo News   said yesterday ,
citing a report compiled by 16 organizations of the UN,
including its nuclear watchdog.  The report, compiled after Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant
disaster, states that Japan should review all its existing and
planned reactors against potential accidents and also take into
account possible effects from climate change, Kyodo said.  It is due to be presented at the UN General Assembly
meeting on Sept. 22, Kyodo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
