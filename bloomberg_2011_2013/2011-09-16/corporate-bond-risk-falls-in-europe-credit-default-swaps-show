The cost of insuring against
default on  Europe ’s junior bank bonds posted the biggest ever
weekly decline after politicians met in  Poland  to discuss
efforts to contain the sovereign crisis.  The Markit iTraxx Financial index of credit-default swaps
on the subordinated debt of 25 banks and insurers fell 70 basis
points since Sept. 9 to 465, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
at 5:30 p.m. in London. The senior index, which rose on the day,
decreased 35 basis points to 265, the largest weekly drop since
March 2008.  European finance ministers met in Poland today, and are
continuing their discussions tomorrow, as they debate how to
resolve the euro-area’s deepening debt crisis. Clashing with
U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner , the regional ministers
ruled out efforts to prop up the faltering economy and gave no
indication of aid to complement yesterday’s coordinated central-
bank measures to ease dollar lending.  “No end in sight to debt crisis, but rays of hope prompt
bear market rallies,” ING Groep NV analysts wrote in a note.  The  European Central Bank  said yesterday it worked with
other central banks to extend dollar loans to euro-area
institutions, adding fuel to a rally that sent insurance costs
tumbling from records set Sept. 12.  Merkel on Euro  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said today that  Germany 
must make its contribution to help the common currency. Euro
countries should pursue budget consolidation to help the region
move away from a “debt union,” she said in a speech in Berlin.  It now costs $5.85 million upfront and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years, compared with
$5.9 million in advance yesterday and $5.3 million Sept. 9,
according to BNP Paribas SA prices for credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell three basis points today to
325, and clocked up the biggest weekly drop in seven weeks. A
decline signals an improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on Belgium dropped 13 basis points to 243 today,
 France  declined 3.5 to 165.5 and Germany was 0.5 lower at 82.5,
according to CMA. Contracts on Ireland fell 11 basis points to
792, Italy tumbled nine to 443, Portugal was 24 lower at 1,035
and  Spain  was down eight basis points on the day at 365.  Swaps on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose one basis point to
715, paring the weekly rally to the biggest since March 2008. It
was earlier on track for the biggest drop of all time.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings climbed 2.25 basis points to 176,
dropping 16 basis points in the week, JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
