The developer of the One Hyde Park
luxury-condominium complex in London’s Knightsbridge
neighborhood is in talks to sell the McLaren sports-car store on
the ground floor of one of the property’s buildings.  Project Grande (Guernsey) Ltd. is seeking offers of at
least 11.5 million pounds ($18 million) and has rejected three
bids, Nick Candy said in an interview yesterday. Candy
masterminded the development with his brother, Christian.  McLaren has a  15-year lease  for the store, according to
 Savills Plc (SVS) , the property broker handling the sale. In August,
Russian entrepreneur Grigory Guselnikov bought a Rolex store at
One Hyde Park for more than 13 million pounds, Savills said.  One Hyde Park was developed by a venture between Christian Candy’s CPC Group and Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jaber Al Thani. Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank rents a third
retail unit at the complex, its first in the U.K.  McLaren cars are driven by Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button
in the Formula 1 racing series. The company started McLaren
Automotive in March 2010 to market  sports cars .  To contact the reporter on this story:
