Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki
approved a new law that will regulate the prices of essential
commodities, according to a statement e-mailed by the
Presidential Press Service in Nairobi today.  Inflation quickened to 16.7 percent in August, more than
triple the government’s 5 percent target. Price pressures are
persisting and “the return to normal prices has been slower
than the experience in 2009,” the central bank said this week.  Kibaki also assented to four other laws, including the
creation of a tourism regulator, the press service said. The
government predicts a 20 percent increase in tourist arrivals
this year as more people visit from India and  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
