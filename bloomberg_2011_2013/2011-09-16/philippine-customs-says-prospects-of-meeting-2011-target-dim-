The Philippines’ Bureau of Customs,
responsible for about a fifth of government’s annual revenue, is
behind its collection target this year and prospects of meeting
the goal may be “dim,” Commissioner Ruffy Biazon told
reporters today. The agency will strive to achieve the target
and plans to use ‘GPS’ in tracking container vans to help curb
smuggling, Biazon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
