OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel,
Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikov’s steelmaker, formed a
mining unit in Luxembourg, MMK-Mining Assets Management SA,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday.  The decision follows similar moves by rivals OAO Severstal
and OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  and lays the groundwork for a possible initial
public offering in two to three years, Dmitry Smolin, an analyst
at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said today by telephone.  MMK doesn’t plan an IPO of the mining unit, spokesman
Kirill Golubkov said by telephone. The company’s mining assets
include coal producer OAO Belon and iron ore mines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
