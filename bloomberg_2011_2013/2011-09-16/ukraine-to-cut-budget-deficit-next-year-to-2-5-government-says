Ukraine plans to reduce next year’s
budget deficit to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product from 3.5
percent in 2011.  The gap will include the deficit of state energy company
NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy, equal to 0.8 percent of GDP, and the
pension-fund deficit of 0.2 percent, according to a draft budget
law posted on the parliamentary  website  late yesterday.  The government plans to borrow 91.9 billion hryvnia ($11.5
billion) domestically and on foreign markets, according to the
draft. Foreign borrowing will reach 37.5 billion hryvnia, while
domestic borrowing will be 54.3 billion hryvnia.  Ukraine must reduce its budget shortfall to receive the
third tranche of a $15.6 billion standby loan from the
 International Monetary Fund . The eastern European nation has
received $3.4 billion in two installments, with the third
delayed since March as the government seeks to trim the Naftogaz
and state-managed pension deficits.  The government expects foreign direct investment to reach
$6 billion next year because of a better investment climate,
according to the draft, which doesn’t give further details.  Exports of goods and services will increase 9.2 percent
from 2011, while imports will rise 13.3 percent. Ukraine will
spend 30 billion hryvnia on servicing debt, 11.4 billion hryvnia
of which will be for foreign borrowing, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
