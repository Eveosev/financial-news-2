(Corrects attribution in headline.)  The South African Taxi Council
starts its airline service tomorrow, with the first flight from
Johannesburg to Bisho in the Eastern Cape province, the New Age
reported, citing Santaco president, Jabulani Mthembu.  President  Jacob Zuma  and Transport Minister Sbu Ndebele are
expected to be passengers on the flight, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said.  Santaco represents about 95 percent of taxi operators in
the country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
