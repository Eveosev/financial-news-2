Ukraine plans an additional sale of
Eurobonds this year, the government said in an amendment to a
draft state budget law published on parliament’s website today.  The bill envisages the sale of Eurobonds equivalent to
20.29 billion hryvnia ($2.5 billion) by the end of this year,
according to the materials. Ukraine has sold $2.8 billion in
Eurobonds in 2011.  “We will tap international markets,” First Deputy Prime
Minister Andriy Klyuev said today at a conference in Yalta,
Crimea. “Although conditions are unfavorable now.” Klyuev also
said the cabinet isn’t considering selling rouble bonds at the
moment.  “Given the current market conditions, it will be very
difficult for the government to raise $2.5 billion by the end of
the year,”  Olena Bilan , chief economist at Kiev-based Dragon
Capital, said by phone. “It means that the $2 billion loan from
Russian VTB Group will be at least partially prolonged into
2012, effectively increasing borrowing needs next year.”  The Cabinet plans to issue Eurobonds equivalent to 28.35
billion hryvnia ($3.54 billion) in 2012 to finance the state
budget, the government said in material accompanying the state
budget bill. Total foreign borrowing will be 37.5 billion
hryvnia next year, according to the state budget draft.  To contact the reporters on this story:
