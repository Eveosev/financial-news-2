Boris Berezovsky , a Russian
billionaire living in exile in the U.K., is facing fresh
accusations of ordering the murder of journalist  Anna Politkovskaya ,  Kommersant  reported.  The Investigative Committee received testimony from a
former police officer charged with organizing the 2006 killing
which points to Berezovsky as the person behind the crime, the
Moscow-based newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Andrei Borovkov, Berezovsky’s Moscow-based lawyer, said his
client dismissed the allegations against him as “complete
rubbish.” The Investigative Committee’s spokesman,  Vladimir Markin , didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment.  Berezovsky, 65, an opponent of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin who was granted political asylum in the U.K. in 2003, has
previously denied any involvement in Politkovskaya’s murder
after allegations by Russian officials. He’s accused the Russian
government of responsibility for the killing.  “The Russian authorities have failed to get Berezovsky’s
extradition from the U.K. and now they are looking for a new
way,” Borovkov said in a phone interview today. “They have
this person in custody who’s agreed to collaborate.”
Berezovsky, who fled  Russia  in 2001, has been sentenced in
absentia to prison for embezzlement.  Politkovskaya, a correspondent for the independent
newspaper  Novaya Gazeta , wrote about corruption under then-
President Putin and chronicled abuses by security forces in the
mainly Muslim region of Chechnya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
