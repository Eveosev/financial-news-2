Skandia Investment Group has some
$15 billion of assets under management and plans to boost this
by 50 percent within three years, according to Chief Investment
Officer James Millard.  This will be achieved by “expanding and strengthening our
distribution,” increased marketing and a broadening of the
range of products offered, Millard said in a phone interview in
 Hong Kong . In Asia, the firm plans to double the total it
oversees to $2 billion in the coming three years, he said.  Skandia Investment Group is the U.K.-based fund-management
division of  Old Mutual Plc. (OML)   To contact the reporter on this story:
