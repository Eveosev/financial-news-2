Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc
Frieden said his euro-area colleagues are disappointed at the
pace of Greek reforms.  Greece ’s fiscal problems are best solved within the euro
region, Frieden told reporters after a meeting of euro finance
ministers in Wroclaw,  Poland , today.  The group’s meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  was a positive development, Frieden said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
