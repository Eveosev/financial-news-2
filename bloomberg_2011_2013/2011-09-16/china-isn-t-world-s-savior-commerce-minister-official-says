China  is willing to assist European
countries hit-by the sovereign debt crisis because it’s in the
nation’s interests to do so and not because it wants to be a
“savior,” a Ministry of Commerce official said today.  “The European debt crisis will affect our own sustained
development and from this perspective we’d like to help with the
debt issue based on our own capacity,” Chai Xiaolin, director-
general of the Department of World Trade Organization Affairs at
the Ministry of Commerce, said in an interview in Beijing today.
“We are not going to act as a savior for the world.”  Chai’s comments reflect statements made by Premier Wen
Jiabao this week, who said at the  World Economic Forum  in the
Chinese city of Dalian that developed nations must first “put
their own houses in order,” cut deficits and open markets
rather than rely on China to bail out the world economy. The
European Union is China’s largest trading partner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
