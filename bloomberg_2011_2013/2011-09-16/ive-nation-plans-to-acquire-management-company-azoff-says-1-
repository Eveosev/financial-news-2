Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
biggest ticketing, live concert and talent management company,
is working on an acquisition in the management area, Chairman
Irving Azoff said.  The deal will be announced on Sept. 19, Azoff said today at
a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference in Beverly
Hills,  California . He didn’t name the target.  “We are in the middle of an acquisition that we will
announce Monday that is pretty major in the management area,”
Azoff said.  Such a deal would bolster Live Nation’s Front Line
Management Group, which advises the Eagles, Christina Aguilera
and Aerosmith, among others. Azoff built the agency and sold a
controlling stake to Ticketmaster in 2008, becoming chief
executive of the combined company. He became chairman of Live
Nation after it merged with Ticketmaster last year.  Live Nation, based in  Beverly Hills , rose 20 cents to $8.59
today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have lost 25 percent this year.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
