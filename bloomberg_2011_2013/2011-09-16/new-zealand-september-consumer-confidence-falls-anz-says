New Zealand  consumer confidence
fell in September as turbulence in global equity markets
outweighed a boost to sentiment from the start of the  Rugby
World Cup , according to ANZ National Bank Ltd.  The ANZ National-Roy Morgan confidence index declined to
112.6 from 113.3 in August, the Auckland-based bank said in an
e-mailed report. The gauge has gained from a two-year low of
101.4 reached in March and April.  Sovereign debt worries in  Europe  have roiled markets,
prompting central bank Governor Alan Bollard to keep the
official cash rate unchanged yesterday. The rugby tournament
that began in New Zealand on Sept. 9 has been a distraction for
consumers, ANZ said.  “The feel-good factor from hosting the event may have
helped offset any negative impact on sentiment from the
deteriorating global outlook,” Khoon Goh, head of market
economics and strategy at ANZ in Wellington, said in the report.  Fewer of the 1,037 consumers surveyed expected to be better
off in a year, today’s report showed. Fewer also predicted the
economy to improve a year from now and more said it is a bad
time to buy a major household item, it showed.  Still, the report showed fewer respondents said they were
worse off than a year ago, which may encourage a pick-up in
retail sales, Goh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
