Croatia  will sell 10.66 percent of
oil pipeline operator  Jadranski Naftovod d.d. (JNAFRA)  and 29 percent of
insurer Croatia Osiguranje d.d., while retaining control of both
companies.  The government will sell the shares through a retirement
fund and use the proceeds to pay its obligations to pensioners,
the government said yesterday in a statement on its website.  The Jadranski Naftovod shares being sold are valued at 271
million kuna ($49 million), while the Croatia Osiguranje shares
being sold are valued at 458 million kuna, the government said.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
