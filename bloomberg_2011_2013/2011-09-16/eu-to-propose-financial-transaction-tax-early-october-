The European Commission said it
will “propose common rules to tax financial transactions in all
27 EU member states,” in “early October.”  “In the context of the current economic crisis, the three
main objectives of the new rules are to assure that the
financial sector makes a fair and substantial contribution to
public finances to recoup the costs of the crisis,” the
commission said in a statement on its website today.  This plan would “alleviate member states’ contributions to
the EU budget and to discourage to a certain extent risky market
behaviours,” the commission said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
