Denmark’s lenders, which from Oct.
1 will be able to raise liquidity at the central bank using bank
loans as collateral, will be allowed to make their own
assessments of the quality of the loans they provide, newspaper

loans even though the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has
said the country’s lenders often take a too optimistic view on
write-downs, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
