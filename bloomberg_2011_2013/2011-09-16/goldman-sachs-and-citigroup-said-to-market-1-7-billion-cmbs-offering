Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  plan to offer $1.7 billion in securities tied to
commercial mortgages, resuscitating a deal that was withdrawn
after  Standard & Poor’s  withdrew its ratings.  The debt will be marketed to investors next week, according
to people familiar with the offering who declined to be
identified because the deal hasn’t been announced. The issue was
originally $1.5 billion.  The transaction was pulled after it was placed with buyers
in July, rankling investors and bankers in the $600 billion
market. The banks canceled the issue on July 28 after S&P said
it was halting its ratings of commercial-mortgage bonds because
of potential flaws in its models. The New York-based rating
company resumed grading the securities on Aug. 5, saying the
impact on ratings of the inconsistencies would be “generally
modest.”  The offering adds to more than $24 billion of the debt
issued in 2011, following $11.5 billion last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
