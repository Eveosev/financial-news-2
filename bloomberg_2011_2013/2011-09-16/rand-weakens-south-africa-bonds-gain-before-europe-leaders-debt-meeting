South Africa ’s rand declined for a
second week as European policy makers struggled to find
solutions to contain the region’s debt crisis that is slowing
global economic growth.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy fell as much as
0.9 percent to 7.4432 per dollar and traded 0.5 percent weaker
at 7.4153 as of 5:02 p.m. in Johannesburg, taking its drop in
the five-day period to 1.8 percent. The government’s 13.5
percent bonds due 2015 climbed 9 cents to 123.07 rand, driving
the yield down 2.7 basis points, or 0.027 percentage point, to
6.793 percent. Four-year borrowing costs rose 31.5 basis points
this week, the biggest jump since the five days through Jan. 21.  The weakening in the currency is limiting the chance of a
cut in  interest rates  by adding pressure on inflation, according
to Ian Cruickshanks, head of treasury strategic research at
Johannesburg-based Nedbank Capital, a unit of South Africa’s
fourth-biggest bank.  “I think it’s reduced the chance of a rate cut, but rates
lower for longer is a very real prospect simply because of the
fragile nature of the economy, not just the South African
economy but our major trading partners which include  Europe ,”
Cruickshanks said in a phone interview.  Forward-rate agreements for March 2012, which investors use
to lock in borrowing costs, increased three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, this week to 5.27 percent. The central
bank’s  Monetary Policy Committee  meets on Sept. 22 to discuss
interest rates. The bank has left its benchmark rate at a 30-
year low of 5.5 percent since November even after forecasting
inflation will breach the upper limit of its 3 percent to 6
percent target range in the fourth quarter.  The euro pared its first weekly advance this month versus
the greenback as European finance ministers meeting in Wroclaw,
 Poland , ruled out efforts to prop up the faltering economy and
raised issues of collateral demanded to take part in another
Greek bailout at a meeting today. The Dollar Index rose for the
first time in four days as commodities fell, increasing demand
for safer assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
