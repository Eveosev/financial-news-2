Lithuanian inflation, calculated
according to European Union standards, will probably slow to 3.9
percent from a year earlier in September on falling vegetable
and fuel prices, the  statistics office  said.  Inflation may slow from 4.4 percent in August, the Vilnius-
based office said today in a statement on its website. Consumer
prices will probably rise 0.1 percent from the previous month,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
