U.S. and European economies are on
the verge of recession, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said today
at a conference in Sochi on Russia’s Black Sea coast.  “The debt crisis in  Europe  and the U.S. is made worse by
the fact that their economies are on the verge of recession,”
Putin said. “Unfortunately for us all, and that includes
Russia, there is no clarity on when they will return to health.
This prospect may be more distant than it seemed three years
ago,” he said.  Mounting turbulence on global markets “shows once again
that a growth model based on debt doesn’t work,” Putin said.  Russia’s gross domestic product will grow 4 percent
annually over the next three years and the country won’t have a
 budget deficit  this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
