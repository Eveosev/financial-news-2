Norway will increase this year’s
budget by as much as 723 million kroner ($129 million) to pay
for expenses stemming from the July 22 terror attacks.  The amount, which will be presented to parliament on Sept.
30, covers extraordinary spending until Nov. 1, the  Finance
Ministry  said in  an e-mailed statement .  The government is dealing with added costs from the July 22
bombing attack on the prime minister’s office and a massacre at
a Labor Party youth camp that together took 77 lives. Anders Behring Breivik has admitted to committing the acts.  The Justice Ministry will be allocated an extra 195 million
kroner for police and civil defense costs, while the  Defense
Ministry  will be granted an extra 86.9 million kroner to
temporarily house the prime minister’s office.  In May, the government said it expected to use 112.9
billion kroner of its oil revenue to plug its structural non-oil
deficit in its revised 2011 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
