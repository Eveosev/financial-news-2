Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency
strategist in  Singapore  at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , comments on
the outlook for  India ’s rupee after the central bank increased
borrowing costs.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised the repurchase rate to
8.25 percent from 8 percent and said rising inflationary
expectations remain a key risk. Fourteen of 17 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey predicted the decision and three expected
no change.  The rupee pared gains after the announcement. It rose 0.2
percent to 47.4725 per dollar as of 1:21 p.m. in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s difficult to build a positive near-term outlook for
the rupee. Global risk aversion will persist and leave equity
market investors wary. The rupee might fall to 48.50/80 a dollar
in the coming few weeks.  ‘‘With inflation still the number one concern for the RBI,
further hikes can’t be ruled out. My concern is that with the
global growth outlook not looking too great at the moment, the
risks of hard landing in the economy -- whilst pretty small at
this stage -- are probably increasing.  ‘‘However, we think the Fed will have to embark on a fresh
round of quantitative easing into 2012 and that will weigh
against the dollar. So by mid-2012 we see the rupee trading at
or stronger than 46.50 and possibly stronger than 46 by the end
of 2012.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
