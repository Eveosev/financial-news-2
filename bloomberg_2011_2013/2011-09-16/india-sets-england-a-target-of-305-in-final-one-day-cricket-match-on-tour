England  beat India by six wickets
in a rain-shortened one-day international cricket match in
Cardiff, sending the visitors home at the end of their tour
without a win against the hosts.  India set a target of 305, but rain cut England’s innings
to 34 overs, reducing the target to 241 under the Duckworth-
Lewis rules used for weather-shortened matches. The hosts
achieved it with 10 balls remaining.  Ravi Bopara  and Jonny Bairstow, a 21-year-old making his
debut, combined for 75 runs from 40 balls to push England to
victory. Bairstow hit three sixes while reaching 41 unbeaten.
Bopara was 37 not out.  Jonathan Trott  lead England with 63.  India got 107 runs from Virat Kohli as they reached 304-6,
their highest run total on the current tour, in their 50 overs.
India was looking to get its first victory over England on this
visit.  Kohli had nine fours and one six before he was bowled by
 Graeme Swann , who took three wickets.  Rahul Dravid  reached 69
and MS Dhoni was 50 unbeaten. The start of today’s match was
delayed by rain in Cardiff.  It was the final match in India’s tour. England already
clinched victory in the five-match series with a draw at Lord’s
in London.  The hosts won two straight weather-shortened one-day games
after the series opener was rained out. England swept a four-
match Test series and the sole Twenty20 match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
