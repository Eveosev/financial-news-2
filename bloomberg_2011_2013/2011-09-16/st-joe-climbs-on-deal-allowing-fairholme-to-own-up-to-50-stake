St. Joe  Cos., Northern Florida’s
largest landholder, jumped in New York trading after disclosing
a deal that allows Chairman  Bruce Berkowitz ’s Fairholme Capital
Management LLC to own as much as 50 percent of the stock.  The agreement, reached Sept. 14, increases the limit of
Fairholme’s stake from 30 percent, Watersound, Florida-based St.
Joe said in a regulatory filing today. Fairholme currently owns
about 29 percent of the company’s stock and is its largest
shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  St. Joe climbed $1.12, or 6.6 percent, to $18.20 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
lost 17 percent this year, compared with a 0.8 percent increase
in the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index.  Berkowitz, the founder of Miami-based Fairholme, became
chairman of St. Joe in March after criticizing the board’s
spending and corporate governance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
