California  took orders from
individual investors for 18 percent of its $2.5 billion debt
issue on the first day of sales, according to  Tom Dresslar , a
spokesman for Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  The state’s first general-obligation issue in 10 months
offered a yield of 4.8 percent for $350 million of bonds due
September 2041, Dresslar said in an e-mailed statement. That’s
1.16 percentage points above yields on 30-year AAA rated tax-
exempt securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Debt
maturing in 2021 was sold at 3.17 percent, or 1.08 points above
a similar 10-year index.  California will need to raise rates on most maturities by
about 20 basis points to attract individual buyers outside of
the state, Terry O’Grady, senior vice present of municipal
trading at FMS Bonds Inc. in  North Miami Beach ,  Florida , said in
a telephone interview before the day’s results were released.  “About 20 basis points higher across the board would make
them attractive nationally,” O’Grady said. The company has
distributed “significant” amounts of California bonds to
individual investors around the nation in the past, when higher
yields were offered.  The sale follows California’s $5.4 billion short-term
revenue-anticipation note issue Sept. 14 at yields of as low as
0.38 percent to bolster  cash flow .  Voluntary Suspension  That was as much as 137 basis points less than when it sold
$10 billion of such notes in November. Governor  Jerry Brown  and
Lockyer voluntarily halted debt sales earlier this year to curb
costs.  Proceeds from the latest sale will be used to pay off some
short-term loans and refund other debts. The refinancing portion
of today’s issue was priced to provide yields as low as 0.67
percent. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Stone & Youngberg are
managing the sale, continuing Sept. 20.  California has the lowest long-term debt rating of any
state from  Standard & Poor’s  at A-, its fourth lowest for
investment-quality securities. Moody’s Investors Service rates
it A1, fifth-highest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
