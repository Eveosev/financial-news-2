Following is a summary of second quarter
year-over-year labor costs from Eurostat in Luxembourg:  NOTE: Data is % change compared to same quarter a year earlier.
Labour cost indices show the short-term development of the total cost for
employers of employing the labour force on an hourly basis. Total labour 
costs include employeesâ€™ gross earnings and indirect costs. Gross earnings
include direct remuneration and bonuses as well as the value of any social
contributions, income taxes, etc. payable by the employee, even if actually
withheld by the employer and paid directly to social insurance schemes, 
tax authorities, etc. on behalf of the employee. Indirect costs include the 
social contributions incurred by employers in order to secure for their 
employees the entitlement to social benefits. Indirect costs also include 
taxes connected to employment minus received subsidies intended to refund 
part or all of the cost of direct remuneration. Indices are based on the 
national currencies, and are not influenced by exchange rates.  The original indices from Member States can be revised, and thus aggregates
are recalculated. The data should not be considered as final.  Whole economy here includes all market economic activities i.e. industry, 
construction, trade, hotels and restaurants, communication, transport & 
financial and business services  SOURCE: Eurostat  To contact the reporter on this story:
