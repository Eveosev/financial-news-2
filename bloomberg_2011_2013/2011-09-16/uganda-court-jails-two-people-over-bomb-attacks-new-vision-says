Uganda’s  High Court  sentenced two
people to prison for involvement in twin bombings in the
capital, Kampala, in July last year which killed 76 people,  New
Vision  reported.  Edris Nsubuga was sentenced to 25 years in jail on three
counts of terrorism, while his colleague Muhamoud Mugisha was
handed a five-year term, the Kampala-based newspaper said on its
website, citing Judge Alfonse Owiny-Dollo. Both pleaded guilty,
and 12 other people are facing trial over the attacks, it said.  The Somali-based al-Shaabab terrorist group, which has
pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the
bombs, which targeted people watching soccer’s  World Cup  final
on television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
