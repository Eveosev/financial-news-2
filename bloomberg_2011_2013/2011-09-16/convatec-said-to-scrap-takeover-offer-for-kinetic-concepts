ConvaTec Inc., the wound-treatment
maker owned by  Nordic Capital  and Avista Capital Partners LLC,
has abandoned an offer for  Kinetic Concepts Inc. (KCI) , said a person
familiar with the bid.  The person declined to be identified, as the process wasnâ€™t
public. ConvaTec had made an offer for Kinetic that surpassed a
previous $5 billion bid from a group led by London-based buyout
firm  Apax Partners  LLP, people familiar with the process said
last month.  Kinetic, which generated about 70 percent of its $2 billion
in revenue from the wound-treatment business last year, also
makes hospital beds and tissue-regeneration products used in
surgeries. The San Antonio-based company, led by Chief Executive
Officer Catherine Burzik, has gained 13 percent in New York
trading since July 5, the day before reports of buyout talks
surfaced.  Apax Partners and Canadian pension funds agreed in July to
buy Kinetic for about $6.5 billion, including assumed debt, and
said they would borrow as much as $5 billion to do so. Bank of
America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley are
helping finance the deal.  Kinetic shares closed at $66.60 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. Swedish business publication  Dagens
Industri  reported the collapse of the deal earlier.  Stockholm-based Nordic and Avista bought ConvaTec from
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. for $4.1 billion in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
