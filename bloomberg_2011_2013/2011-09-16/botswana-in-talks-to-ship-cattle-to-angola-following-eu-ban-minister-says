Botswana is in talks about
exporting cattle to  Angola  after the European Union banned
imports of Botswanan beef, the Ministry of Agriculture said.  Botswana’s agriculture minister, Christian de Graaff, “is
coming back today and has reported fruitful discussions with his
counterpart and business people in that country,” the Gaborone-
based ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. The southern
African country has started selling cattle to neighboring
 Zimbabwe , it said.  The EU banned beef imports from Botswana in February after
an inspection of industry-standards, leading to a 89 percent
decline in the country’s exports of beef in that month compared
with January, according to central bank data. An outbreak of
foot and mouth disease in the northern region this year also
affected the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
