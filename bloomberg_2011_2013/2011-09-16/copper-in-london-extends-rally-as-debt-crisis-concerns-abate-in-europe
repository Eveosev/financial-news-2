Copper climbed for a second day
after the  European Central Bank  and international policy makers
coordinated to lend dollars to banks to help tame the credit
crisis, boosting demand prospects for industrial metals.  The three-month contract on the London Metal Exchange rose
as much as 0.8 percent to $8,779 per metric ton and traded at
$8,770.75 at 4 p.m. in  Tokyo . The price has fallen 0.6 percent
this week, a second weekly drop. On Sept. 14, the metal touched
$8,590, the lowest price since Aug. 11.  The ECB said it teamed up with the  Federal Reserve , the
Bank of  England , the  Bank of Japan  and the  Swiss National Bank 
to extend three-month loans to euro-area banks in an effort to
ensure they have enough cash for the rest of the year. The
leaders of France and Germany confirmed this week they will
support Greece’s continued participation in the euro currency.  “It’s a relief rally,”  Peter Richardson , chief metals
economist at Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd., said today. “I
don’t think this is an indication that the problem is solved.
It’s simply that they bought a bit of time, in my view, to try
and put together more lasting solution to this problem.”  Asian stocks rose as much as 2.4 percent today, paring the
regional benchmark index’s decline this week. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index advanced for a fourth day, advancing 1.7
percent yesterday.  Indonesia, Peru  In Indonesia, about 8,000 non-staff workers at Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s Grasberg mine began a one-month
strike, union official Virgo Solossa said on Sept. 15. Freeport
doesn’t see a short-term effect on output from a separate strike
at its Cero Verde mine in  Peru , Bruce Clemens, an official at
the unit, said yesterday in Peru.  The strike at the Grasberg mine, “with 70 percent of their
employees, is potentially a quite important, additional factor
in a market where we had over 500,000 tons of production lost
already this year,” Richardson said.  The Grasberg dispute may result in a loss of 230,000 tons
of ore per day, Thamrin Sihite, director general of minerals and
coal at the energy ministry, said at a briefing in Jakarta today.  Copper for November delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 1.4 percent to end at 65,970 yuan ($10,332) a ton.  Nickel climbed 0.5 percent to $21,903 a ton in  London ,
aluminum gained 0.2 percent to $2,378 a ton, and lead advanced
0.4 percent to $2,395.75 a ton. Zinc and tin were little changed
at $2,191.25 a ton and $23,575 a ton, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
