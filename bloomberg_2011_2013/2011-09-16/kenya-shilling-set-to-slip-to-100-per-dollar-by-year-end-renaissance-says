Kenya ’s shilling is poised to
weaken to 100 per dollar by the end of the year,  Renaissance
Capital  said.  “A softer oil price due to an economic slowdown in the
advanced economist is positive for Kenya’s current account and
the shilling,” Yvonne Mhango, a Johannesburg-based economist
with Renaissance, wrote in an e-mailed research note today.
“However, this could be countered by weaker demand for exports
and slowing financial inflows.”  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.3 percent to 95 per dollar by 10:36 a.m. in the capital,
Nairobi. It declined to 95.80 on Sept. 13, the weakest level in
17 years. Kenya’s currency has retreated 15 percent against the
dollar this year, making it the world’s worst performer after
 Uganda ’s shilling, Suriname’s dollar and Maldives’ rufiyaa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
