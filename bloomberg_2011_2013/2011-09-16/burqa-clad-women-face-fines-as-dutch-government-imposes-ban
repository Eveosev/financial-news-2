The Netherlands plans to ban facial
veils in public places, with women clad in burqas that cover
their faces risking a fine of as much as 380 euros ($523).  “Wearing clothes that partly or almost fully cover the
face fundamentally breaches the character of social interaction,
during which we meet each other with a recognizable visage
equally,” the Dutch government said in a statement on its
website today.  The ban was first proposed in 2005 by Geert Wilders, who
now leads the anti-Islam Freedom Party that supports Prime
Minister’s Mark Rutte’s minority government of Liberals and
Christian Democrats. The Cabinet deems a possible restriction of
freedom of religion necessary and justified in the interest of
the protection of the character and good customs of public life
in the Netherlands, the government said.  A French law banning facial veils in public places went
into effect in April, meaning women wearing burqas with their
faces covered in  France  risk a 150-euro fine. Neighboring
Belgium also introduced a ban this year.  Dutch statistics bureau data from 2006 show the Netherlands
has about 850,000 Muslims, most of whom are of Turkish or
Moroccan origin. The country’s population is 16.7 million.  Tijs Manten, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said
women who break the facial-veil law may risk a fine of as much
as 380 euros once the ban is in place.  To contact the reporters on this story:
