Less than two months after  UBS AG (UBSN) 
Chief Executive Officer  Oswald Gruebel  said the bank had “one
of the best” risk-management units in the industry, his firm
posted a $2 billion loss from alleged “unauthorized trading.”  The disclosure exposed flaws in the bank’s risk controls
that may prompt regulators to restrain lenders from making bets
with their own capital, academics and analysts said. Britain’s
Financial Services Authority and its Swiss counterpart yesterday
said they would also investigate the UBS trading losses.  “Clearly, UBS’s risk-management systems aren’t fit for the
purpose, or this couldn’t have happened,” said Giorgio Questa,
a finance professor at Cass Business School in London and a
former banker. “It shouldn’t be possible to build up losses
this big. Regulators are likely to force them to get out of this
field of trading.”  The Swiss lender said yesterday that the loss at its
investment bank was caused by a trader it didn’t identify.
Police in  London  today charged Kweku Adoboli, a 31-year-old UBS
employee, on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position. He worked
on the Delta One desk, a team that handles trades for clients
and took risks with the bank’s own money in arranging trades.  The regulators’ investigation, to be carried out by a third
party, will focus on “the control failures which permitted the
activity to remain undetected” and “will include an assessment
of the overall strength of UBS’s controls to prevent authorized
or fraudulent trading activity in its investment bank,” the FSA
said in an e-mailed statement today.  ‘Needs to Be Done’  “When we see what’s happened in the last couple of days,
it’s obvious that there is still more that needs to be done to
ensure we reach appropriate regulation and supervision,”  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview in Wroclaw,  Poland , after a meeting of
euro-area finance ministers yesterday.  Global regulators are pressing banks to curb proprietary
trading.  The loss may revive calls for firms to increase
controls on risk and separate their  investment banking  from
retail businesses.  A government commission led by former Bank of England Chief
Economist  John Vickers  this week recommended banks erect
firewalls between consumer and investment-banking units to
safeguard customers and the taxpayer.  “Whether it’s because of an irresponsible trader or
failure in the prevention of risk taking, I’m convinced you
can’t stop some investment banks taking on more risk than
others,” said  Martina Metzger , executive director of the Berlin
Institute of Financial Market Research. “What you can do is
separate investment banking from depositors’ money.”  ‘Rogue Trading Risk’  No matter how robust a bank’s controls, if someone is
determined and knowledgeable enough they are likely to be able
to circumvent those systems, according to David Berman, partner
and head of financial-services regulation at London-based law
firm Macfarlanes LLP.  “Whilst it is questionable whether rogue trading risk can
ever be entirely eliminated, firms will at the very least be
expected to ensure that the chances of it happening internally
are minimized,” Berman said. “Regulators will likely expect
institutions to revisit and reassess their own systems and
controls.”  UBS’s loss is the largest of its type since former Societe
Generale derivatives trader  Jerome Kerviel  caused a 4.9 billion-
euro ($6.8 billion) loss in 2008.  Britain’s FSA has said it had discussed the Kerviel case
with as many 50 banks in London and that “many had already put
in place reviews to ensure they identify any gaps in trading
controls and close them as soon as possible,” according to a
policy document from March 2008.  Value at Risk  Banks monitor traders’ risk-taking through daily
calculations of value-at-risk, which mustn’t exceed specific
thresholds, as well as measures of counterparty risk, according
to Marco Delzio, founder of Martingale Risk, an advisory firm.  When valuing structured derivatives, banks rely on prices
and measures, such as correlation, that aren’t available on the
open markets, said Delzio. It’s possible for a trader to hide
losses by entering false prices that can’t be verified, he said.  This isn’t the first time that UBS has been caught out by
“unauthorized” trading.  Two years ago, the FSA fined the Swiss bank 8 million
pounds ($12.7 million), at the time the third-largest penalty
ever imposed by the regulator, for not stopping employees in its
U.K. international wealth-management business from making
unauthorized trades with customer money in 2007.  Remedial Steps  The bank said at the time it “deeply” regretted the
incident and had taken “full remedial steps.” A spokesman for
the bank in London yesterday declined to comment on internal
risk controls.  Gruebel, who previously ran rival Credit Suisse Group AG,
came out of retirement in February 2009 to run UBS. Since
joining, he has sought to install tighter controls at the
investment bank. He started weekly calls with top risk officers
and was personally monitoring traders’ positions, together with
Carsten Kengeter, who runs the investment bank.  “I’m pretty convinced that we have one of the best risk
management in the industry,” Gruebel said on a July 26 call
with analysts as the bank reported second-quarter earnings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
