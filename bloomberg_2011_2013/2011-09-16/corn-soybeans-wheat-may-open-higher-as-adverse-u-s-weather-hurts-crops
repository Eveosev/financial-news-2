What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that frost
and freezing temperatures in the past three days have hurt crops
in the northwestern U.S. Midwest, Chad Henderson, a market
analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
 Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that cold weather reduced yields and
the quality of the crop, Henderson said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open up 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a pound, and soybean-
meal futures may open $2 to $3 higher for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as rain this week in the southern U.S. Great
Plains was lighter than forecast, missing key growing areas
before the planting season, Henderson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
