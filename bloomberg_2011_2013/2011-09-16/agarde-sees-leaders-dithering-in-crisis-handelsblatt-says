Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  called for concerted action
by policy makers to cut debt and keep the global economy on
track,  Handelsblatt  quoted her saying in a commentary.  Dithering by politicians in dealing with debt in developed
countries has contributed to a vicious circle that is holding
back consumer demand, investment and  job creation , Lagarde
wrote, according to the op-ed published in the Dusseldorf,
Germany-based newspaper today.  She called on emerging economies and countries that have a
current-account surplus to boost consumer demand to spur the
global recovery, according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
