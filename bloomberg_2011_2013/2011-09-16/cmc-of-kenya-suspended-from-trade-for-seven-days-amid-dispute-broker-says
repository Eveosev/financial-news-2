CMC Holdings Ltd. (CMCH) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
publicly traded auto dealer, was suspended from trading on the
 Nairobi Stock Exchange  for seven trading sessions after a
dispute over fees paid to a logistics company.  The suspension will “give the CMC Holdings directors an
opportunity to resolve the outstanding issues, and facilitate
investigations,” Capital Markets Authority Chief Executive
Officer Stella Kilonzo said in an e-mailed statement today.  CMC has been overcharged by as much as 2 billion shillings
($21 million) over the past five years by a freight-forwarding
company run by former CMC chairman Peter Muthoka, CMC Chief
Executive Officer Bill Lay told reporters on Sept. 14.  Andy Forwarders Services Ltd., the largest supplier of
services to CMC, charged the company in some instances as much
as 100 times the market rate, Lay said. Muthoka, who was
replaced by Joel Kibe as chairman of CMC on Sept. 9, dismissed
the allegations as “utterly inaccurate and not based on fact.”  Shares in CMC fell 3 percent to 12.90 shillings yesterday,
the biggest decline in two weeks.  The  Capital Markets Authority  has begun a probe into the
dispute between directors of the company, said Kungu Gatabaki,
chairman of the regulator. The authority also urged CMC to
appoint independent directors to avoid similar disputes in
future, Gatabaki told reporters in Nairobi yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
