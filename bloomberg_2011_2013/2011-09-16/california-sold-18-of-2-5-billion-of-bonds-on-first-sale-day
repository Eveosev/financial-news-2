California  took orders from
individual investors for 18 percent of its $2.5 billion debt
issue on the first day of sales, according to  Tom Dresslar , a
spokesman for Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  The stateâ€™s first general-obligation issue in 10 months
offered a yield of 4.8 percent for $350 million of bonds due
September 2041, while debt maturing in 2021 was offered at 3.17
percent, Dresslar said in an e-mailed statement.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay off some short-
term loans and refund other debts. Bank of America Merrill Lynch
and Stone & Youngberg are managing the sale, which continues
through Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
