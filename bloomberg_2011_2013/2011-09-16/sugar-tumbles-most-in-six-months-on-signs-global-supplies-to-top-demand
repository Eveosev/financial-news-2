Sugar futures plunged the most in
six months in New York and  London  on signs of increased supply
from  Brazil , the world’s largest producer and exporter. Coffee
fell, while cocoa was little changed.  Brazilian ports were listed as the source of 110,000 metric
tons of deliveries against 2,200 October futures contracts that
expired today on London’s NYSE Liffe exchange. A month earlier,
when August futures expired, deliveries totaled 1,203 contracts,
Liffe  data  show. Raw-sugar prices in New York are down 17
percent since reaching a six-month high on Aug. 24.  “This created an expectation that there is sugar in the
market, more specifically in Brazil, helping pull prices down,”
Rafael Crestana, a risk manager for broker INTL FCStone in  Sao
Paulo , said in an e-mailed statement.  Raw sugar for October delivery, the closest to expiration,
plunged 1.98 cents, or 6.7 percent, to close at 27.52 cents a
pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the biggest
decline since March 15. The March 2012 contract, the most-
actively traded futures, fell 1.87 cents, or 6.6 percent, to
26.31 cents, capping a 4.8 percent decline for the week. Prices
are down 18 percent this year.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery slid
$30.40, or 4.2 percent, to $687.20 a ton, the biggest decline
for a most-active contract since March 15. Prices are down 12
percent this year.  Brazil Harvest  Farmers in Brazil’s Center South, the main growing region
in the world, have reaped 338.1 million tons of cane this year,
a drop of 11 percent from a year earlier, according to Unica, an
industry association. Mills in the region have produced 20.4
million tons of sugar this year, down 9.4 percent from last
year.  “Brazil lost sugar-production potential this year due to
poor weather, but production in other parts of the world seems
strong,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president for Price Futures
Group in  Chicago , said in an e-mail. “Traders are watching to
see how much more sugar  India  is willing to export, and how much
 China  might need to buy.” India is the second-largest producer
and China is the biggest user.  Alex Oliveira, a trader at Newedge Group in New York, said
the decline today reflected slowing demand for sugar after
prices surged in June and July, before reaching a high of 31.85
cents on Aug. 24.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery slid 0.15
cent, or 0.1 percent, to $2.604 a pound in New York. The price
fell 3.6 percent this week.  Cocoa futures for December delivery rose $1 to $2,792 a ton
on ICE. The commodity dropped 2.8 percent during the week.  On NYSE Liffe, cocoa futures fell and robusta coffee rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
