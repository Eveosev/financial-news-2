Sinochem International Corp. has

Overseas Bank Ltd (UOB) , which each committed $28 million, said a
person familiar with the matter.  The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. committed $27 million
while the Bank of East Asia Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,
and Rabobank International committed $18 million each, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because details are
private.  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. and Qatar National Bank SAQ
each committed $10 million and  Bank Mandiri Tbk Pt (BMRI)  committed $5
million, said the person.  The loan pays a top-level all-in of 145 basis points to
