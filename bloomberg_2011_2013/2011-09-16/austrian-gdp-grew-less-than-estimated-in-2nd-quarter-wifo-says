Austriaâ€™s economy grew less than
estimated in the second quarter after the Alpine republic
exported fewer goods and services than previously thought, the
Vienna-based Wifo economic research institute said today in an
e-mail.  Second-quarter gross domestic product, the value of all
services and goods, grew 0.7 percent from the preceding three
months, less than the 1 percent originally estimated, according
to Wifo. Compared with a year earlier, the economy expanded 3.4
percent.  Austrian exports rose 0.1 percent in the quarter, Wifo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
