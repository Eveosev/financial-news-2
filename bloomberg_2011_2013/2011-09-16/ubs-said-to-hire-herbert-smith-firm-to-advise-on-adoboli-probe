UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
hired the London-based law firm  Herbert Smith  to advise on an
investigation into unauthorized trades that caused a $2 billion
loss, according to two people familiar with the investigation.  Kweku Adoboli, 31, a trader on the Delta One desk at UBS’s
investment bank, was charged today with fraud and false
accounting. The investigation is ongoing and police said they
are working with the U.K.’s finance regulator, the Financial
Services Authority and the  Serious Fraud Office , which
prosecutes white-collar crime.  UBS spokeswoman Stephanie Aneto and Herbert Smith spokesman
Michael Evans declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
