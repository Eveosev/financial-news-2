Lead inventories monitored by the
 London  Metal Exchange climbed the most in a month to the highest
level in more than 16 years.  Stockpiles rose 5,075 metric tons, or 1.6 percent, to
327,750 tons, daily LME figures showed. The increase, the
biggest since Aug. 16, lifted inventories to the highest level
since Jan. 31, 1995, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
Inventories in Singapore warehouses increased 3,250 tons to
45,225 tons, the most metal since June 30.  Global reported lead inventories will likely fall to the
equivalent of 1.5 weeks of consumption by the end of 2015 from
an expected 3.1 weeks this year, according to RBS Global Banking
& Markets. Demand will exceed supply by 50,000 to 150,000 tons
between 2013 and 2015, analysts including Nikos Kavalis in
London said in a report dated yesterday.  Lead for three-month delivery gained $18, or 0.8 percent,
to $2,403.50 a ton by 10:51 a.m. on the LME. Prices are down 5.7
percent this year, the second-best performance among the six
main metals traded on the exchange after aluminum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
