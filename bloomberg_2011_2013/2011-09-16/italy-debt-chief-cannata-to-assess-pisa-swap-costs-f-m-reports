Italy ’s highest administrative
court appointed Maria Cannata, the  Finance Ministry ’s director
of public debt, as the expert who will assess whether Pisa’s
swap dealers concealed fees, Finanza & Mercati reported, citing
the court order.  Italy’s Council of State has asked Cannata to verify if
Dexia Crediop SpA and Depfa Bank Plc charged so-called implicit
costs on derivative transactions and whether the financing was
more expensive than the provincial government’s existing debt,
the daily newspaper reported today. Her review of the case must
be submitted by Nov. 30, the newspaper said.  The municipality has the right to annul swaps contracts,
Italy’s highest administrative court ruled earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
