European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. Chief Executive Officer Louis Gallois said finding
investors for the company stakes that will come up for sale by
 Lagardere SCA (MMB)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  will be hard to find, according to
an interview in French weekly Le Point.  Daimler wants to sell half of its stake in EADS, and that
Lagardere has always said aerospace isn’t a main activity,
Gallois was cited as saying. No major industrial company would
be to spend to spend 2 billion euros ($2.76 billion) to 3
billion euros on the shares unless the purchase brought
synergies, Gallois was cited as saying.  Gallois was also quoted as saying Dutch law would provide
means for EADS to protect itself from hostile bids. EADS is
based in the Netherlands.  Daimler controls 22.5 percent of EADS shares, and Lagardere
owns 7.5 percent of shares while having  management control over
a 22.5 percent stake that includes the French state’s shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
