The rupiah slid, its biggest weekly
drop in more than two years, after global investors reduced
holdings of Indonesian assets on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
will damp demand for exports. Bonds declined in the week.  International funds sold $414 million more Indonesian
shares than they bought this week through yesterday, according
to exchange data.  Bank Indonesia  intervened in the rupiah and
bond markets, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said on Sept. 14,
when the currency declined as much as 2.6 percent. The  European
Central Bank  said yesterday it coordinated with counterparts
around the world to extend three-month loans to euro-area banks
to ensure they have enough cash for the rest of the year.  “Talks of possible Greek default and the country exiting
from the euro-region” caused  risk aversion , said Wiwig Santoso,
head of treasury and markets at PT Bank DBS  Indonesia  in Jakarta.
“There are concerns of a global economic slowdown, and the
rupiah isn’t isolated from market developments.”  The rupiah fell 2.5 percent this week, the most since June
2009, to 8,806 per dollar as of 3:05 p.m. in Jakarta, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 8,939 on
Sept. 14, its weakest level since Feb. 14.  Government bonds  dropped this week, with the yield on
benchmark notes climbing to the highest level in almost two
months. The rate on the 8.25 percent securities due July 2021
increased 65 basis points to 7.07 percent, according midday
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Global funds’ ownership of rupiah sovereign bonds fell 2.1
percent in the first three days of this week to 245.9 trillion
rupiah ($28 billion), according to the debt-management office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
