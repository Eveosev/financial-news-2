Poland’s ruling  Civic Platform 
party led its closest rival, Law & Justice, by 18 percent to 17
percent in a poll of likely voters,  Gazeta Wyborcza  reported.  The poll of 1,005 people on Sept. 13-14 by the TNS OBOP
agency used a new methodology to filter out people who don’t
plan to vote in the Oct. 9 election, the newspaper said. A
Sept. 1-4 poll by OBOP using different methodology had shown 35
percent backing for Civic Platform and 22 percent for Law &
Justice.  The Democratic  Left Alliance , also in the opposition,
attracted 5 percent of voters in the most recent survey, while
the Polish Peasants Party, the junior coalition partner in
the government, had 3 percent, Gazeta said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
