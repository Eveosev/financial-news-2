Barclays Capital  will open a
precious metals vault in London next year as demand for assets
boosted investors’ holdings and pushed prices to a record.  The facility may be operational by next summer, the bank
confirmed in a statement. It’s joining The Brink’s Co., which
opened a vault in London earlier this year and is considering
building another facility.  Gold is set for an 11th straight annual gain, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920, as investors have shunned
equities and some currencies amid concern about slowing economic
growth and debt crises. Investors own 2,145.2 metric tons of the
metal in exchange-traded products, more than all but four
central banks, who are expanding reserves for the first time in
a generation. Silver prices more than tripled since 2008.  Barclays is building the vault “in response to client
demand,” it said. “This is part of our long-term commitment to
the bullion market.”  Gold for immediate delivery reached a record $1,921.15 an
ounce on Sept. 6 and traded at $1,768.13 by 6:31 a.m. in  London ,
set for a 24 percent gain this year. Silver was at $39.47 an
ounce. It reached a record $49.79 on April 25. Both metals
outperformed global equities, commodities and Treasuries this
year, sending the value of precious metals held in ETPs to $144
billion.  U.K. gold vaults are traditionally located within the area
bounded by the M25 road that orbits London, the  London Bullion
Market Association  website shows. The gold stored in such vaults
is typically to the LBMA’s so-called good delivery standard,
where bars are of 99.5 percent fineness and include serial
number, refiner assay and manufacture year marks.  Brink’s’ above-ground vault that it opened this year took
almost two years to build, according to the LBMA, which visited
the vault in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
