Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) , a Nigerian lender,
gained the most in two weeks after its management embarked on a
marketing trip to explain its acquisition plans to local and
foreign investors.  The stock increased 25 kobo, or 5 percent, to 5.30 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos.  Access held investment conferences in  London ,  Cape Town  and
Johannesburg this week on its planned acquisition of
 Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) , a lender bailed out by the central
bank in 2009, Austin Edoga-Peters, spokesman for the lender,
said by phone today.  “Investors showed positive interest in the bank after the
road shows,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based analyst with
Renaissance Capital, said by phone today.  Access will acquire 75 percent of Intercontinental, and
shareholders will be asked at a meeting on Sept. 26 to approve
the use of 53.5 billion naira ($342.5 million) it raised in a
public offer in 2007 to fund the transaction, the Lagos-based
lender said in an e-mailed statement on Aug. 29. The two lenders
will become  “a single entity” in October 2012, when the
acquisition will be completed, Chief Executive Officer Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede said on Sept. 1.  The  Central Bank  of Nigeria fired the chief executives of
eight of the nation’s 24 lenders in 2009 after a debt crisis
threatened to collapse some of the West African nation’s banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
