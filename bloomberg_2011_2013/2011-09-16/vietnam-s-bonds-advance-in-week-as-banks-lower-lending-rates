Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained
this week on speculation demand for the notes will improve as
banks lower lending rates in response to a request from the
central bank.  Lenders including Vietnam Bank for Agriculture & Rural
Development, the country’s largest bank by assets, cut rates for
some borrowers to as low as 17 percent this week from more than
20 percent, according to a statement on the central bank’s
website. The  State Bank  of Vietnam asked banks earlier this
month to meet a 14 percent cap on dong deposit rates.  “As the central bank strictly enforces the cap on deposit
rates, expectation is rising that lending rates will soon
decline and the bond yield curve too will move down,” said
Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB
Securities Inc.  Five-year yields fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, this week to 12.48 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong dropped 0.03 percent today to 20,827 per dollar as
of 4:38 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks. The
central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,628 today, unchanged
since Aug. 24, its website showed. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the official rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
