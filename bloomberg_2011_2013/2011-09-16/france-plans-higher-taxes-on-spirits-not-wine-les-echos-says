The French government plans to
raise taxes on spirits,  Les Echos  reported, citing the prime
minister’s office.  France expects to raise 340 million euros ($471 million)
with the new tax, which will increase the price of one liter of
spirits by as much as 90 cents,  Les Echos  said. The government
doesn’t plan to raise taxes on wine or beer, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
