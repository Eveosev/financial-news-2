With a ragtag band of his Green
Mountain Boys, Ethan Allen launched a pre-dawn attack on the
greatest fortress in colonial America.  Without firing a shot, he captured Fort Ticonderoga in 1775
for the first victory in the Revolutionary War. His next major
foray, however, attacking  Montreal , led to disaster.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Allen was captured and sent as a trophy to  England  for
trial and execution. Confined to a cramped, dark, lice-infested
hold with two tubs for excrement, Allen and the 33 other
prisoners soon developed fever, diarrhea and an “intolerable
thirst.”  An emaciated, jaundiced Allen disembarked at Falmouth, clad
in the same clothes he’d been wearing for two months. The crowds
gathered to see him were so thick, officers had to draw their
swords to clear a passage to the dungeon.  His outlaw reputation had preceded him, and Allen was now a
celebrated folk hero.  Fearing that it would be impossible to get an English jury
to convict him, much less condemn him to death, British
officials sent Allen back to America, where he died in 1789.  I spoke with Willard Sterne Randall, author of “Ethan
Allen: His Life and Times,” on the following topics:  1. Rebellious Spirit  2. Green Mountain Boys  3. Prisoner of War  4. Back to Vermont  5. Prison Narrative  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
