South Korea ’s won posted its
biggest weekly loss in 15 months as concern about Europe’s debt
crisis and a global slowdown sapped demand for emerging-market
assets. The government’s three-year bonds declined.  Global economic risks are growing and financial markets are
highly volatile, South Korea’s Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan
said at a meeting today. The  European Central Bank  said
yesterday it will coordinate with other international policy
makers in lending dollars to euro-area banks to ensure they have
enough cash. U.S. retail sales stagnated in August and
manufacturing in the New York region is contracting at the
fastest pace since November, data showed in the last two days.  The won tumbled 3.1 percent this week to 1,112.10 per
dollar at the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,119.75 yesterday, the
weakest level since March. The won advanced 0.4 percent today.  “Reports from  Europe  prompted some risk-taking moves in
the market today, supporting the won,” said Ryoo Hyun Jung,
chief currency dealer in Seoul at Citibank Inc. “Uncertainties
are still lingering though, making investors unsure of which
position to take.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its won forecast for the
yearend to 1,080 per dollar from 1,040, saying Europe’s debt
crisis will spur capital outflows from emerging markets.
Overseas investors reduced holdings in South Korean bonds by
106.6 billion won ($95.9 million) this month through yesterday,
according to the Financial Supervisory Service.  The government’s benchmark three-year bonds were headed for
the first weekly drop since July. The yield on the 3.5 percent
notes due June 2014 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, this week to 3.41 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. The rate gained two basis points today, extending
yesterday’s climb from a Sept. 14 closing level of 3.29 percent
that was the lowest for a benchmark three-year note since
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
