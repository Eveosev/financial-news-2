Hungary won’t limit borrowers’
eligibility to participate in a foreign-currency mortgage
repayment program based on the size of the loans they took out,

participation in the plan may depend on the size of the loans,
Giro-Szasz said at a press conference in Budapest today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
