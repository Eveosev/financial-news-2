Acciona SA (ANA) , the Spanish renewable
energy company, plans to develop a 144-megawatt wind farm in the
state of  South Australia , according to documents filed with the
Australian government.  The Exmoor wind farm, with as many as 48 turbines, would be
located about 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of Naracoorte in the
southeast region of the state, the Madrid-based company said in
documents lodged yesterday with the Australian Environment
Department. Acciona may get approval to build the wind farm as
early as 2013, the company said.  Acciona,  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK)  and Investec Plc are among
companies planning to build more wind-power projects in
Australia as the country moves toward a goal of generating 20
percent of its power from renewable energy sources by 2020.
AGL’s 420-megawatt Macarthur wind farm in Victoria state,
estimated to cost A$1 billion ($1 billion), will be the largest
in the southern hemisphere when it is completed in early 2013,
the Sydney-based company said last year.  Acciona in July opened the 107 million-euro ($148 million)
Gunning wind farm in New South Wales state, the company’s third
in  Australia . That project has a capacity of 46.5 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
