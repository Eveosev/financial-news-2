Peruvian dollar bonds rose for the
first time in seven sessions as optimism European leaders will
contain the region’s debt crisis spurred demand for emerging-
market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.13 percent at 11:34 a.m.  New York  time.
The bond’s price rose 0.21 cent to 120 cents per dollar. Yields
have increased 12 basis points this week, the most since the
week ending April 15.  The European Central Bank said yesterday it coordinated
with the U.S. Federal Reserve to extend three-month loans to
euro-area banks, easing concern a liquidity crunch looms.  “Sentiment has gotten a touch better,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of  Latin America  fixed-income research at
IdeaGlobal in New York. “It’s like a sentiment roller coaster
with Europe. The outlook at no point has gotten terribly
negative with regards to the overall sovereign debt in the Latin
America.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 climbed one basis point to 5.59
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol was little changed at 2.7308 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7300 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
