Prices for 97-RON gasoline rose in
 Asia  after BP Plc, the biggest seller of the fuel on the Platts
window this month, sold a cargo in Singapore. Hin Leong Trading
Pte bought fuel oil for a third day.  Light Distillates  BP sold 50,000 barrels of 97-RON gasoline to Royal Dutch
Shell Plc at $129.30 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window.
That’s more than the $126.60 that BP got for a cargo yesterday.  Morgan Stanley sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON to PetroChina
Co. at $125.20 a barrel, the survey showed. Glencore
International AG sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for delivery in the
second half of November to Shell at $983 a ton, and sold another
25,000 tons for the same period to Marubeni Corp. at $981 a ton.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures,
known as the crack spread, rose to $127.56 a ton at 5:40 p.m.
 Singapore  time, from $114.06 at the end of trading in Asia on
Sept. 9, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  BP sold 150,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil, or
diesel, to Hin Leong at 50 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes,
according to the Bloomberg News survey. That’s up from a 40-cent
premium in yesterday’s transaction.  BP bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10 parts-per-
million of sulfur from ConocoPhillips, paying $3 a barrel over
quotes, the survey showed. The London-based company last year
was the largest buyer of so-called ultra-low-sulfur diesel.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, the Asian crude benchmark,
climbed $2.26 to $17.24 a barrel at 2:27 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This
crack spread, a measure of refining profit, widened the most
since March 15.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil dropped 5 cents to $1.75 a
barrel, PVM data showed. This regrade narrowed for a third week,
signaling it’s less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Fuel Oil  Vitol Group sold two cargoes of 180-centistoke fuel oil
totaling 42,000 tons to Mercuria Energy Ltd., according to the
Bloomberg News survey. The price was $6.50 a ton above benchmark
quotes for one cargo and a $6 premium for the second cargo.  Hin Leong purchased two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, paying $1.25 a ton over September quotes to
Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd., the survey showed.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 1 cent to $6.01
a barrel at 2:27 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM data.
The difference has narrowed almost 60 percent since peaking in
April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It may fall
further to average $5 a barrel in the third quarter and $4.50 in
the fourth quarter, according to Standard Chartered Plc.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
rebounded 50 cents to $9 a ton, the first gain in seven days,
PVM said. This viscosity spread narrowed for a second week,
indicating bunker, or marine fuel, has increased more than
higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
