The  European Central Bank ’s plan to
step up dollar lending to the region’s banks is only a temporary
solution to easing funding needs and solving the region’s debt
crisis, said Marco Valli, chief euro-area economist at UniCredit
Group in Milan.  “We are seeing a clear sign of stress, so this coordinated
move certainly goes in the right direction, but this isn’t a
long-term solution,” he said in an interview with Maryam
Nemazee on Bloomberg Television’s The Pulse.  For a permanent solution “governments really need to step
up their efforts to bring about a coordinated end to this debt
crisis,” he said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
