Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,
Japan’s third-biggest lender by market value, will merge its
corporate and retail banking units by September 2013 to
streamline management.  The lender plans to combine Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. and
Mizuho Bank Ltd. in the first half of the year starting April
2013, the company said in a statement to the  Tokyo  Stock
Exchange today. It will also consider merging Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co. with the two units, the statement said.  With loan profitability declining as domestic lending
shrinks, Japan’s biggest banks are under pressure to trim costs
and look abroad to expand credit. Consolidating the units would
be in line with bigger rivals  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) 
and  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , which each have one
main banking subsidiary that serves retail and corporate clients.  “Turning Mizuho into one-bank regime would be a symbolic
event that signals a leap out of the old regime,” Yoshinobu Yamada, a Tokyo-based bank analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said
before today’s announcement. “How Mizuho will be managed under
the new framework must be closely watched in the coming years.”  The company’s net interest margin, a gauge of profit on
loans, shrank to 0.81 percent in the year ended March from 1
percent seven years earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Mitsubishi UFJ’s margin fell to 1.13 percent from
1.19 percent, while  Sumitomo Mitsui ’s stood at 1.19 percent in
March compared with 1.48 percent in 2004.  Tokyo-based Mizuho unveiled a plan in May to integrate
administrative and systems functions of the three units by March
2013 after a computer systems failure at the retail bank in
March. The glitch delayed transactions worth more than $10
billion following a record earthquake and tsunami.  Mizuho was created in 2000 through the merger of Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd. and Industrial Bank of  Japan 
Ltd. Its shares have dropped 25 percent this year, almost double
the 13 percent decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
