Haverford ( Bermuda ) Ltd. Chairman
Mark Byrne said his company’s offer for a 25 percent stake of
 Omega Insurance Holdings Ltd. (OIH)  could be a “done deal” within
five weeks.  Byrne, who is founder of Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings
Ltd., said he has backing from Omega’s largest investor,  Invesco
Ltd. (IVZ) , which holds a stake of about 29.4 percent, according to a
March 1 filing. Haverford’s Sept. 12 bid of 83 pence a share
also has the backing of Omega’s board, he said.  “As far as I’m concerned it is as close to a done deal as
can be bar the kabuki dance of regulatory approval,” Byrne said
in a telephone interview today. “Somewhere from five weeks from
now we expect to be finished.”  Omega, the second-smallest publicly traded Lloyd’s of
London insurer, received a rival offer for all of its shares
from Canopius Group Ltd. on Sept. 13. That bid, also at 83 pence
a share, values Hamilton, Bermuda-based Omega at 202 million
pounds ($319 million).  A spokeswoman for Omega declined to comment while Bill Hensel, a spokesman at Invesco, couldn’t immediately be reached
when contacted by phone.  Omega has gained 13 percent in London trading to 74.63
pence since the Sept. 12 offer.  Omega has this year fended off bids from Lloyd’s rivals
Barbican Group Holdings Ltd. and Novae Group Plc. Lloyd’s
insurers have become takeover targets after earnings fell
following the worst first half for catastrophe losses on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
