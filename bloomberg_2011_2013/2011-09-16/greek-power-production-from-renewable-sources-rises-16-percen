Greece  increased electricity
produced from renewable sources in the first half by 286 mega
watts to 2,022 mega watts, the countryâ€™s Energy Ministry  said .  Wind power accounted for 1,432 mega watts and photovoltaic
units comprised 341 mega watts while small hydro-production
plants accounted for 206 mega watts and biomass 43 mega watts,
the Athens-based  ministry  said today in an e-mailed statement.  Licenses granted for producing electricity from renewable
sources, where production has yet to start, corresponded to
