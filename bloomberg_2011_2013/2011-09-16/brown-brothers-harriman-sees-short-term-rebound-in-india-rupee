Analysts including New York-based
Win Thin at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. comment in a research
note on the outlook for India’s rupee after the central bank
increased borrowing costs.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised today its repurchase rate
to 8.25 percent from 8 percent in the sixth addition this year.
Fourteen of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey predicted the
decision and three expected no change. The rupee traded at 47.47
per dollar as of 1:11 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “In the short term, we think the rupee could be due for a
rebound after falling over 8 percent against the dollar since
early August. With the S&P registering four days of consecutive
gains, it’s likely that global equity investors will be more at
ease in Sensex and reduce the pace of outflows.  ‘‘However, the lack of policy support for the rupee
combined with  India ’s large current-account deficit, dependency
on short-term flows and exposure to equity markets will probably
keep the currency as an underperformer in the region until risk
aversion subsides.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
