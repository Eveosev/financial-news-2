Hungary’s banking industry was
unprofitable in 2010, closing the year with a total loss of 17
billion forint ($ million) compared with a net profit of 210
billion forint in 2009,  Vilaggazdasag  said, citing the financial
regulator.  Of the country’s 40 lenders, 18 posted a loss last year,
the business newspaper said.  The loss of profitability is chiefly the result of a
special banking tax levied by the government, as well as higher
provisioning for bad loans, the newspaper said.  The largest losses were booked by Bayerische Landesbank
AG’s local unit MKB Bank Zrt. and the subsidiaries of  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  and  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , Vilaggazdasag
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
