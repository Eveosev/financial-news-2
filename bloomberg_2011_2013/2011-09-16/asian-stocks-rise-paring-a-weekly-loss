any panic over banks’ access to short-term funding,” said
Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1.1 billion at Platypus
Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “Anything that suggests they
will act proactively to avoid another Lehman-style crisis will
help equities, commodities and other risk assets because of how
oversold they are, and how bearishly everybody is positioned.”  Global Concern  Concern the global economy was slipping back into a
recession amid a worsening European-debt crisis and slowing U.S.
growth triggered a 16 percent plunge in the MSCI Asia Pacific

markets are taking this very positively,” Kirk Hartman, chief
investment officer of Wells Capital Management in  Los Angeles ,
told Susan Li on Bloomberg Television’s “First Up.” “I don’t
think we’re going to having a banking crisis, but I think we are
going to have more turmoil. Clearly there are issues, but I
think over time it will work itself out.”  Metals Increase  Raw-material producers posted the second-biggest increase
