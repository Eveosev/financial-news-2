Ghana’s  cedi gained for the first
day in seven and the most since April as mining companies sold
dollars to finance their cedi-denominated operations.  The currency of the world’s second-largest cocoa producer
appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to 1.5584 per dollar before
trading 0.3 percent stronger at 1.5652 by 4:05 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Mining companies auctioned dollars today to raise the cedi
equivalent for their operations” including salaries, Chris Nettey, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank  Ghana  Ltd., said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
