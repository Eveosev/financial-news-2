Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s Sabine Pass
terminal in  Louisiana  is scheduled to receive a cargo of
liquefied natural gas, according to vessel tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The tanker Golar Arctic is to arrive at the terminal on
Sept. 24, the data showed. The vessel can move as much as
140,648 cubic meters of LNG, or about 3.03 billion cubic feet of
gas, equivalent to 4.6 percent of estimated daily U.S. gas
production.  Bloomberg data showed yesterday that another ship, Seri
Balhaf, is to reach the terminal Sept. 20.  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back into a gas.  The Sabine Pass terminal can regasify and send out 4
billion cubic feet a day of natural gas to pipelines, making it
the biggest LNG terminal in  North America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
