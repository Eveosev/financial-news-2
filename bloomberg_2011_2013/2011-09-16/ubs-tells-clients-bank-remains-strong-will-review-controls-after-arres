UBS AG (UBSN) , the Swiss lender that says
it sustained a $2 billion loss from unauthorized trading at its
investment bank, told clients it “remains strong” and will
scrutinize how it monitors risks.  While the loss “is disappointing, UBS remains strong,
well-capitalized and committed to serving you,” executives at
UBS Financial Services wrote yesterday in an e-mail to
customers.  Karina Byrne , a spokeswoman for the Zurich-based
firm, confirmed a copy of the message obtained by Bloomberg
News.  Kweku Adoboli, 31, a trader on the Delta One desk at UBS’s
investment bank, was charged in the U.K. today with fraud and
false accounting. UBS Chief Executive Officer  Oswald Gruebel 
called the loss “unauthorized” and “distressing” in an e-
mail to employees yesterday, without giving details.  “UBS is taking this incident very seriously,” the firm
said in the e-mail to customers. “In addition to cooperating
with the authorities, UBS will thoroughly review its risk
management and control processes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
