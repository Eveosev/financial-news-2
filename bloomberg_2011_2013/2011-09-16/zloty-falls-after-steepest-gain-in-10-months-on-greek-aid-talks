The zloty retreated following its
steepest gain in almost 10 months as European Union finance
officials sparred over collateral to back rescue loans for
 Greece .  The zloty depreciated 0.4 percent to 4.3430 per euro as of
10:31 a.m. in Warsaw and headed for a weekly decline of 1
percent. The currency jumped the most since Nov. 30 yesterday
after the  European Central Bank  said it will lend dollars to
euro-area banks. The yield on bonds maturing in April 2016 rose
two basis points to 5.04 percent.  Finnish Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said it was
unlikely any agreement on collateral would be reached at the
gathering in Wroclaw,  Poland . ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
yesterday pressed euro-area governments to take decisive action
to halt the debt crisis and show “unity of purpose” at the
meeting.  “The zloty’s performance depends on the sentiment in
 Europe  and the news from Europe,” Bank Pekao SA economists led
by Marcin Mrowiec in Warsaw wrote in a note to clients. The
currency will probably stay in a range between 4.30 and 4.3530
against Europe’s common currency, according to Pekao.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch today cut its 2012 economic
growth forecast for Poland to 2.9 percent from 3.7 percent,
citing a “jittery” global economy, the bank’s London-based
economist  Raffaella Tenconi  said in an e-mailed report. Poland
sends 55 percent of its exports to countries that share Europe’s
common currency, according to statistics office data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
