The amount of sugar waiting to
leave  Brazil ’s main ports fell by about 1 million metric tons in
a week as demand for the South American country’s sweetener
slowed on speculation of large crops in the Northern Hemisphere.  As many as 32 vessels were waiting at the ports of Recife,
Santos and Paranagua to load 905,648 tons of sugar on Sept. 14,
down from 63 ships and 1.94 million tons on Sept. 7, according
to data from Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  “The line up reflects lower demand,” Pierre-Henri Dietz,
an analyst at Sucden, the trading arm of Sucres et Denrees SA,
said by phone from Paris today. “Chinese buying has probably
reduced and Russia is not buying anymore because of the duty
increase and the start of the beet crop there.”  The customs union joining  Russia , Belarus and  Kazakhstan 
fixed the import duty on raw sugar at $140 a ton for August,
September and October. The duty was $85 a ton in July.  Europe ’s crop for the season starting Oct. 1 will be 30
million tons, the highest since 2005-06, the Ratzeburg, Germany-
based researcher F.O. Licht GmbH estimates.  “There will be a lot of sugar in the Northern Hemisphere
when the crop starts in a few weeks,” Dietz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
