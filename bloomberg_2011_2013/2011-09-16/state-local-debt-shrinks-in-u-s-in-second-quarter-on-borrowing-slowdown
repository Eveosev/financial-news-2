U.S. state and local governments
pared their debts during the second quarter as officials curbed
borrowing, the  Federal Reserve  said.  Outstanding debt of state and local governments shrank at a
3.2 percent annual pace in April through June to $2.89 trillion,
the central bank reported today. That follows a 4.2 percent
decline during the first quarter and sets the pace for the first
annual drop in municipal indebtedness since 1996, according to
the Federal Reserveâ€™s statistics.  The quarterly figure confirms the slowdown in municipal
debt sales during the first half of the year as politicians cut
outlays to deal with budget deficits.  The dearth of bond sales, along with financial turmoil that
sent investors fleeing risk, has helped lift returns in the
municipal market. Municipal bonds returned 4.5 percent during
the second quarter, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
