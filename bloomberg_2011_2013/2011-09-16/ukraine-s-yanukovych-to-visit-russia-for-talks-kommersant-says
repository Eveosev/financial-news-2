Ukrainian President  Viktor Yanukovych  will visit Russia on Sept. 24 for talks with
President  Dmitry Medvedev , the Kremlin said today in an e-mailed
statement, without elaborating.  Ukraine is seeking to reduce gas imports from Russia to 27
billion cubic meters and lower the contract price, while OAO
Gazprom, the Moscow-based gas-export monopoly, has said it will
hold the neighboring country to minimum levels of 33 billion
cubic meters.  Medvedev last week said Yanukovych’s complaints about the
existing gas contracts were “outrageous,” according to an
interview with Euronews.  Gazprom has said it may compromise on the contract if
Ukraine agrees to a merger with NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy, the state-
owned energy company and pipeline operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
