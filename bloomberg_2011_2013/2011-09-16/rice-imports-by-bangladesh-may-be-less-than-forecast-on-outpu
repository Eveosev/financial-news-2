Rice imports by  Bangladesh ,  South
Asia ’s biggest buyer, may be half the amount forecast earlier by
the government as local production increases and domestic prices
decline, according an executive at the state food buyer.  Shipments may total 400,000 metric tons in the year that
began July 1 compared with 800,000 tons estimated two months ago,
Badrul Hasan, director for procurement at the Bangladesh
Directorate General of Food, said in a phone interview. Imports
were 1.26 million tons in the year ended June 30, he said.  Lower imports by Bangladesh may help end a 51 percent jump
in prices in Chicago in the past year that allowed rice to beat
rallies in corn and soybeans and a drop in wheat. Global food
costs were near a record in August, supported by higher rice and
corn prices, according to the Food & Agriculture Organization.  “With stocks much higher this year, we’ll have less import
needs,” Hasan said from Dhaka yesterday. Lower local prices
will also help the government to cut purchases of the grain used
in a food-distribution program for the poor, he said.  Rough rice for November delivery traded at $17.98 per 100
pounds on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 6:07 p.m. in Singapore.
The most-active contract touched $18.54 on Sept. 12, the highest
level since 2008, when surging food costs stoked riots worldwide.  The global rice trade may total 33.2 million tons in the
year from Jan. 1 from 31.6 million tons in 2010, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Thailand and  Vietnam  are the
two largest exporters, while  India , which ended an export ban,
is forecast to overtake the U.S. and  Pakistan  to become the
third-largest shipper, according to USDA data on Sept. 12.  Bigger Harvest  Bangladeshi production of milled grain, excluding waste,
may rise to 30 million tons in the year from July 1, from 28.5
million tons last year, Hasan said. Hasan’s latest rice-import
estimate compares with the 600,000 ton  forecast  by the USDA’s
 Foreign Agricultural Service  on Aug. 5.  Local stockpiles were at 1.1 million tons, almost double
the 600,000 tons a year ago, after the government boosted
overseas purchases last year to secure supplies as so-called
panic-buying sent domestic prices higher, he said.  The end of the export ban on non-basmati rice shipments
from India, the world’s second-largest grower, may push
Bangladesh’s domestic prices down further as it helps buyers to
be able to secure supply in the event of crop losses, Hasan said.  After the government ended the ban on Sept. 8, exports by
India may reach 2 million tons by March 31, according to an
estimate from Shri Lal Mahal, a New Delhi-based trader.  Domestic wholesale  prices  of rough rice in Dhaka have
fallen 6.9 percent to 3,082 taka ($41) per 100 kilograms in
August, from 3,311 taka in December, the highest price since
April 2008, according to FAO data.  The UN agency’s  Rice Price Index , which tracks 16 varieties
from exporters, advanced 20 percent to 261 in August from a year
earlier. The World Food Price Index was at 231.1 last month,
near the all-time high of 237.7 in February, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
