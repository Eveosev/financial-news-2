Hungary will raise taxes next year,
including a sales levy, to keep its  budget deficit  within 3
percent of gross domestic product in 2012, when the government
expects slower growth than previously estimated.  The Cabinet plans to raise the  sales tax  to 27 percent from
25 percent, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  told reporters
today, adding that the measure doesn’t violate a European Union
rate cap. Hungary reduced its forecast for 2012 economic growth
to 1.5 percent, lowering it a second time this month, from 3
percent.  Hungary is struggling to reduce the budget deficit to a
targeted 2.5 percent of GDP next year and to steer public
finances to a sustainable path as growth slows, cutting tax
revenue. Hungary is rated the lowest investment grade at  Fitch
Ratings , Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s.  “We have lowered our growth forecast to reflect the
palpable risks and the obvious slowdown in growth seen from
 Japan , through America to  Europe ,” Matolcsy said. “This is a
very cautious, very realistic projection.”  The forint weakened to 286.02 per euro at 5:39 p.m. in
Budapest from 284.85. The benchmark BUX stock index fell 0.1
percent to 16,779.45, reversing a two-day rally, led by a 9.6
percent plunge in mortgage lender Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank AG
and a 2.7 percent decline in Gedeon  Richter Nyrt ., Hungary’s
largest drugmaker.  Budget Savings  The government wants to boost budget savings next year by
200 billion forint ($967 million) to 750 billion forint,
Matolcsy said. The 2012 budget draft is based on 4.2 percent
inflation and a current-account surplus of more than 3 percent
of GDP, he said.  The government is seeking 150 billion forint of income from
the higher value-added tax, to contribute to 450 billion forint
of its target for extra revenue. It is also targeting 300
billion forint of additional spending cuts. The government
originally targeted 550 billion forint of savings for next year
as part of a multi-year spending cut plan.  The Cabinet plans to cut the level of public debt to 72
percent of GDP by the end of 2012 from a targeted 73% at the end
of this year, Matolcsy said.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
