The Philippine central bank is
discussing a proposal to curb non-deliverable currency forward
trades with lenders, including a plan to impose higher capital
charge, and the memo will probably be out “in the next few
weeks,” Governor Amando Tetangco told reporters today.  The monetary authority saw from banks daily report that
“substantial” trades on the derivative were speculative,
Tetangco said in  Manila . Banks can cope with a higher capital
charge on NDFs as transactions decline, he said. Recent weakness
in the peso was due to “risk-off” sentiment and the move was
in line with the region, the governor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
