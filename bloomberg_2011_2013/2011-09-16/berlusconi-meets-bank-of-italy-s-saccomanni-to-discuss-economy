 Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berluconi met with Bank of Italy Director General Fabrizio
Saccomanni, one of the candidates to succeed  Mario Draghi  as
governor of the central bank, a spokesman for Berlusconi said.  The meeting today at Palazzo Chigi, Berlusconi’s
headquarters, lasted more than 30 minutes.  Berlusconi in June said that Saccomanni was one of the
leading candidates to take the helm at the bank when Draghi
leaves to become president of the  European Central Bank  in
November when Jean-Claude Trichet’s term ends.  The central bank’s governing council is due to meet on
Sept. 28, news agency Ansa reported. The council needs to
approve any candidate nominated by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
