A probe into Honda Motor Co.’s CR-V
headlights that may stop working has been upgraded to an
engineering analysis by U.S. auto-safety regulators, a step that
may lead to a recall.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
said today on its  website  that it is expanding the investigation
into about 288,000 CR-Vs from model years 2002 to 2004.  Honda, based in  Tokyo , had told the regulator that low-beam
headlights on CR-Vs may stop working, both at the same time,
requiring replacement of the headlight switch and harness
connector after they were damaged by overheating.  “Honda has cooperated with NHTSA and will continue to do
so until this matter is resolved,”  Chris Martin , a U.S.-based
spokesman for Honda, said in an e-mail. “Honda is also
continuing to analyze this, but we have not yet reached any
conclusions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
