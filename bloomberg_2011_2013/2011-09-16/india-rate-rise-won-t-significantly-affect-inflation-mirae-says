Gopal Agrawal, the Mumbai-based
chief investment officer at the local unit of  South Korea ’s
Mirae Asset Financial Group, comments on the outlook for Indian
stocks. He spoke in a phone interview in Mumbai.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index advanced 1.1 percent to
17,055.12 as of 12.54 p.m. local time.  On markets:  “The market had expected a rate hike of 25 basis points,
in contrast with what Brazil and  Russia  have done. As a result
there’s going to be a neutral stance on the market. The Finance
Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said yesterday that inflation peaked
in August and will start moderating over a period of time. If
this is true, then there will be a rally in the rate-sensitive
sectors.  On growth:  ‘‘Inflation is at an elevated level because of global cost
pressure, high commodity prices and wage inflation. So, as a
policy stance, the RBI stuck to its stance. There will be a
moderation in growth. However, inflation is affected by global
factors, so the rate hike will not significantly bring down
inflation.’’  On foreign institutional investment:  ‘‘FII flows aren’t entirely dependent on the rate hike.
They depend on global issues too. Because of short-term global
issues like the euro-zone debt crisis and the problems in the
 U.S. economy , there could be slowdown in foreign institutional
investors’ outflows. However, nobody will leave India because
it’s an attractive investment destination.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
