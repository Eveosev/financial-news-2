The  World Trade Organization  will
cut its forecast for 6.5 percent growth in global trade this
year as the economy cools and  Europe  battles a debt crisis,
Agence France-Presse reported, citing WTO chief Pascal Lamy.  Lamy, speaking today at the European American Press Club in
Paris, didnâ€™t provide a new figure, AFP said. The revised
estimate will be presented at a summit of Group of 20 leaders in
the French Mediterranean resort of Cannes in early November,
Lamy said.  The WTO in April forecast that global trade would expand
6.5 percent this year after growing a record 14.5 percent in
2010. Trade dropped 12 percent in 2009, the biggest contraction
since World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
