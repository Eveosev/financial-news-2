The U.S. East Coast may be cooler
than normal over the weekend and again at the end of September,
according to forecasters.  The eastern U.S. from the  Great Lakes  to the coast will be
cool through Sept. 20, according to forecasts by  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC, and MDA EarthSat
Weather.  The coast and  New England  will cool again from Sept. 26 to
Sept. 30, according to Rogers’s 11- to 15-day forecast. The cool
area may extend from the coast to the Appalachian Mountains,
according to MDA in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  The Rocky Mountains, western Great Plains and West Coast
will be warmer from Sept. 21 to Sept. 30, according to Rogers’
6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day forecasts. MDA calls for similar
warming, while also predicting that Maine and the Canadian
Maritimes will be warm in the Sept. 21 to Sept. 25 time frame.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and  power plants 
use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  There is a chance  Texas  may receive 0.75 inch to 1.25
inches of rain through next week, said Rogers, in Bethesda,
Maryland. The state is experiencing an exceptional drought, the
most extreme on the U.S. Drought Monitor’s five-step scale. The
dry conditions are expected to persist.  Houston Drought  Houston has received 11 inches (28 centimeters) of rain
this year, or 29.02 less than normal, according to the  National
Weather Service .  “2011 is about 70 percent complete and it is becoming
increasingly possible that 2011 will end as the driest year on
record for southeast Texas,” according to the weather service.  The least amount of rain Houston received in a single year
was 17.66 inches in 1917.  Along with the lack of rain, the state has also had some of
its highest temperatures. Dallas and  Fort Worth  have had 70 days
at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), the most ever,
according to the weather service. The previous record was 69
days in 1980.  To contact the reporter on this story:
