The rate at which London-based
banks say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose for
the sixth day, reaching the highest level since August 2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans rose to 0.35133 percent from 0.35022 percent yesterday,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest rate since Aug. 17, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 28.33 basis points as of 12:01 p.m. in London,
from 28.22 basis points yesterday. That’s the most since July
28, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
