Societe Generale (GLE)  SA’s private
banking unit is cooperating with the  U.S. Department of Justice 
as part of a case involving R. Allen Stanford.  SG Private Banking “is cooperating with the  Department of
Justice  with regard to the request which has been made,” Jolyon
Barthorpe, a Paris-based spokesman for the bank, said by phone
today. He declined to make any further comment.  The Department of Justice is investigating whether the
French bank helped facilitate Stanford’s alleged $7 billion
investment-fraud scheme by ignoring suspicious transactions, the
Wall Street Journal reported earlier today, without saying where
it got the information.  The U.S. government claims Stanford defrauded investors by
deceiving them about the liquidity and oversight of more than $7
billion in certificates of deposit issued by his Antigua-based
Stanford International Bank Ltd. Stanford denies all wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
