Belgium ’s caretaker Prime Minister
 Yves Leterme  was appointed deputy secretary-general of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Leterme, 50, will take up his new post before the end of
2011, according to a statement from the OECD today. He will stay
on as prime minister until Belgium forges a new government,
Dominique Dehaene, his spokeswoman, said on Sept. 14. The
country’s politicians have been struggling to form a coalition
since inconclusive elections in June 2010.  Leterme, who has held a number of ministerial posts in
Belgium’s federal government and the regional government of
Flanders, will be responsible for the OECD’s social and
governance portfolio, which includes education, labor and
employment, health, and small and medium-size enterprises,
according to the statement. The mandate is for a renewable two-
year term.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
