-- Hungarian wages rose more than
economists estimated in July because of special payments in the
public sector to compensate for income-tax changes.  The average monthly gross wage increased 6.2 percent from a
year earlier to 210,052 forint ($1,021), the  statistics office 
in Budapest said in a statement today. The median estimate of
six economists in a Bloomberg survey was 4.7 percent.  Public wages rose 12.9 percent and private salaries were up
3.4 percent from July 2010. Regular private wages excluding
bonuses, one of the  central bankâ€™s  closely watched indicators
for determining inflation expectations, increased 4.1 percent in
July from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
