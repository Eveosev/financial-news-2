The Czech Republic’s equity index

power utility in the country, and Ausria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) 
fell.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slid 0.8 percent to 960 as of
9:42 a.m. in Prague, led by CEZ’s 2.5 percent drop to 748
koruna. The benchmark has lost 2.4 percent so far this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
