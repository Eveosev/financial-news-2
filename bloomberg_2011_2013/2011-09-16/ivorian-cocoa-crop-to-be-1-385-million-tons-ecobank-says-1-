The cocoa crop in  Ivory Coast , the
world’s largest grower, will fall from a record 1.5 million
metric tons to 1.385 million tons in the season starting next
month, according to Lome, Togo-based lender Ecobank
Transnational Inc.  About 1.414 million tons of  cocoa beans  were at ports by
Sept. 4, as production, which benefited from good weather and
maintenance, beat the previous record of 1.407 million tons set
in 2003-04, according to the bank report e-mailed today.  “Given that the country is unlikely to experience the same
ideal weather for a second consecutive season, Ecobank expects
production to remain broadly stable at 1.385 million tons in
2011-12,” Edward George, soft commodities specialist at the
bank in  London , wrote in the report.  Black pod disease in eastern cocoa regions remains a
concern, George said, adding good weather at the end of August
and the beginning of September helped this year’s crop.  The 2010-11 harvest benefited from “careful tending of
aging trees, improved spraying and ideal weather for much of the
season,” he said.  Cocoa supplies will remain “abundant” in the 2011-12
season after a global surplus of 325,000 tons in the current
crop year, Ecobank said. “We expect cocoa prices to soften
throughout the remainder of the year.”  Cocoa for December was little changed at 1,809 pounds
($2,861) a ton by 12:13 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Cocoa for
December delivery advanced $9, or 0.3 percent, to $2,800 a ton
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
