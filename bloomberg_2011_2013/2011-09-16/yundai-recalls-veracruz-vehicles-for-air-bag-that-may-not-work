Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  said it’s
recalling 205,233 Santa Fe and Veracruz sport-utility vehicles
in the U.S. because front air bags may not deploy when needed.  Hyundai, based in  Seoul , said the electrical parts used to
deploy air bags may not conduct current properly, causing them
to not work in a crash. The automaker announced the recall today
on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  website .  The recall includes 178,685 Santa Fes and 26,548
Veracruzes, Hyundai told the regulator in a Sept. 8 letter
posted on the website.  The company said it has received about 7,800 warranty
claims for air-bag defects in the vehicles and isn’t aware of
any accidents or injuries caused by it.  In the year model 2007-2008 SUVs being recalled, the clock
spring contact assembly for drivers’ front air bags may become
damaged, leading the air bag’s electrical circuit to experience
high resistance and potentially causing it to not deploy,
Hyundai told the regulator. If this happens, the air-bag warning
light on the instrument panel will turn on.  “Hyundai is voluntarily initiating this action to ensure
the safety and quality of vehicles and the continued
satisfaction of our customers,” Miles Johnson, a U.S.-based
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
