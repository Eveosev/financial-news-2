The dollar strengthened against
most of its peers before a report today that may show  consumer
confidence  rebounded from its lowest in more than two years,
curbing speculation the  U.S. economy  is slowing down.  The euro was set for its first weekly gain against the yen
in three weeks on prospects costs for dollar funding will drop
after the  European Central Bank  said it will lend U.S. currency
to euro-area banks. The yen weakened versus the greenback as
Asian stocks extended global gains in equities.  “We’re not expecting the U.S. economy to return to double
dip recession,” said  Thomas Averill , a director in Sydney at
Rochford Capital, a currency and interest-rate risk management
company. “There’s quite a solid base in dollar-yen.”  The dollar advanced to $1.3838 per euro as of 10:37 a.m. in
 Tokyo  from $1.3877 in New York yesterday. The U.S. currency
bought 76.83 yen from 76.70. The euro traded at 106.34 yen from
106.43 and has gained 0.3 percent since Sept. 9.  The dollar has risen 3.3 percent in the past month, the
best performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Preliminary data will show the Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan index of consumer sentiment rose to 57 this month
after falling to 55.7 in August, the least since November 2008,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
