Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX) , the U.S. coal
producer spun off from Peabody Energy Corp. in 2007, fell as
much as 9 percent after reporting third-quarter production will
be reduced by 450,000 tons and costs will be higher than
previously forecast.  Patriot fell $1.41, or 9.8 percent, to $12.92 at 11:23 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares have
dropped 26 percent this year before today.  Patriot closed a thermal-coal mine in West Virgina’s Big
Mountain complex after a roof collapse caused by a 5.8-magnitude
earthquake on Aug. 23, the St. Louis-based company said today in
a statement.  Costs-per-ton for the company’s Appalachian operations will
be “several dollars” higher than previous forecasts, the
company said. Longwall moves, which involve relocating heavy-
mining machinery, at Patriot’s Federal and Panther mines in  West
Virginia  took longer than planned, the company said. Patriot
Chief Financial Officer Mark Schroeder had estimated costs of
“mid-$70s” in the company’s July 26 earnings conference call.  Management Changes  Bennett K. Hatfield will join Patriot as chief operating
officer, the company said in a statement. Former COO Charles A.
Ebetino Jr. will become senior vice president of global strategy
and corporate development. Hatfield, 54, was formerly chief
executive officer of International Coal Group Inc. before that
company’s sale to Arch Coal Inc. in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
