The European Union should allow
additional supplies of sugar in the 27-nation bloc to ease
shortages during the 2011-12 season, the Committee of European
Sugar Users said.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, should
permit local producers to sell at least 550,000 metric tons more
of the sweetener within the region by November, the Brussels-
based  group  said in a statement e-mailed today. It also urged
the EC to allow additional imports of at least 550,000 tons at
zero duty by December.  Under EU rules, local producers can supply a limited amount
of sugar to the domestic market, and any surplus must be
exported or put to non-food use. The 2011-12 marketing season
starts next month.  “A predicted EU ‘bumper’ crop will do little to help the
situation,” the committee, or CIUS, said in the statement.
“The current quota system means this will not relieve any
market shortages.”  Europe ’s crop for the season starting Oct. 1 will be 30
million tons, the highest since 2005-06, Ratzeburg, Germany-
based researcher F.O. Licht GmbH said on Aug. 31.  CIUS also supported the temporary suspension of the 98
euro-a-ton ($135-a-ton) duty on sugar imports from a group of
countries including Brazil and  Australia , known as the CXL duty.
It said the measure is needed by October.  Market Signals  “These measures will send the right signals to the market
and ensure that sugar supply meets demand at the right time,”
the group said. “Establishing structural reform through
deregulation of the market is essential in the long term.”  Sugar shortages in the EU in the 2010-11 crop year led  the
commission to approve the sale of 500,000 tons of out-of-quota
sugar and 500,000 tons duty-free imports earlier this year. The
CXL duty was suspended between December 2010 and August and a
tender system to import sugar at reduced duty was implemented.  CIUS represents companies such as Coca-Cola Co.,  Kraft
Foods Inc. (KFT)  and Nestle SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
