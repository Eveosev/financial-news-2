Options traders pared bearish bets
on Indian equities after the country’s central bank increased
borrowing costs in line with estimates.  Prices for three-month puts to sell the 50-stock S&P CNX
Nifty Index fell 20 percent from 30.46 on Sept. 14, the highest
since January 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The India
VIX, which gauges the cost of buying protection against losses
in the Nifty, slid 7.6 percent to 28.45, the most since Aug. 29.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
8.25 percent from 8 percent, raising borrowing costs for a 12th
time since March 2010 to tackle the fastest inflation among the
so-called BRIC nation. Fourteen of 17 economists in a Bloomberg
survey predicted the decision and three expected no change.  “The rate hike and the RBI’s commentary was in line with
expectation,” Savio Shetty, an analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher
Pvt., said in a phone interview. “Traders are selling puts on
optimism the Nifty may cross 5,200.”  The Nifty gained 0.2 percent to 5,084.25, paring gains of
as much as 1.3 percent, at the 3:30 p.m. preliminary close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
