Bank of England Deputy Governor
 Charles Bean  said U.K. economic growth will improve next year as
inflation slows, the Sun  reported , citing an interview.  “There is light at the end of the tunnel,” Bean told the
London-based newspaper. “It’s a long tunnel, I won’t dispute
that. Even next year, if the squeeze in  household income  has
stopped, it still won’t be pretty strong growth. But it won’t be
as bad as this year.”  Bean said inflation, which accelerated to 4.5 percent in
August, will come down “in time for the Olympics” in London in
2012 as oil and petrol prices decline, the Sun reported.
Britons’ pay growth will also increase, the newspaper cited Bean
as saying.  While economic indicators in the past few months have been
“disappointing” and “the outlook is weaker now than it was,”
Bean said he didn’t think it was “appropriate” for the bank to
expand its 200 billion-pound ($315 billion) bond-purchase
program at its policy meeting in August, the Sun reported.  “We have done a considerable amount of work on looking at
the benefits” of so-called quantitative easing, he told the
newspaper. “If we need more stimulus, another dollop of QE
would be effective, but it all hinges on the outlook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
