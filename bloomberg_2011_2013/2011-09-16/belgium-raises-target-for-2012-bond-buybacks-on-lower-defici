Belgium  raised its target for
buybacks of bonds due next year by 2.19 billion euros to 4
billion euros as the 2011 budget deficit will be smaller than
originally estimated, the Brussels-based debt agency said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Belgium already bought back 2.55 billion euros of 2 percent
securities due in March 2012 as of Sept. 15, according to a
statement on its website.  The debt agency plans to sell an additional 4.67 billion
euros of bonds before the end of the year, for a total of 36
billion euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
