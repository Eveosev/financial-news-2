Israeli President  Shimon Peres  said
he hopes his country and Turkey will “find a solution” to
rising tensions between the two nations.  “Turkey is a country of difference,” Peres said today at
the Yalta European Strategy conference in Ukraine. “I respect
this difference. I am not going into personalities.”  Relations between the two deteriorated this month after
Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  demanded an apology
for the killing of Turkish activists on a flotilla headed to the
Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip last year, expelled the Israeli
ambassador, halted defense purchases and announced plans to send
more warships to the eastern Mediterranean. He also said he may
visit Gaza.  During his trip to  Egypt  on Sept. 13, Erdogan said that
Turks and Arabs have an “historic” chance to work together
toward a common future and help support a Palestinian bid for
statehood.  To contact the reporter on this story:
