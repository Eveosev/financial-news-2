Hungarian shares fell after the
government said it will increase the value-added  tax rate  and
denied a report it will water down its proposal for early
repayment of foreign-currency mortgages.  The benchmark BUX index of shares fell 0.1 percent to
16,779.45 as of the 5 p.m. end of trade in Budapest, after
rallying as much as 1 percent earlier today. OTP Bank Nyrt., the
country’s largest lender, rose 0.3 percent to 3,740 forint.  OTP fell 11 percent on Sept. 9 when Prime Minister  Viktor
Orban ’s Fidesz party proposed allowing repayments at exchange
rates 20 percent below prevailing levels, with banks shouldering
costs. The plan was criticized by the Hungarian Banking
Association, the European Commission and the Austrian
government. OTP rallied 2.3 percent earlier today after news
website Origo reported today that the Cabinet may restrict
eligibility to loans of less than 5 million forint ($24,000) or
10 million forint.  “I most categorically deny” media reports that say
participation in the plan may depend on the size of the loans,
government spokesman Andras Giro-Szasz said at a press
conference in Budapest today. The Cabinet plans to increase the
value-added tax rate to 27 percent from 25 percent, Economy
Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said at the same press conference. He
also said the government cut its economic growth forecast for
next year.  The forint depreciated 0.3 percent against the euro to
285.8, extending its losses this week to 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
