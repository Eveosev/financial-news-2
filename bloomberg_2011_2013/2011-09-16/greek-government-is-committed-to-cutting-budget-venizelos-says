The Greek government is committed
to reducing spending and overhauling the economy, Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos said as the country seeks to win
more aid.  “It is of great importance to reduce the public sector, to
reduce public expenditure,” Venizelos told reporters today in
Wroclaw,  Poland  during a meeting with his European Union
counterparts. “Of great importance are the structural changes
that we have started to implement and that must accelerate.”  Greece  is seeking to qualify in coming weeks for a sixth
disbursement of aid under last year’s 110 billion-euro ($152
billion) rescue from the euro area and  International Monetary
Fund . Prime Minister George Papandreou’s government also wants
to benefit from a planned second aid package of 159 billion
euros approved by euro-area leaders on July 21.  “Now is the moment of changes,” Venizelos said. “If we
don’t do this now, we will have to do it later in a dramatic
way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
