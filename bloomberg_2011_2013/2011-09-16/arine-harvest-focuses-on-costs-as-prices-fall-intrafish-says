Marine Harvest ASA (MHG)  is focusing on
cost cuts amid falling salmon prices,  Intrafish  reported, citing
documents published on the Oslo-based company’s intranet.  Joergen Christiansen, a company spokesman, confirmed the
content of the article to Bloomberg News via e-mail. Marine
Harvest wants to postpone investments where possible, while
Chief Executive Officer Alf-Hege Aarskog plans to cut his own
salary by 10 percent, Intrafish reported.  “Reduced capex was communicated to the market in the
second-quarter presentation in late July, and cost cutting has
been frequently communicated since the capital markets day,”
Christiansen said in his e-mail.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
