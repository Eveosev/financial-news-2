Russian banks may need to pay as
much as 6 percent to borrow overnight from other lenders by the
end of September because of concern that interbank rates will
rise in  Europe ,  Alfa Bank  said.  “Fears of a European interbank collapse are causing
concerns over foreign banks’ abilities to refinance Russian
foreign debt and are fueling pressure on the ruble exchange
rate,” Natalia Orlova and Dmitry Dolgin, analysts at Russia’s
largest private lender, said today in an e-mailed research note.  September tax payments may reach 1.7 trillion rubles ($55.6
billion), helping push overnight banks rates to 5.5 percent to 6
percent by the month’s end, they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
