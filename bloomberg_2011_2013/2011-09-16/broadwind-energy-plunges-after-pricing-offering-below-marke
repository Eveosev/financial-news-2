Broadwind Energy Inc. (BWEN) , a U.S. wind-
turbine component maker, fell to a six-year low after it said it
would sell additional shares below yesterday’s market value.  Broadwind dropped 9 cents, or 16 percent, to 45 cents in
 Nasdaq  Stock Market trading, the lowest price since August 2005.
Shares of the Naperville, Illinois-based company have plummeted
81 percent this year.  Broadwind Energy is selling 32.5 million shares at 40 cents
each, the company said today in a statement. It’s the second
time the company has sold shares since listing on the Nasdaq in
April 2009. The company will use the $11.7 million generated by
the sale for general corporate purposes, it said. Lazard Capital
Markets LLC is managing the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
