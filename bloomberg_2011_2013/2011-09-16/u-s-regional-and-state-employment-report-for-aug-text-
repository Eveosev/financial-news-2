The following is the text of the
U.S. state employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  REGIONAL AND STATE EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT -- AUGUST 2011  Regional and state unemployment rates were generally little
changed in August. Twenty-six states and the  District of
Columbia  reported unemployment rate increases, 12 states
recorded rate decreases, and 12 states had no rate change, the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Thirty-seven
states registered unemployment rate decreases from a year
earlier, 11 states and the District of Columbia had increases,
and 2 states experienced no change. The national jobless rate
was unchanged at 9.1 percent but was 0.5 percentage point lower
than a year earlier.  In August, nonfarm payroll employment decreased in 30 states and
the District of Columbia and increased in 20 states. The largest
over-the-month decrease in employment occurred in New York (-
22,700), followed by  Georgia  (-18,200) and the District of
Columbia (-12,500). The largest over-the-month increase in
employment occurred in  Minnesota  (+28,400), followed by  North
Carolina  (+16,500),  Arizona  (+15,400), and Florida (+9,900). The
District of Columbia experienced the largest over-the-month

employment (+1.1 percent), followed by Arizona (+0.6 percent)
and Idaho and Vermont (+0.5 percent each). Over the year,
nonfarm employment increased in 44 states and the District of

rate, 8.2 percent. Over the month, the Midwest was the only
region to experience a statistically significant jobless rate
change (+0.2 percentage point). Two of the regions had
significant rate changes from a year earlier, both decreases:
the Midwest (-0.5 percentage point) and West (-0.4 point).  Among the nine geographic divisions, the Pacific continued to
report the highest jobless rate, 11.2 percent in August. The
West North Central again registered the lowest rate, 6.9 percent.
Over the month, the East North Central was the only division to
experience a statistically significant unemployment rate change
(+0.2 percentage point). The East North Central also recorded
the only significant rate change among divisions over the year

the states, 13.4 percent in August.  California  posted the next

total, 25 states reported jobless rates significantly lower than
the U.S. figure of 9.1 percent, 8 states and the District of
Columbia had measurably higher rates, and 17 states had rates
that were not appreciably different from that of the nation.  Seven states experienced statistically significant over-the-
month unemployment rate increases in August. Illinois and
 Pennsylvania  reported the largest of these (+0.4 percentage
point each), followed by North Carolina (+0.3 point); Maryland,
North Dakota, and  Virginia  (+0.2 point each); and Georgia (+0.1
point). The District of Columbia also posted a significant over-
the-month rate increase (+0.3 percentage point). The remaining
43 states recorded jobless rates that were not measurably
different from those of a month earlier, though some had changes
that were at least as large numerically as the significant
changes.  New Mexico  registered the largest jobless rate decrease from
August 2010 (-1.9 percentage points). Four additional states
reported smaller but also statistically significant decreases
over the year: Oklahoma (-1.4 percentage points), Indiana (-1.3
points), Oregon (-1.1 points), and  Florida  (-0.9 point). The
