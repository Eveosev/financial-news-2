U.S. industrial prices rose 0.18
percent today, according to the JOC-ECRI industrial prices daily
report. The smoothed annualized growth rate, which is designed
to minimize fluctuations, fell 4.4 percent.  The index anticipates trends in companiesâ€™ pricing power
and is thought to be a leading indicator of corporate profits
and consumer price changes.  SOURCE:  JOC-ECRI  To contact the reporter on this story:
