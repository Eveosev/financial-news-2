OAO Russian Railways lifted the ban
for rail shipments of grain to the terminal, owned by the state
trader United Grain Co., with some limitations on shipments
still on place.  The so-called railroad congestion was lifted yesterday,
Russian Railways said in e-mailed statement today, citing
reduced number of freight cars loaded with grains waiting near
the terminal.  The ban for the rail shipments to the second grain terminal
in the city of Norvorossiysk was lifted Sept. 7. As many as
1,390 cars loaded with grains are waiting in line by both
terminals in Novorossiysk, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
