The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
advanced for a fourth day, rising 53.3, or 0.2 percent, to
31,051.35 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, taking the week’s
gains to 2 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.        Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , closed at a
six-week high, gaining 2 rand, or 0.7 percent, to 294.50 rand.
Diamond demand at the retail level remains “strong,” said
Philippe Mellier, chief executive officer of  De Beers , in which
Anglo American has a 45 percent stake.        AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, gained to an almost seven-month high, gaining 7.20
rand, or 2.1 percent, to 344.40 rand. Gold rose the first time
in three days in  New York  on renewed concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will threaten economies, boosting demand for a haven.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), the continent’s third-
largest gold company, climbed the most in almost a month, adding
3.79 rand, or 4.1 percent, to 96.80 rand. Separately, the miner
was raised to “overweight” from “neutral” at HSBC Holdings
Plc by equity analyst Sabrina Grandchamps, with a price estimate
of $17.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  , the fourth-biggest
platinum miner, rose the most in more than a week, adding 1.61
rand, or 6.2 percent, to 27.49 rand. The company was raised to
“overweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase & Co. by
equity analyst Steve Shepherd, with a 12-month price estimate of
34.10 rand.  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  , a coal miner, fell for a
third day, slipping 2.26 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 191.50 rand.
Mediated wage talks between  South Africa ’s National Union of
Mineworkers and Exxaro and  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)   failed to secure an agreement, the labor union said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Impala dropped 1.57 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 167.67 rand.  Grindrod Ltd. (GND)  , Africa’s biggest shipping company,
closed at its highest in more than five months, advancing 26
cents, or 1.8 percent, to 15.14 rand.  Remgro Ltd. (REM)  , a
diversified investment holding company, is in talks to buy a
stake in Grindrod, Finweek magazine reported, without saying how
it got the information.        Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  , an iron ore-producer that
exports almost 60 percent of its metal to  China , fell for the
first day in four, dropping 6.04 rand, or 1.3 percent, to 475
rand. China iron-ore inventories are near record levels, above
98 million metric tons, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
