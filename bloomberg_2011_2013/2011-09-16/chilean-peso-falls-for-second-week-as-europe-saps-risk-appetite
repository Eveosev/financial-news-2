Chile ’s peso fell, and is headed to
a second straight weekly decline, as concern that Europe’s debt
crisis is deepening eroded demand for riskier, emerging-market
assets.  The peso slumped 0.6 percent to a five-month-low of 480.95
per U.S. dollar at 11:13 a.m. New York time, from 478.14
yesterday. The currency has lost 2.4 percent this week.  European finance ministers ruled out efforts to prop up the
faltering economy and gave no indication of providing aid for
lenders to go along with yesterday’s liquidity lifeline from the
 European Central Bank .  “We’ve been seeing depreciative pressure from abroad,
mainly from the euro zone,”  Osvaldo Cruz , an economist at Banco
de Credito e Inversiones, said today by telephone from Santiago.
Foreigners have been unwinding positions, he said.  Chile’s central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 5.25 percent yesterday for the third straight month
and indicated that a tight labor market may prevent it from
following Brazil and cutting rates next month.  Three-month interest rate swaps, which reflect traders’
views of borrowing costs, fell 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.21 percent.  “It’s improbable that the peso devalues much more going
forward,” said Andres de la Cerda, a trader at Bice Inversiones
in Santiago. “Through the end of the year it should remain
within the range of 460-480.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
