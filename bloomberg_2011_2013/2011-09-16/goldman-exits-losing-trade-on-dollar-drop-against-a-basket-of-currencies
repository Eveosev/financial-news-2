Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said it
exited a money losing bet that the dollar would weaken against a
basket of currencies after turmoil in European markets and
broader  risk aversion  added to the greenback’s refuge appeal.   The trade was “stopped out” after a loss of 2.3 percent,
the New York-based securities firm said in a note today. On Aug.
10, Goldman recommended betting against the dollar with a basket
of currencies comprised of the New Zealand dollar, Russian
ruble, Swedish krona, South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit and
Chilean peso.   To contact the reporter on this story:
