European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said inflation
expectations in the 17-nation euro region are well anchored in
line with the ECB’s limit of just under 2 percent.  “All surveys show that inflation is well-anchored close to
2 percent,” Gonzalez-Paramo told reporters in Sofia today.
Inflation “is on the way down,” he added. “We assess the
risks to price stability to be balanced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
