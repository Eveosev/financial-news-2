Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  will announce
pricing next week for its Blockbuster streaming-movie service,
which will compete with  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , a person with knowledge of
the plan said.  The second-largest U.S. satellite-TV company will hold a
press conference on Sept. 23 to announce subscription costs and
other details for the service, according to the person, who
declined to be identified because the plan isn’t public.  Dish is unveiling the service next month to take advantage
of Netflix’s recent price increases, said the person. Englewood,
Colorado-based Dish, which acquired most of Blockbuster Inc.’s
assets in April for $320 million, aims to boost its subscribers
by offering the online service with its pay-TV packages, said
the person. Non-Dish customers who only want Blockbuster’s
offering will eventually be able to do so, the person said.  Aaron Johnson, a spokesman for Dish, declined to comment.  Netflix, based in  Los Gatos ,  California , began charging
separate fees for mail-order and streaming videos, effectively
raising the price by 60 percent to $15.98 for customers who want
both options.  Netflix fell the most in more than three years yesterday
after cutting its U.S. subscriber forecast, following the price
increase. The shares declined $14.06, or 8.3 percent, to $155.19
at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, after
dropping 19 percent yesterday.  Dish rose 47 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $26.29. The shares
have gained 34 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
