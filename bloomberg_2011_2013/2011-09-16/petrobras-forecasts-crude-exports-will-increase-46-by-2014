Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil â€™s
state-run oil producer, is forecasting exports will rise 46
percent by 2014 and more than triple by 2020.  Daily crude shipments will increase to 734,000 barrels in
three years and reach 1.735 million by the end of the decade,
according to a presentation by Leoncio Ackstein, a Petrobras
marketing official, at a conference yesterday in Singapore. The
company expects to export 505,000 barrels each day this year,
the slides showed.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company said production of its 11
export grades of crude may reach 849,000 barrels a day in 2012,
the company said. About 534,000 barrels of that will be sent to
overseas buyers daily.  Petrobras expects total oil output to climb to 2.8 million
barrels a day in 2014 and gain further to 4.91 million daily
barrels in 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
