Colombia’s peso rose for a second
day on speculation inflows into the South American country will
rise after the  European Central Bank  and international policy
makers coordinated to lend dollars to euro-area banks.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,820.10 per dollar at
10:44 a.m. New York time, from 1,821 yesterday. The peso is up
4.8 percent this year, the second-best performance after the
Czech koruna among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “Part of that liquidity will find its way to emerging
markets either through direct or portfolio investment,” said
Daniel Velandia, the head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Corrveal SA. “The news has also brought tranquility to the
external market, leading to gains in U.S. stocks and some
appetite for risk.”  In a bid to help tame the European debt crisis, the ECB
said yesterday that in coordination with the U.S. Federal
Reserve, the  Bank of England , the  Bank of Japan  and the  Swiss
National Bank  it will make U.S. dollar loans with a maturity of
about three months.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent benchmark bonds due in
July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.34 percent. The bond’s price rose 0.183 centavo to 121.611
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
