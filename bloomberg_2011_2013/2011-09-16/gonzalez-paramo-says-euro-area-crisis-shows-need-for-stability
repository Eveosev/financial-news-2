European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said the region’s
fiscal crisis has shown the need for embarking on sound fiscal
policies before adopting the euro.  “The challenges the euro area is facing illustrate the
need for sustainable convergence stability,” Gonzalez-Paramo
said in a speech in Sofia today. While “Bulgaria is expected to
adopt the euro at some time in the future,” the country “must
ensure” convergence criteria are met in a “sustainable”
fashion, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
