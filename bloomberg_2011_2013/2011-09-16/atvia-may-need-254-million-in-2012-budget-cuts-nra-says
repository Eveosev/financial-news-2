Latvia may need to find as much as
130 million lati ($254 million) in savings in the 2012 budget,
exceeding a previous government estimate,  Neatkariga Rita Avize 
reported, citing Central Bank Governor Ilmars Rimsevics.  The government earlier estimated that the figure could be
below 100 million lati, now it could be between 100 million lati
and 130 million lati, Rimsevics said, according to Neatkariga.
Rimsevics said turmoil in the Eurozone could lead to a slowdown
in growth rates for exports, necessitating a need for more
budget cuts, the Riga-based newspaper reported.  Latvia, which plans to adopt the euro in 2014, could
consider measures such as a cut in the value-added tax and a
reduction in excise taxes in the future should inflation
accelerate and threaten the countryâ€™s goal to switch currencies,
Rimsevics said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
