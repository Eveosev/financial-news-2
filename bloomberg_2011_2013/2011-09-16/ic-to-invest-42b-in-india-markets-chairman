Life Insurance  Corp. of India, the
country’s biggest, will maintain its plan to invest 2 trillion
rupees ($42 billion) in stocks and bonds this fiscal year even
as markets stay volatile, Chairman D.K. Mehrotra said.  “We did find some good opportunities in the market during
the recent declines,” he said in an interview to Bloomberg UTV
today. The Mumbai-based insurer invested 150 billion rupees in
local equities between April and August, and may add another 300
billion rupees by March 31, Mehrotra said.  The BSE India Sensitive Index has tumbled 17 percent this
year, the most in Asia, amid concerns a slowdown in the global
economy will erode earnings already threatened by interest-rate
increases. The gauge lost 8.4 percent last month, the worst
August in at least a decade, on signs  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis is spreading and after  Standard & Poor’s  cut its rating
on U.S. credit.  Life Insurance, which manages more money than all Indian
 mutual funds  combined, invested 1.85 trillion rupees in the
markets in the year ended March 31, of which 430 billion rupees
was in equities, Mehrotra told Bloomberg UTV on June 3.  Indian mutual funds managed 7.47 trillion rupees in stocks
and bonds at the end of June, according to the Association of
Mutual Funds in India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
