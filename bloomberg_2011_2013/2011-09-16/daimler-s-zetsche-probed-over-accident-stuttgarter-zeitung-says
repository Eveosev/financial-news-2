Daimler AG (DAI)  Chief Executive Officer
Dieter Zetsche faces an involuntary manslaughter probe over the
death of an engineer at a test track in northern  Germany ,
Stuttgarter Zeitung reported.  A 27-year old-Daimler engineer died at a test track in
Papenburg following an accident caused by an intern, the
newspaper said. The intern was convicted over the issue.  The driver’s parents say Daimler is also responsible
because it didn’t train the intern before putting him in a fast
car. They asked prosecutors in August to look into the issue,
Stuttgarter Zeitung reported, citing prosecutor’s office
spokesman Alexander Retemeyer. Retemeyer didn’t answer the phone
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  Daimler sees the investigation as a “mere formality” and
expects the probe to be dismissed after a previous court
decision found no fault by the company, Ute Vellberg, a
spokeswoman for the Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker said by
phone to Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
