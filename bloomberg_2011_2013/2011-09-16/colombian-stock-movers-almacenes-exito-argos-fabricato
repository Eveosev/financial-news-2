based company began offering 114.27 million shares at 21,900
pesos each on Sept. 5 in a sale that will end Sept. 23. The

Nicolas Bernal, analyst at brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA.  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  , Colombia’s biggest cement
maker, rose 0.9 percent to 11,300 pesos. Colombia granted
building permits for 1.8 million square meters of construction
in July, a 23.5 percent increase from a year ago, according to
the website of the country’s national statistics agency.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s biggest textile maker,
held at 73.5 pesos after earlier rising as much as 1.4 percent.
Chief Executive Officer Juan Carlos Cadavid told the daily
Republica today that bringing the company out of bankruptcy
proceedings will be a main goal. Cadavid was the company’s
interim head until the board approved him as CEO, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday.  The company said it has paid off all but 3.3 billion pesos
($1.8 million), or 1 percent of its total debt, when it began
restructuring under the country’s bankruptcy law in 2000,
according to a regulatory filing Aug. 31.  “The company ought to have the capital and capacity to pay
off that debt, they’re simply weighing at what moment it will be
most convenient to do so,” said Alejandro Isaza, analyst at
Interbolsa SA,  Colombia ’s biggest brokerage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
