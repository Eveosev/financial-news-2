U.S. Open winner  Novak Djokovic 
of  Serbia  withdrew from the  Davis Cup  semifinals because of
injury, and his defending-champion teammates lost the first two
singles matches today against Argentina.  Djokovic, who won his third Grand Slam tennis title of the
season at the Open four days ago in  New York , pulled out because
of “lower back and rib pain,” according to a  statement 
on his website. He was replaced by Viktor Troicki, who lost 6-4,
4-6, 6-2, 6-3 to David Nalbandian in Belgrade.  Juan Martin del Potro then defeated Janko Tipsarevic 7-5,
6-3, 6-4 to leave Argentina one match from clinching the best-
of-five series that continues tomorrow with doubles. Two more
singles matches are scheduled for the following day.  Djokovic, the top-ranked player on the ATP World Tour,
helped Serbia win its first Davis Cup in December. He went on to
win 41 consecutive matches this season, only to be stopped by
third-ranked  Roger Federer  of Switzerland in the semifinals of
the French Open in June. Djokovic also won Wimbledon and the
Australian Open this year.  Second-ranked Rafael Nadal, who was dethroned as U.S. Open
champion by Djokovic in four sets in the final, today secured
the first point for host Spain in its Davis Cup semifinal
against France. He beat 15th-ranked Richard Gasquet, 6-3, 6-0,
6-1.  David Ferrer then gave Spain a 2-0 lead with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-
1 win against Gilles Simon in Cordoba, Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
