SJB National Bank, formed in 2009
by executives of Related Cos. to purchase failed U.S. lenders,
has returned some money to investors after being unable to find
an attractive deal, Related President Jeff Blau said.  “We believed there was going to be a lot of opportunities
to buy through the FDIC failed bank program,” Blau said in an
interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with
Betty Liu. “What we found is that opportunity did not
materialize.”  Many banks were taken over by larger regional lenders
before failing, Blau said. SJB didn’t see more opportunity for
deals with  interest rates  near record lows and a relatively
small difference betweens short and long-term debt yields
reducing profitability for lenders.  SJB considered purchasing the U.S. online banking unit of
Amsterdam-based  ING Groep NV (INGA) , Blau said.  Capital One Financial
Corp. (COF)  agreed in June to buy the business for $9 billion, gaining
deposits and access to 7 million customers. The  Federal Reserve 
said last month it would hold public hearings to examine the
deal’s benefits and risks to the U.S. banking system.  “It’s an acquisition we looked at seriously, we spent a
lot of time on it,” Blau said. “We’re disappointed because I
think that the future of banking today is really going to be
away from the branch system and more toward an online network.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
