Irish finance minister  Michael
Noonan  a reduction in the country’s bailout loans may generate
savings to the state of up to ten billion euros over the period
of the loans.  Noonan, speaking to reporters in Wroclaw,  Poland  today,
said that the state expects to save about 800 million to 900
million euros next year as part of the deal.  Noonan said he now wants to examine the terms of the loans,
including possibly availing of the terms to  extend the debt.
The government won’t opt “automatically” for an extension,
though it will look for a “pattern of repayments that don’t
stack” up against the it, he said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
