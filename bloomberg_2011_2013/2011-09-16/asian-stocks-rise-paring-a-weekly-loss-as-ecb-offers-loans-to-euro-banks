Asian stocks rose, paring the
regional benchmark index’s decline this week, after the  European
Central Bank  and international policy makers coordinated to lend
euro-area banks U.S. dollars, increasing 
confidence the region’s debt crisis may be contained.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.1 percent to 119.17 as
of 9:12 a.m. in Tokyo. All 10 industry groups on the measure
rose, with about 14 stocks advancing for each that felld.  The index this week fell to its lowest level since Aug. 25,
2010, dragging the measure towards its second weekly loss.
Concern the global economy was slipping back into a recession
amid a worsening European-debt crisis and slowing U.S. growth 
triggered a 16 percent plunge in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
between this year’s high on May 2 and yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
