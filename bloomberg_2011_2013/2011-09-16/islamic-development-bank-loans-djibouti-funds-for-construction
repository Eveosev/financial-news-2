The  Islamic Development Bank  loaned
Djibouti $8.5 million to help build a residential and commercial
center in Djibouti City, the capital.  A foundation stone for the project, which will include a
shopping mall, office space and three residential buildings, was
laid yesterday by President Ismail Guelleh and Ahmed Mohamed Ali, president of the Islamic Development Bank.  The bank also provided a $300,000 grant to the Horn of
Africa nation to help alleviate the effects of a drought in the
region, Simon Mibrathu, secretary general at the Economy and
Finance Ministry, told reporters yesterday.  Djibouti, about the size of Massachusetts, has a $982
million economy that relies on services related to its strategic
location on the  Red Sea , one of the worldâ€™s busiest shipping
lanes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
