Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, the national
carrier known as  Turkish Airlines , is aiming for a profit this
year even after making a loss in the first half, chief executive
Temel Kotil said.  Turkish Airlines will meet this year’s target of 32.9
million passengers, with more international passengers, and
expects sales of $7.2 billion in 2011, Kotil said in an
interview in Istanbul today.  The company’s performance was hurt by poor ground handling
at Istanbul’s main Ataturk airport, Kotil said. The weak lira
also impacted its balance sheet negatively, he said.  A fall in August passengers was due to the religious
Ramadan holiday, he said.  Turkish Airlines rose 3 kurus, or 1.1 percent, to 2.81
liras at 5:30 p.m. in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
