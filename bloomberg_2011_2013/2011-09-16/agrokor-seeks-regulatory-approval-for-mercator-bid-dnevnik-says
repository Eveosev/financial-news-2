Croatia â€™s Agrokor d.d. asked the
Slovenian competition protection office to approve its purchase
of  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., Dnevnik newspaper  reported 
without saying where it obtained the information.  Agrokor has the backing of large banks in  Europe , including
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Societe Generale SA,
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and others, to acquire the Slovenian
retailer with non-binding bids due by Oct. 5, the Ljubljana-
based newspaper said.  The sale of Mercator to Agrokor, which offered the best bid
for a 23 percent stake, was blocked by the Slovenian regulator
in April.  Slovenian banks last month appointed ING Bank NV to advise
on the sale of just above 50 percent of Mercator with the
process likely to be completed by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
