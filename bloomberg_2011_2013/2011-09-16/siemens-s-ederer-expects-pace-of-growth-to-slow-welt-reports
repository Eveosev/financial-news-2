Siemens AG (SIE)  board member Brigitte Ederer said growth will slow from the pace the German
engineering company has seen in the last 1 1/2 years,  Welt
reported , citing an interview with the manager.  An employment agreement guaranteeing German production
sites and jobs is not in danger at the moment, Ederer said,
according to the German newspaper. Siemens is still hiring and
added 4,500 jobs in the first nine months, Ederer told Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
