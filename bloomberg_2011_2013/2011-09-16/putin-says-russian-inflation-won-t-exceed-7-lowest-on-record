Russia’s inflation probably won’t
exceed 7 percent this year, the lowest since the  Soviet Union 
collapsed in 1991, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said at a
conference in the Black Sea resort of Sochi today.  The government won’t increase the tax burden on businesses,
Putin said, adding that extra capital must be found by spending
budget funds more efficiently.  To contact the reporter on this story:
