Holger Schmieding, chief economist
at Joh. Berenberg Gossler & Co in  London , forecast a “mini
recession” in  Germany  starting at the end of 2011 and lasting
until early the following year.  “Instead of temporary stagnation, we now expect a German
mini-recession in late 2011 and early 2012 followed by a V-
shaped rebound thereafter,” Schmieding said in an e-mailed note
to clients today."Despite a brief cyclical setback, Germany’s
long-term fundamentals remain excellent.’’  Schmieding also forecast one ECB interest rate cut early in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
