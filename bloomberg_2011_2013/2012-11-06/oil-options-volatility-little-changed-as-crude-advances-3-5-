Crude oil options volatility was
little changed after underlying futures rose 3.5 percent when
commodities rallied and the dollar weakened as Americans
selected a president.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30 percent on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as of 3:40 p.m., down from 30.11 percent
yesterday.  January-delivery crude oil rose $3.03 to settle at $89.17 a
barrel on the Nymex.  The ICE Futures’ dollar index, which tracks the currency
against the euro, the yen and currencies of four other major
U.S. trading partners, fell 0.14 percent at 3:51 p.m. in New
York. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of commodities rose 2.3
percent with 22 of 24 materials rising.  “Everything is getting caught in a risk-on play before the
election,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $85 puts, which slid 84 cents to 40 cents on volume of
2,937 lots at 3:55 p.m. January $110 calls were the second-most
active, with 2,723 lots exchanged as they increased 8 cents to
17 cents.  Bets that prices would rose, or calls, accounted for 52
percent of the 63,856 lots traded.  Real-Time Data  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
