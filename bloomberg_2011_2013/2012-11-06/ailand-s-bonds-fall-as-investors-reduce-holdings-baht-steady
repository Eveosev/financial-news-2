Thailand’s government bonds declined
after international investors reduced their holdings amid
speculation the global economy is recovering. The baht was
steady before today’s U.S. presidential election.  The five-year yield rebounded from its lowest level since
January after a report yesterday showed  service industries  in
the U.S. kept growing in October. Global funds sold $45.8
million more of Thai sovereign notes than they bought yesterday
while pouring a net $16.6 million into the stock market,
according to data from the Thai  Bond Market  Association and the
stock  exchange .  “Recent data are indicating that global economic
conditions are stabilizing, improving investors’ risk
sentiment,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for  Economic Research  in Tokyo. “The local bond market
may be seeing just a correction after the recent decline in
yields.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.01 percent as of
8:18 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate reached 3.005 percent yesterday, the lowest level since
Jan. 10.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index was 54.2 last month, compared with 55.1 in September, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said yesterday. A measure above 50
signals expansion in industries that account for almost 90
percent of the economy. The October figure exceeded the third-
quarter average.  U.S. voters decide today between giving President  Barack
Obama  another four years in office or replacing him with
Republican challenger  Mitt Romney . Obama led Romney 50 percent
to 47 percent in a survey of 2,345 likely voters conducted Nov.
1-4 by ABC News and the Washington Post.  The baht was unchanged at 30.81 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
steady at 4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
