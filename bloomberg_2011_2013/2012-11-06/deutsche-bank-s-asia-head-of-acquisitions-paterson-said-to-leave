Gordon Paterson, who ran  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ’s mergers advisory team in the Asia-Pacific region
outside Japan, has left after more than five years with Europe’s
biggest bank, two people familiar with the matter said.  Paterson left the  Frankfurt-based bank  recently, one of the
people said, asking not to be identified because his departure
hasn’t been announced. Deutsche Bank has yet to announce a
replacement for the executive.  A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, who asked not to be
identified, declined to comment. Paterson didn’t respond to
calls to his mobile phone seeking comment.  Paterson, who has a master’s degree in business
administration from the University of Western Ontario, joined
Deutsche Bank in May 2007 from  Citigroup Inc. (C) , where he’d worked
since 2002.  Deutsche Bank ranks 6th in advising on mergers and
acquisitions in the Asia-Pacific region excluding  Japan  this
year, up from No. 8 in the same period in 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
