New York Mets outfielder  Lucas Duda 
is expected to be ready for spring training in February after
breaking his wrist while moving furniture, the team said.  Duda, who bats left-handed and throws with his right,
fractured his right wrist last month at his apartment in
Southern California and had surgery yesterday at the Hospital
for Special Surgery in New York, the Mets said in an e-mailed
news release.  The 26-year-old Duda batted .239 with 15 home runs and 57
runs batted in last season, playing in 121 games. In three years
in Major League Baseball, all with the Mets, he has a .256
batting average with 29 homers and 120 RBI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
