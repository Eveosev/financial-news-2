Ethanol followed gasoline higher
after the dollar weakened as U.S. voters headed to the polls
today to pick a president and as thin margins forced companies
to reduce output of the biofuel.  Prices gained after New Energy Corp. said it idled its 100
million-gallon-a-year plant in South Bend,  Indiana , following
similar moves by other companies, including Valero Energy Corp.
U.S. stocks and commodities, such as gasoline, jumped as voters
decide whether to return  Barack Obama , a Democrat, as president
or elect his challenger,  Mitt Romney , a Republican.  “All eyes were on today’s election as the results will
shape the next four years of policy,” SCB & Associates LLC in
Chicago wrote in a report to clients. “Energy futures were
higher for the second straight day from gains on Wall Street and
a weakening dollar as investors wait on U.S. election results.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 1.3 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.345 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 6.5 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York
at $2.465 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.37 and in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.45, data compiled by Bloomberg show, while the fuel on the
West Coast declined 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.52 a gallon.  Corn for December delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $7.41 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 35 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline Rises  Gasoline for December delivery jumped 7.87 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.6989 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel increased to 35.39
cents from 31.02 cents Nov. 2. Gasoline traded at a premium of
99.8 cents to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  The  dollar  sank 0.14 percent against the euro.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, sank 3.3 percent to 3.67 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
