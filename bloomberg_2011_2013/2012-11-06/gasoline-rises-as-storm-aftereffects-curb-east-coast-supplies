Gasoline rose on speculation that
East Coast stockpiles of the motor fuel will remain constrained
as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  said its New Jersey refinery will be shut as long
as three weeks to recover from  Hurricane Sandy .  Futures climbed a second day as Phillips’s 238,000-barrel-
a-day Bayway plant, which supplies gasoline to the  New York 
Harbor market, remains shut to repair equipment damaged by
flooding. U.S. gasoline inventories probably fell 1.5 million
barrels in the week ended Nov. 2, according to the median
estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “Bayway produces approximately 145,000 barrels a day of
gasoline, which is impacting supplies throughout the metro
area,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston. “As we go forward, demand will pick up as terminal
and service station infrastructure is restored.”  Gasoline for December delivery rose 4.33 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.6635 a gallon at 9:41 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have jumped 3.5 percent in two days.  Twenty-one petroleum tankers, five carrying gasoline and
five transporting naphtha, are scheduled to arrive in New York
Harbor in the next four days, according to the Coast Guard.  Sixty to 65 percent of gas stations are open in  New York
City ,  Michael Green , a Washington-based spokesman for AAA, said
in an e-mail yesterday. The figure is 55 percent to 60 percent
in New Jersey and 50 percent to 55 percent on Long Island.  Other Refineries  Valero Energy Corp. said yesterday that the fluid catalytic
cracker at its 310,000-barrel-a-day refinery in  Port Arthur ,
Texas, was shut following a Nov. 3 fire. In the Midwest, BP Plc
shut the largest crude unit at its 420,000-barrel-a-day Whiting,
Indiana, refinery, the biggest plant serving the Chicago market.  “People are looking past the demand destruction we’ve seen
up there because of the storm,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president
of research at PFGBest in Chicago. “They’re looking at refinery
outages and the expectation that people will start consuming gas
again.”  Heating oil  for December delivery rose 0.95 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.9924 a gallon on the exchange. Inventories of
distillates, including diesel and heating oil, declined 1.63
million barrels last week, according to the survey.  The average nationwide price for  regular gasoline  at the
pump slipped 0.7 cent to $3.463 a gallon yesterday, AAA, the
largest U.S. motoring organization, said today on its website.
Prices have fallen every day since Oct. 10, sliding 35.5 cents
to the lowest since July 20. The pump price reached a 2012 high
of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
