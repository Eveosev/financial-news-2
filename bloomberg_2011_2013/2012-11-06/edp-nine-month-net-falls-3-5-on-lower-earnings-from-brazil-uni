EDP-Energias de Portugal SA , the
country’s biggest utility, said nine-month profit fell 3.5
percent on lower earnings from its Brazilian unit.  Net income dropped to 795 million euros ($1.02 billion)
from 824 million euros a year earlier, Lisbon-based  EDP (EDP)  said
today in a regulatory filing. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization slipped 1.2 percent to 2.74
billion euros, with the Brazilian unit’s contribution to Ebitda
declining 28 percent.  The former Portuguese power monopoly is spending on new
dams and wind turbines in  Europe  and  Brazil  to rely less on oil
and coal and tap state incentives for alternative energy. EDP
plans to invest 2.1 billion euros on average a year through
2015.  The company estimates installed capacity will increase 14
percent to 26.4 gigawatts in 2015 from 2011, EDP said on May 23.
Hydropower plants and wind farms will represent 73 percent of
the utility’s capacity in 2015.  Net debt rose to 18.25 billion euros at the end of
September from 16.95 billion euros in December. EDP in September
sold  Portugal ’s first benchmark corporate bonds since January
2011, raising 750 million euros from issuing five-year bonds.  The  Portuguese government  in December agreed to sell a 21
percent stake in EDP to  China  Three Gorges for 2.69 billion
euros. The Chinese company will also spend 2 billion euros to
purchase minority stakes in EDP wind farms by 2015 and offer
additional funding for EDP. The government on Oct. 31 approved a
plan to sell a 4.14 percent stake in EDP.  EDP  shares  slipped 0.6 percent to close at 2.03 euros in
Lisbon before the earnings were released. The stock has dropped
15 percent this year, giving EDP a market value of 7.42 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
