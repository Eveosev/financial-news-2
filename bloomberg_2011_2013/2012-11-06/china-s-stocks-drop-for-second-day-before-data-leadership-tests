Chinese stocks  fell, dragging down
the benchmark index by the most in a week, before the start of
the country’s leadership congress and U.S. presidential
elections. [bn:WBTKR=600115:CH]   China Eastern  Airlines Corp. [], the nation’s second-biggest
domestic carrier, slid 3.1 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG
downgraded the stock to underperform. Liquor maker  Kweichow
Moutai Co. (600519)  paced declines for consumer staples producers on
speculation recent gains were excessive relative to earnings
prospects. Aluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd. and China Coal Energy
Co. led losses for metal and energy producers on concern Europe
will struggle to contain its sovereign debt problems.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.4 percent to 2,105.99
at the close, the biggest decline since Oct. 26. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  dropped 0.4 percent to 2,292.21. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
slipped 0.2 percent.  “Investors are cautious ahead of the congressional meeting
and U.S. voting,” Hao Hong, managing director of research at
Bank of Communications, said in e-mailed comments from Beijing.
“Typically, the Chinese market tends to underperform before the
meeting.”  President  Hu Jintao  is due to hand over the Communist Party
leadership to Vice President  Xi Jinping  at a congress that
begins Nov. 8.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite exceeded the 30-
day average for this time of day by 7.1 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Thirty-day volatility in the gauge was at
16.4 today, lower than this year’s average of 17.2. The Shanghai
index trades at 10 times estimated profit after falling 4.3
percent this year, compared with the 17.8 average multiple since
Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data  in 2006.  Japan Travel  China Eastern dropped 3.1 percent to 3.43 yuan, while the
Hong Kong-traded shares slid 3.1 percent to HK$2.83 after Credit
Suisse cut its recommendation from outperform on concern
slumping travel to Japan will hurt profit.  China Southern
Airlines Co. (600029) , the nation’s biggest carrier by fleet size,
slumped 2.4 percent to 3.63 yuan.  Tensions between China and Japan escalated after Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s government said it would purchase
disputed islands from their private Japanese owner, prompting
China to dispatch government vessels near the islands known as
Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese.  Kweichow Moutai, which jumped a combined 13 percent in
September and October, lost 2.9 percent to 235.93 yuan.
 Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , the second-largest baijiu maker, retreated
2 percent to 33.02 yuan. Investors are selling shares of the
liquor makers because of speculation fourth-quarter sales may be
disappointing and recent rallies were excessive, Wang Ping, an
analyst at Great Wall Securities Co., said yesterday.  Earnings Slump  Third-quarter profit for Chinese listed companies fell 3.4
percent from a year earlier, accelerating from a 1.8 percent
drop in the second quarter, Huang Xindong and Chen Jianxiang,
analysts at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., wrote in a report
dated yesterday. Net income for companies excluding financials
fell 18.2 percent in the period, matching the decline in the
second quarter, according to the report.  “Investors have doubts about the economic recovery and
many expect it to be weak and won’t help improve corporate
earnings,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China
Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Expectations about policy support
for the stock market have faded as the party congress draws
closer.”  U.S. voters decide between giving President  Barack Obama 
another four years in office or replacing him with Republican
challenger  Mitt Romney  tonight. Obama led Romney 48 percent to
45 percent in an Oct. 31-Nov. 3 national poll conducted by the
Pew Research Center, a survey that showed the candidates tied at
47 percent a week ago. Romney has said he will label China as a
“currency manipulator” if elected.  ‘Trade-War Risk’  China has sole decision-making power on its exchange-rate
policy and the yuan’s appreciation against the dollar in recent
weeks has been driven by market demand, He Jianxiong, director-
general of the People’s Bank of China’s international
department, said in an interview in Mexico City yesterday.  “Romney is a trade-war risk,” said BoCom’s Hong. Neither
him nor Obama “is market friendly in a market that has failed
to break new ground after” U.S. quantitative easing, he said.  The National Bureau of Statistics is due to release October
economic data on Nov. 9. Industrial production probably rose 9.4
percent from a year earlier, accelerating from a 9.2 percent
gain a month earlier, according to the median estimate of 30
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Producer prices may have fallen
2.8 percent last month, compared with a 3.6 percent decline in
September, the survey showed.  Leadership Change  Xi, scheduled to take over the presidency in March, may
face economic growth of 7 percent in 2013, the slowest in 23
years, according to Pacific Investment Management Co., which
runs the world’s largest bond fund.  “The leadership change is dragging on investor
sentiment,” said  Gavin Parry , managing director of Hong Kong-
based Parry International Trading Ltd. “You’ve got a couple of
things going on. There is speculation that more hardline
conservatives could slow down the reformist agenda. There is
also a feeling that not much in the way of stimulus measures
will get announced from now through the next few months as the
new leadership settles in. That’s finally beginning to sink into
investors’ minds, the closer we get to the start of the
congress.”  Europe Concern  Chalco, the listed unit of nation’s biggest maker of the
lightweight metal, slid 1 percent to 4.89 yuan. China Coal, the
second-largest coal producer, lost 0.8 percent to 7.19  yuan .  As Greece seeks a 31 billion-euro ($40 billion) financing
tranche this month, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is facing
down a revolt in his three-party coalition. The leader of the
Democratic Left yesterday reiterated his party’s opposition to
changes in the labor law demanded by international creditors.  Chinese stocks traded in  New York  rose yesterday, led by
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and  Sina Corp. (SINA) ,
after they reported better earnings than analysts predicted.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in New York added 0.5 percent. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.2 percent before the Nov. 6 U.S.
presidential election.  Option traders  are turning less bearish on Chinese stocks.
The number of outstanding puts on iShares China ETF, or rights
to sell, was 1.3 times that of calls, or options to buy, on Oct.
19, the lowest since June, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The ratio was 1.4 on Nov. 1, the latest date for
which data was available.  --Zhang Shidong and Weiyi Lim. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
