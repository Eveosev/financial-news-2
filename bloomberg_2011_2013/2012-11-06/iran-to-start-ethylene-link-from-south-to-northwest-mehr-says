An ethylene pipeline that will carry
the product to northwestern  Iran  from the southern port town of
Assaluyeh will start next month,  Mehr  reported, citing an
official with the National Iranian Petrochemical Co.  Iran’s West Ethylene Pipeline, which can transport 2.5
million metric tons a year, will feed 13 petrochemical complexes
in the Kermanshah province once operational, Ali-Mohammad
Bassaqzadeh said in the state-run news agency report.  In the Iranian year that ended on March 19, the nation
exported $14.2 billion worth of polymer and petrochemical
products to more than 60 countries, Mehr said.  The Persian Gulf state exported 7.7 million tons of the
products valued at $6.1 billion in the first six months of the
year, NIPC’s managing director Abdolhossein Bayat said in a
report published today on the Oil Ministry’s  Shana  news website.  Iran, which is under financial and energy sanctions by
Western nations over its nuclear program, is a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
