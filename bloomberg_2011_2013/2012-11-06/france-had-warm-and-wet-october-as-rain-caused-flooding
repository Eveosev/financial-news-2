France  had a relatively warm and wet
October, while excess rain caused flooding in the Var region in
the country’s south, the Agriculture Ministry reported.  Average rainfall in France was 107 millimeters (4.2 inches)
last month, 31 percent more than normal values for the month,
the ministry wrote in a  report  on its website today. The average
temperature was 14.4 degrees Celsius (57.9 degrees Fahrenheit),
0.5 degree more than usual.  The October rains improved soil-humidity levels from the
previous month, with values now above normal in the north and
east of the country, as well as in the coastal regions of the
Mediterranean Sea, according to the report.  “During the last days of the month, the rains were
particularly strong in the Var, where locally they caused
flooding,” the ministry wrote. “The month of October remained
mild across the country.”  Northern France got 58 percent more rain than normal, while
the west had 89 percent more precipitation than usual, the
report showed. Soil moisture deficits remained in the country’s
center east, with the region receiving 35 percent less rain than
usual for October, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
