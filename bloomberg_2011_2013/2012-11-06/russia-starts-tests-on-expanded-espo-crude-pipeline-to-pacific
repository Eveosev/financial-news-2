OAO Transneft,  Russia â€™s pipeline
operator, started testing the second phase of the East Siberia-
Pacific Ocean pipeline to the Pacific port of Kozmino.  A second pier at Kozmino, capable of handling 100,000
metric-ton tankers, will load its first cargo this week, Igor Dyomin, a spokesman in Moscow, said today by phone.  The second phase, or ESPO-2, extends a pipeline that
already runs from fields in East Siberia to Skovorodino near the
Chinese border. It also boosts annual capacity of the entire
link to 30 million tons. ESPO crude exports are scheduled to
reach a record 1.6 million tons this month and 1.8 million tons
in December, loading programs obtained by Bloomberg show.  The newly completed part of the pipeline was filled with
oil for trials on Nov. 4 and may be certified by the government
for use by mid-December, Dyomin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
