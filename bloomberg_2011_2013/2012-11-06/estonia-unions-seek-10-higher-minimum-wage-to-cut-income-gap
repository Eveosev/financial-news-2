Estonian trade unions want a 10
percent increase in the minimum monthly wage from January to
keep income gaps between the rich and the poor from widening and
reduce  tax avoidance .  The unions are demanding the minimum gross wage rise to 320
euros ($409) from 290 euros, according to a statement published
on the  website  of the Confederation of Estonian Trade Unions
late yesterday.  Earnings of the richest increased four times more than
those of the poorest fifth of Estonians between 2003 and 2010,
Chairman Harri Taliga said in the statement. The move would also
reduce the so-called envelope pay, or undeclared cash payments
by employers, that amount to 10 percent of total, Taliga added.  Higher costs of public services after strikes by teachers
and doctors this year are threatening the competitiveness of the
newest euro area member and may delay the return to surplus
budgets, the central bank said yesterday.  Labor productivity  declined in the first half of this year
as the $19 billion economy  is slowing  from the European Union’s
fastest pace of 8.3 percent last year, while  average wage growth 
haven’t slowed significantly, the central bank added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
