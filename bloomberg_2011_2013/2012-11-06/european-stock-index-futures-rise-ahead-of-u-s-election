European stocks  advanced for the
third time in four days as Americans went to the polls to elect
their president.  ARM Holdings Plc increased 2.1 percent as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  was
said to explore how to use the chip designs from its mobile
devices in Mac personal computers.  Adecco SA (ADEN)  climbed 3.2 percent
after the world’s biggest supplier of temporary workers reported
earnings that exceeded estimates.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  dropped 4.1
percent as the carmaker sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of
bonds that convert into shares.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  increased 0.6 percent to 274.74
at the close of trading, as more than two shares rose for every
one that declined. The equity benchmark has  surged 17 percent 
from its low on June 4, as the  European Central Bank  and the
 Federal Reserve  announced further rounds of asset buying.  “Europeans would like to see Barack Obama elected because
they know where he stands,” said  Robert Halver , head of capital
markets research at Baader Bank AG in Frankfurt. “Whichever
president is elected will have to face the fiscal-cliff
debate.”  The so-called fiscal cliff refers to the $607 billion in
federal spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect
in January unless the  U.S. Congress  acts.  Election Polls  U.S. voters decide today between giving President Barack
Obama another four years in office or replacing him with Mitt
Romney. Obama led Romney 48 percent to 45 percent in a national
poll conducted by the  Pew Research Center  released on Nov. 4.
The survey, conducted Oct. 31-Nov. 3 among 2,709 likely voters,
has a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points.  The  Bank of England  and the ECB will both leave their key
 interest rates  unchanged at meetings on Nov. 8, according to
Bloomberg  surveys of economists . China’s President Hu Jintao
will probably hand over the Communist Party leadership to Vice
President  Xi Jinping  at a congress that begins the same day.  The number of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 21 percent lower than the 30-day average
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Volumes are very thin, with investor attention taken up
entirely with the U.S. elections and the critical Greek vote,”
said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of research at Charles Stanley
Group Plc in London. “Low volumes could see equities blown
around quite a bit.”  In Greece, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras must face down
dissent within his three-party coalition to get a package of
austerity measures and economic reforms ratified and obtain the
next slice of aid from a European Union-led bailout.  Greek Strikes  The Democratic Left party’s lawmakers said they won’t
support the bill because of proposed changes to  labor laws .
Unions began a 48-hour general strike today to protest against
the measures. The vote will be held as soon as tomorrow,
followed by another ballot on the 2013 budget on Nov. 11.  EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn ,
speaking at a meeting of Group of 20 finance chiefs in Mexico
City yesterday, said that euro-area finance ministers must agree
on a deal for Greece at a meeting in Brussels on Nov. 12. A
European G-20 official speaking before Rehn and on condition of
anonymity cast doubt on the prospects for that deadline.  Stocks gained even as a report showed German factory orders
fell the most in a year in September. Orders, adjusted for
seasonal swings and inflation, slumped 3.3 percent, the  Economy
Ministry  said today. Economists had forecast a 0.4 percent
decline, according to the median of 40 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  National benchmark indexes rose all 18 western European
markets, except Denmark. France’s CAC 40 Index climbed 0.9
percent, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index added 0.8 percent and
Germany’s DAX Index increased 0.7 percent. The OMX Copenhagen 20
Index sank 3 percent as  Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB)  plunged 6.9 percent.  ARM Advances  ARM (ARM) , whose chip designs power Apple’s iPhones, rose 2.1
percent to 709.5 pence. Apple’s engineers have grown confident
that the chip technology used for its mobile devices will have
enough power to run its desktops and laptops, according to three
people familiar with the company’s research. Apple has used
processors from  Intel Corp . for its Macs since 2005.  Adecco advanced 3.2 percent to 46.60 Swiss francs as the
world’s biggest supplier of temporary workers reported  third-
quarter profit  of 118 million euros. That beat the median
analyst estimate for net income of 103.2 million euros.  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group,  Europe’s largest airline , surged 5.3
percent to 7.34 euros, its highest price since August 2011.
Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Alitalia SpA,
which is partly owned by Air France, plans to sell assets to
avoid a capital increase.  Minimum Wage  Separately, Le Point newspaper said yesterday that the
French government may trim social taxes for wages between 1 and
2.5 times the minimum wage starting in 2013. The change could
boost Air France’s 2014 earnings before interest and taxes by
about 60 million euros, Loic Sabatier, an analyst at MainFirst
Bank, said in a note to investors today. The airline employed
about 50,000 ground staff in 2011, he said.  Fraport AG gained 5.3 percent to 46.22 euros after the
owner of Frankfurt airport said quarterly profit jumped 36
percent as passenger numbers increased.  Hannover Re rallied 4.5 percent to 55.90 euros as the
world’s fourth-biggest reinsurer forecast record earnings this
year.  Third-quarter profit  rose 63 percent to 265.5 million
euros from 163.2 million euros a year earlier, the reinsurer
said. That beat the 216 million-euro  average estimate  of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Munich Re  Munich Re , the world’s biggest reinsurer, and  Allianz SE (ALV) ,
Europe’s largest insurance company, rose 1.8 percent to 127.60
euros and 1.1 percent to 96.39 euros, respectively. A gauge of
insurance companies posted the second-biggest gain of the  19
industry groups  in the Stoxx 600, climbing 1.1 percent.  Volkswagen dropped 4.1 percent to 155.70 euros as Europe’s
largest carmaker sold bonds that automatically convert into
shares at maturity to bolster its capital base following its
purchases of Porsche and Ducati.  Novo Nordisk sank 6.9 percent to 860 kroner, the biggest
decline in 15 months. A report from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration found that the company’s once-a-day insulin
treatment Tresiba carries a higher heart risk than other
diabetes treatments.  Andritz AG (ANDR)  fell 1.4 percent to 47.19 euros as the world’s
second-biggest hydropower-turbine maker said third-quarter
orders declined 1.2 percent. Net income dropped 5.6 percent to
58.5 million euros, compared with the 60.4 million-euro average
