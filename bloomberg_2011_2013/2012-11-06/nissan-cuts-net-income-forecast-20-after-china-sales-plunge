Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , the top Japanese
seller of vehicles in China, cut its full-year net income
forecast 20 percent after consumer backlash stemming from a
territorial dispute sent sales lower in its largest market.  Net income  may total 320 billion yen ($4 billion) for the
year ending March 31, compared with its earlier estimate of 400
billion yen, the Yokohama, Japan-based company said in a
statement today. The carmaker cut its operating income forecast
to 575 billion yen from 700 billion yen.  The cutbacks at Nissan, which follows  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  in
lowering its profit forecast, illustrates how leadership in the
world’s biggest auto market has become a handicap amid the row
over uninhabited islands claimed by  China  and  Japan . Toyota
Motor Corp., which has the smallest share among the three
largest Japanese carmakers, raised its income forecast on demand
in the U.S. and at home.  “Nissan has a big exposure in China and was hit hard by
the protests, but we have seen some nice recovery in production
volume,” Kota Yuzawa, an analyst at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
said by phone before today’s announcement. “There’s no benefit
for both Nissan and their Chinese partners. Things will
stabilize probably toward the end of the year.”  Nissan  shares  fell 2 percent to close at 677 yen in  Tokyo 
before the earnings announcement. The stock has declined 2.2
percent this year, compared with the 6.2 percent gain in the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average. (NKY)   Net income was 106 billion yen in the July-to-September
quarter, beating the 91.2 billion yen average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating income was 166.4
billion yen, versus the 164.4 billion yen average analyst
projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
