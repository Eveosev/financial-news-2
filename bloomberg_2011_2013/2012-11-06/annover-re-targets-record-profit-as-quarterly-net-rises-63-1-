Hannover Re, the world’s fourth-
biggest reinsurer, expects record earnings this year after
reporting a 63 percent increase in third-quarter profit.  Net income rose to 265.5 million euros ($339 million) from
163.2 million euros a year earlier, the Hanover, Germany-based
reinsurer said in a  statement  today. That beat the 216 million-
euro average  estimate  of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Full-year profit is expected to be “in excess of” 800
million euros should major losses not significantly exceed the
predicted level of 560 million euros and assuming there are no
drastic downturns on capital markets, the company said. While
Hannover Re said it’s too early to make “reliable statements”
on claims from  Hurricane Sandy , the reinsurer doesn’t expect
losses to exceed its annual budget, Chief Financial Officer
Roland Vogel said on a conference call today.  Hannover Re  shares  climbed 5 percent to 56.17 euros at 9:38
a.m. in Frankfurt trading. The stock has gained 47 percent this
year, valuing the company at 6.8 billion euros. The  Bloomberg
Europe 500 Insurance Index (BEINSUR)  has gained 25 percent in the same
period. German insurer Talanx AG, which sold shares in an
initial public offering last month, holds 50.2 percent of
Hannover Re.  Superstorm Costs  Sandy, the Atlantic superstorm that left 8.5 million homes
and businesses without power after hitting New Jersey, New York
and other East Coast states last week, may cost insurers and
reinsurers, which shoulder some of the risks in return for a
share of the premiums, $10 billion to $20 billion, according to
 Eqecat Inc. , a provider of catastrophic risk models.  “Estimating conservatively, Sandy costing some 100 million
euros and excluding other major losses could lead to 1 billion-
euro range estimations for the net profit 2012,”  Fabrizio Croce , a Zurich-based insurance analyst at Kepler Capital
Markets, wrote in a report on Hannover Re to clients. Croce has
a hold rating on the reinsurer’s shares.  Claims of more than $18.5 billion would make Sandy the
second-most expensive hurricane on record, behind Katrina in
2005, which cost $62.2 billion. Hurricane Ike, which struck the
Gulf of Mexico in 2008, is the industry’s second-most expensive
hurricane with Hurricane Andrew in 1992 at $17 billion ranking
third, according to data  compiled  by Munich Re, the world’s
biggest reinsurer.  Good Platform  Hannover Re said net income for the first nine months of
the year climbed 76 percent to 670.8 million euros.  “The group net income reported for the first nine months
puts in place a good platform for achieving a very pleasing
result for the full 2012 financial year,” Chief Executive
Officer  Ulrich Wallin  said in the statement.  The reinsurer’s full-year profit target compares with a net
income of 606 million euros for 2011, when Hannover Re reported
claims of 981 million euros from natural disasters, including
the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  and the floods in  Thailand .
Hannover Re’s previous record profit was 749 million euros in
2010.  The reinsurer’s  dividend  payout for 2012 may “slightly
exceed” its target range of 35 percent to 40 percent, CFO Vogel
said. Hannover Re cut its 2011 payout to 2.10 euros per share
from 2.30 euros in 2010 following last year’s record claims from
natural disasters.  Claims of 49.2 million euros from the drought in the U.S.
were the reinsurer’s largest single loss in the quarter.
Hannover Re defines claims costing more than 10 million euros as
major losses.  Investment Income  Investment income rose 80 percent to 499.3 million euros in
the quarter, helped by the sale of real estate in the U.S. and
gains from instruments used to hedge against inflation and
derivatives associated with securities deposits held by U.S.
life-insurance clients.  Hannover Re expects 2013 net income of about 800 million
euros, assuming claims from major losses don’t “significantly
exceed” an expected level of about 600 million euros in non-
life reinsurance and provided there are no adverse movements on
capital markets.  Munich Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer, is scheduled to
report third-quarter figures on Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
