Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the home lender
that agreed to refinance mortgages after a probe of the
industryâ€™s practices, may forgo as much as $2 billion in
interest, $300 million more than previously estimated.  The lost interest may range from $1.8 billion to $2 billion
in future years, or $181 million to $201 million annually, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said today in its quarterly
 regulatory filing .  As many as 36,000 borrowers may get their interest rates
cut, according to the filing. Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home
lender, had estimated in August that 40,000 might be covered.  The program is part of a $25 billion mortgage settlement in
February by five banks with 49 states and the federal
government. The  accord , the largest federal-state civil
settlement in U.S. history, ended a 16-month probe of abusive
foreclosure practices.  Elsewhere in the filing, Wells Fargo said its total
exposure to the countries and other non-sovereign entities of
 Europe  climbed 6 percent in the third quarter to $30.2 billion.
The bank increased loans and commitments to the governments of
the euro region, including Austria and  Germany , as well as the
U.K., to $2.3 billion at the end of September from $2.1 billion
in June, the filing showed.  The lender increased its holdings, including debt and
equity securities, with non-sovereign entities located in those
countries to $27.9 billion, up from $26.4 billion in June.  Wells Fargo rose 0.9 percent to close at $34.32 in New
York. The shares  have climbed  36 percent over the past 12
months, outpacing the 28 percent gain in the 24-company  KBW Bank
Index. (BKX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
