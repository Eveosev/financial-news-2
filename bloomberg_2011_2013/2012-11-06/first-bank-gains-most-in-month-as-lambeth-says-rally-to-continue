First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, rose the most in
almost a month as investors saw the price as “attractive”
after declines, Lambeth Trust and Investment Co. Ltd.  The stock rose 5.1 percent, the most since Oct. 9, to 16.40
naira in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital. About 15.2 million
shares, 67 percent of the three-month daily average, traded,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. First Bank retreated
1.7 percent yesterday to 15.6 naira, giving a decline of 5.5
percent in a five-day period.  “The price fell to a point where it became attractive to
some investors,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Lambeth, said by phone today. ”The stock is
recovering.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
