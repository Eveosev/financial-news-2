Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , Indiaâ€™s
second-largest aluminum maker, reported a 29 percent drop in
profit in its fiscal second quarter as metal prices fell.  Net income , excluding unit Novelis Inc., declined to 3.59
billion rupees ($66 million) in the three months ended Sept. 30
from 5.03 billion rupees a year earlier, the company said today
in a statement. The median profit estimate of 29 analysts polled
by Bloomberg was 3.72 billion rupees. Sales fell 1.8 percent to
62.2 billion rupees.  Base metals fell on the London Metal Exchange in the last
quarter. The average price of aluminum, the lightweight metal
used to make aircraft and beverage cans, declined 20 percent
from a year earlier, while copper, which the company also
produces, fell 14 percent. The rupee fell 17 percent in the
quarter from a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The depreciation of the Indian rupee partially countered
declining prices as Hindalco pegs its sales in  India  to rates on
the LME, which denominates contracts in dollars. Total expenses
rose to 58.2 billion rupees from 57.9 billion rupees during the
quarter, while income from sources other than the main business
fell to 1.32 billion rupees from 1.85 billion rupees, it said.  The company, controlled by billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla,
in September got financing for the 131.95 billion rupee Aditya
Aluminium smelter project in the eastern state of Odisha. The
company borrowed the rupee-denominated loan at an annual
interest rate of 11.25 percent.  Hindalco  shares  declined as much as 2.6 percent to 111.55
rupees and traded at 113.05 rupees as of 2:20 p.m. in Mumbai.
The shares have dropped 2.1 percent this year, compared with a
21 percent increase in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
