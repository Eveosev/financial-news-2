Hundreds of thousands of Indians will rise earlier than usual tomorrow to join U.S. voters in tracking the final hours of the presidential election. The long campaign -- and particularly the candidate debates -- was closely watched in India, whose citizens asked themselves  why it was so improbable  that the leaders of their country's two major political parties would ever consent to a similar challenge. In 2008,  Barack Obama 's historic campaign and skepticism-dissolving language caused a bubble of optimism about politics in the U.S. and around the world, and the weight of Indian support falls squarely behind him this time, too. But Indians have invested less, with both heart and head, in the election of 2012. Obama's possible re-election isn't as interesting. And in a campaign fought mainly over domestic issues, there has been no significant mention of India in either candidate's pitch. All the talk in policy circles about the "converging interests" of  "the world's two largest democracies"  seems to have been left behind. India knows that, as an emerging economy and a politically-stable democracy, it doesn't have the same claim to the U.S.'s attention as  China  or  the conflict zones  in Afghanistan or  Pakistan . Although Obama visited India during his presidency and made a highly praised  speech  in the parliament, there has been nothing in the last four years to match the warmth of 2008, when the signature of  an important nuclear deal  in the last days of the George W. Bush administration marked a high point in Indo-U.S. political relations. A good overview of the arc of recent relations -- which includes ties between the same Indian coalition government, the UPA, with both Republican and Democratic administrations -- was supplied by the Indian foreign-policy analyst C. Raja Mohan in an interview titled  "How India Sees the U.S. Presidential Race."  Mohan emphasized that Obama is far more popular than his predecessor, even though the previous Republican administration had gone to greater lengths to build partnerships with India.  He remarked that in the Obama years  New Delhi  missed "the special attention that it got from the Bush White House." He sketched out a small map of important bilateral issues to which the Democrats and Republicans had different approaches, particularly foreign policy: If India figures at all in the 2012 election, it is as the destination for lost U.S. jobs,  particularly in the software industry . Pramit Pal Chaudhuri reported recently  in the Hindustan Times  that the Obama campaign's ads criticizing  Mitt Romney  as a "pioneer in outsourcing" could be crucial in winning over voters in states with depressed economies. David J. Karl had called out the bad faith of this attack in a Bloomberg Businessweek article in May with the headline  "The Indian Outsourcing Issue Is Back" : But there's plenty that Indians have taken away from the presidential race itself. (Last year, the politician  Shashi Tharoor   even made a case  for switching India's U.K.-type model of government over to an American-style presidential one.) The advance of broadband Internet in India has meant that it no longer takes hours to download videos of speeches or to follow news on a live stream. Last month, thousands of Indians frustrated with the  intransigence  and cynicism of their country's political debate watched videos of the Obama-Romney debates on the Internet, and the columnist Aakar Patel spoke for many (even if he overstated the case against India)  when he wrote : But many of  India 's long-established predilections have been shaken in the recent past, and perhaps as a result of our being able to look into the functioning of other democracies around the world, the Indian voter will cut a new, improved figure in the next general elections in 2014. Meanwhile, as the curtain falls on a long U.S. election year, the lights in India are sure to come on especially early tomorrow.
