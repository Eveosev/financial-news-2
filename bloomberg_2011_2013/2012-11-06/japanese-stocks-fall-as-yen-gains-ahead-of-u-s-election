Japanese  stocks  fell for a second day
amid low volume as investors await the results of the  U.S.
presidential election  and as companies from  Dainippon Screen (7735) 
Manufacturing Co. to  NTN Corp. (6472)  unexpectedly forecast losses.  Dainippon Screen plunged 16 percent to lead declines on the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average, while bearing-maker NTN sank 7.3
percent.  Makita Corp. (6586) , a power-tool manufacturer that gets more
than 40 percent of its sales in Europe, lost 2.6 percent amid
speculation Greece will fail to secure a loan pact next week.
Utilities rebounded from declines yesterday that came amid
disagreement about earthquake risk at the nation’s only
operating nuclear plant.  “Japanese corporate earnings aren’t good and deteriorating
economies in Europe and China are likely to have an impact on
that,” said Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $34
billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The market is
starting to worry about Europe’s debt issues again. Talks on
Greece’s bailout are dragging on.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  fell 0.4 percent to 8,975.15 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo. Volume on the gauge was about 15 percent below
the 30-day average ahead of the U.S. election today. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index lost 0.4 percent to 744.88, with more than two
shares dropping for each that gained.  The Topix has risen 3.6 percent since Sept. 6 after the
 European Central Bank  started a global wave of stimulus to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  Bank of Japan 
following suit. Shares on the equity gauge trade at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.2 for the  Standard & Poor’s  500
Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent today. Voting
starts today for Americans deciding between giving President
Barack Obama another four years in office or changing course
with Republican challenger Governor  Mitt Romney .  Greek Bailout  Exporters to Europe fell after a official from the Group of
20 nations said a Nov. 12 meeting of finance ministers from the
monetary union may fail to deliver an agreement necessary to
unfreeze Greece’s bailout.  Makita lost 2.6 percent to 3,210 yen. Sony Corp., which
depends on Europe for a fifth of its sales, slid 1.8 percent to
897 yen.  Dainippon Screen and NTN are among 551 of the 1,675 Topix
companies post  earnings results  this week. Of the 264 companies
on the gauge which have reported quarterly revenue since Oct. 1
and for which  Bloomberg News  has estimates, 65 percent have
missed projections.  Dainippon Screen  Dainippon Screen plunged by its daily limit of 80 yen, or
16 percent, to 406 yen. The chip-equipment maker reversed its
full-year forecast to a loss of 14 billion yen ($175 million)
from a 500 million-yen profit and canceled its planned annual
dividend of 5 yen per share. The company cited lower  capital
investment  across the sector for the results.  NTN, a bearing maker that supplies automakers including
Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. tumbled 7.3 percent to
140 yen after saying it expects a loss of 7 billion yen in the
year ending March 31 amid slumping demand and a strong yen. The
company had earlier forecast an 11 billion-yen profit.  Shipping companies declined the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) , Japan’s third-
biggest shipping line by sales, sank 5.6 percent to 102 yen
after Standard & Poor’s placed the company’s long-term credit
and debt ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications.  Nippon Yusen K.K. fell 3.2 percent to 152 yen, while Mitsui
O.S.K. Lines Ltd. slid 2.1 percent to 186 yen.  Kansai Electric  An index tracking utilities gained 3.7 percent, the most on
the Topix, after falling 2.5 percent yesterday as a decision was
delayed on the future of  Kansai Electric  Power Co.’s Ohi nuclear
plant as seismologists from the Nuclear Regulation Authority
disagreed over whether a fault line under the site is active.  The team studying the fault will meet tomorrow to discuss
the matter with the power station’s operator, said Kunihiko
Shimazaki, a commissioner at the regulator. Kansai Electric
jumped 7.5 percent to 618 yen after falling 6.8 percent
yesterday. Chubu Electric Power Co. soared 7.6 percent to 935
yen.  “Shares bounced back today after a selloff yesterday that
was really unwarranted given the fact that the decision on
whether to keep running the Ohi plant comes tomorrow,” said
Hideyuki Suzuki, a senior market analyst at Tokyo-based
brokerage SBI Securities Co.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 1.4 percent
to 19.32, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.5 percent
on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
