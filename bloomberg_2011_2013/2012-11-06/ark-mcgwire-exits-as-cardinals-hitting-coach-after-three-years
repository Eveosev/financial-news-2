Mark McGwire  said he won’t return as
the St. Louis Cardinals’ hitting coach for a fourth season in
2013 and the team promoted John Mabry to replace him.  McGwire’s exit comes as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch
reported he intends to accept an offer to take over as hitting
coach for the  Los Angeles Dodgers . McGwire, 49, lives in Orange
County, California, and played college baseball at the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles.  McGwire, a 12-time All-Star whose 583 career home runs rank
10th in Major League Baseball history, would replace Dave Hansen
as the Dodgers’ seventh hitting coach in eight seasons. Hansen
was fired last month.  Mabry, 42, batted .263 over 14 major-league seasons with
eight teams from 1994 to 2007. He spent last season as the
Cardinals’ assistant hitting coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
