Crude rose the most in a month on
forecasts that U.S. gasoline supplies dropped after  Hurricane
Sandy  forced the shutdown of East Coast refineries and as
Americans went to the polls to pick a president.  Futures climbed to a two-week high after a Bloomberg survey
showed supplies of the motor fuel probably decreased 1.5 million
barrels last week.  Hess Corp. (HES)  and  Phillips (PSX)  66’s New Jersey
refineries remained shut after Sandy. U.S. voters decide today
whether to return  Barack Obama , a Democrat, as president or
elect his challenger,  Mitt Romney , a Republican.  “Clearly there is a short-term shortage of gasoline on the
East Coast because of the closure of refineries, terminals and
pipelines,” said Julius Walker, global energy markets
strategist at UBS Securities LLC in New York. “These problems
should be short-lived. In the oil market, you also have some
sentiment about the election affecting trading.”  Crude oil for December delivery advanced $3.06, or 3.6
percent, to $88.71 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the biggest gain since Oct. 4 and the highest settlement since
Oct. 22. Prices are down 10 percent this year.  Prices were little changed after the American Petroleum
Institute reported U.S. oil inventories slid 27,000 barrels to
371.7 million last week. Gasoline stockpiles gained 1.38 million
to 201 million barrels. December oil advanced $2.75, or 3.2
percent, to $88.40 a barrel at 4:44 p.m. in electronic trading.  Brent oil for December settlement increased $3.34, or 3.1
percent, to end the session at $111.07 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  Gasoline supply may have dropped to 198 million barrels in
the seven days ended Nov. 2, according to the survey. That would
be the first decline in four weeks.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Fuel Inventories  Stockpiles of gasoline fell to 195.4 million barrels in the
week ended Oct. 5, the lowest level since October 2008,
according to Energy Department data. Inventories were at 199.5
million in the week ended Oct. 26.  “There is fear that until things are back to normal we
might have some tight supply and the market is keeping an eye on
it,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition
Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There is still some
uncertainty about the result of the election. People are waiting
to see who is going to win.”  Crude inventories probably rose 2 million barrels to 375.1
million barrels last week, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Gasoline futures for December delivery advanced 7.87 cents,
or 3 percent, to $2.6989 a gallon on the Nymex. They pared gains
after the API report, increasing 7.12 cents, or 2.7 percent, to
$2.6914 a gallon.  Refinery Outages  Phillips plans to resume normal operations at the 238,000-
barrel-a-day Bayway plant in two to three weeks after repairing
equipment damaged by Sandy, the Houston-based company said
yesterday in a statement on its  website .  Hess said yesterday it has partially restored power at the
70,000-barrel-a-day Port Reading refinery. Full power is needed
to complete an assessment, the company said.  “Gasoline supply is going to be tight in the next couple
of days,” said Chris Barber, a senior analyst at Energy
Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “It’s a
short-term thing.”  About 76 percent of gas stations in the New York
metropolitan area had gasoline yesterday, up from 73 percent on
Nov. 4, according to an  Energy Department  survey.  Sandy, the biggest Atlantic storm in history, prompted six
refineries with a capacity of 1.17 million barrels a day to shut
or operate at reduced rates, the  department  said. Four
refineries in  Pennsylvania ,  Delaware  and New Jersey have
returned to operation.  U.S. Election  The next president will need to address a so-called fiscal
cliff of more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts that take effect in 2013 unless Congress can reach a budget
compromise.  U.S. oil  production  has jumped 36 percent since January
2009 on rising output from shale formations in states including
North Dakota,  Texas  and  Oklahoma . Total output rose to 6.67
million barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 26, the most since
1995, according to the Energy Department.  “Whether Romney is president or Obama, the shale play is
still producing a lot of oil,” Barber said. “Production is not
the issue.”  Output will average 6.85 million barrels a day next year,
up 8.2 percent from this year, the Energy Department said in the
monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook  report today. It was forecast
to reach 6.33 million this year, 12 percent more than 2011.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 520,834
contracts as of 4:34 p.m. Volume totaled 477,577 contracts
yesterday, 8.2 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.61 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
