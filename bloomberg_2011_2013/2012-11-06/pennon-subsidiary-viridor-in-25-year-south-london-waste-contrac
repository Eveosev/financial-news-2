Pennon Group Plc (PNN) , a U.K. water
company, said its Viridor South London unit signed a 25-year
residential waste contract with South London Waste Partnership
for the boroughs of Croydon, Kingston, Merton and Sutton.  The company said the contract requires the treatment of
about 200,000 tons of waste a year and the construction after
planning permission is gained of an energy recovery facility at
Viridorâ€™s landfill and recycling site in Beddington, Sutton.  The project will require a capital investment of about 200
million pounds ($320 million) by Viridor, to be financed from
internal funds, with the plant to be built by Lagan-CNM, the
company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
