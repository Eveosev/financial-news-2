Brazil  swap rates rose from a record
low as economists projected that consumer prices increased at a
faster rate in October, reducing speculation that the central
bank will keep borrowing costs low.  The IPCA inflation  index  climbed 5.44 percent in October
from year earlier after a 5.28 percent advance in the prior
month, according to the median forecast of 37 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The government’s statistics agency will release
its report tomorrow.  Swap rates on contracts due in January 2014 increased one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.33 percent after
closing at a record low 7.32 percent yesterday. The real gained
0.2 percent to 2.0321 per dollar.  “The IPCA expectations can affect the swap rates market,”
Darwin Dib, the chief economist at CM Capital Markets Asset
Management, said in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo .  Brazil’s currency rose along with most of the dollar’s
other most-traded counterparts as stocks rallied and U.S.
Treasuries dropped.  “The real can appreciate with the improved external
environment, but it will be just a little because of the
vigilance of the central bank,” Dib said.  To weaken the real and protect exporters, Brazil’s central
bank sold $1.4 billion of reverse currency swaps contracts on
Oct. 25, $1.6 billion on Oct. 23, $1.3 billion on Oct. 5, $5.7
billion Sept. 12 through Sept. 17 and $350 million on Aug. 21.
The August reverse swaps were the first since March.  Inflation Boost  Swap rates climbed on Oct. 19 after a report showed that
inflation accelerated more than economists forecast. Prices as
measured by the IPCA-15  price index  rose 0.65 percent in the
month through Oct. 15 after a prior 0.48 percent gain, the
national statistics agency reported. That was the fourth
straight acceleration.  The central bank has cut the benchmark  interest rate  by
5.25 percentage points since August 2011 to a record low 7.25
percent to support the economy.  Carlos Hamilton, the central bank’s economic policy
director, said in September that annual inflation probably won’t
slow to policy makers’ 4.5 percent target until the third
quarter of 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
