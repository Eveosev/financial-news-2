Financial markets remain “jittery”
ahead of the results of the  U.S. presidential election , said
Azad Zangana, a European economist at Schroders Investment
Management.  Schroders is “looking beyond the immediate result of the
election and more towards what the potential impact” on the
 U.S. economy  will be from the winner of the vote, Zangana said
at a conference in Lisbon today.  “The U.S. has been in denial for a couple of years now,”
he said. “They have in fact been increasing stimulus into their
economy not actually tightening fiscal policy, which of course
will bring us to the fiscal cliff.”  Zangana said the near-term outlook for  Europe  still looks
“very weak” and forecasts the euro area economy to contract a
“little bit further” over the next six months as austerity
measures continue to weigh on countries across the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
