U.K.  retail sales  fell in October as
weak  consumer confidence  caused Britons to curtail spending, the
British Retail Consortium said.  Sales at stores open at least 12 months, measured by value,
dropped 0.1 percent from a year earlier, the London-based trade
group said in an e-mailed report today. Sales rose 1.5 percent
the previous month, the strongest in nine months.  “Unfortunately it looks like the modest sales revival we
saw in September was something of a false dawn,” BRC Director
General Stephen Robertson said. “The disappointing figures are
a reminder of the difficult economic realities many are still
facing. Falling consumer confidence means people are limiting
spending to essential items and are cautious about committing to
big-ticket and discretionary buying.”  Including stores open less than 12 months, retail sales
rose 1.1 percent last month from a year earlier, the slowest
pace since April, according to the BRC. In the three months
through October, food sales increased 0.7 percent from a year
earlier on a like-for-like basis, while non-food sales rose 0.2
percent.  Robertson said the fact that year-to-date average retail
sales growth hasn’t outpaced  inflation  means overall volumes
were “going backwards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
