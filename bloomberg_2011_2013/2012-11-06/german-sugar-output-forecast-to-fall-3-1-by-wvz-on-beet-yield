German sugar production from beets is
forecast to decline 3.1 percent on lower yields for the roots
and a drop in planting, industry group Wirtschaftliche
Vereinigung Zucker said.  Beet-sugar output is estimated to slip to 4.51 million
metric tons this year from 4.65 million tons in the 2011-12 crop
year, the Bonn-based group wrote in a  statement  dated yesterday
on its website.  Germany  is the European Unionâ€™s second-largest sugar-beet
grower behind  France , according to data from the bloc.  Crop yields are estimated at 70.1 tons of beets per hectare
(2.47 acres) from 74.6 tons in 2011-12, while the sugar-beet
area slipped to 393,667 hectares (972,751 acres) from 396,505
hectares, according to WVZ.  Total beet deliveries by growers are predicted to fall to
27.6 million tons from 29.6 million tons, with the average sugar
content in the roots estimated at 18.3 percent from 18 percent a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
