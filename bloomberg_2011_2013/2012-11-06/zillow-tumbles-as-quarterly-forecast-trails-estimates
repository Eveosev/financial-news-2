Zillow Inc. (Z) , operator of the largest
real estate information website, posted a record decline after
forecasting fourth-quarter revenue that trailed analysts’
estimates.  Sales this quarter will be $30 million to $31 million, up
from $19.9 million a year earlier, the Seattle-based company
said in a statement yesterday. That’s lower than the $32.4
million average estimate of analysts, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Zillow, which first sold shares to the public in July 2011,
faces increased competition from  Trulia Inc. (TRLA) , the online real
estate site that went public in September. To maintain growth
and diversify its product offerings, Zillow is making
 acquisitions , and announced yesterday the purchase of financial
software company Mortech Inc. for $12 million in cash and
150,000 shares of restricted stock.  Revenue in the third quarter jumped 67 percent to $31.9
million from $19.1 million a year earlier. The company swung to
a profit, recording net income of $2.33 million after reporting
a loss of $570,000 a year earlier.  Zillow  plunged  as low as $27.71 and was down 18 percent to
$28.02 as of 10:02 a.m. in New York. It had climbed 72 percent
since the initial public offering through yesterday, while
shares of Web companies including  Facebook Inc. (F) , Groupon Inc.
and  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  have tumbled since their IPOs.  Trulia is scheduled to report third-quarter results
tomorrow. The San Francisco-based company has  gained  31 percent
since its initial public offering on Sept. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
