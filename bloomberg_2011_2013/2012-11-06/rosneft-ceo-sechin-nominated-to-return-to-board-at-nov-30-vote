OAO Rosneft Chief Executive Officer
 Igor Sechin  has been nominated to return to the board after he
stepped down last year following an order from the government.  Shareholders will vote on board candidates at a Nov. 30
meeting, the oil producer said today in a regulatory filing.  Sechin, who was named Rosneft CEO in May after not being
reappointed as deputy prime minister, quit as chairman of the
board last year when Russiaâ€™s then President  Dmitry Medvedev 
asked certain state officials to give up their directorships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
