Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
world’s biggest concert promoter, said third-quarter profit
increased 12 percent on growth in ticketing, talent management
and sponsorship.  Net income grew to $57.9 million, or 31 cents a share, from
$51.7 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier,  Beverly Hills ,
California-based Live Nation said yesterday in a  statement .
Sales gained 9.7 percent to $1.96 billion, exceeding the $1.82
billion average of four analysts’  estimates .  Live Nation is revamping Ticketmaster, adding territories
outside the U.S. and expanding its roster of concert festivals
to boost operating income 35 percent through 2015, Chief
Executive Officer Michael Rapino told investors last month. The
company expects growth in concerts, ticketing and sponsorship in
the current quarter. The company has sold 3 million tickets for
events in the year ahead, compared with 900,000 a year ago.  “The more popular my concert business, even though it’s
the least profitable in terms of margins, the more we make on
ticketing and sponsorship,” Rapino said in an interview. “It’s
the engine that drives our global platform.”  Pink, Rihanna and other performers are selling tickets
earlier, giving the company more time to market shows, Rapino
said. With more tickets sold in advance, managers of other acts
gain confidence to tour, he said.  Thinking Ahead  “We like that artists are thinking about 2013 in
September,” Rapino said. “We usually aren’t putting these on
sale until February or March. It doesn’t effect later business,
we won’t see any decline next year.”  Adjusted operating income of $202.4 million beat the $192.7
million  average  of estimates. Adjusted operating income excludes
acquisition costs related to the 2010 purchase of Ticketmaster,
asset sales, depreciation, amortization and stock-based
compensation.  Live Nation  fell  0.8 percent to $9.17 yesterday in  New York 
and has gained 10 percent this year.  The company held 5,182 events that drew 11.5 million
attendees in  North America  and 4.27 million elsewhere, with
worldwide attendance up 1.6 percent, according to the statement.  North American spending per attendee rose to $18.55 in the
period from $18.03 a year earlier, the company said.
International festival goers spent an average $15.71 each, up
from $16.80 a year earlier.  Live Nation sold 36.1 million tickets valued at $2.1
billion in the period, compared with 34.9 million tickets worth
$2 billion a year earlier. Sponsorship revenue grew 12 percent
to $81.5 million in the period from $72.7 million, the company
said. Online advertising rose 4.3 percent to $14.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
