Exports of  North Sea  Alvheim crude
for December will be reduced to five cargoes of 780,000 barrels
each, one less than this month, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  A shipment of 780,000 barrel will load on Jan. 2, according
to the plan.  Houston-based  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  operates the  field  in the
Norwegian North Sea. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
