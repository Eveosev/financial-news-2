Ukraine’s government proposed
widening this year’s budget deficit by 7.68 billion hryvnia
($938 million) to cover losses at  utility companies  for 2011 and
2012.  The former Soviet republic’s fiscal shortfall will increase
to 38.8 billion hryvnia from a planned 31.13 billion hryvnia,
according to a draft bill published today on Parliament’s
website. Funds needed to compensate utilities for missing
household heating payments will more than double to 15.91
billion hryvnia, according to the document.  Ukraine is seeking cheaper natural gas imports from  Russia 
to lower the cost of subsidizing household heating tariffs. The
 International Monetary Fund  has frozen a bailout program because
of the government’s refusal to raise domestic fuel tariffs, a
move the Washington-based lender has demanded to stem losses at
state energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy.  The 450-seat  legislature , based in the capital, Kiev, will
discuss the bill today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
