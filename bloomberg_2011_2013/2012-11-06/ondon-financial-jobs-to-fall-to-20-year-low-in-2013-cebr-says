Employment in  London ’s financial-
services industry may tumble to a 20-year low in 2013 as a slump
in equity and foreign-exchange trading and mergers triggers job
losses.  Positions in the City and Canary Wharf financial districts
may fall to a revised estimate of 237,000 in 2013, compared with
256,000 predicted six months ago, the London-based Centre for
Economics and Business Research said in a statement today. That
would be the lowest number since 1993 and down from 354,000 in
2007, the research firm said.  “The business model for many firms in the City, which was
based on taking a percentage from yields of 8 percent plus, has
to change in a world where low yields are likely for many years
to come,” Douglas McWilliams, CEBR chief executive officer,
said in the statement. “The fall in activity is partly a
function of the weak economy, partly a hangover effect from the
financial crisis and partly caused by increasing regulation.”  European and Japanese financial firms, with securities
trading hubs in London, are cutting positions amid volatile
markets and increased regulation in the U.K.  UBS AG (UBSN)  plans to cut
10,000 jobs as  Switzerland ’s largest lender shrinks its
investment bank. About 100 traders at its fixed-income unit in
London were put on leave, a person briefed on the plan said last
month.  Expansion Unwound  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s biggest brokerage, is also
eliminating about 100 investment-banking jobs in  Europe  as it
unwinds a four-year international expansion, three people with
knowledge of the plans said in September.  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc , Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, said on
Sept. 24 it will cut 300 more jobs at its investment-banking
unit in addition to 3,500 announced in January.  The decline in City jobs reflects a 20 percent fall in
equity trading this year compared with a year-earlier and a 50
percent fall in international orders for equity trading. U.K.
mergers have dropped by a third, while international deal-making
has declined more steeply, the CEBR said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
