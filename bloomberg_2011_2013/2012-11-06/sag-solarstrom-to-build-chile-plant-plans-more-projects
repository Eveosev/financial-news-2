SAG Solarstrom AG (SAG) , a German solar
power developer, plans to build a 2-megawatt photovoltaic pilot
plant in Chile and is looking at larger projects in the country.  SAG Solarstrom will sell electricity from the facility,
expected to begin operating in the first quarter, to the
unidentified farm that owns the land, the Freiburg, Germany-
based company said in a statement today. The project, which will
also sell power on the spot market, will be in Coquimbo, a
region 500 kilometers (300 miles) north of Santiago.  “The 2-megawatt system provides us with the opportunity of
gaining a foothold in a very interesting growth market,” Karl Kuhlmann, chairman and chief executive officer of SAG
Solarstrom, said in the statement. “We are already in talks on
how to set up an appropriate project pipeline to include large-
scale projects in  Chile .”  Solar irradiation, a measure of sunshine intensity, in
Coquimbo is more than twice the level it is in  Germany , the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
