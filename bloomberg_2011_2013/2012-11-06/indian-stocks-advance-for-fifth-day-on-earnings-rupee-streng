Indian stocks gained for the fifth
day after better-than-expected earnings by companies including
Cipla Ltd. and a recovery in the rupee from a seven-week low
boosted investor sentiment.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.3 percent
to 18,823.58, according to preliminary closing prices, after
changing directions at least 20 times. Drugmaker Cipla jumped
4.2 percent to a record. The rupee rose 0.4 percent to 54.3950
per dollar, rebounding from its weakest level since Sept.  14.  The Sensex has increased 22 percent this year, driven by
overseas fund purchases and government policy reforms announced
since mid-September to revive economic growth. Foreigners have
bought a net $18.3 billion of local shares this year, the most
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding  China .  Out of the 21 Sensex companies that have reported earnings
for the quarter ended Sept. 30, just four, or 19 percent, have
trailed  analystsâ€™ estimates . That compares with 40 percent of
the index companies missing forecasts in the June quarter, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
