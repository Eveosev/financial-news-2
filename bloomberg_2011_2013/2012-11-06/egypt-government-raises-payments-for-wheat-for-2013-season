Egypt  will pay 400 Egyptian pounds
($65.40) per ardab measuring unit, or about 2,640 pounds per
ton, for wheat for the 2013 season starting May, the government
said.  The price compares with 380 pounds a year earlier, Minister
of Supplies and Domestic Trade Mohamed Abu Zaid said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Abu Zaid last month said in an interview that the
government planned to buy 4 million metric tons of wheat from
local farmers in the coming season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
