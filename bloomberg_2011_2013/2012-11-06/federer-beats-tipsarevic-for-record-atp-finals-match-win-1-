Roger Federer overpowered Janko Tipsarevic with his serve at the ATP World Tour Finals on his
way to a record 40th match win at the season-ending tournament.  Federer beat the No. 8 seed from  Serbia  6-3, 6-1 in his
first group match at London’s O2 arena.  The Swiss right-hander fired seven aces past Tipsarevic,
who managed three himself. No. 2 seed Federer never faced a
break point, winning 95 percent of the points on his first serve
compared with 56 percent for his opponent.  “It was a great year and a great summer, but it’s not over
yet,” Federer said in a court-side interview after he completed
the win with a backhand. “I hope I can keep it up here.”  Before today, Federer had been tied with Czech-born Ivan Lendl for most match wins at the year-end tournament with 39.
Federer, 31, defeated  France ’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the London
final last year, before going on to win a men’s record-extending
17th major singles title at Wimbledon in July and reclaiming the
top spot in men’s tennis for 17 weeks.  The  ATP World Tour Finals  feature a round-robin format. The
top eight singles players and doubles pairs are divided into two
groups of four, with the top two in each section moving into the
knockout semifinals.  Spain’s David Ferrer faces former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro of  Argentina  in the evening session.  Britain’s Andy Murray, the U.S. Open champion, and top-
ranked  Novak Djokovic  of Serbia won their group matches
yesterday.  It’s Federer’s 11th appearance at the ATP Finals, and he
now has a 40-7 win-loss record. He’s won the title a record six
times: in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2011. Lendl and Pete Sampras are next with five season-ending championships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
