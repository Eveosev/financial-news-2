Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, dropped the most in more than
six weeks after reporting a first-half loss and saying full-year
earnings would be reduced by at least 25 percent.  The stock fell 3.6 percent to 12 shillings by the close in
Nairobi, the biggest decline since Sept. 21. About 437,000
shares, 107 percent of the three-month daily average, were
traded.  In the six months through September, Kenya Airways made a
loss of 4.79 billion shillings ($56 million) compared with a
profit of 2.03 billion shillings a year earlier, the company
said today. Revenue dropped 9.3 percent to 49.8 billion
shillings. The carrier cited lower passenger traffic on some
routes, increased costs associated with firing workers and a
stronger shilling as all hurting earnings.  “We were expecting a loss but the results came in a lot
weaker than our estimates,” Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank said today in an e-mailed note to clients. “While the
airline expects to recover in second half, it does not expect
this to fully offset the first-half loss.”  A program to cut 12 percent of its workforce through early
retirement and dismissal will cost 800 million shillings this
year, Chief Executive Officer Titus Naikuni said Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
