Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest carrier by passengers, posted a first-
half loss on lower passenger numbers, a stronger shilling and
costs associated with firing workers.  The loss was 4.79 billion shillings ($56.1 million) in the
six months through September compared with a profit of 2.03
billion shillings a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Alex Mbugua said at a briefing today in Nairobi, the capital. Revenue
dropped 9.3 percent to 49.8 billion shillings, he said.  “The global  airline industry  was impacted by the economic
downturn and austerity measures in Europe and high prices of jet
fuel,” the company said in a statement to the Nairobi
Securities Exchange.  Profit in the global airline industry is expected to more
than halve to $4.1 billion this year from $8.4 billion in 2011,
according to the International Air Transport Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
