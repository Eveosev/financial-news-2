Preparation for natural disasters
such as storms and floods have “taken a back seat” among
politicians and the public amid the  European debt crisis ,
according to  Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest insurer.  “Due to the broad public discussion of the debt crisis and
a so far relatively mild catastrophe loss year in 2012, climate
change and natural catastrophes have again taken a back seat on
the political and public agenda,” Amer Ahmed, chief executive
officer of Allianz Re, Allianz’s reinsurance arm, said in an e-
mailed  statement  today.  Allianz said it expects the “frequency and severity” of
weather-related events to increase and more lives and property
are at risk as people move to coastal areas.  Hurricane Sandy ,
which slammed into New York and New Jersey last week and killed
more than 100 people, may cost insurers and the reinsurers, who
take parts of their risks in return for a share of the premiums,
$10 billion to $20 billion, according to an  estimate  by  Eqecat
Inc. , a provider of catastrophic risk models.  “We have to increase our efforts to implement mitigation
measures together with the public sector to be prepared for
increasing storm, heavy rain and hail activity,” Ahmed said.  Payouts to customers for weather-based insurance losses
have risen 15-fold in the past 30 years, Allianz said. It’s
increasingly the case that natural catastrophes such as last
year’s flooding in  Thailand  result in worldwide chain reactions
due to supply chain disruptions at global companies, the insurer
said.  The insurance industry and government-funded insurance
programs paid out a record $105 billion of natural-disaster
claims in 2011 for events including the earthquake and tsunami
that hit  Japan  and floods in Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
