A senior Egyptian security officer
was shot by unknown assailants in north Sinai, an official said.  Lieutenant General Selim El-Gammal, the inspector-general
for security in north Sinai, was severely injured and taken to
hospital in al-Arish, the governorateâ€™s administrative center,
after attackers opened fire on his police vehicle, Mohamed Said,
chief detective in the region, said by phone today.  Egypt  launched an operation in the Sinai to root out
extremists after 16 border guards were killed in August. There
have been frequent attacks since then. The head of security in
the region was fired after the Nov. 3 killing of three policemen
prompted protests by low-rank security officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
