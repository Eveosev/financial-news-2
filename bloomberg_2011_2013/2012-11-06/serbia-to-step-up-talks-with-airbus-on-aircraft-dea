Serbia will step up talks with  Airbus
SAS (EAD)  on an agreement to purchase and lease aircraft as it tries
to rebrand its ailing airline JAT Airways.  The government wants to buy four 180-passenger A230
aircraft and lease eight more planes for a new, debt-free JAT,
the Belgrade-based Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement.  “Talks will be stepped up in the coming period” and
“should be completed by spring when the new JAT will be
established,” the ministry said. Earlier today, Finance
Minister Mladjan Dinkic met with Airbus representatives. JAT
Tehnika, the state-run airline’s former maintenance unit, could
be included to service Airbus jets.  Serbia made an advance payment of about $23.5 million to
Airbus more than a decade ago for a purchase of eight planes and
later canceled the order. The government is now seeking to
include the amount in talks with Toulouse, France-based Airbus.  The Balkan country may offer JAT to the third-biggest Gulf
airline Etihad Airways PJSC,  Dinkic said on Oct. 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
