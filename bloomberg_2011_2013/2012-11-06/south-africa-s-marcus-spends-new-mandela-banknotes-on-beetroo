South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus today bought watermelon, almonds, aubergines, a
cucumber and beetroots using the first batch of banknotes
bearing the image of Nelson Mandela.  Automated Teller Machines will start dispensing the new
notes from today, Marcus said at the Lynwood Housewife Market,
in a suburb of  Pretoria , where she and her mother have been
buying groceries from the independently owned shop for about 30
years.  Mandela, 94, who became South Africa’s first black
president after 27 years in prison for his role in the fight
against apartheid, “really is an extraordinary man and this is
a way in which we pay tribute to him,'' Marcus told reporters.
‘‘All of us relate to him in one way or the other. He has
touched the lives of everyone.’’  The banknotes include a watermark of Mandela’s face, an
imprint of their denomination in lettering only visible through
a magnifying glass, several raised features and raised lines to
assist visually impaired users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
