Defending champion Roger Federer
eased past Janko Tipsarevic in his first group match at the ATP
World Tour Finals, breaking the record for most match wins at
the season-ending tournament.  Federer of Switzerland, a six-time champion at the event
for the world’s top eight singles players and doubles teams,
beat the No. 8 seed from  Serbia  6-3, 6-1 at London’s O2 arena.  Before today, Federer had been tied with Ivan Lendl for
most match wins at the ATP Finals with 39.  Britain’s Andy Murray, the reigning U.S. Open champion, and
top-ranked Novak Djokovic of Serbia both won their group matches
yesterday. Spain’s David Ferrer faces former U.S. Open champion
Juan Martin del Potro of  Argentina  later in the day.  The ATP World Tour Finals feature a round-robin format,
with the top eight players in the rankings divided into two
groups of four, with the top two in each section moving
into the knockout semifinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
