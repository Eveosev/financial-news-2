Celebrity chef Laurent Tourondel
settled a lawsuit filed by his former employer, BLT Restaurant
Group LLC, alleging he violated its trademarks with his new
restaurant in  New York ’s Hamptons.  The complaint brought by BLT was dismissed because of an
agreement between the parties to end the suit, U.S. Magistrate
Judge Michael Dolinger said in a filing yesterday in federal
court in New York. No details of the agreement were provided.  BLT said in the complaint filed in August 2010 that
Tourondel and his partner, Michael Cinque, had opened a
restaurant, LT Burger, in the Hamptons village of Sag Harbor
that “mimics plaintiff’s well-known line of restaurants.”
Tourondel had been executive chef of BLT.  BLT claimed that LT Burger copied menu items such as the
Grandma’s Treat milkshake with bourbon. LT Burger also has a
restaurant in  Manhattan ’s Bryant Park.  Jimmy Haber, the owner of BLT Restaurant Group, and Lisa
Tatelbaum, an assistant to Tourondel, said separately that the
parties will issue a joint press release on the settlement, most
likely tomorrow.  BLT, a unit of New York-based  ESquared Hospitality , stands
for Bistro Laurent Tourondel. ESquared operates 22 restaurants
worldwide, including BLT Steak in several cities and Casa Nonna
in New York.  Tourondel, before working at BLT, was the chef at the
former Manhattan Upper East Side restaurant Cello, which
received three stars from the New York Times in 1999.  The case is BLT Restaurant Group LLC v. Tourondel, 10-6488,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
