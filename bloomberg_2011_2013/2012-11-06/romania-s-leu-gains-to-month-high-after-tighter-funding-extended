The leu rose to the strongest level
in more than a month as the Romanian central bank extended its
policy of tighter funding at its repurchase agreement auctions
for a fifth week.  The currency appreciated for a fourth day, gaining 0.2
percent to 4.5133 per euro by 5:05 p.m. in Bucharest, the
highest on a closing basis since Sept. 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on 2019 Eurobonds declined five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.03 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank maintained a cap on funding to lenders at
4 billion lei ($1.4 billion) yesterday, compared with 5 billion
lei it offered on Oct. 22, 6 billion lei on Oct. 8 and 12.6
billion lei on Oct. 1. Demand at yesterday’s repo auction was
15.6 billion lei. Governor Mugur Isarescu said on Nov. 2 he is
limiting funding at repo auctions and intervening in the
foreign-exchange market to support the currency.  The currency continued to gain ground today as “the
central bank provides further support,” Mihai Tantaru, a
Bucharest-based economist at ING Bank Romania SA, wrote in a
note today. “Given the leu is only some 1 percent firmer from
two weeks ago when presumably the central bank started to act
more forcefully in the market, we think they might loosen their
grip somewhat.”  -- With assistance from Irina Savu in Bucharest. Editors: Ash
