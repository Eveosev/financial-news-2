European Union carbon rose to its
highest in two months as 2012 supply may be lower because some
nations are not ready to sell in auctions.  The European Energy Exchange AG yesterday published an
updated list of auctions that showed 12 of 25 EU member states
will sell at least 4.48 million tons of permits in each of nine
sales from Nov. 20 through Dec. 18. While that’s up 11 percent
from the previous 4.03 million tons per sale, it excludes some
nations including Poland. The list is updated weekly as more
member states complete preparations.  The contract for December gained 1.1 percent to close at
8.35 euros ($10.70) a metric ton, the highest since Sept. 7 on
 London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. United Nations Certified
Emission Reduction credits rose 3.8 percent to 1.09 euros a ton.  “The short-term supply squeeze is probably supporting
prices this week,” James Cooper, an analyst at Bloomberg New
Energy Finance, said today by e-mail. With lower volumes in
sales, power utilities still need to buy carbon permits when
they sell electricity forward, which can push up demand on ICE
and boost prices, he said.  “There is an increasing probability that further early
auction volume gets pushed into 2013, which would mitigate the
potentially bearish effect of rising supply as we approach 20
million tons per week by the end of November,” Cooper said.  The updated auction list of countries ready to sell
allowances and the total volume of permits to be sold, added a
total 3.9 million tons from the Netherlands to the volume to be
sold starting Nov. 20.  Curbing Supply  EU nations will “almost certainly” sell at least 7.3
million tons of allowances in 2013 instead of 2012, curbing this
year’s supply, according to New Energy Finance.  “The addition of the Netherlands now lifts the confirmed
volume of early auctions to 48 million tons,” Cooper said
yesterday by e-mail. “This means a maximum of 112.7 million
tons of early auctions will occur in 2012.”  Poland  wants to start next month auctions of its portion of
the carbon permits and may continue the sales in early 2013.  The central European country will be able to begin selling
allowances for the 2013-2020 stage after it signs an agreement
with EEX, according to Magdalena Sikorska, spokeswoman for the
Polish Environment Ministry. The procedure should be finalized
and sales should start the beginning of December, she said.  “Sales may continue in 2013,” Sikorska said by e-mail
today. “The auctioning schedule will have to be agreed with
EEX, in line with EU rules.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
