Investors in Treasuries were the most
neutral in more than two months as they cut bullish positions
ahead of the closely contested U.S. presidential elections,
according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Investors raised neutral bets to 70 percent from 68
percent, pushing it to the highest level since Aug. 27, the
survey reported, as President  Barack Obama  and Republican
challenger  Mitt Romney  courted voters.  The  proportion  of net longs was at four percentage points
in the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan, down from
six percentage points the previous week.  The percent of outright longs dropped to 17 percent, from
19 percent the previous week, the survey said. The percent of
outright shorts, or bets the securities will fall in value,
remained at 13 percent, according to the survey.  The yield on the benchmark U.S.  10-year note  rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.7 percent at 8:57 a.m. in
New York. It touched a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25
and reached a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on March 20.  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in  New York ,
wasn’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
