(Corrects first, second, fourth paragraphs to clarify that
carrier will continue  London  flights via Los Angeles.)  Air New Zealand Ltd.  will stop its
Hong Kong-London route after abandoning hope of making a profit
on the service.  The carrier will halt the flights in March, it said in
 statement  on its website yesterday. It will also begin
cooperating on Hong Kong services with  Cathay Pacific Airways
Ltd. (293)  from Jan. 31. The airline will continue flying to London
via Los Angeles.  The end of the Hong Kong-London service will enable Air NZ
to continue adding more capacity to Los Angeles and San
Francisco, it said.  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  is also paring European
flights and forming a tie-up with Dubai-based Emirates as Middle
Eastern airlines win market share on the sector by offering a
wider range of connections at hubs halfway along the route.  Air NZ will cut about 70 cabin-crew posts based in London
alongside the end of flights via Hong Kong, it said. The carrier
began the Hong Kong-London route in October 2006.  The airline also codeshares on Deutsche Lufthansa AG
flights to  Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
