The risk of a borrower failing to
repay a loan in  Portugal  is increasing and is linked to the
country’s current economic cycle, Bank of Portugal Vice Governor
Pedro Duarte Neves said.  “An increase in credit risk is an unavoidable reality,”
Neves said at a conference today in Lisbon. While banks have
succeeded in bolstering their  capital ratios , the current
setting remains difficult for the banking system, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
