SK Telecom Co. (017670) , South Korea’s largest
mobile-phone operator, reported third-quarter profit that lagged
behind analysts’ estimates after expenditure to upgrade networks
and marketing costs increased.  Net income  fell 54 percent to 175.6 billion won ($161
million) from 383.9 billion won a year earlier, the Seoul-based
company said in a statement today. That missed the 236.2
billion-won average of 18  analysts’ estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Competition among South Korea’s three mobile-phone carriers
is intensifying as they try to sign up more customers to fourth-
generation services using the so-called Long Term Evolution, or
LTE technology. Mobile-phone makers led by Samsung Electronics
Co. and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  are introducing LTE devices, escalating the
fight among the operators.  “The third-quarter earnings are almost the worst they can
be,” Park Jong Soo, a Seoul-based analyst at Hanwha Investment
& Securities, said by telephone before today’s announcement.
“Marketing got so heated through the third quarter.”  SK shares fell 0.3 percent to 155,000 won as of noon on the
Korea Exchange, after rising as much as 2.9 percent earlier. The
benchmark Kospi index added 0.4 percent.  Operating profit fell 46 percent to 300.7 billion won on
sales of 4.13 trillion won.  Intense Competition  Marketing costs  increased to 1.04 trillion won during the
July-September period from 781 billion won a year earlier, the
company said. Investments for upgrading networks including the
nationwide rollout of LTE rose to 788 billion won from 552
billion won, it said.  SK began commercial LTE service in July last year. The
number of LTE subscribers exceeded 6 million, the company said
on Oct. 26. The carrier expects to have more than 7 million 4G
customers by the end of the year, SK said then.  In September, Apple began selling the iPhone 5 capable of
running on LTE networks, following rivals including Samsung in
adopting the 4G technology. The latest Apple smartphone hasn’t
gone on sale in South Korea.  The new devices will keep the competition among South
Korean carriers intense in the fourth quarter, Park wrote in a
Sept. 27 report.  The companies are counting on LTE subscribers also because
they need to boost sales of more profitable plans after they
agreed with the government to reduce phone tariffs to help curb
inflation.  SK in September last year began to lower monthly basic
rates for its mobile-phone subscribers by 1,000 won and offer 50
free text messages each month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
