Ghana lawmakers approved $663 million
in funding for sewer and water projects in the Accra
metropolitan area and flood-prone parts of the Odaw River basin,
the Ghanaian Times cited Accra’s mayor as saying.  The credit facility approved by Parliament includes $538
million from the U.S. Export Import Bank and $125 million from
Standard Chartered Bank, the state-owned newspaper cited Mayor
Alfred Vanderpuiye as saying at an emergency meeting yesterday
of the Metropolitan Assembly over the dredging of the Odaw
River.  The five-year project that’s due to start soon is designed
to improve drainage and sewer systems including restoring
operations at a wastewater treatment plant and help curb
flooding in the capital city, the mayor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
