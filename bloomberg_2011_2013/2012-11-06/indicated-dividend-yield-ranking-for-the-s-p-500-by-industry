The table below ranks indicated dividend yields of
companies in the  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index (SPX)  by industry as of October 31. The
yield is calculated by taking the latest declared dividend, annualized and
divided by the stock price. Payout ratios are calculated based on latest
annual dividend paid divided by earnings. The data is first sorted by the
industry name alphabetically and then by the yield in descending order.
Dividends are paid on a quarterly basis unless noted.
