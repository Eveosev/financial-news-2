Prices for California carbon
allowances will average about $29 a metric ton between next year
and 2020, about 5.5 percent lower than an earlier estimate,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Prices will start at $11 a ton next year when the state’s
emission-trading program goes into effect and will reach $47 a
ton in 2020, the London-based research company said today in a
report.  California’s Global Warming Solutions Act requires the
state to  regulate  carbon emissions of refineries, power plants,
industrial facilities, and transportation fuels using a cap-and-
trade system. The first auction is scheduled for Nov. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
