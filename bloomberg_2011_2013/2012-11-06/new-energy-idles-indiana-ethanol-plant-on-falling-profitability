New Energy Corp. idled an ethanol
plant in  South Bend , Indiana, because making the fuel has become
unprofitable.  The company is mothballing the 100 million-gallon-a-year
operation as a supply glut, tepid demand and high corn prices in
the aftermath of the worst U.S. drought since the 1950s cut
profitability, Russ Abarr, president of South Bend-based New
Energy, said in a telephone interview today.  “That’s all working against the margins,” Abarr said.
“Unfortunately, it’s happening at a lot of places in the
country and we’ll see more of it happen.”  New Energy’s decision to idle the plant until it’s
profitable comes after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest
U.S. ethanol producer, said Oct. 30 that it shut distilleries in
Albion, Nebraska, and Linden, Indiana.  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 2.2 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.332 a gallon yesterday on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices have gained 4.9 percent this year.  Bunge-Ergon Vicksburg LLC plans to halt operations at its
Mississippi mill by Nov. 30 and  Biofuel Energy Corp. (BIOF)  said in
September that it closed a plant in Fairmont, Minnesota.
Southwest Georgia Ethanol LLC stopped production at a Camilla,
Georgia, operation last month.  Abarr said New Energy plans to sell the 28-year-old plant
when the market improves.  Poet LLC, in  Sioux Falls , South Dakota, is the largest U.S.
ethanol producer, followed by  Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM)  in
Decatur, Illinois.  To contact the reporter on this story:
