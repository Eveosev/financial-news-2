Kuwait  plans to offer a contract to
build a new airport terminal at an estimated cost of 900 million
dinars ($3.2 billion), Public Works Ministry Undersecretary
Abdul Aziz Al-Kulaib said in an interview today.  The project is part of the country’s $110 billion
development plan to modernize and diversify Kuwait’s oil-reliant
economy. Other projects include building a subway and rail
network, new power stations, hospitals, roads and a port on
Boubyan Island.  The Ministry of Public Works plans to spend about 4 billion
dinars on road projects over the next five years, the ministry’s
assistant undersecretary for Roads Administration, Saud Al-Naki,
said today in an interview. That will include “introducing two
interchanges” on a main highway leading to Kuwait International
Airport to serve the new terminal, Al-Naki said.  The ministry awarded a 738 million-dinar causeway project
to a group led by Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., Al-
Naki said. Subiya Causeway will span 37.5 kilometers (23.3
miles), mostly across water, and link  Kuwait City  with Subiya in
the north and Boubyan Island, where projects are planned as part
of the development plan.  Kuwait Civil Aviation President Fawaz AbdulAziz Al-Farah
said in May that the country will spend $6 billion to almost
double the number of passengers to 13 million that the airport
is able to handle by the end of 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
