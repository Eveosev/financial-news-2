Russia ’s services industry grew for a
third month in October, accelerating to the fastest pace since
May 2011 as new orders increased, encouraging companies to
expand headcounts, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The Russia Services Business Activity Index rose to 57.3 in
October from 54.5 a month earlier, HSBC said in a  statement 
today, citing data compiled by London-based Markit Economics. A
reading above 50 shows growth, while below 50 indicates a
contraction. The measure fell to 52 in July.  Russia, the world’s largest energy exporter, has relied on
the private consumption that accounts for half the economy to
drive growth as global demand for its commodities of energy and
metals suffers. The pace of inflows of new work at service
providers was the fastest since July 2008, resulting in the
biggest increase in workforces since February, HSBC said.  “It is private consumption that has given a strong boost
to the Russian economy,”  Alexander Morozov , chief economist for
HSBC in Moscow, said in the note. “It looks like we are back to
the ‘golden’ pre-crisis years in this respect, with an extra
bonus of lower inflationary pressures in the economy now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
