U.K. 10-year bond yields dropped to
the lowest level in a week after a government report showed
industrial production slumped in September, spurring demand for
the safety of government debt.  Benchmark gilts outperformed German bunds before  Bank of
England  policy makers start a two-day meeting tomorrow where
they will decide whether to increase monetary stimulus, or so-
called quantitative easing. The pound weakened against 12 of its
16 major counterparts as the factory data damped optimism the
economy is recovering. The Debt Management Office sold 3.25
billion pounds ($5.2 billion) of 10-year gilts.  “Gilts have performed better than bunds and a portion of
that move can be attributed to the softer U.K. data,” said
Jason Simpson, an interest-rate strategist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
in  London . “This doesn’t change the bigger picture in that we
don’t expect more QE on Thursday.”  The 10-year gilt yield was little changed at 1.82 percent
at 4:40 p.m. London time after declining to 1.80 percent, the
lowest since Oct. 29. The price of the 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 was at 99.41.  The German 10-year bund yield increased one basis point to
1.43 percent.  Benchmark U.K. 10-year yields are likely to climb to 2
percent by Dec. 31 and reach 2.90 percent by the end of 2013,
 Banco Santander ’s Simpson said.  British industrial production dropped 1.7 percent from
August when it slipped 0.5 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in London. Separate data showed U.K. retail
sales fell and  house prices  slid in October.  Asset Purchases  The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
will leave the target for asset purchases at 375 billion pounds
on Nov. 8, according to 35 of 45 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Six forecast a 50 billion-pound increase, and four
predict a 25 billion-pound expansion.  The Debt Management Office sold gilts maturing in September
2022 at an average yield of 1.815 percent, up from 1.764 percent
at the previous auction on Oct. 2. Investors bid for 1.93 times
the amount of securities allotted, versus 1.87 times last month.  Gilts have returned 2.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 3.6 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 2.1 percent.  Momentum Stalls  The pound erased gains versus the euro following the
industrial production data.  “The pickup in momentum in the economy during the third
quarter appears to have stalled into the fourth and that makes
it a closer call for the Bank of England this week,” said  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “BOE policy has not been the
main driver of pound direction, which is being influenced more
by developments in the euro area.”  The pound dropped 0.1 percent to 80.15 pence per euro after
appreciating to 79.84 pence, the strongest level since Oct. 2.
Britain’s currency was little changed at $1.5994.  Sterling will strengthen to 76.50 per euro in the next 12
months, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi’s Hardman said.  The pound has gained 1.3 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro fell 3.1 percent, while
the dollar dropped 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
