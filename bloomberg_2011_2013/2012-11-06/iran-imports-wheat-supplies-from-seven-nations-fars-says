Iran  has imported wheat from seven
countries even amid trade and financial sanctions against the
Persian Gulf nation,  Fars  reported, citing Abbas Ghobadi, deputy
minister of industries, mines and commerce.  Iran stockpiled sufficient volumes of nine strategic goods
to meet its needs over the next 1 1/2 years, the state-run news
agency cited Ghobadi as saying, without detailing the items.  Ghobadi dismissed claims that Iran is bartering wheat for
oil, according to Fars.  While food imports aren’t targeted by international
sanctions aimed at Iran’s nuclear program, restrictions on
banking and financial transactions have made it more difficult
for the country to import agricultural goods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
