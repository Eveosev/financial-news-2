The Danish government plans to push
back power production from two offshore wind farms with a joint
capacity of 1,000 megawatts by one year to 2018.  The 600-megawatt Kriegers Flak and 400-megawatt Horns Rev
projects will still start full output by 2020, according to a
 document posted today  on the website of the Danish ministry of
climate and energy.  Offshore wind is a key component in an agreement between
government and opposition parties,  signed March 22 , to replace
50 percent of coal use with renewable energy sources over the
next eight years and boost the share of wind power to 50 percent
of total generation from 28.2 percent last year. Tenders for the
two projects will be announced in 2013 to 2015.  Denmark currently has four offshore wind farms at Horns Rev
and Roedsand, with capacities from 160 megawatts to 209
megawatts. Denmarkâ€™s biggest utility Dong Energy A/S is
constructing a fifth farm at Anholt, which is due to start this
year with full 400-megawatt output in the first half of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
