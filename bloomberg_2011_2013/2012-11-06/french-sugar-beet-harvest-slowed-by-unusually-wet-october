French sugar-beet harvesting was
slowed down by unusually wet weather last month, disrupting the
supply of roots to processors, industry researcher Institut
Technique de la Betterave said.  France ’s sugar-beet growing regions on average received 112
millimeters (4.4 inches) of rain last month, 45 millimeters more
than usual, the Paris-based institute wrote in a  report  on its
website.  “These very wet conditions caused major disruption to the
harvest and the supply of factories in all regions,” ITB wrote.
“From the start of the month, harvest conditions were very
difficult in all the sugar-beet regions due to the very heavy
precipitation.”  France is the European Union’s largest sugar-beet producer,
and most of the country’s beet crop is grown in the north of the
country.  Some sugar factories lifted restrictions on soil content in
beet cargoes to ensure supply, according to the ITB. Weather
conditions for harvesting gradually improved after Oct. 20, the
researcher reported.  The ITB reported last month that harvesting had started in
the middle of September in difficult conditions due to dry soil,
before rain at the end of the month improved fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
