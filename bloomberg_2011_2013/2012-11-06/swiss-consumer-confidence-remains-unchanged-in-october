Swiss  consumer confidence  remained
unchanged in October even as households grew more pessimistic
about the economic outlook and the labor market.  An index based on a quarterly survey of about 1,100
households stayed at minus 17, the  State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs  in Bern said in an e-mailed statement today.
Economists had forecast a retreat to minus 21, the median of 12
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  A gauge measuring consumersâ€™ assessment of the development
of the overall economic situation in the next 12 months fell to
minus 23 from minus 20 in July, while a sub-indicator of future
unemployment rose to 67 from 62, indicating an increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
