AOL Inc. (AOL) , the publisher of the
 Huffington Post  and TechCrunch websites, gained the most in
almost seven months after reporting a third-quarter profit amid
stronger advertising sales.  The shares advanced 22 percent to $43.70 at the close in
New York, the biggest daily increase since April 9. The stock
has almost  tripled  this year, outperforming  Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) ,  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   Since separating from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  in 2009, AOL under
Chief Executive Officer  Tim Armstrong  has worked to transform
the company from an Internet services provider into ad-based
content provider. Global advertising rose 7 percent to $340
million in the quarter, AOL said.  “We have a lot more work to do,” Armstrong said in an
interview after the earnings report. “We expect 2013 to be a
growth year, both in terms of revenue and operating income.”  Net income totaled $20.8 million, or 22 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $2.6 million, or 2 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, profit was 34 cents, beating the 29-cent
average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Total revenue was unchanged at $531.7 million, the first
quarter since the spinoff that AOL didn’t post a year-over-year
decline. Analysts projected $522 million, the average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Search advertising increased 7.9 percent to $91.8 million,
according to the statement. AOL’s advertising network surged 18
percent to $112.8 million. Display advertising fell 1 percent to
$135.4 million. International display ads advanced 18 percent,
offsetting a 2.6 percent drop in the U.S. portion.  AOL’s U.S. advertising business ranks fifth among major
competitors behind Google, Yahoo, Facebook Inc. and Microsoft
Corp., according to research firm EMarketer Inc.  Patch Readership  The company is going through a lengthy turnaround phase and
continues to see lower revenue as its legacy dial-up business
loses customers to faster broadband connections offered by cable
companies. Sales from dial-up fell 10 percent to $173.5 million.  Armstrong has invested more than $600 million in Web
publishing, acquiring the  Huffington Post  last year for $315
million and spending more than $300 million to develop Patch, a
local-news division that Armstrong said should bring in about
$50 million in sales this year.  Traffic at its Patch division increased 19 percent in
September compared with year earlier, AOL said. Total readership
to AOL’s properties grew 4 percent to 111 million people in the
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
