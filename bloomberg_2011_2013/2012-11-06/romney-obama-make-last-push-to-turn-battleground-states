President  Barack Obama  was poised to win re-election after capturing the battleground states of Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, according to television network projections.  Obama’s victories in those closely contested states all but extinguished Republican  Mitt Romney ’s chances of winning the 270 Electoral College votes needed to claim the White House.  Obama sought to overcome stubborn U.S. joblessness as he vies for a second term while Romney is counting on upsets in many of the battlegrounds to win the White House.  Each candidate scored victories where they had been favored in states where polls had closed by 11 p.m. Washington time. The Associated Press or television networks projected Romney wins in states that included Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, South Carolina, Indiana, Louisiana, Texas and Georgia. States Obama was projected to carry included Minnesota,  New Jersey , New York, Connecticut, California, Delaware, his home state of Illinois and Romney’s home state of Massachusetts, where the Republican served as governor.  Obama also was projected to win  Michigan , where Romney’s father served as governor and where the president benefited from his support of the government’s bailout of the  auto industry .  -- With assistance from Julie Bykowicz and Julie Hirschfeld Davis in Washington and Lisa Lerer in Boston.
