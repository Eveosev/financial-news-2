for their best start to a National Basketball Association season
in 13 years.  J.R. Smith added 17 points and  Raymond Felton  had 16 points

Knicks, who had also beaten the 76ers 100-84 at Madison Square

night before taking a 25-21 lead at the end of the first
quarter. The visitors extended the lead to eight points at
halftime and used a 12-0 third-quarter scoring run to push their
advantage to 20 points.  “They caught us by surprise a little bit,” Anthony, who
hit 7-of-16 shots and had seven rebounds, told reporters. “They
were at home at had the momentum early. We kept our composure,
stuck with our game plan and it worked for us.”  New York next faces the  Dallas Mavericks  on Nov. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
