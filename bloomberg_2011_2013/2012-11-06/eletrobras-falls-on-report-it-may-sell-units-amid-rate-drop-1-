Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
South America’s largest power generator, fell to the lowest in
seven years after  Valor Economico  reported the company may sell
subsidiaries as the government forces a cut in utility rates.  Preferred shares of Eletrobras, as the state-controlled
company is known, declined 0.5 percent to 15.34 reais at the
close of trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest since Aug. 29, 2005.
Voting shares dropped 1.3 percent to 10.90 reais, the lowest
since September 2003. The benchmark Bovespa index gained 2.1
percent.  Eletrobras may sell all or part of six power distributors
in the medium to long term in an attempt to preserve profit
after new rules go into effect that will lower revenue by 8.5
billion reais ($8.2 billion) a year, Valor Economico reported
today, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Jose da Costa Carvalho Neto. In 2011, Eletrobras’s revenue was 33.1
billion reais.  “The market is definitely concerned about this kind of
intervention,” Sandro Fernandes, a trader at  Belo Horizonte ,
Brazil-based brokerage Corval, said by phone.  President  Dilma Rousseff  unveiled measures in September to
force power companies to cut rates by as much as 28 percent as
part of the government’s efforts to bolster economic growth and
damp inflation. The measures include revised conditions for the
renewal of licenses expiring between 2015 and 2017.  “All possibilities are under discussion,” Eletrobras’s
press office said in an e-mailed response to questions from
 Bloomberg News  about the Valor news report.  Preffered shares have lost 43 percent this year, while
voting shares have dropped 39 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
