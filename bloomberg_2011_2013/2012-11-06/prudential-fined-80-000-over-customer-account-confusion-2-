Prudential Plc (PRU)  was fined 50,000
pounds ($80,000) by the U.K.’s data protection watchdog after
mistakenly merging the accounts of two customers leading to the
wrong person getting retirement payments.  “This case would be considered farcical were it not for
the serious sums of money involved,” Stephen Eckersley, head of
enforcement at the Information Commissioner’s Office, said in a
 statement  today on the agency’s website.  Prudential first merged the accounts of the customers, who
share the same first name, surname and date of birth, in March
2007 and took more than three years to resolve the issue, the
ICO said.  The fine is the first that doesn’t relate to a loss of
data, the ICO said, and was levied due to the company’s failure
to investigate the mix-up after being alerted by the customers.  “We are very sorry for any distress and inconvenience
experienced by the two customers, and we have apologized and
compensated them,” London-based Prudential, the U.K. largest
insurer by market value, said in a statement. “We regret that
this incident occurred and was not resolved more quickly.”  The firm said it changed its administration and training
procedures to minimize the chances of the error recurring.  To contact the reporters on this story:
