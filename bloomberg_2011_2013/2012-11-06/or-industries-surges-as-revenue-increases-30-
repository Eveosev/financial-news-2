Thor Industries Inc. (THO)  gained the most
in three months after the maker of Airstream recreational
vehicles and Champion buses said sales surged 30 percent to a
fiscal first-quarter record.  The  shares  climbed 12 percent to $44.96 at 11:02 a.m. in
 New York  after advancing as much as 14 percent, the most
intraday since Aug. 3. The Jackson Center, Ohio-based company’s
stock had risen 46 percent this year through yesterday.  Sales for the quarter ended Oct. 31 rose to $876.8 million,
Thor said today in releasing preliminary results. The average of
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $745.5 million.
Thor said in a statement that its order backlog at the end of
October was $720.4 million, up 41 percent from a year earlier.  Sales of recreational vehicles are monitored as a sign of
an improving economy because motor homes and travel trailers are
discretionary purchases that consumers defer during a slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
