More than 60 percent of citizens
surveyed in the European Union don’t have confidence in their
nations’ financial institutions, according to research conducted
by Gallup Inc.  The 61 percent figure is up 6 percentage points from last
year as residents lost trust amid the sovereign-debt crisis, the
Omaha, Nebraska-based polling and research company  said . Thirty-
four percent of the roughly 1,000 people polled in 27 EU
countries had confidence in their banks and financial
institutions, according to the survey.  In Malta, 72 percent of citizens surveyed had confidence in
financial firms while fewer than 18 percent of those in Spain,
Greece and Ireland did, the survey shows. Confidence in the
banks of Cyprus declined the most over the year earlier.  The survey was conducted through telephone and in-person
interviews from October 2011 to July 2012. Citizens were asked
about their opinions prior to the announcement from European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  that he’d do whatever it
takes to preserve the region’s currency, according to Gallup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
