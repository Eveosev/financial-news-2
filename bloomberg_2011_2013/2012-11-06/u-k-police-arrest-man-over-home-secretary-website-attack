Police arrested a 41-year-old man in
connection with a suspected cyberattack on the websites of U.K.
Home Secretary Theresa May and her agency.  The man from Staffordshire,  England , was arrested today on
“suspicion of assisting or encouraging crime” in relation to a
so-called denial-of-service attack, London’s  Metropolitan Police
Service  said today. He was later released on bail.  Material including computers, telephones and associated
media storage devices were removed from the address as part of
the investigation by the Police Central e-Crime Unit. A denial-
of-service attack occurs when a website gets too many visits at
once causing the website to go offline.  The  Home Office  declined to comment on the case when
contacted by phone. A call to May’s office wasn’t immediately
returned.  “Assisting and encouraging cyber crime is a serious matter
and I would advise all persons to consider their actions and any
possible future consequences prior to posting any material
online,” Jason Tunn, a Met police detective inspector, said in
an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
