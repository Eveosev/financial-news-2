The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default was little changed
today, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was at 138 basis points
as of 11:13 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking Corp.
The index closed at 137.3 basis points in New York yesterday,
and has declined from 158.9 basis points this quarter, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan held at 117 basis points as of 8:18 a.m.
in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices show. The gauge has
traded between 114.4 and 134.6 since Sept. 30, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 201.5
basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. It closed yesterday at 202.3, the highest since Nov. 1,
CMA prices show.  The indexes are benchmarks for protecting bonds against
default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A
drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness, while an
increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
