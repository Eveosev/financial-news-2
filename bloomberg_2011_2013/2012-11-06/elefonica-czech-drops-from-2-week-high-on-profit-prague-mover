Telefonica Czech Republic AS (SPTT)  fell
from a two-week high after the country’s biggest phone company
said its third-quarter profit shrank more than analysts had
expected.  The shares of the Czech unit of Telefonica SA retreated 0.5
percent to 388 koruna by the close in Prague, snapping a two-day
gain. The  PX (PX)  equity index rose 0.7 percent.  Net income fell to 1.76 billion koruna ($89 million) in the
three months to September from 2.21 billion koruna a year
earlier as clients spent less on calls, the company said today.
That missed the average 1.83 billion-koruna estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue shrank 4 percent to 12.6
billion koruna.  “We are getting more and more cautious” because “both
revenues and profitability are on the slide,” Attila Gyurcsik,
an analyst at Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt. in Budapest, wrote in a
report today. “The sustainability of the ordinary 40 koruna-
per-share dividend is in question in the next couple of years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
