Blackstone Group LP (BX) , manager of the
world’s largest real estate fund, teamed with  Canada ’s biggest
pension-fund manager to buy loans backed by a 12 percent stake
in Paris landlord  Gecina SA. (GFC)   Affiliates of the Blackstone Real Estate Partners Europe
III fund and Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., the real estate investment
arm of Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, acquired about 40
percent of the outstanding bank loans made to two of Gecina’s
largest shareholders, according to a statement after the French
market closed yesterday. Blackstone didn’t say what percentage
of the venture each partner will hold.  Investment companies owned by former Gecina Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Joaquin Rivero and the Soler family
pledged their combined 31 percent stake in Gecina as collateral
for loans provided in 2006 by 13 European banks. There is 1.62
billion euros ($2.1 billion) of debt outstanding, they said last
month.  Rivero’s Alteco Gestion & Promocion de Marcas SL and Mag-
Import SL, owned by Victoria Soler and her husband, both filed
for creditor protection in Spain on Oct. 3 after refinancing
talks with the banks broke down.  Blackstone didn’t say how much of a discount it paid to
acquire the loans, which have a nominal value of about 640
million euros. The value of shares backing the loans is about
662 million euros, based on yesterday’s  closing price  in Paris.  Gecina is  France ’s third-largest real estate investment
trust, with a market value of 5.34 billion euros. The company is
also Paris’s largest publicly traded office landlord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
