The Egyptian government has decided
to ease a curfew on shops and restaurants intended to save
energy, after opposition from chambers of commerce and the
public, state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported.  Shops and restaurants in cities will be allowed to remain
open until midnight and 2am respectively, both two hours later
than the original proposal last month, Ahram said, citing
minister of trade and industry Hatem Saleh. The measure will
come into effect on Dec. 1, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
