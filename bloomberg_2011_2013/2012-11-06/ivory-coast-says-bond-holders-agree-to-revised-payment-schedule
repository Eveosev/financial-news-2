Ivory Coast , which failed to pay its
dollar debt during a political crisis last year, said bond
holders agreed to amended terms, including a revised interest
payment schedule and a waiver on defaults incurred.  The world’s biggest cocoa producer said 85.5 percent of
outstanding bond holders had consented to proposals by
yesterday, according to an e-mailed statement sent by Richard Creswell, a London-based spokesman for Lazard & Co., which is
advising the West African nation. Ivory Coast needed at least 75
percent to approve a revised payment schedule for three coupon
payments and the issuance of additional bonds, it said in the
statement.  Ivory Coast proposed last month it would repay 40 percent
of its coupon arrears in 2013 and 60 percent the year after as
debt servicing remains “significant” and as the government
pushes economic growth through investment. The government wants
to issue $186.7 million of additional bonds.  The previous government of President  Laurent Gbagbo 
defaulted on $2.3 billion of Eurobonds due 2032 in January 2011
during a post-election crisis when he refused to hand over power
to  Alassane Ouattara , who won a November 2010 vote. Ouattara’s
government started interest payments again in June.  The Eurobonds of the West African nation, which have jumped
78 percent this year, were little changed at 89.98 cents on the
dollar, yielding 7.1 percent, at 10:03 a.m. in  London , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
