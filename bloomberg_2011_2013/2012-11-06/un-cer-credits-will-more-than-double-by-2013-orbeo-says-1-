United Nations Certified Emission
Reduction credits will more than double to 2.50 euros ($3.20) a
metric ton next year after a European Union ban is enforced,
said Orbeo, which manages projects that create the credits.  The “EU-ETS bans act as regulatory cliffs, forcing supply
earlier in the market and distorting prices,” Carine Hemery, an
analyst at Orbeo in Paris, said in an e-mailed note.  CERs for December rose 4.8 percent today to 1.10 euros a
ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . They dropped
to a record 71 cents a ton on Oct. 25 on muted demand and
surging supply. The EU has banned some industrial-gas credits
starting in May next year and has proposed banning some Emission
Reduction Units issued after this year.  “With the vote for the Emission Reduction Unit ban
scheduled just two weeks before Phase 3 starts, turmoil is
likely in the CER/ERU market until year-end,” Hemery said. That
phase begins Jan. 1 and runs through 2020. Orbeo is a unit of
Solvay SA, the Brussels-based chemical company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
