European Union pig prices bottomed
out this week, with levels stabilizing in  Germany  and the
Netherlands, German industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. reported.  German pig prices were stable at 1.776 euros ($2.27) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds), halting a three-week slide, Damme,
Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on its website today. Prices
in Spain fell for a fourth week, while those in  France  declined
for a sixth week, the report showed.  Germany is the EU’s biggest pork producer, followed by
Spain and France, Eurostat data show. France slaughtered fewer
animals due to the Nov. 1 holiday, and prices there fell to the
lowest among the EU’s five biggest hog producers, ISN said.  “The European slaughter-pig market this week reached the
bottom and is in a consolidation phase,” ISN wrote. “French
pig breeders, in comparison with other European countries, in
the past six weeks faced the most extreme price decline.”  The EU has forecast output of pig meat in the bloc will
decline 3.2 percent next year on higher feed costs and new
animal welfare rules.  German pig prices last week fell to the lowest since the
week of Aug. 21, and are still up 13 percent from the same time
a year ago, ISN data show. Dutch pig prices were unchanged this
week at 1.714 euros a kilogram, while prices in Belgium and
 Austria  were also stable from last week.  French prices fell to 1.701 euros a kilogram from 1.724
euros last week, while those in Spain slipped to 1.837 euros
from 1.873 euros, according to ISN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
