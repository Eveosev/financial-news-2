Fifth-ranked  David Ferrer  overcame
former U.S. Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in three sets at
the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London.  Ferrer defeated the seventh-ranked Argentine, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4
at London’s O2 arena.  Ferrer, the only Spaniard at the ATP Finals in the absence
of the injured eleven-time Grand Slam champion  Rafael Nadal , is
having the best season of his career. The 30-year-old has won
seven titles, the most of anyone on the men’s tour.  Earlier in the day, six-time champion Roger Federer of
Switzerland cruised past Serbia’s Janko Tipsarevic, 6-3, 6-1.  The ATP World Tour Finals feature a round-robin format. The
top eight singles players and doubles pairs are divided into two
groups of four, with the top two in each section moving into the
semifinals.  U.S. Open champion  Andy Murray  of Britain and top-ranked
Novak Djokovic of Serbia, who both won their opening matches
earlier in the week, will play each other tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
