Even before the ( notoriously inaccurate ) exit polling comes in, here are some early voting numbers to chew on.  Bloomberg Businessweek's Joshua Green  received some early voting/absentee voting data from the  micropolling outfit  Catalist : "Colorado: 1,853,586 total votes -- 44% Democratic, 43% Republican, 12% Independent ... Ohio: 1,442,536 total votes -- 50% Democratic, 36% Republican, 14% Independent." According to former Republican strategist  Kevin Ruffini , there have been 51,167 "voted Obama" tweets in last day, 28,075 Romney. Dixville Notch, the New Hampshire hamlet where the  polls open at midnight , recorded a draw of five votes for Obama, five for Romney. The New York Observer's  Colin Campbell  reports that Obama spokesperson Stephanie Cutter told supporters they should “keep calm,” even if they hear news of strong  "turnout in Republican counties or exit polls, particularly early in the day." Paddy Power, the Irish online bookmaker, is  paying out  early to those who wagered on Obama.  (Tobin Harshaw writes editorials on national security for Bloomberg View. Follow him on  Twitter .)
