European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said nations that are taking steps to return to sound
finances should not target schooling in cost-cutting efforts.  “Those decisions should not come at the expense of
education,”  Van Rompuy  said, speaking by video to a conference
in Brussels.  Belgian Finance Minister Steven Vanackere said the EU needs
to include financial literacy in its arsenal of crisis-fighting
tools, which he said also includes the need to ensure there is
“no effort spared to put in place banking union.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
