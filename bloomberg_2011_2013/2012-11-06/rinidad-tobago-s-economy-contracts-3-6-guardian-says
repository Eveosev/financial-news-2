Trinidad & Tobago’s economy
contracted 3.6 percent in the second quarter from a year ago,
the Guardian  reported  today, citing a speech by Central Bank
President Jwala Rambarran.  The downturn was sharper than anticipated and means the
Caribbean nation’s economy has declined in five of the past six
quarters, the Port of Spain-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
