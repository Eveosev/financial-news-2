Serbia agreed with drugmakers and
wholesalers to repay a 26 billion-dinar ($293 million) debt owed
by state hospitals and the government-controlled health  fund 
through 2015.  The state will assume 13 billion dinars in debt owed by
state hospitals for drugs and other medical supplies as public
debt and repay it “in nominal value, without interest, over the
next three years, in equal quarterly installments,” the  Finance
Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Serbia will also shorten payment deadlines for the state-
owned Health Insurance Fund from 200 days to 150 days next year
and then reduce it to 120 days in 2014 and 90 days in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
