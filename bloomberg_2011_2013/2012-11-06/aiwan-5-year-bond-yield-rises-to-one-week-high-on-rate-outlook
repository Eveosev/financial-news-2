Taiwan ’s government bonds declined,
pushing the five-year yield to the highest level in more than
two weeks, on speculation the central bank will refrain from
cutting interest rates as inflation stays above 2 percent.  Consumer prices  rose 2.36 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics bureau said in Taipei yesterday, compared with an
average 1.3 percent in the past three years. Taiwan’s gross
domestic product  increased  1 percent in the third quarter, after
a 0.18 percent contraction in the previous three months,
according to preliminary data released on Oct. 31.  “With the CPI at more than 2 percent and GDP at 1 percent,
the governor of the central bank would not want to make any
changes to monetary policy,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income
trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July 2017
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.887 percent,
the highest level since Oct. 18, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed
at 0.387 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  The Central Bank of the  Republic of China  (Taiwan) kept its
benchmark  interest rate  at 1.875 percent on Sept. 20 for a fifth
straight review after inflation accelerated to a four-year high
of 3.43 percent in August and exports fell. Policy makers next
meet on Dec. 27.  Worst Performers  Taiwan’s bonds returned 3.3 percent in the past year, the
worst performance among 10 Asian local-currency debt indexes
tracked by HSBC Holdings Plc.  The  Taiwan dollar  appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$29.275
against its U.S. counterpart, data from Taipei Forex Inc. showed.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, increased 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 3.60 percent.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
NT$29.210, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts reached NT$29.245 today and yesterday, the weakest
level since Oct. 30, and are at a 0.2 percent premium to the
spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
