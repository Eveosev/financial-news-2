Drew Brees  threw two touchdown passes
and  Patrick Robinson  scored on a 99-yard interception return as
the New Orleans Saints beat Philadelphia 28-13 at home, sending
the Eagles to their fourth straight loss.  Chris Ivory also had a rushing touchdown for New Orleans
last night at the Superdome as the Saints (3-5) won for the
third time in their past four National Football League games.
The Eagles fell to 3-5.  The Saints missed a field goal on their opening drive, yet
took a 7-0 lead when Robinson intercepted a pass from Eagles
quarterback  Michael Vick  at the New Orleans 1-yard line and
raced the length of the field for a touchdown. While the pass
went off the hands of Eagles tight end Brent Celek, it was the
ninth interception of the season for Vick, who coach  Andy Reid 
considered benching last week in favor of rookie Nick Foles.  After a field goal by Philadelphia’s Alex Henery, Ivory
scored on a 22-yard run and Brees threw a 1-yard touchdown pass
to Marques Colston to give the Saints a 21-3 halftime lead.  The Eagles pulled within 21-13 midway through the third
quarter as Vick threw a 77-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson
and Henery added a 37-yard field goal. Brees threw a six-yard
touchdown pass to  Jimmy Graham  in the closing minutes of the
third quarter to push the Saints’ lead back to 28-13.  Any chance for an Eagles comeback ended when Celek fumbled
at the New Orleans 8-yard line with about three minutes
remaining. It was the sixth time this season that Philadelphia
has had a turnover within an opponent’s 20-yard line, the most
in the NFL.  Brees completed 21-of-27 passes for 239 yards, while Vick
connected on 22-of-41 attempts for 272 yards and was sacked
seven times. Vick rushed for 53 yards and  LeSean McCoy  rushed
for 119 yards on 19 carries for the Eagles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
