Bacho Akhalaia,  Georgia ’s former
interior minister, has been detained after several hours of
questioning, according to his lawyer.  Charges will be brought today, the lawyer, David
Dekanoidze, told reporters yesterday. Akhalaia served as defense
minister and then as interior minister before resigning in
September after a public outcry over graphic footage showing
prison guards beating and raping male inmates with a broom
handle and truncheon.  The questioning concerned Akhalaia’s tenure as defense
minister, not the prison scandal, according to Dekanoidze. The
prison abuse case has embarrassed the administration of
President Mikheil Saakashvili.  To contact the reporter on this story:
