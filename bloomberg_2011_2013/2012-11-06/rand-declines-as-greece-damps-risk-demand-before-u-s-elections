The rand gained for a second day as
investors awaited the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election
and after commodity prices rose, boosting  South Africa ’s export
prospects.  The currency advanced as much as 0.5 percent and traded 0.4
percent stronger at 8.6857 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due
December 2026 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 7.65 percent, the lowest since Oct. 22.  U.S. voters decide today between giving President  Barack
Obama  another four years in office or replacing him with
Republican challenger  Mitt Romney . Prices of metals including
copper nickel rose before data this week that may show the U.S.
economy stabilising.  “Commodity prices obviously have contributed” to the
rand’s rally, William van Rijn, a currency trader at Nedbank
Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by phone. “The rand has been
holding up relatively well, although volumes were light,
exacerbating the move.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw material advanced
1.1 percent, the most since Oct. 9. Metals and other commodities
account for 45 percent of South Africa’s exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
