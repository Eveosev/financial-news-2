Andritz AG (ANDR) , the world’s second-
biggest hydropower turbine maker, said it’s unclear how many
large contracts it will get after third-quarter orders dropped.  Orders fell 1.2 percent to 1.24 billion euros ($1.6
billion), the Graz, Austria-based company said today in a
statement. Net income dropped 5.6 percent to 58.5 million euros
as sales gained 7.9 percent to 1.27 billion euros. Analysts had
forecast 60.4 million euros net income on revenue of 1.27
billion euros, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The visibility of upcoming projects and the award of
orders have shortened significantly, particularly for large-
scale investments,” Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Leitner
said in the statement. The company said it expects sales to rise
to about 5 billion euros this year.  Andritz, which has risen 49 percent this year on the Vienna
stock exchange, has been expanding outside  Austria  to boost
sales and profit. It won contracts to supply equipment in
countries including China and  Laos  in the last quarter. Andritz
this year took over Schuler AG, a German maker of metal-forming
machines.  While Andritz said this year’s earnings are expected to top
2011, the company cautioned investors about the future.  “If the global economy should deteriorate further in the
coming months, this may have a negative impact on the Group’s
earnings,” Andritz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
