Australia’s building  industry shrank
in October at a slower pace as housing showed signs of recovery
following interest-rate reductions, a private gauge showed.  The construction performance index was 35.8 last month
compared with 30.9 in September, a survey by the Australian
Industry Group and the Housing Industry Association released in
Sydney today showed. A reading below 50 represents a
contraction, and the gauge has been under that level for 29
months.  Australia ’s construction industry is struggling even after
the Reserve Bank lowered its benchmark borrowing cost by a total
of 1.5 percentage points since Nov. 1 last year. Governor Glenn Stevens indicated signs of improvement when he kept rates
unchanged at 3.25 percent yesterday.  Construction “took a turn for the better,” Peter Burn,
the Australian Industry Group’s director of public policy, said
in a statement. “This was most noticeable in the long-suffering
house building sub-sector.”  House building surged 12.5 points to 41, and commercial
construction advanced 7.8 points to 37.4, today’s report showed.
Construction of apartments edged up 1.6 points to 27.6 while
engineering gained 2.4 points to 35.1.  New orders rose 7.7 points to 36.8, while a gauge of
employment slid 1 point to 32 last month, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
