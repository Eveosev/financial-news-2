Euro-area  producer-price inflation 
held steady in September as slower energy-cost growth offset
higher prices for intermediate and non-durable  consumer goods .  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation euro region rose 2.7
percent from a year earlier after a similar increase in August,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists had forecast an increase of 2.6 percent, the median
of 19 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. From the
prior month, prices gained 0.2 percent.  Energy costs on the producer level rose an annual 7 percent
in September after an 8.1 percent increase in the previous
month, the statistics office said. Prices of intermediate goods
rose 0.7 percent after a 0.2 percent increase in August, while
non-durable consumer goods were up 2.4 percent.  In  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, producer prices rose
1.7 percent from a year earlier, after increasing 1.6 percent in
the previous month, today’s data showed. France reported a gain
of 2.8 percent, with prices in Spain and Portugal increasing 3.8
percent and 4.6 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
