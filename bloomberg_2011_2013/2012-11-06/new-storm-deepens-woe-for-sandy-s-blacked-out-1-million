About 650,000 power customers, most in New York and  New Jersey , remain without power because of  Hurricane Sandy  as another storm brings high winds, rain and snow to the U.S. Northeast.  According to a Bloomberg tally of utility company websites, 627,000 homes and businesses are blacked out in New York and New Jersey, down from a peak of 4.7 million. Connecticut utilities reported about 750 customers without power, from as many as 626,000 that lost electricity.  Sandy knocked out power to more than 8.5 million homes and businesses in 21 states after making landfall in southern New Jersey on Oct. 29, according to the  U.S. Energy Department .  Gusts as intense as 60 miles (97 kilometers) an hour accompanied by rain, sleet and snow are forecast to hit  New York  about midday, according to the  National Weather Service .
