The European Union aims to propose
“in the coming days” tighter rules on fluorinated greenhouse
gases as a part of the bloc’s sustainable development drive,
Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said today.  Hedegaard said she hoped national governments and the
European Parliament will give “a high priority” to the planned
draft revised regulation on the so-called F-gases.  EU regulation already in place would lead to the
stabilization of fluorinated gas emissions at current levels,
which is not enough to reach the bloc’s long-term goal to cut
pollution by 80 to 95 percent by 2050, Hedegaard told a
conference in Brussels today.  F-gases are used mainly as substitutes for ozone-depleting
substances and have a high global warming potential. They
include hydrofluorocarbons, used in refrigeration and air-
conditioning, perfluorocarbons used typically in the electronics
sectors and in the cosmetic industry and sulfur hexafluoride,
used as an insulation gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
