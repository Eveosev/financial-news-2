Ukrainian central bank will have the
right to determine the amount and terms of obligatory sales of
currency earnings after parliament approved a law to support the
hryvnia.  The bill, prepared by the National Bank of Ukraine, was
supported by 237 lawmakers in the 450-seat legislature. Under
the new regulation, the central bank will determine how much
foreign currency earnings companies will have to exchange into
hryvnia on the interbank market and when.  The introduction of obligatory sales “will increase the
supply of foreign currency on the interbank market and will ease
the pressure on central bank reserves,” said Vladislav
Sochinsky, the treasurer at Citigroup Inc.’s Ukrainian unit,
said in e-mailed comments.  “The fact that the regulator will
have the freedom to decide the amount of sale and tenor is
positive and clearly increases the flexibility in the decision-
making process.”  Ukraine’s central bank regulates the exchange rate of the
hryvnia by buying and selling dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
