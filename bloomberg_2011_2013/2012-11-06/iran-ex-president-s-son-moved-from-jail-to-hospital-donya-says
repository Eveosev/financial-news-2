The son of former Iranian President
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was transferred to a hospital from
a Tehran jail following heart complications,  Donya-e-Eqtesad 
reported, citing his lawyer Mahmoud Alizadeh-Tabatabai.  Mehdi Hashemi was taken to the hospital yesterday after
doctors requested an angiography, the Tehran-based newspaper
said. Hashemi will be back behind bars following the procedure,
Alizadeh-Tabatabai said.  Hashemi, who had spent three years in the U.K., was
arrested on Sept. 24, a day after his return to  Iran . He is
accused of inciting unrest after the disputed re-election of
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  in 2009, which led to street
protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
