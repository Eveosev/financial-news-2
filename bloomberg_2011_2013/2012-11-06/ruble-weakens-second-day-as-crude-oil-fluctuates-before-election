The ruble slid for the second day as
crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, swung between gains and
losses before presidential elections in the U.S.  The ruble weakened 0.3 percent to 31.5524 per dollar by
12:19 p.m. in Moscow. The markets were closed yesterday for a
national holiday. The currency rose 0.2 percent to 40.3120
versus the euro and was little changed at 35.4921 versus the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket.  Oil dropped as much as 0.2 percent to $85.45 before trading
at $85.51. Crude and natural gas account for about 50 percent of
Russia’s state revenue. U.S. voters decide today whether to
return  Barack Obama  as president or elect his challenger  Mitt
Romney .  Bank Rossii plans to review  interest rates  on Nov. 9. The
regulator will probably leave the  refinancing rate  on hold at
8.25 percent, according to a median estimate of 21 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 32.0218 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  dropped one basis point to 191,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields gained two basis points to
7.0840 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
