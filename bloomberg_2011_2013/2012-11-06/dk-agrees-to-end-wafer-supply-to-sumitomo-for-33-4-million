LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the solar-wafer maker
that’s reported five straight quarterly losses, agreed to
terminate a contract to supply products to  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  for a
$33.4 million settlement.  The Chinese manufacturer under the original contract was to
supply wafers used in making solar cells from 2009 to 2016,
while Japan-based Sumitomo prepaid a portion of the contract
value, LDK said today in a  statement .  The contract ends as the industry is facing an oversupply
and declining profits. The average price of multicrystalline
wafers has plunged 21 percent this year to 88 U.S. cents a
piece, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  “We are pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable
conclusion to our 2008 wafer supply contract with Sumitomo” and
will work with customers to tackle “current industry
challenges,” Peng Xiaofeng, who stepped down as LDK’s chief
executive officer yesterday and remains as chairman, said in the
statement.  LDK, based in Xinyu, Jiangxi, said it is evaluating the
financial impact of the termination on its earnings this year.
The company in September reported a fifth straight quarterly
loss of $254.3 million in the three months ended Jun. 30.  Sumitomo spokeswoman Sayaka Ito confirmed the termination
of the contract and that it agreed to pay LDK $33.4 million. She
declined to say why the contract was ended, citing
confidentiality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
