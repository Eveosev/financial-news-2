South Africa  reduced the weightings
of food and transport costs, while increasing those for
education and electricity in its  consumer inflation  index to
better reflect current spending in the economy.  The index will include prices of 393 goods from January,
less than the 402 in the current basket,  Patrick Kelly ,
executive manager of price statistics at the data agency, said
in Johannesburg today. CPI will also be rebased to 2012 prices
from 2008, he said.  The government is seeking to update how it calculates
consumer price increases more frequently to take into account
changes in spending patterns in  Africa ’s biggest economy.
Reweighting the basket will happen every three years starting in
2003. The last adjustment was in 2009 and the change was
previously done every five years.  Food and non-alcoholic beverages will probably represent
17.5 percent of goods in the total-country basket, down from
18.3 percent previously, Kelly said. The weighting is based on
March consumer inflation data and will be updated again in
December, he said.  The food weighting in CPI for urban areas, which the agency
publishes as headline inflation, declines to 14.8 percent from
15.7 percent and rises to 24.1 percent for housing from 22.6
percent, Kelly said.  Power Prices  Inflation accelerated to 5.5 percent in September from 5
percent a month earlier, remaining within the central bank’s 3
percent to 6 percent target for a fifth month, Statistics South
Africa said Oct. 24. Higher food and fuel prices, and a weaker
rand, are risks to the inflation outlook, according to Reserve
Bank Governor  Gill Marcus . The statistics agency didn’t say how
the changes announced today will affect inflation.  Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the state-owned electricity
company, is seeking to raise prices by an average 16 percent
annually for five years, it said Oct. 22. The cost of gasoline
has climbed 14 percent this year, according to Department of
Energy data.  Gasoline, which forms part of the transport sub-index, will
make up 4.68 percent of total-country CPI using the March
inflation calculation compared with 3.61 percent previously,
while electricity will rise to 3.55 percent from 2.18 percent,
the agency said. For urban areas, the gasoline weighting
increases to 4.9 percent from 3.93 percent and to 3.56 percent
for electricity from 1.87 percent, it said.  Feta Cheese  The rand pared gains after the changes were announced,
strengthening 0.3 percent to 8.6902 against the dollar at 3:50
p.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on the government’s 6.75 percent
bonds due March 2021 fell one basis points, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 6.66 percent.  The new weights are calculated using data collected in the
income and expenditure survey conducted in the 12 months through
August 2011. The statistics agency will also publish an index
that will remove volatile items by throwing out goods that show
the largest and smallest price changes in a month.  The new basket will add feta cheese, bread rolls, bricks,
vodka, cement and tablet computers, the statistics agency said.
It will remove savory biscuits, frozen vegetables, dried lentils
and peas, and vienna sausages, the agency said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
