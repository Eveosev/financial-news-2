The cost for banks to borrow dollars
increased to the highest level in more than a month in European
money markets.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 26 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9:27 a.m. in
 London , compared with minus 25.7 basis points yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most
expensive since Oct. 3.  The one-year basis swap was at 25.3 basis points, or 0.253
percentage point, below Euribor, from minus 25.5 basis points
yesterday.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another was little changed, with the difference
between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-
OIS spread, at 11.6 basis points, from 11.5 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.09
percent yesterday, little changed from the end of last week. The
Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs
over the next three months, was little changed at 8.3 basis
points.  Lenders left  overnight deposits  at the  European Central
Bank  unchanged at 261 billion euros ($334 billion) yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
