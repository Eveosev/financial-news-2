Fossil Inc. (FOSL) , the maker of the
namesake watch brand, fell the most in almost six months after
reporting sales that trailed analystsâ€™ estimates.  Fossil  slumped  10 percent to $84.24 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since May 8. The shares have advanced
6.1 percent this year.  Third-quarter sales rose 6.4 percent to $684.2 million, the
Richardson, Texas-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts projected $713.5 million, the average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Fossil also lowered its fourth-quarter
 sales  forecast by about 4 percentage points, to a 12 percent
increase, because of slowing European growth. Analysts
anticipated a 16 percent gain.  Net income in the third quarter rose 10 percent to $76.8
million, or $1.26 a share, from $69.6 million, or $1.09, a year
earlier, Fossil said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
