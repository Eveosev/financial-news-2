Peruvian bonds rallied, pushing
yields down the most in five weeks, as local investors bought
the securities following a selloff by foreigners in anticipation
of today’s U.S. presidential election.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bonds due in August 2020 dropped three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage points, to 4.31 percent at 11:43 a.m. in
 Lima , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That is the
steepest decrease on a closing basis since Sept. 27. The price
rose 0.24 centimo to 112.97 centimos per sol. A decline in the
bonds yesterday pushed the yield up seven basis points.  “There was a selloff by offshore investors restructuring
their holdings in light of the elections today,” Walther Benavides, a trader at BBVA Banco Continental in Lima, said by
phone today. “Local investors see current levels as
attractive.”  Foreign investors have reduced their holdings of Peruvian
debt during the past week as U.S. polling showed a close race
between President  Barack Obama  and Republican  Mitt Romney ,
Benavides said.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries decreased two basis
points to 113 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The sol slid 0.3 percent to 2.6105 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
