AB  Ukio Bankas (UKB1L)  Group,  Lithuania ’s
biggest publicly traded bank, fell to the lowest in almost four
years after saying it took ownership of a sports arena developer
from borrowers who pledged the company as collateral.  The shares fell as much as 4 percent on the Nasdaq OMX
Vilnius exchange in the Lithuanian capital, closing down 2.6
percent at 0.148 euros ($0.19), the lowest since Dec. 1, 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Volume of 298,999
shares was five times the three-month average.  Ukio Bankas increased its stake in UAB Zalgirio Sporto
Arena to 100 percent by taking over 94.9 percent of shares,
valued at 357 million litai ($132 million), from debtors, the
lender said in a statement before trading today. Its shares have
fallen during five of the last six trading sessions since Oct.
29, when the bank reported a group net loss of 44 million litai
for nine months of this year.  By taking over the shares of the stadium developer, the
bank said it would “be able to accelerate the development and
implementation of the real estate project carried out by the
company, and also will avoid possible loan impairment losses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
