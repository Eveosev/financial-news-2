The euro is likely to extend its 1.3
percent drop in the past three sessions against the  U.S. dollar 
this week, according to IG Markets Securities Ltd., which cited
trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency has fallen below its 200-day moving
average and continues to trade below it, according to Junichi Ishikawa, a Tokyo-based analyst at IG Markets. “The euro has
broken the $1.28 level after falling below its 200-day moving
average and technical indicators are suggesting further
declines,” he said.  The $1.2755 level, which the euro failed to break below on
Sept. 10 and Sept. 11, will act as an initial support, Ishikawa
said. Should the euro fall below that level, it could test
$1.2739, near the 38.2 percent retracement from its rise from
the July 24 low of $1.2043 to the Sept. 17 high of $1.3172 on
the Fibonacci chart, he said. The euro last touched $1.2739 on
Sept. 7.  The shared currency was little changed at $1.2787 as of
10:55 a.m. in  Tokyo  from $1.2796 yesterday, when it touched
$1.2767, the weakest since Sept. 11.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a new high or a
low. Support refers to an area on a chart where analysts predict
that orders to buy may be clustered. In  technical analysis ,
investors and analysts study charts of trading patterns to
forecast changes in a security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
