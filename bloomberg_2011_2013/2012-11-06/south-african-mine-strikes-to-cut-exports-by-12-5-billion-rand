Strikes in South Africa’s mining
industry are expected to reduce exports by 12.5 billion rand
($1.4 billion) and cut gross domestic product by 0.5 percentage
point this year, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  The strikes have cut gold and platinum output by 10.1
billion rand and coal production by 180 million rand, and it’s
not known how much of those losses can be recouped, Gordhan said
in a written reply to a parliamentary question today.  Violent labor unrest in the mining industry began in
January with a stoppage by workers at  Impala Platinum Holdings
Ltd. (IMP) , the world’s second-largest platinum producer, that left
four people dead. At least 46 people died during an illegal six-
week strike that began Aug. 10 at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana platinum
mine, 34 of them killed by police. Labor action has also shut
shafts owned by  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  and
other companies.  “Export losses exceed direct losses as mining has strong
linkages with other sectors of the economy, which are also
negatively affected,” he wrote. “Amongst the sectors most
affected are fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment,
rubber and basic iron and steel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
