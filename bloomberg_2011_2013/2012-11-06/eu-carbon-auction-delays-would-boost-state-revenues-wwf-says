Delaying the sale of 1.2 billion
European Union carbon permits would boost revenues of national
governments by 7 billion euros ($8.96 billion), a report
commissioned by environmental lobbies WWF and Greenpeace showed.  Revenues from auctioning carbon-dioxide allowances by EU
 member states  would increase to 92 billion euros in the
2013-2020 trading period in the region’s emissions trading
system should the bloc agree to delay some auctions by five
years, according to the report based on modelling by Oeko-
Institut e.V. in Berlin and published today.  Withholding 1.4 billion permits for at least 10 years would
raise auctioning revenues by 12 billion euros to 97 billion
euros and increasing the EU domestic greenhouse-gas reduction
target to 25 percent from the current 20 percent would add about
63 billion euros, according to the  report .  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm, is due
to propose on Nov. 14 a specific number of permits whose
auctions could be postponed to a later stage in the next trading
period, known as Phase 3. The strategy, which needs approval by
member states to be enacted, is known as backloading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
