China  initiated World Trade
Organization proceedings to seek a ruling on whether some
European Union nations violated global commerce rules through
their green energy programs.  China has begun WTO dispute settlement procedures after it
accused some EU countries of providing subsidies for power
generated by solar plants outfitted mainly with components made
in EU countries or the European Economic Zone, Shen Danyang, a
spokesman for China’s  Ministry of Commerce , said in a  statement 
posted on the ministry’s website yesterday.  Such subsides violate national treatment and most-favored-
nation treatment under the WTO rules and “seriously” harm
exports of Chinese photovoltaic products and damage China’s
legitimate rights as a WTO member, Shen said.  The case follows anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes China
started last week into solar-grade polysilicon imported from the
EU, which in September opened an investigation into whether
Chinese manufactures sold solar panels and cells and wafers used
in them at a loss.  Trade disputes are escalating as the solar industry
struggles with a supply glut and shrinking profits. The global
average spot price of polysilicon in the week beginning Oct. 22
dropped to a record of $18.3 a kilogram, according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance.  Yesterday’s statement didn’t specify which countries are
targeted in the case. Italy and  Greece  offered extra subsidies
for projects that use EU-produced solar-power equipment, the
official Xinhua News Agency  reported , citing Yang Guohua, deputy
head of the commerce ministry’s treaty and laws department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
