BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , Franceâ€™s largest
bank, hired  Vassili Serebriakov  as a currency strategist in the
New York office.  Formerly with Wells Fargo & Co. in New York, Serebriakov
said he will report to Steve Saywell, the head of foreign-
exchange strategy in London.  Cesaltine Gregorio, a New York-based spokeswoman for BNP,
confirmed the hire.  Serebriakov succeeded Mary Nicola, who departed the firm
Oct. 5. Nicola said she is moving to Singapore with her husband,
 David Mann  of Standard Chartered Bank, who has accepted a
position as regional head of research for Asia. Mann was
regional head of research of the Americas at Standard Chartered
in New York.  Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo
in New York, said the company is working to replace Serebrikov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
