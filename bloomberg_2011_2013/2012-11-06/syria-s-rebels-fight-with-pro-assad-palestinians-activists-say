Syria ’s rebels and allied Palestinian
opponents of Bashar al-Assad clashed with Palestinian supporters
of the president in the capital’s Yarmouk refugee camp,
according to an activist group.  The fighting between the anti-Assad groups and members of
the pro-regime Popular Committees were particularly intense on
the camp’s Falastin and Urooba roads, the opposition Syrian
Observatory for  Human Rights  said on its  Facebook  page. It said
the camp and southern neighborhoods of Damascus have been the
scene of several gunbattles between the groups in recent days.  Five people were killed yesterday when gunmen fired a
mortar round at a bus in the camp, state-run SANA news agency
said. At least 75 people were killed across Syria today,
including 26 in Damascus and its suburbs, the Local Coordination
Committees in Syria said.  Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  met the former
Syrian Prime Minister Riad Hijab in  Jordan  today, according to a
statement posted on Hijab’s website. Hijab, who defected in
August, told Lavrov that a political solution or negotiations
won’t be possible until Assad leaves power, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
