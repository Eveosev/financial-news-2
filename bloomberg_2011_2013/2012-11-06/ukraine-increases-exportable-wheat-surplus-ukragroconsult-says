The Ukrainian government has
increased its exportable wheat surplus to 5.5 million metric
tons for the season which started July 1, agricultural
researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Ukraine’s shipment will not threaten  food security ,
UkrAgroConsult said on its website today, citing Agriculture
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk. The country exports about 5
million tons a year on average.  “The government is not going to take radical steps not
coordinated with traders to limit grain exports,” Kiev-based
UkrAgroConsult reported, citing Prysyazhnyuk.  Ukraine has exported 4.1 million tons of wheat since July
1, UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
