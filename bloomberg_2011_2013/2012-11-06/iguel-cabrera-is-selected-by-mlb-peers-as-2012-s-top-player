Miguel Cabrera  of the Detroit Tigers
was selected by his peers as the 2012 Player of the Year and the
American League’s Outstanding Player following a season in which
he became  Major League Baseball ’s first Triple Crown winner in
45 years.  The Tigers’ All-Star third baseman was honored in the
Players Choice Awards after batting .330 with 44 home runs and
139 runs batted in. He was the first hitter to win the sport’s
Triple Crown since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967, helping the Tigers
win the AL Central Division title and first pennant since 2006.  Two of Cabrera’s top challengers for the player of the year
award also were honored last night, as Los Angeles Angels
centerfielder Mike Trout was selected as the AL’s Outstanding
Rookie and Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Andrew McCutchen was
tabbed as the NL’s Outstanding Player.  New York Mets knuckleballer R.A. Dickey and  David Price  of
the Tampa Bay Rays were chosen as the outstanding pitchers in
the NL and AL, respectively, while Cincinnati Reds third baseman
Todd Frazier was tabbed as the NL’s outstanding rookie.  AL Comeback Player of the Year honors went to  Adam Dunn  of
the Chicago White Sox, who led the league with 41 home runs, a
season after having 11 homers and missing 40 games because of
injury. Buster Posey of the World Series-champion San Francisco
Giants is the NL Comeback Player of the Year after coming back
from a season-ending ankle injury in 2011.  Atlanta Braves third baseman  Chipper Jones , who announced
his retirement in May after 18 seasons, was recognized for his
“outstanding character and charitable work” by receiving the
2012 Marvin Miller Man of the Year award.  To contact the reporter on this story:
