The U.S. Energy Department raised its
estimate for gasoline demand in 2012 and decreased its forecast
for prices at the pump.  Gasoline  consumption  will average 8.73 million barrels a
day, down from 8.75 million in 2011, the Energy Department’s
Energy Information Administration said today in its monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook . Last month’s projection was 8.72
million barrels.  The department estimated 2013 consumption at 8.73 million
barrels a day, down from the October forecast of 8.74 million.  Regular-grade gasoline will average $3.64 a gallon this
year, down from $3.65 in last month’s forecast. Prices may
average $3.44 in 2013, in line with the previous estimate.  Distillate demand, including heating oil and diesel, will
fall drop 3.1 percent to 3.78 million barrels a day this year,
down from the October forecast of 3.79 million. Consumption next
year is estimated to be 3.84 million barrels daily, unchanged
from last month’s outlook.  The department expects households heating primarily with
oil to spend an average of about $2,526 between Oct. 1 and March
31. That’s 21 percent higher than last winter as a result of a
3.3 percent increase in prices and a 17 percent increase in
consumption. The October  forecast  projected spending would rise
20 percent to an average of about $2,494, as prices rose 1.8
percent and fuel use increased 17 percent.  About 6 percent of U.S. households depend on heating oil
for space heating. The Northeast accounts for about 80 percent
of these households.  Total U.S. fuel demand may drop 1.5 percent to 18.66
million barrels a day this year, down from October’s outlook of
18.67 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
