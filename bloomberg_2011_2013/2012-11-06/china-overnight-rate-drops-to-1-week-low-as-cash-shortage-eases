China ’s overnight money-market rate
dropped to the lowest level in more than a week on optimism a
record fund injection last week by the central bank has helped
ease a cash shortage in the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China added 277 billion  yuan  ($44.4
billion) today via reverse-repurchase contracts, according to a
trader required to bid at the auctions. It provided 395 billion
yuan a week ago, the most according to Bloomberg data going back
to 2004. The lower reverse-repo amount shows cash demand eased,
said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co.  “Short-term liquidity has improved a lot,” said Liu in
Shenzhen at China Merchants, the nation’s sixth-biggest lender.  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 2.52 percent as of 10:17 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. That was the lowest since Oct. 25.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined one
basis point to 3.20 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bond due August
2017 dropped six basis points to 3.15 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
