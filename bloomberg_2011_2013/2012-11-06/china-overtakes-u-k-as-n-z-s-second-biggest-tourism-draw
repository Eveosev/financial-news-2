Chinese visitors became  New Zealand ’s
second-biggest spenders from abroad, overtaking tourists from
the U.K., a government report showed.  Chinese visitor spending rose 37 percent to NZ$555 million
($458 million) in the 12 months through Sept. 30 from a year
earlier, according to  government figures  published today.
Spending by U.K. visitors fell 6 percent to NZ$545 million and
purchases by Australians were little changed at NZ$1.66 billion.  Spending by Chinese visitors has surged 74 percent in three
years while purchases by U.K. and U.S. tourists have slumped by
more than 30 percent as the global financial crisis curbed
growth in those economies, according to government figures.  “In the last three years  China  has overtaken  Japan , the
U.S. and now the U.K. tourist markets,” Peter Ellis, manager of
tourism research and evaluation, said in an e-mailed statement.
The increase in spending by Chinese visitors in the past year
matches the gain in arrivals, he said.  New Zealand’s total tourist spending fell 2 percent to
NZ$5.49 billion even as the number of visitors rose 1.8 percent,
today’s report showed. The figures are the first to exclude some
of the foreign fans that attended the  Rugby World Cup  in
September and October last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
