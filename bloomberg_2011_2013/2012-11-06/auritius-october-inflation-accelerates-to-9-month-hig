Mauritius’s annual inflation rate
advanced for a second straight month in October, reaching the
highest level since January, as milk and motor vehicles prices
rose.  Inflation accelerated to 4.2 percent from 3.9 percent in
September, the Port Louis-based Statistics Mauritius said in a
 statement  on its website today. Prices rose 0.2 percent during
the month, it said.  The average inflation rate for the 12 months through
October, a measure used to determine annual wages, declined to
4.3 percent from 4.4 percent in September, according to the data
agency.  The Bank of Mauritius’s Monetary Policy Committee is
scheduled to meet on Nov. 26. The committee has cut the interest
rate by 50 basis points or 0.5 percentage point this year. At
its Sept. 24 meeting, the rate was maintained at 4.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
