A glut of the largest  oil tankers  in
the  Persian Gulf  was poised to remain unchanged for a second
week, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  There are 17.5 percent more very large crude carriers for
hire over the next 30 days than there are likely cargoes, the
median  estimate  in a survey of six shipbrokers and owners today
showed. That’s the same as on Oct. 30 and Oct. 23, according to
previous surveys.  VLCCs on the Saudi Arabia-to-Japan voyage, the benchmark
route for supertankers sailing to Asia, are  losing  $1,799 daily,
figures from the  Baltic Exchange  in London showed. Returns were
positive in only four sessions so far in the second half. Each
vessel can hold 2 million barrels of oil.  The exchange’s assessments don’t reflect speed cuts aimed
at reducing fuel costs, the main expense for owners, who can
boost returns by slowing tankers on return journeys after
unloading cargoes. The price of fuel, or  bunkers , slid 1 percent
to $615.13 a metric ton, the lowest level since July 26, data
compiled by Bloomberg from 25 ports showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
