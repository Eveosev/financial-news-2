BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of  Latin
America ’s biggest securities exchange, posted third-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates as trading volume
dropped, curbing revenue growth.  Adjusted net income was 378.5 million reais ($186.3
million), compared with an average estimate of 385.3 million
reais, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income fell
5.3 percent to 276.5 million reais, while revenue rose 5.7
percent from a year ago to 521.6 million reais, the company said
in a regulatory filing yesterday.  Average daily trading volume in derivatives fell 20 percent
from the previous three months to 2.7 million contracts on
speculation the central bank’s cycle of interest-rate cuts is
ending. After lowering the benchmark Selic 5.25 percentage
points since August 2011, policy makers are expected to hold it
at 7.25 percent at the meeting scheduled to end on Nov. 28,
according to a central bank survey of about 100 economists
published Nov. 5.  There was “a loss of momentum against the relatively
strong numbers posted in the previous quarter” because of
“modest” trading volume in derivatives, Alexandre Spada, an
analyst at Banco Itau BBA SA in  Sao Paulo , wrote in a note to
clients on Oct. 22.  Average trading volume in stocks was 7.2 billion reais in
the third quarter, a 6.1 percent decline from the previous three
months and a 8.7 percent growth from a year earlier, according
to the filing.  Shares have jumped 41 percent this year, while the Bovespa
index rose 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
