EDP Renovaveis (EDPR)  SA, the renewable-
energy division of Portuguese utility  EDP-Energias de Portugal
SA , agreed to sell a 49 percent stake in four U.S. wind farms
for $230 million.  The stake will be sold to Borealis Infrastructure, which
manages investments for the Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System, the unit of Lisbon-based EDP said today in a
regulatory filing.  The wind farms have an installed capacity of 599 megawatts
and are located in  Minnesota , Illinois, Texas and  Oregon . All
sell their electricity under long-term power purchase
agreements, according to EDP Renovaveis.  EDP Renovaveis had 7.5 gigawatts of capacity at the end of
2011 and said in May it plans to spend 3.2 billion euros ($4.1
billion) through 2015 on wind capacity. It plans to add 2.3
gigawatts of wind generation, including 500 megawatts this year,
in markets such as Poland, Romania and  Brazil .  The Portuguese government last year agreed to sell a 21
percent  stake  in EDP to China Three Gorges Corp. for 2.69
billion euros. The Chinese company will also spend 2 billion
euros to purchase minority stakes in EDP wind farms until 2015
and help offer possible additional funding for EDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
