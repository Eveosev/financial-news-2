     Nov. 6 (Bloomberg) --Treasury 10-year notes fell for the
first time in three days as a U.S. sale of $32 billion of three-
year debt drew lower-than-average demand while investors awaited
the outcome of the presidential election.  Longer maturities led the decline as U.S. voters head to
the polls to decide whether President  Barack Obama  or challenger
 Mitt Romney  will face the job of avoiding the so-called fiscal
cliff of $607 billion in spending cuts and tax increases
scheduled to take effect in January. The yield at the note sale,
the first of three auctions this week totaling $72 billion,
exceeded dealers’ forecasts.  “There is a great deal of uncertainty associated with the
election, and more importantly, the ramifications for the fiscal
cliff,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The auction was
pretty average.”  The benchmark 10-year yield climbed seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 1.75 percent at 5:03 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625
percent note due in August 2022 fell 19/32, or $5.94 per $1,000
face amount, to 98 28/32.  The  yield  on the current three-year note rose four basis
points to 0.41 percent.  Election Day  Obama led Romney 48 percent to 45 percent in an Oct. 31-
Nov. 3 national poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, a
survey that showed the candidates tied at 47 percent a week ago.
The final tracking poll by ABC News and the  Washington  Post had
Obama taking a lead of 50 percent to 47 percent in a survey of
2,345 likely voters conducted Nov. 1-4.  Returns on U.S. fixed-income assets have averaged 6.5
percent throughout Obama’s term, exceeding the 4.6 percent
during the previous four years under  George W. Bush , according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Ever since  Lyndon B. Johnson  defeated  Barry Goldwater  for
the presidency in 1964, yields on 10-year Treasuries have
dropped about 40 basis points in the first month when a Democrat
wins, and risen 19 after a Republican victory, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ten-year Treasury yields will rise to two percent if Romney
wins versus a decline to 1.5 percent if Obama wins, according to
Barclays Plc, a primary dealer.  Race Results  “If Obama wins, the initial reaction might still be some
modest buying of fixed income, on the view that the Fed will be
encouraged to proceed” with its bond-buying program, Steven Englander, head of Group of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup
Inc. in  New York , wrote in an e-mailed note. A Romney victory
would result in a “broad sell-off” of fixed income, he said.  Credit swaps protecting the debt of the U.S. traded at 36.4
basis points as of 12:04 p.m. in New York, after rising the most
since April 23 to 36.9 basis points yesterday, according to data
provider CMA which is owned by McGraw Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The measure reached 29.5 basis points, the lowest level in
four weeks, on Oct. 25. The contracts typically rise as investor
confidence deteriorates and fall as it improves.  “The general tone of U.S. credit-default swap movement
would suggest continued stalemate and contentious atmosphere in
Washington,” said  Adrian Miller , director of global market
strategy at GMP Securities LLC in New York.  Auction Outcome  The three-year notes yielded 0.392 percent at the auction,
compared with a forecast of 0.383 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 3.41, the least since April
and compared with an average of 3.59 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 25.1 percent of the notes, the lowest
since May 2007 and compared with an average of 32.9 percent for
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 22.3 percent of
the notes at the sale, the second most since January, 2010,
compared with an average of 10.8 percent for the past 10
auctions.  The auction was “very average,” Brett Rose, an interest-
rate strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York wrote in a note to
clients.  Sales Update  The Treasury is due to auction $24 billion of 10-year
securities tomorrow and $16 billion of 30-year debt on Nov. 8.
The sales will raise $8.9 billion of new cash as maturing
securities held by the public total $63.1 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Investors in Treasuries were the most neutral in more than
two months as they cut bullish positions ahead of the closely
contested U.S. presidential election, according to a survey by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Investors raised neutral bets to 70 percent from 68
percent, pushing it to the highest level since Aug. 27, the
survey reported.  The 10-year yield will be 1.73 percent at Dec. 31 and rise
to 2.03 percent by the end of June, according to a Bloomberg
survey of banks and securities companies with the most recent
projections given the heaviest weightings.  Borrowing Totals  Even as Obama increased the U.S. publicly traded  debt  to a
record $10.8 trillion as of August, investors have been willing
to accept lower  interest rates  as the central bank buys bonds as
a way to sustain the expansion and as inflation holds in check.  After purchasing $2.3 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage-
related bonds, the Fed on Oct. 24 reiterated its plan to
continue unprecedented stimulus measures by buying $40 billion
of home-loan securities a month until the labor market improves
“substantially.”  The Fed is swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings
with those due in six to 30 years as part of its efforts to
support the  U.S. economy  by putting downward pressure on long-
term borrowing costs. The central bank bought $4.85 billion of
Treasuries maturing from November 2018 to August 2020 today,
according to the Fed Bank of New York’s  website .  The Fed-preferred measure of inflation expectations, the
five-year, five-year forward break-even rate  reached  2.88
percent Nov. 1, the highest since August 2011. The gauge
projects the expected pace of consumer price increases during
the five-year period beginning 2017.  To contact the reporters on this story:
