Chateau Haut-Brion 2008, a Bordeaux
first-growth wine from the Pessac-Leognan region south of the
city, fell to its lowest level since February 2010 in trading on
the London-based Liv-ex wine market, according to data on the
market’s website.  Three cases of Haut-Brion 2008 sold for 2,450 pounds
($3,920) yesterday, the lowest level for that vintage since
February 2010 on Liv-ex, the data showed. Wines from the same
producer and year have sold below that amount at  New York 
auctions in April and September this year, the data indicated.  Haut-Brion , one of the five first-growth wines among
Bordeaux’s left-bank vineyards, has seen its 2008 vintage fall
as much as 37 percent since trading at 3,900 pounds in Liv-ex
trading in November last year.  The Haut-Brion estate is controlled by Prince Robert de
Luxembourg, president of Domaine Clarence Dillon SA. It
comprises 51 hectares of vineyards and has been owned by the
Dillon family since 1935.  To contact the reporters on the story: Guy Collins in London on
