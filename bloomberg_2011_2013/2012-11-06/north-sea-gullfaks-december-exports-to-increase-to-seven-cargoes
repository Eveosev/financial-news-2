Exports of North Sea Gullfaks crude
for December will increase to seven cargoes of 800,000 barrels
each, one more than this month, according to a loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Loadings of Statfjord will decline to four 855,000 barrel
shipments from five this month, a separate schedule showed.  Statoil ASA (STL) , Norwayâ€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the two fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules
of crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers
and sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
