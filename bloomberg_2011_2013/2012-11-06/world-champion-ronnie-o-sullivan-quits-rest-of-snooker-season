World champion Ronnie O’Sullivan has
withdrawn from the remainder of the World Snooker Tour this
season, the sport’s governing body said.  “He has some personal issues which he needs to resolve and
we wish him all the best for the future,” World Snooker
Chairman Barry Hearn said in a statement.  O’Sullivan, 36, won’t now defend his fourth world title,
which he won in May. After that victory he said he wanted to
take six months off from the game.  Today’s announcement follows O’Sullivan’s withdrawal from
last week’s International Championship in  China  on health
grounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
