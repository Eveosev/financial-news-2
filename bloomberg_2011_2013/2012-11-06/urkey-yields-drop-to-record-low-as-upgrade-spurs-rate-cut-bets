Turkey ’s  bond yields  fell to a record
on bets the central bank has room to lower  interest rates  after
the nation’s upgrade to investment grade by Fitch Ratings
yesterday pushed the lira to the highest in six months.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell 5 basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 6.89 percent at the in Istanbul, the
lowest since at least 2005. The lira gained by 0.3 percent to
1.7756 per dollar, the strongest level on a closing basis since
May 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fitch boosted Turkey’s foreign-currency ranking to BBB-from
BB+ and its outlook to stable, it said in a statement. Turkey’s
 current-account deficit  narrowed for a 10th straight month to
the least since 2009 in October as exports to the  Middle East 
and Africa made up for lost sales to  Europe . Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government has cut its debt to 36.5
percent of gross domestic product this year from 74 percent in
2004.  “The lira’s appreciation lifted an obstacle for the
central bank to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy,”
Ugur Kucuk, a fixed-income strategist at Is Investment
Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. Fitch’s
upgrade “will enable the central bank to lower the cost of
funding to 5.50 percent more easily,” Kucuk said.  Central bank Governor Erdem Basci said in a press
conference in Istanbul on Oct. 24 the bank can cut the lenders’
borrowing cost to 5.5 percent. Basci varies interest rates daily
within a benchmark 5.75 percent rate and a 9.5 percent overnight
lending rate.  Funding Cost  The  average cost of funding  for Turkish lenders fell to
5.74 percent yesterday, the lowest on record, as the central
bank boosted cheaper funding after economic growth fell to 2.9
percent in the second quarter from 9.2 percent a year earlier
and the  inflation  rate slid to 7.8 percent in October from a
three-year high of 11.1 percent in April.  The Turkish Treasury sold total 2.5 billion liras of
benchmark two-year bonds at average yield of 6.9 percent in
auction, the lowest cost since at least 1998. The Ankara-based
Treasury also sold total 3.1 billion liras of 10-year fixed-
coupon debt at 7.74 percent yield. The yield compared with 8.61
percent in previous auction of September 2022 debt on Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
