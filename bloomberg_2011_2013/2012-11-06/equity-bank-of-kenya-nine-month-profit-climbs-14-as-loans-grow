Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by market value and customers, said nine-month profit
climbed 14 percent as loans increased.  Net income rose to 8.3 billion shillings ($97.6 million) in
the period to Sept. 30, from 7.29 billion shillings a year
earlier, Chief Executive Officer James Mwangi said in Nairobi
today. Net interest income, the amount banks earn from charges
on loans, surged 55 percent to 17.2 billion shillings, he said.  Kenyan lenders have benefited from record high interest
rates after the central bank raised its  benchmark lending rate 
to 18 percent in December to quell surging inflation and bolster
the shilling. The central bank has cut the rate twice since July
to 13 percent and is expected to announce a further reduction
tomorrow, according to six economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Equity’s customers in the nine months to September
increased to 7.8 million, or 51 percent of all bank customers in
Kenya, from 6.7 million a year earlier.  Standard Investment Bank has a hold rating on Equity Bank
with a price target of 24.8 shillings, Head of Research, Francis Mwangi said today by telephone.  The stock gained for a second day, trading 2.1 percent
higher at 24.50 shillings at 12:50 p.m. in Nairobi. Year to date
the stock has rallied 51 percent, outpacing a 34.4 percent rally
on the  NSE All-Share Index (NSEASI) , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
