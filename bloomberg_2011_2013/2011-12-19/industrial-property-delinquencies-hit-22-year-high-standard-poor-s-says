Delinquencies on industrial-property
loans that were packaged into commercial mortgage-backed
securities rose to a 22-year high amid a decline in rental
income from warehouses,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  The delinquency rate for U.S. industrial CMBS as of Sept.
30 was 12.05 percent, the New York-based rating company said
today in a statement. Net operating income has fallen at 47
percent of properties used as collateral for industrial CMBS
since the securities were issued, S&P said.  Delinquencies began rising in 2008 as U.S. gross domestic
product contracted for four consecutive quarters, according to
S&P. Industrial properties are the only segment of CMBS where
delinquencies are at historic highs, S&P said today.  “It is our view that the growing volume of maturing loans,
paired with declining NOI for many, will prevent industrial
delinquencies from improving in the first half of 2012,” Larry
Kay, an S&P analyst, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
