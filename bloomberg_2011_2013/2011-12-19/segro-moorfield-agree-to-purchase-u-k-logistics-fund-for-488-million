Segro Plc (SGRO)  and  Moorfield Real Estate
Fund II  agreed to buy a U.K. fund that owns 14 warehouses for
314.7 million pounds ($488 million) in cash.  The U.K. Logistics Fund will be acquired from Hermes Real
Estate Investment Management Ltd., Legal & General and  LaSalle
Investment Management , according to a statement today. The
fund’s properties have 404,100 square meters (4.35 million
square feet) of space.  Segro and Moorfield will make the purchase through a joint
venture. Segro, the U.K.’s largest owner of business parks and
warehouses, will manage the properties.  About 64 percent of the U.K. Logistics Fund’s real estate
is in the south of England. The fund, set up in 2006, also owns
a development site.  The owners of the logistics fund announced a plan to divest
it on Sept. 15 and said  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  would handle the
sale.  Segro fell 36 percent in London trading in the last six
months, cutting its market value to 1.47 billion pounds. The
company in August reported a 57 percent decline in first-half
pretax profit and a 6.1 percent drop in net rental income.
Underlying pretax profit, which excludes the effect of valuation
movements, rose 11 percent to 71.1 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
