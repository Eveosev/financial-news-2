NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy, Ukraine’s
state energy company, may ask to delay repayment to  Russia ’s OAO
Gazprom of an advance $1.8 billion for natural-gas transit
services,  Kommersant-Ukraine  newspaper reported, citing an
unidentified official at the Energy and Coal Ministry.  Naftogaz received the advance payment in December 2010 and
was due to pay it back in five years by increasing transit
volumes from 2010, according to the Kiev-based newspaper.
Considering the present transit fee, Naftogaz may need as long
as eight or nine years to repay to Gazprom, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
