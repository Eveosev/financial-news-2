Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA ,
 Chile ’s largest fertilizer producer, rose the most in two months
after announcing an asset sale that will boost earnings and as
it added a new “outperform” rating.  Soquimich, as the company is known, climbed 2.4 percent to
27,228 pesos at the close in Santiago, the steepest increase
since Oct. 27.  The company announced in a statement to regulators Dec. 16
that it sold mining assets in northern Chile to Sierra Gorda SCM
for $37.8 million, plus an annual royalty payment of $2 million
beginning in 2022. The move will add $30 million to fourth-
quarter earnings, Soquimich said.  “The news is positive for SQM as it will generate a one-
time profit,” the brokerage unit of Banco Bice wrote today in a
note to clients.  Soquimich was also initiated at “outperform” in coverage
at Itau BBA Securities, a unit of Brazilian lender Itau Unibanco
Holding SA, with a target price of $65.20 per American
depositary receipt.  “The stock does not seem expensive on either an historical
basis or on a relative basis when properly compared with
peers,” Itau analysts Giovana Araujo and Antonio Barreto wrote
today in a note to clients. “SQM’s relatively defensive
characteristics, including healthy cash generation and low
volatility of returns, make it a safer bet in the agribusiness
sector in this uncertain environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
