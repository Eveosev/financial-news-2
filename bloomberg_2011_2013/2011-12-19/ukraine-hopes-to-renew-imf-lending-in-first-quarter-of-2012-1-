Ukraine hopes to renew borrowing
from the  International Monetary Fund  in the first quarter of
next year, First Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Klyuev said.  “Cooperation with the IMF is important to us, and the loan
is important to us,” Klyuev said in an interview in Kiev today.
Talks with IMF will be held after the holidays and tranche
disbursement is possible in the first quarter of 2012, he said.  Ukraine’s $15.6 billion loan program with IMF has been on
hold this year because Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov ’s government
has refused to raise domestic tariffs for natural gas and
instead is seeking a lower import price from  Russia .  The government won’t revise local gas tariffs, Klyuev said
today, adding the Cabinet has a plan to balance the finances of
state-run energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy.  Ukraine’s state budget for next year will be approved by
parliament by the end of this week, Klyuev said. The
second-reading version of the budget has been agreed upon with
the  International Monetary Fund , he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
