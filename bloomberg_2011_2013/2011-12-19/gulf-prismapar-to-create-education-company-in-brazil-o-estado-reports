Gulf Investimentos Ltda. and
Prismapar executives plan to create an education company in
 Brazil , which they aim to list in an initial public offering in
2013, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing Renato Souza Neto,
who founded Prismapar in 2002.       Gulf and Prismaparâ€™s associates may hold 20 percent to 25
percent of the new holding company, to be called Brasil
Education, according to the newspaper.  The two companies have already signed contracts with
several institutions and are negotiating with a further 10,
Souza told O Estado. They are seeking 15 to 20 schools in total,
with combined revenue of 500 million reais ($270 million), O
Estado said. The contracts are conditional on the completion of
an IPO, O Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
