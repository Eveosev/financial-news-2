Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  boosted the
estimated amount of natural gas at the Leviathan prospect off
the coast of Israel, its biggest find ever, after getting
results from another appraisal well.  The company said the discovery holds an estimated gross
mean resource of about 17 trillion cubic feet and may hold as
much as 20 trillion cubic feet, according to a statement today.
That gross mean estimate is 6.3 percent more than the 16
trillion cubic feet the Houston-based company announced last
year.  “The reservoir thickness and quality were greater than
anticipated,”  Noble Energy  said in the statement. The appraisal
well, more than 3 miles (5 kilometers) east of the original
discovery, was drilled to a depth of 17,146 feet (5,226 meters)
in about 5,480 feet of water, according to the release.  Noble Energy operates Leviathan and holds a 39.66 percent
interest. Delek Drilling LP and  Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  hold
22.67 percent stakes and  Ratio Oil Exploration 1992 LP (RATIL)  owns the
remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
