The European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  set three conditions at the start of
financial-aid talks with  Hungary  last week, HVG weekly  said on
its website , citing an “influential” Hungarian official with
knowledge of the talks.  The conditions included withdrawing a draft central bank
law, which the institutions say may undermine the independence
of monetary policy, as well as a law that requires a two-thirds
majority to make changes to the flat personal income tax, HVG
said. A third condition was that Hungary is only eligible for a
standby loan agreement, requiring “strict” policy reviews, HVG
said.  Talks between the government and the lenders broke down on
Dec. 15, after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said he can’t accept
the conditions if the international delegation “isn’t open to
compromise,” the weekly said. A day later, the IMF and the EU
announced the interruption of the talks, citing differences over
the draft central bank law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
