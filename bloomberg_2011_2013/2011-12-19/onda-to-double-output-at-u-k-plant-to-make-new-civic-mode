Honda Motor Co. (7267)  said it will add
500 jobs and double production at a plant in Swindon, west
England, as the carmaker introduces a new Civic compact model.  Production of the Civic at the plant was delayed by a month
following the floods in Thailand, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Honda’s operations were also affected by
parts shortages caused by the March earthquake in  Japan .  “The last three years have been extremely difficult for
all of Honda’s European operations,” Manabu Nishimae, Honda
president for the continent, said in the statement. “We have
faced many challenges beginning with the economic downturn
through to the two natural disasters in Japan and  Thailand .”  Honda will increase the number of production shifts at the
plant, its largest European site, to four from three and intends
to double production to about 180,000 vehicles next year. The
company also builds the CR-V compact sport-utility model and
Jazz compact car in Swindon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
