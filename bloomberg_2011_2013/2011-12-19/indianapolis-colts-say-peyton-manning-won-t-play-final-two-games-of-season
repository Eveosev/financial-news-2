Peyton Manning  won’t play in the
final two games of the National Football League season as the
 Indianapolis Colts  quarterback recovers from neck surgery that
forced him to miss the first 14 games, the team said.  “His rehabilitation has not come far enough to make it
prudent for him to step on the field in game action,” Colts
vice chairman Bill Polian said in a  statement  after his team
beat the Tennessee Titans 27-13 yesterday for its first win of
the season.  Manning, a four-time NFL Most Valuable Player, began
throwing to teammates at the Colts’ practice facility last week
while wearing pads and a helmet.  Polian said that workout was part of the rehabilitation
process and team doctors advised the following day that Manning
shouldn’t return for the final two games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
