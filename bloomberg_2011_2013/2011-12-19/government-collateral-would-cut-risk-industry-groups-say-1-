Governments should post collateral
on derivatives trades with commercial lenders to reduce risk and
improve liquidity in the banking system, according to a paper
published by a group of financial-market industry bodies.  Collateral arrangements are negotiated independently in
unregulated derivatives markets and most governments require
their trading partners to make guarantees without reciprocating.
Portugal and Ireland are the only exceptions in  Europe ,
according to the paper from the International Capital Market
Association, the International Swaps & Derivatives Association
and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe.  The imbalance of collateral practices may sap as much as
$70 billion from the financial system, the associations said in
the paper, entitled “The Impact of Derivative Collateral
Policies of European Sovereigns and Resulting Basel III Capital
Issues.”  The use of one-way collateral agreements by European
governments “has created meaningful credit risks in the
financial system and has also drained liquidity from the banking
system,” the paper said. Governments posting collateral to back
their trades would also increase transparency to their debt,
they said.  Derivatives are financial instruments derived from stocks,
bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to specific
events like changes in  interest rates  or the weather. So-called
over-the-counter derivatives aren’t traded on exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
