Cocoa dropped for a fourth session
on speculation that supplies exceed demand and as traders
increased bets on price declines. Coffee rebounded from a one-
year low, while sugar slipped.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Marex Spectron Group Ltd. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc have forecast surpluses for the season
that started in October. In the week ended Dec. 13, hedge-fund
managers and other large speculators boosted their bearish cocoa
bets by 50 percent to 11,969 futures and options contracts, the
most negative outlook since the end of October, U.S. government
data show.  “Speculators have really increased shorts,” said Keith Flury, a London-based analyst at Rabobank International. “This
bearish stance certainly pressures the market.”  Cocoa for March delivery fell 1.1 percent to $2,077 a
metric ton at 12:07 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Before
today, prices dropped 31 percent this year, heading for the
biggest slump since 1999.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery gained 0.3
percent to $2.158 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the price touched
$2.1235, the lowest since Dec. 13, 2010.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery declined 0.4 percent
to 22.99 cents a pound on ICE. The sweetener dropped 28 percent
this year before today.  In London futures trading, cocoa and robusta coffee fell,
while refined sugar was little changed on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
