The Philippine peso fell, snapping a
two-day advance, on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will weaken
demand for the nation’s exports. Bonds gained for a third day  Overseas sales declined for a sixth month in October,
official data showed Dec. 13. Losses in the currency may be kept
in check after the nation’s credit-rating outlook was raised by
 Standard & Poor’s  last week, said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a currency
strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore.  “There is a lingering fear about the European situation,”
Tanuwidjaja said. “Asian currencies are being priced on a
slightly weaker bias. The downtrend in the peso should be
limited.”  The peso declined 0.4 percent to 43.990 per dollar at the
close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 44.323 on Dec. 15, the weakest level since Jan. 31.  Euro-area finance ministers will hold a conference call at
3:30 p.m. in Brussels to meet a self-imposed deadline to channel
additional bailout funds and put together new budget rules to
stem the debt crisis and buoy investor confidence.  Philippine exports fell 14.6 percent in October from a year
earlier, the statistics office said last week.  The yield on the Philippine government’s 5.75 percent bonds
due November 2021 dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 5.64 percent, according to noon fixing prices from
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. That was the lowest level
for a benchmark 10-year note since at least 1998, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
