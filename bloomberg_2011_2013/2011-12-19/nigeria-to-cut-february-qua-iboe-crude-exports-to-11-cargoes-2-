Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to reduce Qua Iboe crude exports in February to
11 cargoes, one less than next month, according to a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will also ship five consignments of Bonny Light
blend totaling 4.75 million barrels, down from 4.9 million
barrels in January, the plan showed.  Exports of Bonga grade will be unchanged at five cargoes,
while Yoho loadings will be three shipments, one more than
January, according to the plan.  Nigeria will cut its exports of Forcados to six cargoes
from seven in January, a separate schedule showed. Bonga crude
shipments are 1 million barrels each, while the rest are for
950,000 barrels, according to the plans.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
