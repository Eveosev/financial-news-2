Coffee exports from  Uganda ,  Africa ’s
largest exporter of the crop, may fall 9.6 percent this month as
wet weather hinders the harvesting and drying of the beans, the
nation’s coffee development agency said.  December shipments may decline to 215,000 60-kilogram (132-
pound) bags from 237,747 bags a year earlier, the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority said in an e-mailed statement today. The
forecast is 5.4 percent less than the 227,177 bags shipped in
November, it said.  “On-going rains have delayed the harvesting and drying
processes in most areas,” the authority said. “This has put
pressure on the quality of the coffee.”  Uganda ranks behind  Ethiopia  as Africa’s largest producer
of the crop, according to the  International Coffee Organization .
Robusta beans, used in espressos and instant drinks, account for
about 85 percent of the nation’s annual production.  Shipments from the East African nation may rise to 3.3
million bags in the 12 months through September 2012 from 3.15
million bags a year earlier because of a bigger crop, the
authority said last month.  Uganda plans to increase production to 4.5 million bags by
2015 through a replanting program. The nation consumes around 3
percent of its annual coffee crop and the rest is exported,
according to the Eastern African Fine Coffee Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
