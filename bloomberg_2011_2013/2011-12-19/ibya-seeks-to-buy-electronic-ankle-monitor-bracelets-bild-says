Libya ’s transitional government is
seeking to buy electronic ankle monitor bracelets in  Germany  to
aid in law enforcement,  Bild  reported, citing an internal German
Foreign Ministry document.  The Foreign Ministry views the request, made in the fall to
the German Embassy in Tripoli, as a way to enter the Libyan
market, the newspaper said today. It didn’t name any company
that might supply the equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
