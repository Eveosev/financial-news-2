Germany ’s IFO business climate index
for December may show how efforts to resolve Europe’s debt
crisis affected sentiment in the region’s largest economy. The
European Central Bank reports on the health of the region’s
banks. France sells debt amid speculation of a credit rating
cut. Spanish Prime Minister-Elect Mariano Rajoy outlines his
economic plan. Italy Prime Minister  Mario Monti  seeks final
approval for his $39 billion austerity program.  The Bank of Japan will probably leave its benchmark
interest rate unchanged at near 0 percent. China will release
November home prices for 70 cities, a benchmark of the economy.  U.S. existing home sales will probably show the impact of
an oversupply of foreclosed properties. The  National Basketball
Association  opens on Christmas Day after a labor dispute wiped
out 20 percent of games.  MONDAY, Dec. 19  To contact the reporters on this story:
