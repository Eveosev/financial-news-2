U.S. Gulf oil premiums weakened as
the difference between West Texas Intermediate and Brent was
little changed.  The spread between the two benchmark crude futures for
February delivery decreased 7 cents to $9.53 a barrel at 2:35
p.m. in  New York  today. The differential has narrowed 66 percent
since reaching a record of $27.88 a barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI narrowed 25 cents to
$10.25 a barrel at 2:03 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium narrowed
20 cents to $10.05 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI decreased 25 cents to $8.15.
The premium for Mars Blend lost 25 cents to $6.75 a barrel.
 Poseidon ’s premium narrowed 20 cents to $6.20 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium decreased 5 cents to $5.80
a barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount widened 5 cents to 90
cents.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  was unchanged at
$15.75 a barrel.  Syncrude ’s premium was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
