Thoratec Corp. (THOR) , a maker of
implantable heart pumps, should retain an investment bank to put
the company up for sale, according to a shareholder proposal by
investor Oracle Investment Management Inc.  The proposal for the next shareholder meeting was disclosed
in a regulatory  filing  today. Oracle, based in Greenwich,
Connecticut, controls 5.2 percent of Pleasanton, California-
based Thoratec.  Larry Feinberg, Oracle’s founder, earlier this month urged
Thoratec’s board to hire a bank to handle an auction of the
company. The heart-pump maker may attract bids from  Johnson &
Johnson (JNJ) ,  Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  or  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  if the company
seeks a buyer, Feinberg said in an interview on Dec. 6.  “We believe that the market clout, capital resources, and
relevant experience of a larger and more tenured medtech company
is required to accelerate the penetration of this burgeoning
market opportunity,” Oracle said in a supporting statement in
the filing.  The market for Thoratec’s main product, the left-
ventricular assist device, is $5 billion to $10 billion, Oracle
said in its statement. A company device in development may
generate as much as $1 billion, Oracle said.  Thoratec gained less than 1 percent to $30.71 at 10:16 a.m.
