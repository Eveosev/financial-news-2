Premier League soccer club Fulham
posted record full-year net income of 4.8 million pounds ($7.5
million), citing higher attendances at its Craven Cottage
stadium.  The profit is a turnaround for the west London-based team,
which had a 16.9 million-pound loss a year earlier. Revenue for
the year ended June 30 was 77.1 million pounds, matching the
year earlier period when the club played more matches after
reaching the Europa League final.  “The Club has made great strides in recent years, and this
excellent set of financial results is just reward for our
progress,” Chairman and owner Mohamed Al Fayed said on Fulham’s
 website . “As always, I am determined to ensure the club moves
in the right direction whilst remaining true to our history,
heritage and past traditions.”  Fulham, which finished eighth in the 20-team Premier League
last season, said attendances increased 4.9 percent, with
occupancy at its 25,700-seat stadium at 98 percent. The club
didn’t provide further details of its results and  Companies
House  has yet to publish the full accounts.  Al-Fayed spent millions of pounds to take the club from the
third tier to the Premier League within four years of buying
Fulham in 1997. It’s now playing its 11th consecutive season in
the top flight.  Fulham was eliminated from the Europa League last week.
It’s 11th in the Premier League after 16 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
