(Corrects quote in headline)  Trading of RTS futures was suspended
because of a “technical problem,” shortly after the start of
the second session, said a spokesman for the exchange.  “What the system is showing doesn’t correspond to the
clients’ actual positions,” Anton Storozh, a technical support
specialist for the RTS index, said by phone from Moscow. “We
are looking for a solution. It will probably take an hour or
two.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
