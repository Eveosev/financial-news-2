Sevilla  soccer team president Jose Maria del Nido was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison after
being found guilty of cooperating with town hall officials in
Marbella who misappropriated public funds.  Del Nido, who denies any wrongdoing while working as a
lawyer for the town hall, can appeal the sentence at  Spain ’s
Supreme Court. He was cleared of charges including falsifying
documents, improper appropriation of funds and professional
dishonesty, according to a copy of the ruling by the Provincial
Court of Malaga.  The case dates back to Spain’s decade-long real estate boom
in which government officials are accused of receiving kickbacks
in exchange for building permits. Del Nido, 54, began to work
for the town hall in 1999.  Since 2002 he has been president of Sevilla, which won
back-to-back UEFA Cup titles in 2006 and 2007. He is one of the
most outspoken critics of the financial dominance of  Barcelona 
and Real Madrid, who get about the same television rights income
as the other 18 clubs in Spain’s top-tier La Liga combined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
