Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  called
for  Russia â€™s energy and economy ministries and law enforcement
agencies to probe corruption at state-owned utilities, Interfax
reported from a government meeting in Siberia.  The checks are to take place over the next two months and
include companies in which OAO Gazprom, VEB, the state
development bank, and OAO Sberbank own stakes, Interfax
reported, citing Putin.  Putin ordered tighter control over management of state
power utilities, demanding managers and their families provide
information about income and property to the Energy Ministry and
criticizing related party deals between state power utilities
with repair and sales companies, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
