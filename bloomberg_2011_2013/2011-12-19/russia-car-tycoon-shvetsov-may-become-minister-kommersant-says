Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  may
name automaker OAO Sollers owner Vadim Shvetsov industry
minister, replacing his father-in-law Viktor Khristenko,
Kommersant reported.  Deputy Industry Minister Dmitry Manturov is also being
considered to replace Khristenko, who will move to the Eurasian
Economic Commission, the Moscow-based newspaper reported today,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Shvetsov is the main shareholder and chief executive
officer of OAO Sollers, which makes Explorer sport-utility
vehicles with Ford Motor Co.  Zoya Kaika, a spokeswoman for Sollers, denied the report, 
saying Shvetsov has no intention of leaving the company, by phone
in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
