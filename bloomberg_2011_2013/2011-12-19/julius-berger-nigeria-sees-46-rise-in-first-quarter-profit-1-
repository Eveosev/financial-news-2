Julius Berger Nigeria Plc (JBERGER) , the
country’s largest construction company by market value, forecast
a 46 percent increase in first-quarter profit.  Net income for the three months to March will rise to 1.14
billion naira ($7 million) from 781 million naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based company said today in statement to the
Nigerian Stock Exchange. Revenue will rise 21 percent to 37.85
billion naira from 31.4 billion naira, it said.  Julius Berger, whose largest single shareholder is
Germany’s  Bilfinger Berger AG (GBF) , derives 65 percent of its
earnings from government projects and wants more deals with
private companies to maintain growth, Managing Director Wolfgang Goetsch said in an interview on Dec. 2 in Abuja, the capital.  Nigeria , sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy after
South Africa, needs to spend $67 billion naira on infrastructure
over the next four years, Minister of Finance Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala said on Nov. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
