Western Australia led an improvement
in mortgage arrears across the country, boosted by a rebound in
the state’s mining and tourism industries,  Fitch Ratings  said.  About 1.5 percent of home loans in the state were more than
30 days overdue, down from 1.99 percent in March, the ratings
company said in an e-mailed report. One in four borrowers had
cured their delinquency status in the six months, it said.  Western Australia has “experienced a rebound in both the
tourism and mining industries and a slight improvement in
employment over 2010 and 2011,” Fitch said in the report.
“However, the  property market  in Western Australia may suffer
additional volatility in case of downsizing, relocation or
changes in the  mining industry .”  Delinquencies across the country fell in September from six
months ago as borrowers benefited from stable  interest rates  and
the strength of the Australian economy.  Queensland state’s delinquency rate declined to 1.7 percent
in September from 2 percent in March. About 1.55 percent of
loans in New South Wales and 1.04 percent in Victoria state were
more than 30 days overdue, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
