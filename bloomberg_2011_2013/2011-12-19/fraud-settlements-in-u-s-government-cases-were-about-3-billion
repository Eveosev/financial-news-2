The amount the U.S. obtained in
cases involving fraud against the government held steady at
about $3 billion in fiscal year 2011, which ended Sept. 30.  The recoveries under the  False Claims Act  included $2.4
billion in fraud involving federal health care programs,
Assistant Attorney General  Tony West , who heads the  Justice
Department â€™s civil division, said at a briefing today in
Washington.  Most of the cases resulting in recovered funds were brought
to the government by whistle-blowers, according to the Justice
Department. Whistle-blowers can pursue fraud claims under the
act on behalf of the federal government and then share in any
recovery.  The Justice Department has recovered $8.7 billion under the
False Claims Act since January 2009, the largest-ever three-year
total, West said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
