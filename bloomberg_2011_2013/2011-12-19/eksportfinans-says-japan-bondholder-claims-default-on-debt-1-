Eksportfinans ASA said an investor
in the company’s Japanese bonds claimed the debt was in default
following the Norwegian government’s plans to dismantle the
lender.  “On advice from counsel the declaration will be resisted
vigorously,” the Oslo-based lender said today in a statement.
“This is done on the basis that there is no default and the
declaration is therefore of no effect. On this basis such
purported declaration does not constitute a cross default under
its other financial obligations.”  Norway ’s government said last month it will wind down
Eksportfinans, created in 1962 to aid exporters, after rejecting
the lender’s pleas to sidestep European capital rules limiting
large loans. The decision prompted Moody’s Investors Service on
Nov. 22 to downgrade the company’s debt to junk while  Standard &
Poor’s  said Eksportfinans’ euro medium-term note program may
already be in default.  The ratings downgrades hit credit markets as far as  Japan 
as bond investors who thought they held notes backed by a AAA
sovereign awoke to find their securities were no longer
investment grade. Eksportfinans has about $35 billion in
outstanding debt.  Officials at Eksportsfinans couldn’t immediately be reached
for a comment. Eksportfinans is 15 percent owned by the
Norwegian government. DNB ASA, Norway’s biggest bank, holds 40
percent, while 23.21 percent is held by Nordea Bank AB, the
largest Nordic lender. Danske Bank A/S owns 8.09 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
