Oil options volatility dropped as
the underlying futures rose as a son of  Kim Jong Il  took power
in  North Korea  and the U.S. and its allies prepared to discuss
stronger measures against  Iran .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, fell to 36.4 at 2 p.m. in New York from 36.8 on
Dec. 16. Oil rose as much as 1 percent after the official Korean
Central News Agency said Kim Jong Il died Dec. 17 and that Kim
Jong Un will now lead the nuclear-armed nation.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were February $100 calls, with 543 lots changing hands as
of 2:02 p.m. in New York. The options fell 12 cents to $1.50 a
barrel. February $110 calls traded 539 lots, dropping 9 cents to
