Eesti Energia AS, the biggest Baltic
electricity utility, had its  credit rating  cut by Moody’s
Investors Service, which cited a weakening financial profile in
its “sizable” investment program.  The state-owned utility was downgraded from A3 to Baa1,
Moody’s said in an e-mailed statement today. The outlook on the
ratings is stable, it said.  “Moody’s expects Eesti Energia’s credit metrics to decline
substantially compared with 2010 levels, given that the group
faces increased pressure on its earnings and cash flows in
conjunction with its very substantial investment program,” the
rating company said in the statement.  The company will probably face pressure on its market
position following the full opening of  Estonia ’s electricity
market in 2013, Moody’s said. This may “result in higher
earnings volatility and pressure on cash flows as competition
may intensify in the region,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
