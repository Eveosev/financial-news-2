Vietnam ’s  Politburo , the highest
political body, aims to create a “fair business environment”
for entrepreneurs in the country as it recognizes their
importance in the economy, according to a resolution on the
government’s website.  The nation will make socio-economic development plans
public and “transparent” to help reduce business risks for
entrepreneurs, according to the Politburo  statement  dated Dec.
16. It also encourages an increase in the number of medium-sized
firms as well as consolidation and merging of companies in order
to build strong brands capable of competing regionally by 2020,
the release said.  “It affirms that Vietnam respects the role of different
economic sectors,” including private businesses, Nguyen Duc
Kien, deputy head of the National Assembly’s economic committee,
said by phone from Hanoi today. “Business management was once
considered something impure.”  The resolution is the Politburo’s first on entrepreneurs,
Kien said. The move further highlights the growing influence of
entrepreneurs in the economy, after the nation in January
officially allowed private business owners into the Communist
Party for the first time.  The country seeks to “build a large and strong group of
entrepreneurs who have national spirit, political awareness,
business culture, high social responsibility,” and good
management skills, the statement said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
