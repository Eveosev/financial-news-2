Building companies in  Portugal ’s
leading tourist destination of the Algarve have been hit the
hardest from a slump in the industry as the government cuts back
on spending after seeking emergency aid in April.  “It is in the region of the Algarve that the public works
sector has shown, throughout 2011, the most worrying behavior,”
Portugal’s  Association of Public Works and Construction , or
AECOPS, said in a statement today.  The number of building licenses in the Algarve fell 56.5
percent in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the
previous year, almost twice the national average, according to
AECOPS. The outlook for production, employment and prices in the
industry is the worst since at least 1989, AECOPS said on Oct.
19.  Portugal’s government is cutting back on spending and
raising taxes to comply with a 78 billion-euro ($108 billion)
bailout program from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . The economy is expected to contract 1.6 percent
this year and 3 percent in 2012, Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar
said on Nov. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
