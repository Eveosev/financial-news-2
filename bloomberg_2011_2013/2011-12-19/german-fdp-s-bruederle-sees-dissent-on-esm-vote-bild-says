Some lawmakers from Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s Free Democratic coalition partner will probably
vote against approving  Europe ’s permanent rescue fund when it
goes to the German lower house,  Rainer Bruederle , the party’s
parliamentary leader, was quoted as saying by Bild.  A few FDP members dissented in recent votes on euro-area
matters and a similar thing is likely to happen when the
European Stability Mechanism goes before the Bundestag in
Berlin, Bruederle was quoted as saying in an interview in the
 newspaper  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
