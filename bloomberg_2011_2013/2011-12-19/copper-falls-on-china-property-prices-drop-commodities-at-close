24 commodities was little changed at 618.12 as of 5:21 p.m. in
 London . The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials was
down 0.2 percent at 1,471.28.  BASE METALS  Copper futures dropped for the fifth time in six sessions
on concern that demand will ease after property prices declined
in  China , the world’s top consumer of industrial metals.  Metal for March delivery declined 0.6 percent to $3.3105 a

percent, the most since the period ended Sept. 23. On the London

percent to $7,299.25 a metric ton ($3.31 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, zinc, nickel and tin also fell in London.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn gained the most since late October and soybeans rose
to a three-week high as adverse weather threatened crops in
 South America , boosting demand for U.S. supplies. Wheat climbed.  Corn futures for March delivery jumped 2 percent to $5.945

as much as 0.8 pence, or 1.4 percent, to 55.2 pence a therm,
according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell as the dollar strengthened against the euro,
eroding the metal’s appeal as an alternative investment.  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.3 percent to

“substantial downside risks.”  Crude for January delivery slid 18 cents, or 0.2 percent,
to $93.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The more

for next year from four international companies.  Gasoil on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange was little
changed on warmer-than-usual temperatures for this time of year.
The heating fuel’s crack, or premium to Brent, shrank.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle rose, heading for the biggest gain in almost four
weeks, on speculation that a winter storm in the southwestern
U.S. will reduce animal weights, curbing beef supplies. Hogs
also climbed.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 1.2 percent to
$1.19875 a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A close at

contract since Nov. 22. Before today, the commodity gained 9.4
percent this year.  Hog futures for February settlement advanced 0.6 percent to
83.625 cents a pound. Before today, the price climbed 4.3
