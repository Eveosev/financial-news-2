Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  accused Palo
Alto Networks Inc. in a lawsuit of infringing six U.S. patents
for firewall technology used to protect communications networks
from intrusion.  Juniper, based in Sunnyvale,  California , is seeking a jury
trial, unspecified damages and an order to stop misuse of its
inventions, according to the complaint filed today in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “As a leading high-performance networking company, we will
take every appropriate measure to defend and protect our
innovation,” David Shane, a Juniper spokesman, said in an e-
mail.  Palo Alto networks, based in  Santa Clara , California, “was
founded by several former high-level employees of Juniper to
compete against Juniper,” lawyers for Juniper said in court
papers.  “We don’t provide comment on these types of matters,”
Mike Haro, a spokesman for  Palo Alto Networks , said in a phone
interview.  In a statement last week, Haro’s firm said it was named by
industry researcher Gartner Inc. as a leader in the rapidly
evolving field.  The case is Juniper Networks Inc. v. Palo Alto Networks
Inc., 11-cv-1258, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware 
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
