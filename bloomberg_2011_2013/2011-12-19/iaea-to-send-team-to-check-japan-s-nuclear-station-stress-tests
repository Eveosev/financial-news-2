The  International Atomic Energy
Agency  will send a team to  Japan  early next year to review the
status of the country’s stress tests on idled nuclear reactors.  The mission may visit several plants, Yukiya Amano, the
director general of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, told
reporters today in  Tokyo . The schedule hasn’t been decided.  Japan is carrying out so-called stress tests to assess
whether nuclear plants can withstand strong earthquakes,
tsunamis or a loss of power to reactor cooling systems after the
Fukushima disaster.  To contact the reporters on this story:
