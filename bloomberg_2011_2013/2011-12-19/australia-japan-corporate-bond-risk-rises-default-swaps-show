The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Australia and  Japan  against non-payment increased, according
to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
195 basis points as of 1:33 p.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The gauge is set for its first increase in three
days, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 2.5 basis points to
192 as of 10:56 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
Thatâ€™s on course for its highest level since Dec. 2, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc., and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 211 basis points
as of 9:05 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices show. The
benchmark rose 10.7 basis points last week, the biggest weekly
jump in three weeks, according to CMA prices in  New York .  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
