Treasury 10-year note  yields  could
drop to a record low 1.5 percent in 2012 as global growth
concern persists and the  Federal Reserve  buys more debt to
support the U.S. economic recovery, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s Dominic Konstam.  Global policy makers have been unable to boost appetite for
riskier assets or to damp the refuge appeal of  U.S. government
debt  amid  Europe ’s sovereign-debt turmoil and concern American
growth is floundering, Konstam wrote in a note to clients.
Deutsche Bank is one of the 21 primary dealers that trade
Treasuries with the U.S. central bank.  “It has to be worse before it can be better,” wrote
Konstam, global head of interest-rate research in  New York . “We
believe a point will come when it is really bad.”  U.S. 10-year note  yields  fell three basis points today, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.82 percent, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. They have dropped 147 basis points this year
as investors sought safety, reaching a record low 1.67 percent
on Sept. 23.  The benchmark notes have returned 17 percent in 2011,
compared with a 9.9 gain in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  In the new year, “we expect coupon Treasury issuance to
remain stable near term due to the uncertainty on fiscal
policies,” including the payroll-tax cut still under debate in
Congress, Konstam wrote.  Gross issuance of notes, bonds and inflation-indexed debt
issuance may total $2.15 trillion next year, and net issuance
may be $1.1 trillion, he wrote.  TIPS Sales  Total sales of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities may
reach $140 billion in 2012, about 6.7 percent of total coupon
issuance, compared with $131 billion in 2011 and $86 billion in
2010, he wrote.  The Fed purchased $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of
quantitative easing December 2008 to June 2011 from December
2008 to June 2011 to spur growth.  “The Fed has to wake up to QE3; half of them know it,”
Konstam wrote, referring to policy makers on the  Federal Open
Market Committee .  Konstam couldn’t immediately be reached for further
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
