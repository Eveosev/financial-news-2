Verizon Wireless  asked the U.S. to
approve its $3.6 billion acquisition of airwaves from cable
companies  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , Time Warner Cable Inc. and closely held
Bright House Networks LLC.  The transaction will help Verizon Wireless add capacity to
meet increasing demand for high-speed mobile Internet devices,
the Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based wireless company said in a
filing today with the Federal Communications Commission.  Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. wireless carrier,
proposes buying licenses in 120 markets, according to the
filing. Verizon and the cable companies will market and sell
each otherâ€™s services under the agreement announced Dec. 2.  The FCC and Justice Department are likely to approve the
deal, though they may require the sale of assets in certain
markets, said Jeff Silva, senior policy director for
telecommunications, media and technology at Medley Global
Advisors LLC in Washington.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  co-owns Verizon Wireless with
Vodafone Group Plc.  AT&T Inc., the second-largest U.S. wireless operator,
proposed adding capacity through buying T-Mobile USA Inc. The
Justice Department sued to block the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
