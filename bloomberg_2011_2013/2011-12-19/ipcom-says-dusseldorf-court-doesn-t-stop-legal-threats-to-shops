IPCom GmbH & Co. said a Dusseldorf
court injunction last week doesn’t stop it from threatening
retailers of  HTC Corp. (2498)  products with legal action.  “The legal substance of the cease and desist letters is
unchanged,” Alistair Hammond, an outside spokesman for IPCom in
Munich,  Germany , said in an e-mailed statement today.  HTC, the world’s largest maker of mobile phones that use
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system, said last week the court
temporarily banned IPCom from threatening HTC retailers with
legal action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
