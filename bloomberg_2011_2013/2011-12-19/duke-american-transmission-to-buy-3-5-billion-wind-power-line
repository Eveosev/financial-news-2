Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  and American
Transmission Co. have bought a $3.5 billion powerline project
that would bring  wind energy  from Wyoming to  California  and the
U.S. Southwest.  Duke-American Transmission Co., a joint venture of the
companies, bought the 950-mile (241-kilometer) Zephyr Power
Transmission project from  Pathfinder Renewable Wind Energy LLC ,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke said in a statement today.
The sale price wasn’t disclosed.  Pending regulatory approval, the project is expected to be
completed in 2020 and will be able to send 3,000 megawatts of
power from wind farms in Wyoming to demand centers in California
and the U.S. Southwest, Duke said. Zephyr will be built
alongside a wind farm Pathfinder is developing near Chugwater,
Wyoming.  “By working together on a parallel development path, we
avoid ‘the chicken and the egg’ dilemma that has often
challenged major projects like this,” John Flynn, American
Transmission vice president of strategic planning and business
development, said in the statement.  The 500 kilovolt high-voltage direct-current project, which
Pathfinder bought in July from  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , will run from
Chugwater and end in the Eldorado Valley south of Las Vegas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
