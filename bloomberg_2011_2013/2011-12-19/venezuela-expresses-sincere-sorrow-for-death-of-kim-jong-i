Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
sent condolences expressing his “sincere sorrow” for the death
of North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il , according to a Foreign
Ministry statement.  Venezuela is confident that the North Koreans will move
toward a prosperous and peaceful future, the ministry said in
the e-mailed statement.  The government expressed its “solidarity” with  North
Korea  and said that Venezuela is willing to “continue fighting
along with sovereign nations for the auto-determination of
countries and world peace.”  North Korea has defied three U.S. administrations in its
pursuit of nuclear weapons, while economic mismanagement has
resulted in mass starvation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
