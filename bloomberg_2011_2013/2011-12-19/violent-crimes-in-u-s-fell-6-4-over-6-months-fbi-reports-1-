A four-year drop in violent crimes
reported to authorities in the U.S. continued in the first six
months of 2011, according to a preliminary FBI report.  Violent crime in the U.S. fell 6.4 percent from January
through June compared with the same period a year earlier, and
property crimes fell 3.7 percent, according to the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation  report released today.  All four categories of violent crime surveyed -- robbery,
rape, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, and aggravated
assault -- decreased in the first six months of the year
compared to the same period in 2010, according to the FBI.  Murders increased 1.2 percent in cities with populations
between 500,000 and 999,999 and 2.6 percent in cities with
populations under 10,000.  “Although we can all be encouraged that violent crime
rates continue to decline nationwide, it is clear that we must
remain vigilant and more work remains to be done,” Attorney
General Eric Holder said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
