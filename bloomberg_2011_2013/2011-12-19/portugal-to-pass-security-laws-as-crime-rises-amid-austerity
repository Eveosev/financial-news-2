Portugal ’s government is set to
propose laws to make streets safer amid an increase in crime
during the country’s year-long recession, Justice Minister Paula Teixeira da Cruz said.  The government will soon propose legislation to bolster
cooperation between different police forces, Teixeira da Cruz
said today after meeting with the heads of civil and military
police in Lisbon. Last week, unidentified attackers torched two
highway toll booths and shot an employee after the government
introduced fares on four highways as part of austerity measures
agreed on in exchange a 78 billion-euro ($102 billion) bailout.  “The Portuguese should remain calm,” Teixeira da Cruz said
in comments broadcast on SIC Noticias television station. “There
will be a series of administrative and legislative measures in
the future to better coordinate the already exceptional work
carried out by our security forces.”  Portugal has seen a 30 percent increase in theft and
violent crime is up 5 percent this year, according to the
Observatory for Security, Organized Crime and Terrorism, a
Lisbon-based non-governmental organization also known as OSCOT.
Protests against the austerity measures, including a Nov. 24
general strike, have so far not been violent.  “There is a direct link between the pain caused by the
austerity measures and the increase in crime,” OSCOT chief Jose
Manuel Anes said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
