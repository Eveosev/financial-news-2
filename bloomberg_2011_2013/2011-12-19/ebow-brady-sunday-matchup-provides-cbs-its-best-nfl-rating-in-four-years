The matchup of  Tim Tebow ’s Denver
Broncos and Tom Brady’s New England Patriots gave CBS its best
preliminary rating for a regular-season game in more than four
years.  Yesterday’s game in Denver, which the Patriots won 41-23,
was seen in an average of 19.5 percent of homes in the top 56
U.S. television markets, the most since a Patriots-Indianapolis
Colts game in November 2007 drew a 22.5 metered-market rating,
the  CBS Corp. (CBS)  network said in a statement.  The rating was the highest for any National Football League
game on the network this season, topping New England’s game
against the  Dallas Cowboys  on Oct. 16, which drew a 19.1, CBS
said.  Tebow, 24, has become one of the dominant storylines of the
NFL this season and quickly became popular. The devout Christian
led the Broncos (8-6) to six straight wins entering their game
against the Patriots (11-3), spawning a fad known as
“Tebowing” through his kneel-and-pray pose after victories.  He has managed late-game heroics in several of the team’s
wins, including rallying the Broncos to an overtime win against
the  Chicago Bears  on Dec. 11 to overcome a 10-0 fourth-quarter
deficit.  Tebow had 194 yards in the air yesterday after completing
11 of 22 passes and rushed for 93 yards and two scores in the
defeat. Brady, the two-time league Most Valuable Player, was 23-
for-34 for 320 yards passing and two touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
