The U.S. Supreme Court said it will
hear arguments on President Barack Obama’s health-care law over
three days, from March 26 to March 28.  Releasing a schedule today that has few, if any, precedents
in modern court history, the justices left room to expand the 5
1/2 hours they already allotted for argument. The high court
generally hears arguments for a single hour in each case.  The first day will center on the Anti-Injunction Act, a law
that one federal appeals court concluded prevents judges from
ruling until 2015 on the requirement -- also known as the
individual mandate -- that Americans either buy insurance or pay
a penalty.  The justices will use the second day of the hearings to
consider the central issue: the constitutionality of the
individual mandate. A group of 26 states, led by  Florida , is
among those challenging the provision.  On day three, the court will hear arguments on whether
other parts of the law should be invalidated along with the
individual mandate. The justices also will consider the states’
challenge to a provision expanding the Medicaid program for the
poor.  The cases are National Federation of Independent Business
v. Sebelius, 11-393;  Department of Health  and Human Services v.
Florida, 11-398; and Florida v. Department of Health and Human
Services, 11-400.  To contact the reporter on this story:
