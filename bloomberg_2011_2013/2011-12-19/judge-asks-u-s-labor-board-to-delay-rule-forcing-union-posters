A federal judge in  Washington  asked
the  National Labor Relations Board  to delay enforcing a rule
that companies inform employees of their rights to form a union.  U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson made the request
today after hearing from groups led by the  National Association
of Manufacturers  and National Federation of Independent
Businesses that challenged the board’s power to require union-
organizing posters in the workplace.  “We do not believe the law bears out that they have the
authority to require notice postings for all employers,” Joe
Trauger, vice president for human resources policy at the
manufacturers’ group, told reporters before oral arguments on
the groups’ lawsuit to throw out the standard.  The NLRB, which investigates unfair labor practices, in
August ordered employers to display notices informing workers
about their rights to form a union and bargain on contracts.
Companies using posters to announce personnel rules or policies
must add a notice about the right to bargain.  The NLRB said the  National Labor Relations Act  gives it the
authority to pursue new workplace rules such as the proposed
requirement.  The notices would have to be posted by Jan. 31.  The AFL-CIO and other union groups praised the labor
board’s proposal when it was issued.  The case is National Association of Manufacturers v.
National Labor Relations Board, 1:11-cv-1629, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
