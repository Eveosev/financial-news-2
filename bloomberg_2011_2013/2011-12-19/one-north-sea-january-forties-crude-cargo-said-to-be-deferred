One cargo of North Sea Forties crude
for loading in January was delayed by two days, according to two
people with knowledge of the export program.  The shipment with lot number F0105 will now be exported on
Jan. 7 to Jan. 9, the people said, declining to be identified
because the information is confidential. Each consignment is for
600,000 barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
