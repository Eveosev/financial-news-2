Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg
said he believes conditions are in place to reach an agreement
in the European Union on providing funds to an International
Monetary Fund package.  “Conditions are in place to make a joint statement,” Borg
told reporters today in  Stockholm .  Euro-area finance ministers held a conference call
beginning at 3:30 p.m. Brussels time today to discuss 200
billion euros ($261 billion) in additional funding through the
IMF and the mechanics of a so-called fiscal compact that was
negotiated at a Dec. 9 EU summit, according to two people
familiar with the planning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
