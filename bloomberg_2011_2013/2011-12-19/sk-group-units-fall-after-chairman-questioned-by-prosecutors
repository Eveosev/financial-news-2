SK Holdings Co. (003600)  and other  SK Group 
affiliates fell in Seoul trading after SK Group Chairman Chey
Tae Won was questioned by prosecutors over allegations he
misappropriated company funds.  Chey was questioned today at the prosecutors’ office
headquarters in Seoul over the allegations, SK Group said in an
e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. YTN
television earlier reported that Chey was questioned by
prosecutors. The prosecutors’ office declined to comment.  SK Holdings, the de facto holding company for the group,
declined 5.7 percent to 124,000 won as of 11:29 a.m. on the
Korea Exchange, headed for the lowest close since Oct. 6.  SK
Innovation Co. (096770) , the group’s refinery unit, dropped 4 percent to
143,000 won, headed for the lowest close since Oct. 10. SK
Chemicals Co. was down 2.2 percent to 61,600 won, the lowest
since April 13.  Chey apologized for “the publicity of his personal issue”
and will do his best “to address the suspicions and
misunderstanding,” SK Group said, citing his remarks at the
prosecutors’ office in the morning.  Chey Jae Won, who is SK Holdings’ vice chairman and the
younger brother of Chey Tae Won, was questioned by the
prosecutors’ office on Dec. 1 over allegations that he
misappropriated 99.2 billion won ($84 million) from SK
affiliates to make up for investment losses incurred by his
elder brother, Yonhap reported on Dec. 1. The younger Chey has
been cooperating with prosecutors over the investigations, group
spokesman Lim Su Kil said at that time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
