Bulgaria’s state railway workers
ended a 24-day strike called to protest planned job cuts after
unions and management officials reached an agreement.  A resolution over the strike, which cost the indebted
company 2.5 million lev ($1.66 million), will be signed later
today, said  Bulgarian State Railways EAD  Chairman Vladimir
Vladimirov on Sofia-based Bulgarian National Television.  “We agreed to resume work as passenger traffic is at its
highest during the holiday season and we don’t want to make
further losses,” Vladimirov said.  Workers went on strike to protest plans to fire 2,500
employees and cancel 130 money-losing lines to help win a 460
million-lev loan from the  World Bank . Bulgaria, the  European
Union’s  poorest country, aims to narrow next year’s budget
deficit to 1.35 percent of gross domestic product to contain the
impact of the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis. The gap was 3.9
percent in 2010.  About 1,100 rail workers have agreed to leave and take a
severance package offered by the company this month, Vladimirov
said. Unprofitable train lines will remain closed, he said.  The railways’ losses in 2010 amounted to 218 million lev,
while its debts to banks, suppliers, tax authorities and in wage
arrears amounted to 817 million lev, Transport Minister Ivailo
Moskovski said on Nov. 23.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
