UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s board plans to set
the terms of the Italian lender’s 7.5 billion-euro ($9.8
billion) rights offering at a meeting tomorrow, said two people
with knowledge of the discussions.  The underwriters managing the offering are meeting to agree
on the final details, said the people, who declined to be
identified, because the plans are private. An announcement may
be made before the market opens tomorrow, the people said.  UniCredit is raising the money to plug a capital shortfall
and comply with the European Banking Authority’s targets. The
Milan-based bank, whose market value has more than halved to
12.2 billion euros in the past year, is selling shares after
 Italy ’s Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl failed to get orders for
all the stock on sale in its November offering.  The stock fell 2.5 percent to 6.33 euros in Milan trading
today. The shares have declined about 18 percent since the
lender announced the offering on Nov. 14. Officials at the bank
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
