Federal regulators denied a request
from  Michigan ’s Republican governor,  Rick Snyder , to waive new
limits on profits and administrative costs for the state’s
health insurers.  Michigan becomes the second-largest state to have such a
request turned down by the Obama administration. The government
rejected a similar request from Florida on Dec. 15.  The 2010 health-care overhaul requires insurers to spend at
least 80 percent of premiums they collect on patient care.
Seventeen states have asked for adjustments to the standard.
Only  Maine  had its full request approved while five others got
partial exemptions. Six states had requests turned down.  In Michigan, “most issuers are either profitable or
adjusting business models to reach the 80 percent standard,
suggesting no intent to exit” the state, the U.S. Center for
Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight said in a
statement.  State insurance officials in  Florida  and elsewhere have
warned that insurers may stop doing business in their states if
they don’t win reprieves from the rule.  Michigan’s insurance market is dominated by the nonprofit
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Group, which had about 40
percent market share in 2010, according to data collected by the
 National Association of Insurance Commissioners . The company
already meets the 80 percent standard, Michigan’s insurance
commissioner, Kevin Clinton, said in a letter to federal
regulators requesting the waiver.  To contact the reporter on this story:
