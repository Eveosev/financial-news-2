Turkish  yields  rose the most in a
week on concern that inflation may rise in early 2012 as the
worsening outlook for  Europe  may further weaken the lira, which
is already down 18 percent this year.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt increased 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, the biggest rise since Dec.
12, a Royal Bank of Scotland index of the local securities
showed. The lira was little changed at 1.8872 per dollar.  The Turkish currency is the second-worst performing this
year among more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, weakened by concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
damp growth in a region which buys half its exports and worsen
its record  current-account deficit .  Inflation  rose to 9.5
percent in November from 7.7 percent a month earlier, the
statistics office announced Dec. 5.  “January, February and March will the months when
inflation will be at its highest,” Gizem Oztok Altinsac,
economist at Garanti Investment, said in an e-mailed note.
“There is a high risk that Europe’s financial risks deepen in
this period.”  Bonds yields  have jumped from 8.4 percent in September to
10.46 percent today after the Turkish central bank almost
doubled the borrowing costs to rein in credit growth and the
current-account deficit via a dual rates policy, with lending
rates as high as 12.5 percent.  “We expect the central bank to continue its current policy
in the first half of next year. That means  interest rates  will
remain high,” said Altinsac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
