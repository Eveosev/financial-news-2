U.S. stocks erased early gains as
banks retreated on concern over stricter international capital
standards and energy companies slid as oil turned lower.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,217.56 at 10:54 a.m. in  New York  after earlier climbing as
much as 0.4 percent.  Banks should be forced to reveal more data about their
financial reserves so that they can’t conceal poor management
decisions and excessive risk-taking, global regulators said.
Lenders should “disclose the full list” of instruments that
they are counting toward meeting their required minimum capital
levels, the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The Wall Street Journal reported that the  Federal Reserve 
is expected to accept the rules laid out by the Basel Committee.
The newspaper cited unidentified people familiar with the
situation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
