Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , a
Serbian oil company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , agreed with
Rohoel Aufsuchungs AG of Austria on joint oil and gas
exploration and production in Hungary.  The partners agreed to split costs and expected profits
from the 2,255 square kilometer (870 square-mile) area in the
Kiskunhalas area in southern Hungary, the Belgrade-based
company, also known as NIS, said in an e-mailed statement.
Drilling is to begin in 2012 and NIS will get 50 percent of any
output from the field for which RAG holds the license, it said.  “The aim of the cooperation is to bring together
investments and share the risks and profits from gas and oil
resources,” NIS said after the agreement was signed in Vienna
today.  Vertically integrated NIS already operates fields across
the border, in  Serbia , and the agreement with RAG is part of its
regional expansion aimed at increasing production “as well as
resource base and level of secured reserves,” Chief Executive
Officer Kirill Krachenko said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
