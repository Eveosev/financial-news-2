Iranian media broadcast images of a
man arrested on charges of spying for the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency and allegedly sent to infiltrate the
intelligence ministry.  The man was identified as Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, an American
of Iranian descent, state-run  Press TV  said on its website.
Hekmati, who was born in  Arizona , said he joined the U.S. Army
in 2001 after completing high school, according to the state-run
 Fars  news agency. He underwent military and intelligence
training and was later sent to the U.S.-run Bagram air base in
 Afghanistan  where he was given access to classified intelligence
before flying to Tehran, Press TV said.  Hekmati said he was asked to win the trust of  Iran ’s
intelligence ministry by providing a mix of accurate and
erroneous information, Press TV said.  The arrest comes amid escalating tension between Iran and
the U.S., which are at loggerheads over the Persian Gulf
country’s nuclear program, and less than two weeks after Iranian
authorities got hold of a U.S. drone plane used for gathering
intelligence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
