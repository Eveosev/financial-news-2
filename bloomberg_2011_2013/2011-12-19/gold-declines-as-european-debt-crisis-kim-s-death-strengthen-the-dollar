Gold fell as the dollar strengthened
against the euro, eroding the metal’s appeal as an alternative
investment.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said that
substantial risks to the economy remain, and the euro dropped as
much as 0.5 percent. Gold has slumped 17 percent from a record
$1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6, while the euro dropped 7 percent
against the  greenback .  “The dollar has moved positive on the day, impacting
gold,”  Scott Gardner , the chief investment officer at Verdmont
Capital SA in Panama, said in an e-mail. “It will take some
time for investors to regain confidence in gold as a crisis
hedge, given the magnitude of the recent shakeout.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,596.70 at 1:59 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . Last
week, the metal dropped 6.9 percent, the most since the week
ended Sept. 23. Bullion has climbed 12 percent this year.  “Gold suffered from a renewed rush for dollar liquidity,
but in the long run, its outlook remains solid,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in  London , said in a
report. “Accommodative monetary policy across the globe will
continue to secure gold’s inflation hedge role.”  Silver futures for March delivery fell 2.7 percent to
$28.874 an ounce. The metal dropped 8 percent last week and has
lost 6.7 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell 0.3 percent to
close at $1,413.60 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The price declined 6.5 percent last week.  Palladium futures for March delivery declined 1.3 percent
to $617.70 an ounce, after tumbling 8.9 percent last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
