performance this year, with more than half of the 70 biggest
cities monitored in November recording declines after the
government reiterated plans to maintain property curbs,
according to a statement released on the national statistics
bureau’s website yesterday.  CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL)  , the developer that gets about 21
percent of sales from China, dropped 1.7 percent to S$2.26.
 Guocoland Ltd. (GUOL)  , the homebuilder that counts China as
its biggest market, fell 1.7 percent to S$1.74.  SMRT Corp. (MRT SP), Singapore’s biggest commuter train
operator, dropped 2.8 percent to S$1.77. Singapore’s worst
subway disruptions on record have led to calls for rail operator
SMRT Corp.’s Chief Executive Officer Saw Phaik Hwa to step down.
Saw told ChannlNewsAsia she has no plans to resign.  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  , the palm-oil producer
that gets more than half of its sales from China, decreased 2.2
percent to S$4.89. China’s palm-oil consumption may decline this
year after the government sold stockpiles and curbed illegal
production of blended cooking oil, the China National Grain &
Oils Information Center said in e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
