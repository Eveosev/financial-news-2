Nordic Capital  AB, a Swedish
private-equity firm, agreed to acquire  Orc Group AB (ORC) , sparking
the biggest jump in 10 years in the shares of the Stocholm-based
trading and market-making services company.  Cidron Delfi Intressenter AB, owned by Nordic Capital,
offered 86 kronor in cash for every Orc share, valuing the
company at about 2 billion kronor ($290 million), Nordic Capital
said today in a statement. Orc’s board unanimously recommended
the bid, which offers a premium of 52 percent compared with the
past three-month average share price, it said.  Orc had third-quarter net income of 12.9 million kronor
compared with a net loss of 237,000 kronor a year earlier, the
company said Oct. 13. Orc’s board said it hired Lazard to
evaluate the offer and to contact other potentially interested
parties.  “At this point the board of directors can neither confirm
nor rule out that any competing offer will materialize,” Orc
said in a statement. “The price that Cidron Delfi Intressenter
offers entails a significant premium.”  Orc’s shares rose as much as 34 percent, and traded at 86
kronor, up 33 percent versus Dec. 16’s close, at 10:10 a.m. in
 Stockholm .  To contact the reporter on this story:
