Michael Vick  passed for one
touchdown and ran for another as the  Philadelphia Eagles  kept
their playoff chances alive with a 45-19 defeat of the  New York
Jets , whose postseason aspirations were hurt.  The Eagles (6-8) opened a 28-0 lead early in the second
period at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia and the Jets
(8-6) never got within two touchdowns after that.  LeSean McCoy ran for three scores for the Eagles.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
