The  European Central Bank  stepped up
bond purchases last week as leaders prepared to meet a self-
imposed deadline for drawing additional aid to the debt crisis.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it settled 3.36 billion euros
($4.4 billion) of bond purchases in the week through Dec. 16, up
from 635 million euros the previous week. The central bank will
take seven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the 211 billion
euros of liquidity created since its  bond program  started on May
10 last year, a practice it employs to ensure the purchases
don’t fuel inflation.  European finance ministers are holding a conference call
today to discuss 200 billion euros in additional funding through
the  International Monetary Fund . Spanish and Italian notes
advanced today, driving down yields, on speculation banks bought
the securities to use as collateral when the ECB starts offering
three-year loans tomorrow. Italian two-year yields were at 5.11
percent, compared with 7.66 percent on Nov. 25.  ECB officials have resisted calls from investors and
governments to backstop the currency bloc and combat the turmoil
by boosting bond purchases. The ECB says it’s up to governments
to solve the crisis, and asking the central bank to rescue
states would damage its independence and credibility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
