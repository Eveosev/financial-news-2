Portuguese state-owned airline  TAP
SA  will probably post a loss this year after fuel costs
increased 40 percent, Antonio Monteiro, a spokesman for the
carrier, said today.  “The rise in fuel prices is the main factor weighing on
TAP’s results this year,” Monteiro said by phone. TAP had net
income of 62 million euros ($81 million) last year, Monteiro
said.  Portugal  plans to sell TAP in 2012 as part of a plan to
raise funds. The government requested 78 billion euros in
emergency aid from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund  in April.  Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Negocios cited TAP Chief
Executive Officer Fernando Pinto as saying today there has been
some interest in TAP. Pinto declined to provide details,
according to the newspaper’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
