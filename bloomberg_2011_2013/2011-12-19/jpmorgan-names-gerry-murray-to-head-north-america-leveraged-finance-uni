JPMorgan Chase & Co. named Gerry Murray to run its North America leveraged-finance business,
which includes  capital markets , restructuring and origination of
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans  The global investment-grade businesses for both loans and
bond originations will be led by Thomas Cassin and Huw Richards,
according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  Justin
Perras , a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, confirmed the
moves. Richards will relocate to New York from London.  JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,
divided its capital markets business into two groups last month
and named Andy O’Brien and Jim Casey co-heads of global debt-
capital markets.  Ray Doody will remain head of leveraged finance for Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, including high-yield bonds leveraged
loans and restructuring, and Melissa Smith will move to  London 
from New York to run EMEA investment-grade finance, according to
the memo.  Murray has been with the bank for more than 17 years and
was part of the original high-yield team, according to Perras.  JPMorgan leads underwriters in high-yield and high-grade
debt this year and is the largest syndicated-loan underwriter,
with a 20.1 percent market share, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are those rated below
BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s  and less than Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
