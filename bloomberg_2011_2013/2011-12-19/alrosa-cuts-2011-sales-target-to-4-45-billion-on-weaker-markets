OAO Alrosa , the world’s largest
diamond miner by output, cut its 2011 sales target to $4.45
billion as demand weakened.  That will still be a record for the company, Alrosa said
today in an e-mailed statement. The previous target was for as
much as $5 billion, according to the company’s press office.  Alrosa halted spot sales in September as slower economic
growth curbed consumption. Its focus on long-term contracts with
polishers has allowed it to stabilize sales prices, Alrosa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
