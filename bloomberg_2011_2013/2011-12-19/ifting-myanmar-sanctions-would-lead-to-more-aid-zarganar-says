A former Myanmar political prisoner
told reporters lifting sanctions, particularly to allow
investment in the garment sector, would benefit average people.  “If they lifted sanctions we would get much aid from
foreign countries,” Maung Thura, also known as Zarganar, told
foreign reporters in Bangkok on his first trip outside Myanmar.  The  World Bank  discussed ways to give aid to Myanmar in a
meeting with him today, said Maung Thura, who has been arrested
four times and was released earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
