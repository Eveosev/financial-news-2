Chung Yun Sik, the Seoul-based chief
investment officer for equities at ING Investment Management
Korea Ltd., which oversees about $16 billion, comments on the
death of North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il .  “We saw panic selling today amid concerns tensions on the
Korean peninsula may intensify.
‘‘If China comes out this time and gives supporting comments for
Kim Jong Un as successor, I think South Korean financial markets
will quickly stabilize.
‘‘When North Korea’s founder,  Kim Il Sung , died, markets
stabilized quite fast.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
