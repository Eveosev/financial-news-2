Mexico ’s peso fell for the fifth
time in six days as concern that European leaders aren’t making
progress resolving the region’s debt crisis damped demand for
emerging-market assets.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 13.9116 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close in Mexico City, from 13.8775 on Dec. 16. The currency
has declined 11.3 percent this year, the worst performance among
 Latin America ’s major currencies.  The peso erased earlier gains amid low trading volumes and
as European concerns turned investors “negative,” said Omar Martin del Campo, the head trader at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in
Mexico City. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
“substantial” risks to the economy remain and the law forbids
him from boosting government bond purchases to fight the crisis.  “There hasn’t been news which gives certainty, calmness to
the markets,” Martin del Campo said in a telephone interview.
“It’s been the opposite.”  Mexico’s central bank said it didn’t receive offers in the
three dollar auctions it held today.  Mexico’s currency-exchange commission said Nov. 29 the
central bank will auction $400 million of its reserves daily at
a peso  exchange rate  at least 2 percent weaker than the previous
day’s level to help arrest a slide in the currency.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.77
percent in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price of the security climbed 0.10 centavo to 127.78
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
