Consumption of  natural gas  for
heating in the first quarter may be the lowest since 2006,  WSI 
said in its latest seasonal outlook.  Heating demand is expected to be 5.4 percent lower than a
year earlier, even as below-normal temperatures blanket most of
the northern and western U.S.,  Todd Crawford , WSI’s chief
meteorologist, said in a statement.  Temperatures will be lower than normal from north of El
Paso, Texas, to northern  Virginia , with the coldest weather from
northern Oregon to northern Wisconsin, according to WSI, based
in Andover, Massachusetts.  The region from Texas to southern Virginia will see above-
normal temperatures, with Florida expected to be warmest.  “Natural gas inventories are likely to experience
significant draw-downs in January as a result of higher heating
demand, although possibly less than in previous years,” said
Paul Flemming, director of the analysis firm Energy Security
Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts , which works with WSI.  Milder weather will soften demand in February, he said in
the statement. Colder weather may return in March, although
“bullish expectations for natural gas prices may be limited.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
