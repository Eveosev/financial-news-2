Billionaire  Vladimir Lisin , who
agreed to pay $4 billion for 75 percent of  OAO Freight One  in
October, may replace the company’s chief executive officer once
the deal is completed,  Kommersant  reported.  Alexander Sapronov, head of Lisin’s  Independent
Transportation Co. , may become the new CEO, the Moscow-based
newspaper said, citing people it didn’t identify.  Freight One may also lease part of its cistern fleet to
billionaire  Gennady Timchenko , who competed with Lisin in
Freight One’s privatization, Kommersant said. Nobody in the
press office of UCL Holding, which holds Lisin’s transportation
assets, could be reached immediately when Bloomberg called
before normal business hours seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
