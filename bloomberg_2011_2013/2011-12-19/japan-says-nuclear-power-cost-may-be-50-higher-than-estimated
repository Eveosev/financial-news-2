Nuclear power generation in  Japan  is
about 50 percent more expensive than estimated after factoring
in the cost of paying for an accident like the Fukushima
disaster, a government panel said.  Nuclear energy costs at least 8.9 yen (11 cents) per
kilowatt hour, compared with a government estimate of 5.9 yen in
2004, the panel said in a  draft report  today. Coal is estimated
to cost 9.5 yen per kilowatt hour, while liquefied natural gas
and oil cost 10.7 yen and 36 yen respectively.  Japan’s government is reviewing its energy policy after the
disaster at  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic
station. The government will use the panel’s findings to draw up
a new  energy policy  that may call for reducing reliance on
nuclear power.  The committee estimated a catastrophe like Fukushima would
cost a minimum of about 6 trillion yen ($77 billion), the report
said. Each 1 trillion yen increase raises the cost of generation
by 0.1 yen per kilowatt hour, it said. The panel is headed by
Katsuyuki Ishida, a senior  vice-minister  in the Cabinet Office.  By 2030, the cost of coal, LNG and oil power generation are
estimated to rise to 10.3 yen, 10.9 yen and 38.9 yen per
kilowatt hour because of carbon emission costs and rising fuel
prices, the report said.  Wind power from turbines on land may fall to as low as 8.8
yen an hour by 2030 from 9.9 yen in 2010 as technological
innovations make it cheaper, the panel said. Residential solar
power generation is forecast to be 9.9 yen by 2030 from 33.4 yen
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
