The average operating rate of U.S.
plants that make chlorine and caustic soda was unchanged at 76
percent in November, a trade group said.  The industry’s average operating rate for plants that make
the chemicals known as chlor-alkali was the same as in October,
 The Chlorine Institute , based in Arlington,  Virginia , said today
in an e-mail. Plants on average ran at 84 percent of capacity in
November of 2010.  Chlorine is used to make vinyl products such as siding and
polyvinyl chloride pipe. Caustic soda, produced in tandem with
chlorine, is used to make pulp, paper and soap.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) 
is the world’s largest maker of chlor-alkali, followed by
 Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) ,  Olin Corp. (OLN)  and  PPG Industries Inc. (PPG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
