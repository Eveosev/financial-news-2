Vung Ro Petroleum has received land
from the Phu Yen People’s Committee to build a 4 million-ton-a-
year oil refinery, according to the Vietnam Investment Review,
citing a company official it did not identify.  The company is seeking an engineering, procurement and
construction contractor, a process that could take eight months,
the newsletter said, citing the official.  Vo Rung is a joint venture between the U.K.-based
Technostar Management Ltd. and  Russia ’s Telloil Group, the
newsletter said.  The $1.7 billion refinery project was licensed in 2007 and
has been delayed because of site-clearance issues, said Vietnam
Investment Review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
