JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is monitoring
political fallout following the death of North Korean dictator
Kim Jong Il, said Jes Staley, chief executive officer of the
investment-banking unit.  “ North Korea , in and of itself, is not really economically
relevant to any of these markets,” Staley said, referring to
the U.S., Asia and European economies on Bloomberg Television’s
Inside Track today. “That being said, the political instability
it could mean for a Japan, for South Korea, which is a very
important market for us, or for China” is being watched for its
impact on financial markets, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
