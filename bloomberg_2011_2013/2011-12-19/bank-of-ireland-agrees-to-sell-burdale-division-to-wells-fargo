Bank of Ireland Plc (BKIR) , the nation’s
largest bank, agreed to sell its Burdale Financial Holdings Ltd.
unit to  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  for about 690 million euros ($899
million) to reduce its loan book after the country’s bailout.  The lender said it had separately sold a further 2.2
billion euros of loans, to overseas borrowers, without giving
more details, according to a statement today. Burdale extends
loans secured against assets.  The sales bring the amount of loans sold by the Dublin-
based bank this year to 8.6 billion euros. Chief Executive
Officer Richie Boucher set a target in April of selling 10
billion euros of assets and running down a further 20 billion
euros of loans by 2013. The bank, the only one of Ireland’s six
largest lenders to escape majority state ownership, has so far
sold its loans for about 7.1 percent less than face value.  Bank of Ireland said losses from its asset-sales program
won’t be any worse than the so-called base case scenario set out
as part of the bank stress tests in March.  The shares rose 1.3 percent to 7.9 euro cents at 10:25 a.m.
in Dublin trading for a market value of 2.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
