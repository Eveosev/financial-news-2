The rand strengthened for a third
day amid speculation that the worst emerging market currency
slump this year has left the  exchange rate  undervalued.  The South African currency appreciated as much as 1 percent
before paring its gains to 0.3 percent at 8.3778 as of 3:37 p.m.
in Johannesburg, the second best performer out of more than 20
emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The rand has
slumped 21 percent this year.  “In the South African space we have seen such a massive
sell-off, I think the market might be a bit oversold,”  Brigid Taylor , head of institutional sales at Johannesburg-based
Nedbank Capital, said by phone. “A lot of players in the local
market not being around creates thin markets.”  The rand slid 3.7 percent last week, breaking through
8.4550, which represents a 76.4 percent retracement level from a
Nov. 30 low, according to Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics,
citing the daily Fibonacci chart. Fibonacci analysis is based on
the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low. A break above resistance, or below
support, indicates it may move to the next level. Support refers
to an area where buy orders may cluster. Resistance is where
there may be orders to sell.  “Once the markets have moved to price in the risk
associated with  North Korea  this morning, the situation is bound
to be a lot clearer,”  George Glynos , an economist at
Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics, wrote in e-mailed comments. An
initial retreat by the rand would target levels toward 8.2650,
which is a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level.  Equities Slide  The death of North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il  on Dec. 17
sparked concern there will be a power struggle in the communist
nation, contributing to a fall in equities and commodity prices.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell as much as 1.9 percent
before paring its loss to 1.4% at 891.46 as of 2:20 p.m. in
 London , set for its lowest close in more than three weeks.  South African debt advanced, a third day of gains, with the
yield on 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 declining 3.6 basis points,
or 0.036 percentage point, to 6.910 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
