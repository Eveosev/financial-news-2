South Korea  said conflicts between
opposition and ruling party lawmakers are disrupting efforts to
make polluters pay for their emissions starting in 2015.  Opposition parties have boycotted all agenda schedules of
the National Assembly, including those concerning carbon trading,
Park Chun Kyoo, director general of the Presidential Committee
on Green Growth, said by phone today. The boycott started after
the ruling  Grand National Party  used its majority in the
National Assembly on Nov. 23 to ratify a free-trade agreement
between the U.S. and South Korea.  “Our goal remains intact to proceed with the carbon
legislation as soon as possible, with a target by the end of
this year,” Park said. “Still, as the assembly is now wasting
time with no talks, it’s unclear to assess when the legislation
would be on track.”  The proposed legislation would make South Korea the third
country in the Asia-Pacific region after  Australia  and  New
Zealand  to ask polluters to pay for the cost of their
greenhouse-gas emissions. South Korea said in November 2009 that
it plans to voluntarily cut emissions by 30 percent from an
expected 813 million metric tons of greenhouse gas by 2020, or 4
percent below its 2005 emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
