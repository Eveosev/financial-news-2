Commercial Metals Co. (CMC)  urged
investors to turn down an $1.73 billion tender offer from
billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  because it undervalues the steel
producer.  “The CMC Board firmly believes that the continued pursuit
of the company’s strategy will deliver far greater value for
CMC’s stockholders than Mr. Icahn’s offer,” Anthony Massaro,
Commercial Metals’ lead director, said in a statement today.  Commercial Metals, based in Irving,  Texas , also reported
first-quarter earnings will be 87 to 97 cents per share after
deducting costs related to closing the company’s Croatian pipe
mill. Commercial Metals’ expected profit compares with the 12-
cent average of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Icahn said Dec. 9 that his tender offer needs support from
at least 40.1 percent of Commerical Metals’ shareholders to
succeed. That would give Icahn a majority when combined with his
current stake of about 10 percent, New York-based  Icahn
Enterprises LP (IEP)  said.  Icahn asked the board to lift a restriction that limits his
holdings to 10 percent. Icahn said he would go to court if the
board failed to do so.  Icahn Enterprises  previously offered to
buy Commercial Metals in a Nov. 28 letter to the company’s
directors.  Icahn said he would sell “non-core” assets, appoint new
management and combine Commercial Metals with his existing
metals-recycling assets.  Commercial Metals is being advised by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and law firm Sidley Austin LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
