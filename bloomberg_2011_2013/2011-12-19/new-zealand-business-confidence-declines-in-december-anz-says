New Zealand business confidence fell
for the fourth time in five months in December, while a second
gauge of sales and profits fell to a nine-month low, according
to a survey by ANZ National Bank Ltd.  A net 16.9 percent of companies expect the economy will
improve over the next 12 months, down from 18.3 percent in
November, according to the survey released in Wellington today.
A measure of expectations for companiesâ€™ own sales and earnings
declined to 25.7 percent, the lowest since March, compared with
28.8 percent last month.  The net figure subtracts the number of pessimists from the
number of optimists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
