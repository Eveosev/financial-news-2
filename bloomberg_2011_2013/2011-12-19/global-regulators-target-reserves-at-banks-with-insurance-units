Global  banking , insurance and market
regulators published draft guidelines for authorities on
assessing whether banks with insurance arms are “properly”
managing their liquidity and capital levels.  “The financial crisis that began in 2007 exposed
situations in which regulatory requirements and oversight did
not fully capture all the activities of financial
conglomerates,” the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , the
International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the
International Association of Insurance Supervisors, said in an
e-mailed statement on the IOSCO website today. The new rules
address “gaps” in supervision, they said.  A financial conglomerate, or bancassurer, provides both
 banking (SX7P)  and insurance services. The groups will seek views on
the draft guidelines until March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
