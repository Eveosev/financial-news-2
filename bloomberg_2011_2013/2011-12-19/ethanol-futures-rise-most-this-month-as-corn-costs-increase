Ethanol futures rose the most this
month after corn costs increased for U.S. producers.  Prices gained 1.8 percent as dry, hot  weather  threatens
 South American  corn, spurring demand for U.S.-grown supply. Corn
is the basis of ethanol produced in the U.S., with one bushel
making at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel.  “Ethanol is showing strength due to corn,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFG Best in  Chicago . “That’s from the fear
about the crop in Argentina.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery advanced 3.7 cents
to $2.112 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are
down 11 percent in 2011, heading for the first yearly decline
since 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago lost 3 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.155 a gallon and in  New York  the additive
decreased 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.255, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf declined 2 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.295 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slid 2
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.275.  Corn for March delivery jumped 18 cents, or 3.1 percent, to
$6.01 a bushel in Chicago.  Flynn said ethanol prices also increased as crude oil rose.
The biofuel is part of U.S. plans to reduce consumption of the
 fossil fuel .  Crude oil for January delivery gained 35 cents to settle at
$93.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The January
contract expires tomorrow. The more actively traded February
futures rose 30 cents to $94.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
