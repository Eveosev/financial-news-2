A  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  mobile phone
unit filed a 286 million-euro  ($373 million) lawsuit against
Slovenian phone company  Telekom Slovenije (TLSG)  Group d.d. over
alleged “unlawful practices.”  Si.mobil d.d. claims it incurred damage on the retail and
wholesale telecommunications market due to alleged “predatory
prices,” Ljubljana-based Telekom Slovenije said in a regulatory
filing.  The suit is the second this month for the Slovenian phone
company after another rival, Tusmobil d.o.o, demanded 86 million
euros for abuse of its dominant market position, the company
said on Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
