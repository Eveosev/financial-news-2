The  New York Knicks  signed free-
agent point guard Baron Davis, the National Basketball
Association team said in a statement.  The Knicks have been seeking depth at the point guard
position since releasing Chauncey Billups on Dec. 10. New York
signed Mike Bibby to a one-year contract last week at the
veteranâ€™s minimum of $1.4 million to join Toney Douglas at the
position.  The 32-year-old Davis, a two-time All-Star, averaged 13.1
points and 6.7 assists last season while playing in 58 games for
the Cleveland Cavaliers and  Los Angeles Clippers . He may miss
eight to 10 weeks with a herniated disc in his back, the New
York Post reported last week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
