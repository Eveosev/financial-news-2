Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s crippled
reactors in Fukushima are in a state “equivalent to cold
shutdown” even though the definition would be different in the
case of an undamaged plant,  Goshi Hosono , the minister in charge
of responding to the disaster, said today.  “We understand that there is a difference between the cold
shutdown state for a normal nuclear reactor and the state of
cold shutdown that we have achieved at Fukushima Dai-Ichi,”
Hosono told reporters in  Tokyo . “The goal is to have nuclear
fuel where it is kept in a cold state and to ensure that
radioactive materials are not emitted. That is the whole point
of the cooling system that we have in place.”  The government on Dec. 16 announced  Tokyo Electric  had
achieved the milestone, which has been disputed because some
scientists have argued that cold shutdown doesn’t apply to
melted reactors.  Cold shutdown describes a reactor’s cooling system
operating at atmospheric pressure and below 93 degrees Celsius
(200 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. Tokyo Electric has released data showing
it meets these criteria at Fukushima, Hosono said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
