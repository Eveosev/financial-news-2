Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the third-largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, bought more than 650 sites in the
Portland, Oregon, and Seattle areas, following competitors  Toll
Brothers Inc. (TOL)  and  MDC Holdings Inc. (MDC)  into the Pacific Northwest.  The Seattle-area purchases from closely held Premier
Communities LLC and of sites in 11 Portland-area communities are
expected to generate about 200 home deliveries in the second
half of 2012 for Miami-based Lennar, according to a statement
today. Terms weren’t disclosed. The move is the first entry by
Lennar into a new market since early 2010, when it began
operations in Atlanta.  “Both Seattle and Portland are currently benefiting from
diversified economies and stabilizing  home prices ,” Jon Jaffe,
Lennar’s chief operating officer, said in the statement.  Confidence for homebuilders rose in December, the third
consecutive monthly increase and a sign of stabilization in the
housing market, according to the National Association of Home
Builders/ Wells Fargo (WFC)  index released today. The index climbed to
21 from 19 in November. Readings below 50 mean more respondents
said conditions were poor.  New homes  are expected to have sold in November at an
annual rate of 315,000, the median of 67 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey, when data is released Dec. 23. This year is on
pace to be the slowest for new-home sales in Commerce Department
records dating to 1963, following 2010’s record low of 323,000.  ‘Fierce Competition’  “We believe, given fierce competition among large, public
homebuilders in many local markets, that attractive expansion
opportunities into markets lacking public builders’ presence is
difficult,” Adam Rudiger, an analyst with Wells Fargo & Co. in
 San Francisco , said in a note to investors today. “We find it
symbolic that the only three acquisitions announced this year
all occurred in the same market.”  Toll Brothers, based in Horsham,  Pennsylvania , and the
largest U.S. luxury-home builder, paid $143.7 million last month
for CamWest Development LLC, a closely held company with 1,500
lots under ownership or option in the Seattle area.  MDC, the Denver-based builder of Richmond American Homes,
in April purchased SDC Homes LLC, the third-largest builder in
the Seattle area, with about 280 lots in 11 communities and
options on 230 lots.  Lennar’s houses from Puyallup, Washington-based Premier are
expected to sell from $150,000 to $460,000. Lennar separately
bought sites in 11 communities in the Portland area, according
to today’s statement. With the move, Lennar, which sold 10,559
houses since early last year, has homebuilding operations in 18
states and 44 markets across the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
