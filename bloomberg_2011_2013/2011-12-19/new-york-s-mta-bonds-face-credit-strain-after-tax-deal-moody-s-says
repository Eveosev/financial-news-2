New York ’s  Metropolitan
Transportation Authority , the largest U.S. transit agency, faces
“credit strain” on its revenue bonds after state lawmakers
lowered a  payroll tax , Moody’s Investor’s Service said.  The state adopted the levy, along with higher fares, in
2009 to close a $1.8 billion deficit in the MTA’s budget.
Governor  Andrew Cuomo ’s overhaul of the tax code, which the
Legislature passed Dec. 8, cut the portion of payroll taxes paid
by employers in the 12 downstate counties served by the MTA’s
commuter trains.  The state has vowed to reimburse the MTA for the lost
revenue without detailing how, Moody’s said today in a
statement. The revenue will total $212 million next year and
about $310 million annually thereafter, the ratings company
said.  “The MTA’s financial operations are already tight, and
failure to restore the lost revenue may put negative pressure on
the MTA’s transportation-revenue bonds,” said Nicole Johnson, a
Moody’s senior vice president and author of the report. “Our
credit analysis will focus on how the state establishes a new
backstop.”  The tax decision “signals a shift in government support”
for the MTA and comes as the agency plans to increase borrowing
to maintain and expand the transportation network, Moody’s said.  The bonds, known as TRBs, are rated A2, the sixth-highest
level, with a stable outlook.  The MTA operates Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road and
 New York  City’s subway system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
