The Treasury yield difference
between two- and 30-year securities shrank to the least since
October as investors sought safety on bets  Europe ’s debt crisis
will worsen and the U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year notes.  Thirty-year bonds climbed, pushing yields to the lowest in
almost three months, on concern European leaders are failing to
make progress on taming the crisis.  U.S. (YCGT0025)  two-year notes were
little changed after the auction. Its bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt
sold, was 3.45, versus a 3.38 average at the past 10 offerings.  “We are seeing a slow, steady rally on the back end of the
curve that is leading to a flatter curve, and it doesn’t look
like that is going to change much going into the year’s end,”
said  Scott Sherman , an interest-rate strategist in New York at
Credit Suisse Group AG, which as one of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21
primary dealers must bid in U.S. debt sales. “There is still
uneasiness, and thus people are taking risk off the table.”  The gap between yields on two- and 30-year securities,
known as the yield curve, narrowed to 255 basis points, the
least since Oct. 3. It reached a 2011 high of 402 basis points
in February, and the average for this year is 350 basis points.  Current U.S. two-year note yields decreased one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.23 percent at 5:15 p.m.
New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
price of the 0.25 percent securities due in November 2013
slipped 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100 1/32.  Thirty-year bond (USGG30YR)  yields tumbled seven basis points to 2.79
percent and touched 2.78 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 4.  Rescue Programs  Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive officer of Pacific
Investment Management Co., said the first part of 2012 will be
“risk off” as Europe’s debt crisis roils markets.  Newport
Beach , California-based El-Erian spoke in an interview with  Tom
Keene  on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday.”  Thirty-year securities extended gains as Dow Jones reported
euro-area finance ministers failed to agree on raising the joint
ceiling for the region’s two rescue programs, the European
Stability Mechanism and European Financial Stability Facility.
The news service cited a European Union source.  The finance chiefs met a target today for boosting Europe’s
anti-crisis warchest with a pledge to provide 150 billion euros
($195 billion) to the  International Monetary Fund .  Four non-euro users -- the  Czech Republic ,  Denmark , Poland
and  Sweden  -- will also pitch in, Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Jean-Claude Juncker  said in an e-mailed statement after chairing
a teleconference of finance ministers. The U.K. will “define
its contribution” in early 2012, according to the statement.  Three-month Treasury  bill (USGG3M)  rates dropped below zero for a
fourth consecutive day, closing at negative 0.0051 percent.  Auction Yield  The notes sold at today’s auction drew a  yield (USB7YTA)  of 0.240
percent, matching the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight primary dealers. Last month’s offering of two-
year notes drew a yield of 0.28 percent and a record-high bid-
to-cover ratio at the last auction of 4.07. The record auction
low of 0.222 percent was reached in August.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 21.6 percent of the notes at today’s
sale, compared with an average of 33.3 percent for the past 10
offerings. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that
place their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 14.7
percent, versus an average of 13.4 percent at the past 10 sales.  More Auctions  The U.S. will sell $35 billion of five-year securities
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year notes on Dec. 21. The
amounts are unchanged from the last offerings of the maturities
auctioned in November.  The government auctioned $78 billion last week in notes,
bonds and inflation-linked debt. It sold $12 billion in five-
year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Dec. 15 at a record
low yield of negative 0.877 percent and $13 billion in 30-year
bonds Dec. 14 at a  record low (USBD30YT)  yield of 2.925 percent, drawing
3.05 times the bids as the amount sold, the highest level since
August 2000. Auctions of 10- and three-year notes also drew
stronger-than-average demand as investors sought refuge amid
speculation  France  will be downgraded and concern European
leaders are struggling to resolve the crisis.  The Fed  purchased  $4.898 billion of Treasuries due in 2018
today as part of a plan announced in September to replace $400
billion of shorter maturities in its holdings with longer-term
debt to cap borrowing costs and support the economy.  “There still seems to be a need for Treasuries in the back
end of the market, as people are reaching for yield toward the
end of the year given the general  risk aversion  in the
atmosphere, even at these incredibly low yields,” said Paul Horrmann, a broker in  New York  at Tradition Asiel Securities
Inc., an interdealer broker.  Yield Outlook  The yield on the two-year note will end the year at 0.27
percent, according to the median forecast of 58 economists in a
Bloomberg News Survey. The 30-year yield will be 3.10 percent,
according to the median projection for that maturity.  Benchmark 10-year note yields may touch 1.5 percent in the
first half of 2012 amid slow growth, the threat of a worsening
crisis in Europe and a lack of inflation, Dominic Konstam, head
of interest-rate strategy at the primary dealer Deutsche Bank AG
in New York, wrote in a note to clients.  “It has to be worse before it can be better,” he wrote.  Treasury supply probably will “remain stable near term”
because of uncertainty on fiscal policies, Konstam wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
