Banks  should be forced to reveal
more data about their financial reserves so that they can’t
conceal poor management decisions and excessive risk-taking,
global regulators said.  Lenders should “disclose the full list” of instruments
that they are counting toward meeting their required minimum
capital levels, the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  said
in an e-mailed statement today.  “Insufficiently detailed disclosure and a lack of
consistency in reporting” may have “hampered” regulators and
contributed to the financial crisis that followed the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, the group said.  Banks (SX7P) 
should also show how they have applied rules forcing them to
write down the value of some securities they count as capital.  Global regulators have agreed since the crisis to more than
triple the core capital that banks must hold to guard themselves
against insolvency and also to force them to stockpile easily
sellable assets to survive a short-term funding squeeze.  Lenders including  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  BNP
Paribas SA  have warned that plans by the Basel committee to
impose capital surcharges on systemically important lenders
could force them to cut loans to businesses and support to
international trade.  The Basel committee brings together regulators from 27
countries including the U.K., U.S. and  China . The group is
seeking views on the disclosure plans until Feb. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
