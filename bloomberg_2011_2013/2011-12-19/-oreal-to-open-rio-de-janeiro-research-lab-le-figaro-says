L’Oreal SA (OR)  will open a 30 million

seeks to double sales in  Brazil  by 2015 and add 50 million new
customers there in the next decade, Le Figaro  reported , without
saying where it got the information.  The French daily didn’t say when the laboratory, L’Oreal’s
eighteenth worldwide, would open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
