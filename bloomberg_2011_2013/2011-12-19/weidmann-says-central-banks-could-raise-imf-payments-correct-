     (Corrects ‘banks’ to ‘states’ in final sentence.)  Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
told French daily  Les Echos  in an interview that he’s ready to
support an increase in payments by central banks in  Europe  to
the International Monetary Fund.  The increased payments should be made to the IMF’s general
account and would therefore be available to all members,
Weidmann told the newspaper. He said that he would be opposed to
higher payments being directly allocated to refinancing European
states.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
