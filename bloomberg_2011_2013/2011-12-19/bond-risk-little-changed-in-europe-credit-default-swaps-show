The cost of insuring against default
on European financial and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased seven basis points to 312 and
the subordinated index fell five to 555, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. at 2 p.m. in London. A decline signals improvement
in perceptions of  credit quality ; an increase, the opposite.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell two basis
points to 799. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings declined 0.75 basis point to 186.5
basis points.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell two basis points to 367 basis points. Contracts
on  Spain  dropped 17 basis points to 402 and  Italy  fell 11 to
531.5, according to CMA.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
