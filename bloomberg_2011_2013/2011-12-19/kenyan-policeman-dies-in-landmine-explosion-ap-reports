A landmine explosion at the worldâ€™s
largest refugee camp in north-eastern Kenya killed one policeman
and critically injured two others, the  Associated Press 
reported, citing Northeastern Provincial Police Chief Leo
Nyongesa.  Kenya has experienced at least a dozen grenade attacks
since deploying its troops into neighboring Somalia two months
ago to help drive out Islamic militants known as al-Shabaab, the
 news agency  said. Security forces at the Dadaab refugee camp,
which hosts more than 500,000 refugees mainly from Somalia, have
been the target of blasts on at least three occasions, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
