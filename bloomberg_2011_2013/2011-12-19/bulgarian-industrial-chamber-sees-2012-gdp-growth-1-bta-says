Bulgaria’s Industrial Association
forecasts next year’s economic growth at less than 1 percent as
the euro area crisis cuts demand for the country’s exports, the
 Bulgarian Telegraph Agency  reported today.  Some 20 percent of 500 businesses surveyed plan to freeze
wages and downscale investment plans, the agency said, citing
Bozhidar Danev, chairman of the association. As much as 50
percent of the companies have no clear plans about their future
operation, Danev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
