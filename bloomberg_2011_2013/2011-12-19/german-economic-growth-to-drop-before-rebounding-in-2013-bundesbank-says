The Bundesbank said German economic
growth will rebound in 2013 after slumping next year as the euro
region’s sovereign debt crisis gradually abates.  Growth  will slow to 0.6 percent in 2012 from 3 percent this
year before recovering to 1.8 percent in 2013, the Frankfurt-
based Bundesbank said in its monthly report today.  Germany ’s
central bank said its base scenario is that the debt crisis
doesn’t worsen and that the uncertainty among investors and
consumers “gradually lessens.”  “The German economy could in the course of next year
return to a solid growth path, supported by an expansive
monetary policy and a more strongly-growing world economy,” the
Bundesbank said. “This forecast assumes that there is no
further significant worsening in the sovereign debt crisis.”  Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann has said he opposes the
 European Central Bank  stepping up its bond purchases to battle
the debt crisis, and it’s up to governments to find a lasting
solution. Plans for a “fiscal compact” announced by European
Union leaders earlier this month may help to reduce the
“unusually high” level of uncertainty about the economic
outlook, the Bundesbank said.  “If in the near future the envisaged reforms are
successful in overcoming the fiscal crisis and dissolving the
reticence of investors, growth in Germany could be better in the
medium term than set out here,” it said in today’s report.
“Downside risks from the debt crisis should nevertheless be
given greater weight.”  Broad Upswing  Domestic conditions in Germany remain in place for a
“broad, protracted upswing,” the Bundesbank said. While the
short-term outlook has clouded over in recent months and the
economy will experience a difficult period this winter, the
decline in unemployment is bolstering  consumer spending .  Domestic demand will drive growth next year while net trade
makes a negative contribution, it said.  German export growth will slump to 3 percent in 2012 from
10 percent in 2011 and 18 percent in 2010, Hans-Peter Keitel,
president of Germany’s BDI industry lobby, said today at the
presentation of the BDI’s foreign trade report.  “German exporters will clearly feel the weaker demand in
 Europe ,” the Bundesbank said. Still, “private consumption
should benefit from the favorable labor market situation as well
as clearly rising incomes.”  The number of people in jobs in Germany will grow 0.3
percent in 2012 and 0.4 percent in the following year, reducing
the  unemployment rate  to an average 7 percent next year and 6.8
percent in 2013, the central bank said.  Inflation should slow to 1.8 percent next year and 1.5
percent in 2013 from 2.5 percent in 2011, it said.  Germany’s budget deficit will drop to around 1 percent of
gross domestic product this year from 4.3 percent in 2010 and
the ratio will be little changed in 2012 and 2013, the
Bundesbank said. German debt will probably sink to 81 percent of
GDP at the end of this year from 83.2 percent a year earlier, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
