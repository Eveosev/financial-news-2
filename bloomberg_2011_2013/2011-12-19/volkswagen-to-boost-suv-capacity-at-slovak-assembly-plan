Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
carmaker, plans to increase production of sport-utility vehicles
at its Slovak factory to meet rising demand for the models.  The factory in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, will adjust
the lines during a companywide holiday break to prepare for the
planned boost, unit spokesman Vladimir Machalik said in an e-
mailed statement today. The adjustment requires a 50 million-
euro ($65 million) investment, he said.  The plant assembles Volkswagen Touareg and Audi-brand Q7
SUVs as well as bodies for Porsche Cayenne and the investment
will boost production capacity in this segment by one-fourth,
Machalik said, without elaborating. This year, Volkswagen began
producing the so-called New Small Family line of subcompact
cars.  In 2010, the factory shipped 144,510 cars with SUVs
accounting for 93 percent of output. The unit is sticking to its
plan to make “a bit more than” 400,000 vehicles next year even
as the euro area is facing a recession, Chief Executive Officer
Andreas Tostmann said on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
