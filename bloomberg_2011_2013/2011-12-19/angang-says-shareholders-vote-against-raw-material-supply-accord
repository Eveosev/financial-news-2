Angang Steel Co. (347) , the biggest Hong
Kong-traded steelmaker, said its shareholders rejected an
agreement to buy raw material and services from its parent for
the 2012-2013 period.  About 66 percent of stockholders voted against the accord
with Anshan Iron & Steel Group, according to a statement to the
 Shanghai Stock Exchange  yesterday.  Angang Steel had agreed to buy iron ore from its parent at
a 5 percent discount to the average spot price in the previous
six-month period, the company said Nov. 29.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
