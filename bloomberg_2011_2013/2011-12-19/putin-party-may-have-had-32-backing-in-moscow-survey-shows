Thirty-two percent of Moscow voters
backed Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin â€™s United Russia party in a
Dec. 4 parliamentary vote, less than the official total of about
47 percent, a Levada Center survey showed.  The poll of 1,000 Muscovites aged 18 or older was conducted
Dec. 8-16 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3
percentage points, the Moscow-based pollster said today in a
 statement  on its website.  Other parties on the ballot were all found to have had more
support than the official results showed, albeit within the
margin of error. International election observers said they saw
evidence of ballot-box stuffing, prompting about 50,000 people
to protest the results in central Moscow on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
