OAO RusHydro  slid by the most in a
week after Interfax reported Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
Russiaâ€™s largest renewable energy producer should cut its prices
by 12.5 percent on average next year.  The stock tumbled 3.5 percent to 1.03 rubles by 1:15 p.m.
in Moscow, headed for its biggest loss since Dec. 12.  Putin requested the  Finance Ministry  and VEB, the state
development bank, work out a financing plan to ensure RusHydo
carries out planned investments, Interfax reported, citing
comments at a government meeting on the power industry in
Siberia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
