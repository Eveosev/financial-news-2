The U.K.  Financial Services
Authority  issued a record 12.9 million pounds ($20 million) in
fines to individuals in 2011, an increase of 47 percent from
last year.  The watchdog fined both firms and individuals a total of
65.5 million pounds this year, less than the 88.4 million levied
last year, according to research by law firm Reynolds Porter
Chamberlain LLP. The figures differ from the FSA’s own table of
fines on its  website , which lists 63.4 million pounds in fines.  The watchdog fined Jaspreet Ahuja, a former client adviser
at UBS AG’s wealth-management unit in  London , 150,000 pounds on
Dec. 16 for helping a client break Indian law through an
offshore fund.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  received the biggest single
fine in 2011 and must pay 10.5 million pounds for abusive sales
of investment products to elderly customers.  “The FSA is targeting high profile individuals in hard to
prosecute cases,” Richard Burger, a lawyer at RPC, said in an
e-mailed statement. FSA’s strategy “is to bring regulatory
issues closer to home for company directors and other approved
persons.”  The 2010 figures were boosted by the FSA’s largest ever
fine.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s London unit paid out a record 33.3
million pounds in June for not properly separating client money
from the firm’s accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
