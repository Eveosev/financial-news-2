Zimmer Holdings Inc. (ZMH) , maker of
artificial knees and hips, said it will pay an 18-cent quarterly
dividend for the first quarter and repurchase as much as $1.5
billion in shares through 2014.  Future dividends will be subject to approval of the board,
the Warsaw, Indiana-based company said in a statement. The new
buyback program replaces a plan that would have ended in 2013.  The company has bought about $4.5 billion of its shares
since 2005, according to the statement. The device maker had
$299 million left at the end of the third quarter under the
previous program, according to Charlie Young, a spokesman. The
old plan, approved in 2010, authorized the repurchase of as much
as $1.4 billion in stock.  The dividend “ reinforces our confidence in the company’s
future and our commitment to generating value for
stockholders,” said David Dvorak, chief executive officer of
Zimmer, in the statement.  Zimmer rose less than 1 percent to $47.70 at 4:15 p.m.  New
York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
