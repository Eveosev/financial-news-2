JSE Ltd. (JSE)  may increase the number of
foreign investors trading on the bourse through a partnership
with a U.K.-based technology company, Michelle Joubert, head of
 investor relations  said today.  Fixnetix will provide European investors with access to JSE
data from early next year, the operator of Johannesburg’s stock
exchange said Dec. 15. This will be extended to include trading
of equities once the JSE switches to a new system in the first
half of 2012, Joubert said. The exchange’s trading platform is
currently hosted by the London Stock Exchange.  “The whole package will help us compete for trading
volumes,” Joubert said. “The net effect of change is going to
increase the speed of execution orders and, in a trading
environment where latency is a disincentive for certain types of
traders, this is significant.”  Foreign investors owned 33 percent of shares listed on the
JSE by value as of Dec. 31, 2010, according to the latest data
provided by the bourse. The JSE has a market capitalization of
5.32 trillion rand ($636 billion), ranking it in the top 20
 stock exchanges  globally by market capitalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
