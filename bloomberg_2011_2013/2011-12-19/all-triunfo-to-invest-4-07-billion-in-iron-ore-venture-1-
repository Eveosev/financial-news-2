ALL America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3) ,
Latin Americaâ€™s largest railroad company, agreed to create a new
company to tap an iron-ore project in Brazil together with  TPI -
Triunfo Participacoes e Investimentos SA (TPIS3)  and Vetorial
Participacoes SA.  The companies will create a unit called Vetria Mineracao SA
to develop an iron-ore mine in Corumba, in the Brazilian
central-west state of Mato Grosso do Sul, according to a
regulatory filing today. Vetria is expected to invest 7.6
billion reais ($4.07 billion) in the project, which includes the
expansion of a mine, the upgrade of a railway line and the
construction of a port in Santos, the filing added.  The investment will boost the annual capacity of the mine
to as much as 27.5 million metric tons of  iron ore  from a
current capacity of one million ton, the companies said in the
filing, which was released after the closing of the market.  ALL will hold 50.38 percent of the shares of Vetria and TPI
Triunfo will hold 15.79 percent. The rest will be held by
Vetorial, according to the filing.  ALL fell 2 percent to 9.15 reais in  Sao Paulo  today,
extending its decline during 2011 to 39 percent. TPI Triunfo
dropped 1.1 percent to 9.35 reais today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
