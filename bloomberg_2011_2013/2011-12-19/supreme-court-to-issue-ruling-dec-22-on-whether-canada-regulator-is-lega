Canada ’s Supreme Court will rule
Dec. 22 whether the federal government’s plans to create a
national securities regulator are constitutional.  The Ottawa-based Supreme Court  announced  it would rule on
the issue in an e-mailed advisory.  The ruling will determine whether Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  can press ahead with his five-year effort to set up a
nationwide regulator that he argues will make it easier for
companies to access capital and better protect investors.  Quebec , home to Canada’s derivatives market, and other
provinces have refused to join the plan. Ontario, home to the
financial hub of Toronto, supports the effort.  Canada is the only member of the Group of Seven nations
without a national securities watchdog. Flaherty released draft
legislation last year to set up a single oversight body and
submitted it to the  Supreme Court  of Canada for a ruling on
whether it’s constitutional.  A government-appointed panel concluded in 2009 that
replacing the existing system of 13 regional agencies would
reduce costs and uncertainty for issuers and investors. The
national body would also bolster the country’s ability to
respond to market changes and safeguard against systemic
risks that make financial markets across the country vulnerable
to a bad decision by one of the provinces, the panel found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
