MF Global Holdings Inc.  used
$2.4 million in cash collateral of its largest lender  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  for the month ended Nov. 30, the majority of it for
payroll.  MF Global, the bankrupt parent of a failed broker-dealer,
lost $2.36 million from Oct. 31, the day it filed for creditor
protection, to Nov. 30, the Chapter 11 trustee,  Louis Freeh ,
said in a filing today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan .
Most of the money, $2.38 million, went to pay the remaining
employees.  Freeh’s report is preliminary and may change, according to
the filing. MF Global Inc., the brokerage unit, fired most of
its workforce of 1,066 in early November, saying it would rehire
some to help wind down the company.  The operating report for MF Global Holdings also covered a
separate unit, MF Global Finance USA, and showed the company
brought in $402,990.51 from reimbursements for some services and
made an intercompany transfer of $401,990.90.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn said on Dec. 14 that the
company could use New York-based JPMorgan’s cash collateral as
it winds down in bankruptcy, overruling objections from
customers who said the money could be part of the $1.2 billion
missing from their segregated brokerage accounts.  JPMorgan Loan  JPMorgan, agent to a $1.2 billion loan, agreed at the
outset of MF Global’s bankruptcy to let it use $26 million
subject to an agreement that gives the bank a lien on all MF
Global assets. Freeh said in court papers that the money is
presumed to belong to the company, not customers.  MF Global Holdings, once run by former  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  co-chairman  Jon Corzine , filed the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy after a wrong-way $6.3 billion trade on its own
behalf on bonds of some of  Europe ’s most indebted nations. Its
bankruptcy filing listed assets of $41 billion and debt of
$39.7 billion. Corzine, also a former U.S. senator and New
Jersey governor, quit as chief executive officer on Nov. 4.  The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The parent’s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
