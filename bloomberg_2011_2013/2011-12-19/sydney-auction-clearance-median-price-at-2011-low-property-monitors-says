Sydney’s rate of successful home
 auctions  and median sale price fell to the lowest this year as
purchasers at the middle and top ends of the market stayed on
the sidelines, according to Australian Property Monitors.  Out of 349 properties that went to auction on Dec. 17, 209
sold, and another 68 were withdrawn before going under the
hammer, for a clearance rate of 50 percent, according to the
property research group. The median price was A$561,500
($559,198).  First-time purchasers are making up a larger-than-normal
proportion of sales in New South Wales, the nation’s most
populous state, before the government there ends tax breaks on
Dec. 31 on purchases of existing homes worth up to A$600,000.  “We have an unusual market at the moment, with a lot of
energy at the bottom end of the market, counterbalanced by
quietness in the rest of the market, because of which the median
house price has dropped dramatically,” said  Andrew Wilson ,
Sydney-based senior economist at APM. “We expect a dearth of
activity from first-home buyers as a consequence in the first
few months of next year.”  The number of properties listed for sale in Sydney climbed
11 percent from a year ago as sellers rushed to dispose of their
homes before the end of the year, Wilson said.  Melbourne  had an
auction clearance rate of 45 percent and Brisbane 29 percent,
according to APM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
