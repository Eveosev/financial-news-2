Pakistan , the fourth-largest grower
of cotton, may buy as much as one million bales through state-
run Trading Corp. to support prices, the spokesman for the
country’s ginners’ group said today.  “Our group is meeting the prime minister today to settle
the details of the deal,” Arshad Islam, spokesman for  Pakistan
Cotton Ginners Association , said in a phone interview from
Karachi. “We are expecting to sell one million bales and above.
The last time the government bought from us was in 2005, when
they bought 1.6 million bales.”  Cotton prices in Pakistan have declined 42 percent in the
financial year started July 1, tracking weak international rates
as demand from  China  waned and global production rose. Cotton in
 New York  has tumbled 59 percent since reaching a record $2.197
per pound on March 7.  Pakistan is hoping to grow 12.7 million bales in the year
that began July 1 on better yields, the association said on Dec.
13. This is higher than the 12.2 million bales estimated by the
government in October. A bale in Pakistan weighs 170 kilograms
(375 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
