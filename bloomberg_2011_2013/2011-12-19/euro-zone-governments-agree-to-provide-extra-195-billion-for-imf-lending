Euro-area governments met a target
for boosting their anti-crisis warchest with a pledge to provide
150 billion euros ($195 billion) to the  International Monetary
Fund .  Four non-euro users -- the  Czech Republic ,  Denmark , Poland
and  Sweden  -- will also pitch in, Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Jean-Claude Juncker  said in an e-mailed statement after chairing
a teleconference of finance ministers today.      Britain will “define its contribution” in early 2012, the
statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
