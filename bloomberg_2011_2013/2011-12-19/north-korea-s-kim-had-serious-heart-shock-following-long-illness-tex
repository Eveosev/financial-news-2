The following is a reformatted
version of an e-mailed statement released today by the official
Korean Central News Agency describing the death of North Korean
dictator  Kim Jong Il .  “Leader Kim Jong Il had received medical treatment for his
cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for a long period. He
suffered an advanced acute myocardial infarction, complicated
with a serious heart shock, on train on December 17, Juche 100
(2011) for a great mental and physical strain caused by his
uninterrupted field guidance tour for the building of a thriving
nation. Every possible first-aid measure was taken immediately
but he passed away at 08:30 on December 17. An autopsy on
December 18 fully confirmed the diagnosis of his diseases.”
