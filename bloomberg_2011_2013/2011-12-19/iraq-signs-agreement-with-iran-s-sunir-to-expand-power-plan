Iraq  signed a $72 million contract
with  Iran ’s Sunir power company to expand an electricity plant
in the north, an Electricity Ministry spokesman said.  Sunir will install two natural gas-fired units to the Dibis
plant in Kirkuk to add 320 megawatts of capacity to the plant
within 14 months from March 2012, spokesman Mussab Serri said in
a telephone interview in Baghdad. The plant currently generates
150 megawatts, he said.  The Iraqi ministry also signed contracts valued at a total
of $69.8 million with Farab Co. and another Iranian company to
double the generation capacity of the gas-fired Sadr plant in
Baghdad to 640 megawatts within 12 months, Serri said Dec. 15.
It also agreed the same day on a $1.19 billion accord with  China
Machinery Engineering Corp.  to build a 1,260-megawatt power
station north of  Baghdad , he said then.  Iraq’s power plants and distribution network have suffered
from years of conflict, sanctions, sabotage and underinvestment.
Street protests over unreliable supplies have made the issue a
top concern for the government. Two electricity ministers have
resigned in as many years.  The nation aims to become self-sufficient in power by 2014
after the completion of major projects, Adel Mahdi, an
Electricity Ministry adviser, said Oct. 19. Iraq, which now
produces about 6,000 megawatts, imports electricity from Iran
and  Turkey , Mahdi said. Daily demand next year will be about
13,000 megawatts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
