Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  said Chairman Eivind Kolding, 52, will take over as chief executive officer of
Denmark’s largest bank after  Peter Straarup  retires.  Kolding, who’ll step down as CEO of  Maersk Line , the
container unit of A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, will take over Feb.
15, the Copenhagen-based bank said in a statement today. Ole Andersen will become new chairman, Danske said.  Danske Bank  shares have plunged 46 percent this year as
twin Danish housing and banking crises depress  consumer spending 
and drive up costs. The bank is cutting 2,000 jobs after
reporting a third-quarter loss of 384 million kroner ($69.8
million), the first since 2009, it said Nov. 1. The bank said
then that Straarup, 60, will retire.  “Kolding has obvious qualifications that make him very well
suited for the job, and he has achieved impressive results
during his career,” Andersen, the new chairman, said in the
statement. The bank had reviewed both internal and external
candidates, he said.  Kolding became a member of Danske’s board in 2001. Maersk,
 Denmark ’s biggest company, owns about 23 percent of the bank,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kolding joined Maersk in 1989 and was named chief financial
officer in 1998. In 2006 he was named partner at Maersk and next
year he took over as the sole CEO of the container line, which
operates more than 500 vessels.  Kolding has a Master’s degree in law from the University of
Copenhagen.  Maersk named Soeren Skou new CEO of its container unit, it
said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
