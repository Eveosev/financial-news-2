Malaysia’s state-owned  Employees
Provident Fund  borrowed 300 million pounds ($465 million) in a
five-year term loan, proceeds of which will be used to buy
properties in  London , a person familiar with the matter said.  The fund, which initially targeted 240 million pounds, is
considered to be a quasi-sovereign borrower by lenders, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the details are
private.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  arranged the loan, the fund’s first
offshore facility, while Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.,
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., Bank of  Nova Scotia  and Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp. also lent funds, the person said.  Employees Provident will use the loan to help finance 490
million pounds of U.K. property purchases, according to the
person. The facility pays a margin of 123 basis points more than
three-month sterling London interbank offered rate and an
upfront fee of 110 basis points, the person said. That
translates to a so-called all-in fee of 145 basis points, they
said.  The fund’s unit KWASA U.K. Solo Ltd. borrowed the money,
the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
