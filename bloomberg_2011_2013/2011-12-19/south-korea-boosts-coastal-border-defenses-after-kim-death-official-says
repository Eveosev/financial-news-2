South Korea  boosted border and
coastal defense after the death of North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il , said an official at the defense ministry.  It is closely monitoring North Korea’s military movements
and has not seen any unsual changes, said the official, who
declined to be identified, citing military policy. All units
have reported to their positions and the joint South Korean and
U.S. forces are cooperating, he said.  The South Korean military is discussing whether to raise
its “watchcon” monitoring level from three to two and its
“defcon” combat alertness from four to three, said the
official.   To contact the reporter on this story:
