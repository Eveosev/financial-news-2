The ruble fell to its weakest level
in 10 weeks, as oil,  Russia ’s chief export, dropped for a fourth
day and traded near its lowest position in six weeks.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.1 percent, adding to a
3.6 percent decline in the past two weeks, to 32.05 by 7 p.m. in
Moscow. The ruble was little changed at 41.7324 versus the euro,
leaving it steady at 36.4071 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Urals crude, Russia’s export oil blend, retreated 0.7
percent to $104.15 a barrel. Crude for January delivery fell as
much as 1.1 percent in  New York  to its lowest level since Nov. 2
before paring its loss to 0.7 percent at $94.16.  Investors increased bets that the Russian currency will
weaken further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble
at 32.5015 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 32.43 per dollar on Dec. 16. The contracts are a
guide to expectations of currency movements as they allow
foreign investors and companies to fix the  exchange rate  at a
particular level in the future.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobond due in 2020 rose,
decreasing the yield six basis points to 4.671 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
