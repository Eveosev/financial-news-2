European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said that investors haven’t properly appreciated
the outcome of the European Union leaders’ summit.  The Dec. 9 agreement “has received much less recognition
by markets and the public opinion than it actually deserved,”
Draghi told lawmakers in Brussels today. “I think the
expectation of the summit like a silver bullet that would
resolve the crisis was there, and was not realistic.”  European finance ministers pledged to tighten rules to curb
future debts, added 200 billion euros ($260 billion) to their
war chest, sped the start of a 500 billion-euro rescue fund and
diluted a demand that bondholders shoulder losses in rescues. A
week later,  Fitch Ratings  lowered  France ’s credit outlook and
put other nations on review, saying a crisis solution may be
“technically and politically beyond reach.”  “When we discuss progress, we should compare it with
previous summits and the evolution of reality,” Draghi said.
“From this viewpoint I think the summit was a step forward”
and “has really brought about the breakthrough in terms of a
commitment to sound fiscal rules.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
