Vietnam ’s bonds gained on
speculation the largest banks are putting cash into debt rather
than making loans. The dong dropped.  Vietnam Development Bank, a state-owned lender that raises
funds for government projects, sold all of the 1.9 trillion dong
of bonds ($90 million) it auctioned on Dec. 16, according to
statements on the Hanoi Stock Exchange’s website.  “Large commercial banks don’t want to lend in the
 interbank market  since they are afraid that small commercial
banks won’t be able to repay debt,” Ho Chi Minh City-based ACB
Securities Co. analysts Cao Tan Phat and Le Nguyet Anh wrote in
a research note on Dec. 16. “As such, the best investment
channel for them is via the  bond market .”  Yields  on three-year notes fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 12.49 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong fell 0.2 percent to 21,018 per dollar as of 3:30
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,813, unchanged since
Dec. 14, its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
