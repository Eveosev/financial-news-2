Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most popular Internet search engine, was sued by British
Telecommunications Plc for allegedly infringing six U.S. patents
for mobile-device technology.  BT, based in  London , is seeking a jury trial and
unspecified damages against Mountain View, California-based
Google, according to a complaint filed Dec. 15 in federal court
in Wilmington, Delaware.  “BT has invested heavily over the last 20 years,”
generating “numerous patents,” and Google’s products including
the Android operating system, maps, search, music and book
services wrongly “incorporate BT’s patented technologies,”
according to the complaint.  Last year, BT sued U.S. cable company Cox Communications
Inc. in the same court over four patents for transmitting data
over cable networks. A trial in that case is tentatively
scheduled for 2014, according to court papers.  “We believe these claims are groundless,” Jim Prosser, a
Google spokesman, said in an e-mailed message. He said the
company would defend against them.  The case is British Telecommunications Plc v. Google Inc.,
11-CV-1249, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware 
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
