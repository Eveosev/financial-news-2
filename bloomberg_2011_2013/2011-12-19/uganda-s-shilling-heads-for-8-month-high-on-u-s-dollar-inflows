Uganda ’s shilling, the best
performer worldwide in the fourth quarter, headed for its
highest close in almost eight months against the dollar, helped
by inflows of the U.S. currency from exporters.  The currency of East Africa’s third-largest economy gained
0.6 percent to 2,365.85 by 2:38 p.m. in Kampala, the capital,
its strongest level on a closing basis since April 25 and
extending its advance since Oct. 1 by 20 percent.  “Dollar inflows continue to trickle in from commodity
exporters especially coffee,” Taib Lubega, a currency trader at
Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd., said by phone today. Uganda is
Africa’s second biggest coffee producer after  Ethiopia .  Kenya ’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 83.95 per dollar,
retreating for the first time in five days against the dollar.  “We are seeing a bit of demand piling up for dollars.
People buying because the levels look good,” Duncan Kinuthia, a
dealer at Commercial Bank of  Africa  Ltd., said by phone today
from Nairobi, Kenya’s capital.  Tanzania’s currency gained 0.7 percent to 1,598.25 per
dollar, heading for its strongest close since Aug. 4.  “The central bank has intervened today, selling dollars,
which has caused the shilling to appreciate,” Fred Siwale, a
trader with CRDB Bank Plc, said by phone from  Dar es Salaam ,
Tanzania’s commercial capital. “Demand is mainly coming from
the oil sector seeking dollars to import fuel.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
