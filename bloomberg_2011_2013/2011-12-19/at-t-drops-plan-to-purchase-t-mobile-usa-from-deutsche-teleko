AT&T Inc. (T)  dropped its proposed $39
billion purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc. from  Deutsche Telekom AG. (DTE)   AT&T said the company will recognize a pretax charge of $4
billion in the fourth quarter of this year.  The U.S. Justice Department sued AT&T and T-Mobile on Aug.
31, saying a combination of the two companies would
substantially reduce competition. Seven states and  Puerto Rico 
joined the effort to block the deal, which would have made AT&T
the biggest U.S. wireless carrier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
