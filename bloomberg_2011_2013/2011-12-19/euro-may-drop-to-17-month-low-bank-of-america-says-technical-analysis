The euro may drop to the weakest
level in almost a year and a half after breaking through its low
from October, according to Bank of America Corp.  The euro is poised to fall to as low as $1.2510, a level
last reached in July 2010, after trading below $1.3146, the
lowest reached in October, said  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-
exchange and interest-rates technical strategy at Bank of
America in  New York . The shared currency needs to reach and
break through the $1.2901-$1.2859 range before dropping to
$1.2533 and then the lower level, he said.  “The trend is clearly still to the downside, and that
break through the October lows reaffirms that downtrend,” Curry
said in a telephone interview. “If you look at the extremes in
sentiment positioning, a squeeze higher would not be surprising,
but there you need to be a seller of strength.”  The euro dropped 0.2 percent to $1.3019 at 10:18 a.m. in
New York. It broke through the October low on Dec. 13 and
weakened to $1.2946 the following day.  Sentiment on the 17-nation currency has reached “bearish
extremes,” Curry said, which may spur traders to briefly
squeeze out of short positions, driving it to strengthen to as
high as $1.3250. Investors should view that level as a selling
opportunity, he said.  Futures traders  increased their bets to a record level that
the euro will decline against the  U.S. dollar , figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
last week.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 116,457 on Dec.
13, compared with 95,814 a week earlier.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
