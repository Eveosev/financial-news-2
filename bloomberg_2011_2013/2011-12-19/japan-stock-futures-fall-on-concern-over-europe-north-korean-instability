Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  fell and
Australian equities were little changed amid concern European
leaders are failing to stem the region’s debt crisis and the
death of North Korea’s leader may increase instability in Asia.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics, slid 1.2 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, fell 4.3
percent after financial shares led declines in U.S. equities.
BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company, declined
0.3 percent in Sydney after metal prices dropped.  Futures (TPX)  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 8,280 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,300 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,290 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed today and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.5
percent in Wellington.  “Investors remain very cautious as confidence remains
shaky in Europe and geo-political risks rise in East Asia,”
said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “Investors are inclined to close their positions
toward year-end, and they won’t make a big move.”  Substantial Risks  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.1 percent
today. The index fell 1.2 percent in New York yesterday after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said substantial
risks to the economy remain and the law keeps him from boosting
government bond purchases to fight the sovereign-debt crisis.  Europe bolstered its anti-crisis arsenal, channeling 150
billion euros ($195 billion) to the International Monetary Fund.
Britain refused to commit, while four nations not using the euro
also pledged to help.  Asian equities fell yesterday after reports on the death of
North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il stoked concern about the
region’s stability.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 20 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 4.2 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 15 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.2 times for the S&P 500
and 10.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese companies trading in the U.S. declined, led by
energy and materials producers, after comments from Draghi
dashed hopes for a quick resolution to Europe’s debt crisis. The
Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks
retreated 1.4 percent to 92.88 at 2:31 p.m. in New York.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 1.4 percent
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
