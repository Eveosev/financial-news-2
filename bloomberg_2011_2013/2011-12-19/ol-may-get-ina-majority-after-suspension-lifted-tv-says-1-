Hungarian oil company  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  may
obtain a majority in its Croatian unit  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. (INARA) 
as the outgoing government, which opposed the move, prepares to
cede power, state television reported.  Mol may try to boost its holding in the Croatian refinery
above the 47.47 percent it now owns after INA shares resumed
trading today on the  Zagreb stock exchange  following an eight-
month suspension, the TV station reported late yesterday, citing
Dragan Kovacevic, an economist with the incoming government. The
state has 44.84 percent. The trading opened at 4,360 kuna per
share at 2 p.m., up from the closing price of 4,200 kuna on
April 27.  The Hungarian companyâ€™s involvement with the Croatian
refiner has been clouded by a corruption investigation involving
allegations former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader received bribes to
allow Mol take control of INA. Outgoing Premier  Jadranka Kosor ,
who lost Dec. 4 elections, tried to block Mol from gaining any
more shares.  Mol officials and Sanader, who is in the middle of a trial,
have denied any wrongdoing. INA shares were last traded on April
27, before the market regulator suspended them, claiming market
manipulation by Mol. The ban was lifted on Dec. 15.  Mol already has an option to buy 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
