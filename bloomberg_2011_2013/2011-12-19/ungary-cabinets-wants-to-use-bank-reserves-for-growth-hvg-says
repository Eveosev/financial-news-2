Hungary’s government wants to use
part of the central bank’s foreign-currency reserves to boost
lending and economic growth, HVG said on its  website,  without
citing anyone.  The Cabinet wants to use as much as 5 billion euros ($6.5
billion) of the 35 billion euros in reserves to that end, HVG
said. Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  also wants the Magyar Nemzeti
Bank to provide loans from commercial bank deposits parked at
the central bank, the weekly said.  Central bank President Andras Simior considers the
proposals “too risky” and going beyond the bank’s mandate, HVG
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
