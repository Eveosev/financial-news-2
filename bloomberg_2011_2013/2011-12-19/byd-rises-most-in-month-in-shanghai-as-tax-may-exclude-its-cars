BYD Co., the Chinese carmaker partly
owned by  Warren Buffett â€™s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., rose by the
most in a month in  Shanghai  after the government said a new
vehicle tax may not apply to autos using alternative energy.  China will implement a new vehicle tax law starting Jan. 1
next year, according to a statement posted to the State
Administration of Taxation website yesterday. The new law will
omit or reduce taxes on vehicles using alternative energy, the
statement said. BYD, maker of the E6 electric car, gained 6
percent to 22.73 yuan at 2:48 p.m. local time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
