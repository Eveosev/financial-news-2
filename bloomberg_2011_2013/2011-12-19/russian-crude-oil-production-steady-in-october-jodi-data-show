Russian crude oil production reached
10.275 million barrels a day in October, unchanged from the
previous month, according to figures posted on the Joint
Organization Data Initiative’s website.  The initiative, supervised by the Riyadh-based
 International Energy Forum , said  Russia ’s production is
calculated from data the country submitted to Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation and compared with information from four
other sources.  Russia, which replaced Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest
crude-producing nation, pumped 10.35 million barrels a day in
October and 10.34 million in November, according to data from
the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. The October rate was the
highest since Soviet-era output peaked at 11.48 million barrels
a day in 1987, according to BP Plc data.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has called for oil output,
Russia’s largest source of tax income, to remain above 10
million barrels for at least the next decade. Putin lowered the
 tax  rate on crude exports on Oct. 1 to spur investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
