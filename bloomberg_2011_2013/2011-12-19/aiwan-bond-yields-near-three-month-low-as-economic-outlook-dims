The yield on  Taiwan ’s  benchmark  10-
year bonds was near a three-month low as a deteriorating outlook
for the local economy spurs demand for the safest assets. The
local dollar was little changed.  The island’s  export orders  rose 2.8 percent in November
from a year earlier, after gaining 4.4 percent the previous
month, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg before official data due tomorrow. The central bank
will meet to review borrowing costs on Dec. 29 and two of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict the benchmark  interest
rate  will be cut to 1.75 percent from 1.875 percent. The rest
forecast no change. Most Asian currencies weakened today after
 North Korea  reported the death of dictator  Kim Jong Il .  “Yields have been falling for a while due to the economic
conditions,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Investors originally thought the
central bank would not cut rates this month, but now there are
some noises in the  interest-rate  swaps market suggesting a
drop.”  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent debt due September 2021,
the most-traded government securities, was at 1.254 percent from
1.251 percent last week, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show. Benchmark 10-year rates have dropped 30 basis points in
2011.  The Taiwan dollar fell 0.1 percent to NT$30.398 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
was NT$30.369 at the end of last week and NT$30.368 at the start
of the year.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.399 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
