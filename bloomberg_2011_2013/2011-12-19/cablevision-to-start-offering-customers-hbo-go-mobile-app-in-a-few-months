Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , the
fifth-largest U.S. cable operator by subscribers, said it plans
to offer its customers  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s HBO Go mobile-TV
application.  The service will start in a few months, Cablevision said
today in a statement. Customers will also have access to
Cinemax’s Max Go.  The agreement comes three days after Time Warner Cable
Inc., the second-largest U.S. cable provider, agreed to offer
the applications to its  12.2 million (TWC)  customers. HBO Go allows
HBO subscribers to watch more than 1,400 old and current
episodes of shows including “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “Game
of Thrones.” Max Go offers another 400 titles.  Cablevision, based in Bethpage, New York, had been the
final holdout to offer access to the mobile application of the
nine largest pay-TV providers. HBO Go has been downloaded more
than 5 million times and is available to HBO subscribers for
free on personal computers,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones, iPod touches and
iPads, and select  Google Inc. (GOOG)  Android devices.  Cablevision rose 2 percent to $13 at the close in New York.
The shares have declined 45 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
