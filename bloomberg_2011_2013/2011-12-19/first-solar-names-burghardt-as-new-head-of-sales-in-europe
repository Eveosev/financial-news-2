First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest maker
of thin-film solar panels, named a new head of European sales as
the Tempe, Arizona-based company shifts its focus to utility-
scale power plants rather than smaller projects.  Christopher Burghardt will replace Stephan Hansen effective
immediately amid “a broader consolidation of the company’s
worldwide sales and business development activities,” First
Solar said today.  Burghardt “has a deep understanding of European markets
that will be invaluable as we position our sales effort to
develop sustainable, utility-scale energy opportunities,” said
 Jim Brown , the new president of global business development.  First Solar on Dec. 14 reduced profit estimates for this
year and next and said it will cut about 100 jobs in its second
restructuring in six weeks. Demand for panels slowed in  Europe 
this year as Chinese producers increased output even after
international prices slumped, helping prompt three U.S. solar
developers including  Solyndra LLC  to declare bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
