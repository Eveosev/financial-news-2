Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
said he won’t reopen talks on extending a payroll tax cut
through next year until the  House of Representatives  approves a
Senate-passed bill that continues the tax cut for two months.  “I will not reopen negotiations until the House follows
through and passes this agreement that was negotiated by
Republican leaders” in the Senate, Reid, a Nevada Democrat,
said in a statement today.  Earlier today, House Speaker John Boehner said the House
will vote tonight and is expected to reject the Senate bill and
call for new negotiations with the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
