Alfa Bank , Russiaâ€™s largest private
lender, signed a $250 million loan for trade finance and general
corporate purposes.  The one-year deal will pay initial interest at 175 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate,  Alfa Bank 
said in an e-mailed statement today. The bank originally sought
financing of $160 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Wells Fargo & Co. and WestLB AG coordinated the financing
and also served as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners along
with Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
