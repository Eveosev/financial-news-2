Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  will ask labor
unions and the government for permission to hire more foreign
airline captains as it expands its fleet,  Business Daily  said,
citing Chief Executive Officer Titus Naikuni.  The carrier may add as many as 70 airline captains as it
seeks to almost double the number of aircraft it operates to 62
by 2016, while also starting new routes, the Nairobi-based
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
