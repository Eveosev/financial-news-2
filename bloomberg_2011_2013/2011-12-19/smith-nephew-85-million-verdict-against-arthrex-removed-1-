A U.S. judge threw out an $85
million verdict that  Smith & Nephew Plc   had won against  Arthrex
Inc.  over patented technology for surgical anchors used in
shoulder surgery.  U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
found that, under the correct interpretation of the patent, no
reasonable jury could find that Arthrex infringed the Smith &
Nephew patent, Arthrex said in a statement.  The devices are anchored to a bone to repair tears in the
rotator cuff or in the labrum, a fibrous ring in the shoulder
socket. The June trial was the third in the case, which began in
2004 against Naples, Florida-based Arthrex.  “While we are very pleased with the judge’s ruling, we are
perplexed by S&N’s continued attempt to compete in the courtroom
rather than the marketplace,” John W. Schmieding, Arthrex’s
general counsel, said in the statement.  Smith & Nephew, based in  London  and  Europe ’s biggest maker
of artificial hips and knees, targeted the SutureTak and
PushLock line of suture anchors made by closely held Arthrex.  “We’re disappointed in the court’s latest ruling,” said
Joe Metzger, a spokesman for Smith & Nephew. “We are reviewing
the decision and expect to appeal and request reinstatement of
the jury’s verdict.”  The case is Smith & Nephew Inc. v. Arthrex Inc., 04cv29,
U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Portland).  To contact the reporters on this story:
