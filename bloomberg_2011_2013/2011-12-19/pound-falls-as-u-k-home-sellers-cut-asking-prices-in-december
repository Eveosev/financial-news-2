The pound weakened against the
dollar as a report showed U.K. home sellers cut  asking prices 
for a second consecutive month, adding to signs the economy is
losing momentum.  Sterling snapped two days of gains versus its U.S.
counterpart as Rightmove Plc said prices in England and  Wales 
fell 2.7 percent from November, and added that the  property
market  will remain “challenging” in 2012. The pound fell
against the euro even after  France  had its credit outlook
lowered by  Fitch Ratings , on speculation the U.K. economy will
suffer as the euro-region debt crisis escalates.  “Consumers who have found their incomes squeezed are also
wary about the future, so in that context the background for
sterling is relatively challenging,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head
of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
 London . Still “the resilience of the U.K. versus the euro still
looks attractive.”  The pound weakened 0.1 percent to $1.5523 at 4:45 p.m.
London time, adding to last week’s 0.8 percent decline. It was
little changed at 83.85 pence per euro, after climbing last week
to 83.73, its strongest level since Feb. 18.  U.K. government bonds fell, pushing the 10-year gilt yield
two basis points higher to 2.07 percent, trimming declines this
year that pushed it to a record low 2.034 percent. The 3.75
percent bond due September 2021 fell 0.225, or 2.25 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 114.745.  Gilt Returns  Gilts have returned 16 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds earned 9.5 percent,
and U.S. Treasuries climbed 10 percent.  Investors bought British bonds as an alternative to assets
denominated in the euro as European Union leaders struggled to
solve a debt crisis that has forced  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal 
to seek international bailouts. The turmoil also engulfed Italy
and Spain and prompted the bloc to create funds to help stricken
economies.  French 10-year yields rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.10 percent, leaving the extra yield, or
spread, investors get for holding the securities instead of
similar-maturity gilts at 103 basis points. The  French debt 
yielded 22 basis points less than gilts in February, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sterling strengthened 0.1 percent today against nine
developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The dollar was little changed and the euro lost 0.1
percent.  Britain’s currency may slip to its October low against the
dollar should it fall below $1.5400,  Michael Hewson , a markets
analyst at CMC Markets Ltd. in London, wrote in a client note
today. Sterling slipped to $1.5272, the lowest since July 23,
2010.  The pound weakened against the dollar last week as reports
showed unemployment surged and retail sales fell more than
economists forecast in November, strengthening the case for the
 Bank of England  to add to its asset-purchase program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
