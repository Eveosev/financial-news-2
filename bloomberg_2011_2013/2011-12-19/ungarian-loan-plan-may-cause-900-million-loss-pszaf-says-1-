Hungary’s financial industry may
take a loss of as much as 210 billion forint ($900 million)
because of a law allowing the repayment of foreign-currency
mortgages at below-market rates, financial regulator  PSZAF  said.  About 15 percent of eligible borrowers will make use of the
law passed in September, which forced banks to swallow exchange-
rate losses on the repayments, the regulator said in a report
today. The repayments will lead to losses of between 170 billion
forint and 210 billion forint for lenders, PSZAF said.  An extraordinary tax on lenders and rising provisioning for
non-performing loans, along with the risk of a renewed global
economic crisis, are hurting bank profitability and expose them
to “serious difficulties,” PSZAF said.  “The banking sector must fundamentally rethink its
business strategy as a result of the crisis and the government’s
measures,” PSZAF said in the report.  Hungary’s “biggest” banks made provisions and write-downs
of 95 billion forint for the early repayments by the end of
September, PSZAF said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
