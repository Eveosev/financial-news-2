     Dec. 19 (Bloomberg) --  Indonesia  expects 15 new oil and gas
fields to start production in 2012, which will help stem a
decline in the country’s crude production, the nation’s oil and
gas regulator said.  The new fields have  total (FP)  daily production capacity of 1.16
billion cubic feet of natural gas and 32,500 barrels of oil,
Rudi Rubiandini, BP Migas’s deputy of operation, said in a
statement yesterday. It’s one of efforts to slow the declining
rate in oil output to 3 percent from 12 percent now, he said.  Indonesia ’s daily oil output may rise to as much as 950,000
barrels in 2012 from 903,441 barrels this year because of
additional production from new fields, Haposan Napitupulu, BP
Migas deputy of planning, said on Dec. 16.  The following table shows details of the block and the
operating companies as announced by BP Migas yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
