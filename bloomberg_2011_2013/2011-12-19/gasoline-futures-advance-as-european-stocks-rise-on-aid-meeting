Gasoline was little changed and
heating oil fell as stocks headed lower after the European
Central Bank warned of continued risk to the economy.  Futures reduced earlier gains as the Standard & Poor’s 500
index  declined (SPX)  1.2 percent at 3:16 p.m. in  New York . ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said at the European Parliament in
Brussels that “substantial downside risks” to the economic
outlook remain, and that the bank’s bond purchase program was
“neither eternal nor infinite.”  “The whole market is trading off of Europe,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in New York. “Since Draghi started speaking the
markets have been falling.”  Gasoline for January delivery rose 0.21 cent to settle at
$2.4891 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
gaining as much as 1.7 percent. The futures are up 1.5 percent
this year.  January-delivery heating oil fell 2.01 cents to settle at
$2.8055 a gallon, paring its gain this year to 9.3 percent.  Volume in electronic trading for heating oil was 112,382
contracts as of 3:23 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 143,000. Gasoline volume was 72,556 lots, compared with an
average of 131,000.  Gasoline futures “volumes are pretty low,” said  Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory company Cameron Hanover in
New Canaan, Connecticut. “We see pretty light interest from
refiners at this time of year.”  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.7
cent to $3.221 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. It’s
the lowest level since Feb. 22. Prices are 8.1 percent higher
than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
