Serbian private pension fund assets
reached 11.59 billion dinars ($147.36 million) at the end of the
third quarter, increasing 25.9 percent from a year ago, the
central bank said.  Total assets for the nine funds on the market gained 636.5
million dinars in the third quarter, 4.7 percent more than in
the previous, as the number of clients increased by 173,900, the
National Bank of  Serbia  said in a  report .  The growth trend resumed this year after an “insignificant
increase” in new contracts in 2010. The state-run, pay-as-you-
go pension system remains dominant in the country of 7.12
million people. Private pension funds began operating in Serbia
in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
