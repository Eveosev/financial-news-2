Vladimir Antonov , who is fighting
extradition to Lithuania after that country’s government seized
his  Bankas Snoras AB (SRS1L) , said he had invested about 50 million
euros ($65.1 million) in Latvia’s unprofitable AirBaltic AS.  “I think that about 50 million euros, not less” was
invested in the airline, Antonov said in a telephone interview
with  TV3 ’s Neka Personiga news program, broadcast last night.  Latvia increased its stake in AirBaltic to 99.8 percent on
Dec. 1 by acquiring shares that were pledged as collateral in
Snoras’s local unit, Latvijas Krajbanka AS, which was suspended
on Nov. 21.  Antonov and his business partner Raimondas Baranauskas were
arrested Nov. 24 in  London  after Lithuania issued European
arrest warrants over the alleged theft of about 879 million
litas ($331.6 million) from Snoras. They deny the charges.
 Latvia  had been seeking to identify the ultimate beneficial
owners of Baltic Aviation Systems, a shareholder in AirBaltic
before the government took it over.  BAS was 50 percent-owned by Taurus Asset Management, a
Bahamas-based investment fund represented by Andrei Rudeshko,
who met with Latvia’s government in September to discuss
recapitalizing the airline.  Antonov told TV3 that Rudeshko was representing him.
Rudeshko is a close friend who was a witness at his wedding, he
said.  Should BAS decide to invest money it had previously
committed to the airline by Dec. 22 it could get its stake back,
Anrijs Matiss, the Transport Ministry’s state secretary, said
Dec. 13, according to the  Baltic News Service .  To contact the reporter on this story:
