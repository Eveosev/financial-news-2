Aleo Solar AG , the German solar
panel maker controlled by  Robert Bosch GmbH , fell the most in a
month in Frankfurt trading after warning of a loss for 2011 over
costs from supply contracts.  Aleo Solar fell as much as 7 percent, the steepest intra-
day drop since Nov. 14, after the company said today it will
post a loss of 25 million euros ($33 million) to 30 million
euros. The result is due mainly to payments in lieu for
contracts with a supplier of solar cells in the period from 2005
to 2008, it said in a statement.  “A new agreement was reached for the entire period from
2012 to 2019 that takes prices conforming more to the market
into consideration,” said Oldenburg-based Aleo Solar. A full
earnings report will be released in March, it said.  Prices for products across the solar industry tumbled this
year as Chinese companies increased production capacities and
demand fell in  Germany , the world’s biggest photovoltaic market.
Solon SE last week became Germany’s first listed solar company
to file for insolvency.  Polysilicon, the raw material for solar cells and panels,
has plunged to $26.31 a kilogram from $475 three years ago,  data 
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Aleo shares fell 3.1 percent to 20.845 euros as of 1:58
p.m. local time, giving the company a market value of 272
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
