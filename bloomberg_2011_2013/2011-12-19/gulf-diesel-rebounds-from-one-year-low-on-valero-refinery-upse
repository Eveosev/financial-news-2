Gulf Coast diesel rebounded from a
one-year low against futures after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Port
Arthur refinery in Texas blew a water seal on a coker.  “We’ve had a number of distillate desulfurizer outages
that have been occurring at they go into maintenance at this
time of year,”  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates in
Houston, said in a telephone interview. The U.S. has been
exporting “significant” amounts of diesel “because it’s been
drawn to other parts of the world through demand.”  Valero didn’t take the coker out of operation and there
wasn’t a material impact on production, Bill Day, a company
spokesman in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail.  The  discount  for low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf Coast
narrowed 2.37 cents to 7.13 cents a gallon versus futures
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:30 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount was at 9.5
cents from Dec. 14 to Dec. 16, the lowest level since Dec. 13,
2010. Prompt delivery rose 2.96 cents to $2.7351 a gallon.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf widened 0.75 cent to 4.25 cents a gallon versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
