Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , which doubled
the size of its investment bank over the last five years, is
curbing hires and expansion amid “volatile” capital markets.  “This is the time to consolidate and try to make some
money,” Doug McGregor, co-head of  RBC Capital Markets , said in
an interview at his office in Toronto.  RBC may benefit next year as rival banks retreat from
 investment banking  amid the European debt crisis and face
regulatory demands to bolster capital, McGregor said.  Financial firms disclosed plans this year to eliminate more
than 200,000 jobs in response to market turmoil. Morgan Stanley
said it will cut about 1,600 jobs and Citigroup Inc. is shedding
4,500 positions. Royal Bank had 585 fewer employees last quarter
from the previous period.  “We expect global  capital markets  to remain volatile as a
result of the European sovereign issues, coupled with the U.S.
fiscal imbalance and political indecision,” Royal Bank Chief
Executive Officer Gordon Nixon said in a Dec. 2 conference call.  RBC Capital Markets has about 6,000 employees, which
includes about 3,600 investment bankers, research analysts and
traders. That’s about double the workforce from January 2007.  “I don’t think you’ll see any headlines about us doing
anything dramatic in terms of major hires or buying
businesses,” McGregor said. “You’ll hopefully just see us be
profitable consistently throughout the course of the year and
continue to take market share.”  Step Up  In the U.S., the firm has more than 350 investment bankers,
after 220 hires since January 2010 to build on a U.S. platform
it gained from its 2001 takeovers of brokerages Dain Rauscher
Corp. and Tucker Anthony Sutro.  RBC also extended its expansion efforts into the U.K. and
 Europe  in late 2009 in an initiative it dubbed “Project Step
Up.” RBC’s European operation is now the “right size,”
according to McGregor.  “We’re not going to get a lot bigger there,” he said.
“It’s highly unlikely that we’ll buy an investment bank or the
investment bank portion of another bank.”  McGregor, 55, and his New York-based counterpart Mark Standish, 50, became co-heads of RBC Capital Markets in November
2008 after Charles Winograd retired from his position of
overseeing the firm.  Profit Grows  The growth strategies have paid off for  Canada ’s largest
lender by assets. The RBC Capital Markets unit had annual profit
of C$1.58 billion ($1.52 billion) on revenue of C$5.93 billion
for the year ended Oct. 31, according to financial statements.
That’s up from 2008, when the unit had profit of C$1.17 billion
on C$3.94 billion in sales.  RBC provided lending to an additional 300 U.S. companies in
the last year, increasing its U.S. loan book by about 25 percent,
McGregor said. The firm’s U.S. corporate loan book is about C$40
billion, nearly a third of the firm’s total loan book.  The company extended its coverage of industries, added more
bankers and traders and gained corporate clients, while rising
up the rankings for firms advising on U.S. takeovers and
arranging stock sales. The bank’s goal is to be a “Top 10”
investment bank in the U.S.  RBC advised on $47.3 billion worth of announced U.S.
takeovers this year, capturing 4 percent market share to rank
13th among financial advisers in the country. In comparison, RBC
was in 32nd spot in 2008 with 0.9 percent market share.  The bank ranks 12th this year for arranging U.S. equity
financings, with $2.3 billion in deals for a 1.3 percent market
share. RBC ranked 18th in 2008.  “There’s a reasonable chance we’ll crack a Top 10 by the
end of next year,” McGregor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
