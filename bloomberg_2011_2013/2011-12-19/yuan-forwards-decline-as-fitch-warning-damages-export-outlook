Yuan forwards declined after  Fitch
Ratings  put the credit ratings of seven European countries on
review for a possible downgrade, worsening the outlook for
 China ’s exports.  Fitch said on Dec. 16 it was re-assessing rankings for
 France , Belgium,  Spain , Slovenia, Italy, Ireland and Cyprus. A
“comprehensive” solution to Europe’s crisis is “technically
and politically beyond reach,” it said. The increasing
flexibility of the yuan means China is on its way to a market-
based exchange rate, China Business News reported today, citing
Guan Tao, head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange’s
balance of payments department. The yuan jumped 0.4 percent on
Dec. 16, the most in two months.  “While the People’s Bank of China signals it favors a
stronger currency, traders and exporters have turned a bit more
cautious today after the yuan rallied last Friday and on the
worsening outlook in  Europe ,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based
currency analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.08 percent to
6.4095 per dollar as of 10:44 a.m. in Hong Kong, after gaining
0.7 percent on Dec. 16. The contracts were at a 1 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate.  The yuan gained 0.02 percent to 6.3470 today in Shanghai,
according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched
6.3294 on Dec. 16, the strongest level since China unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993. In Hong
Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.09 percent to 6.3790.  The People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate
0.08 percent stronger at 6.3303 per dollar, the highest level in
a week. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 0.5 percent
on either side of the central bank’s fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
