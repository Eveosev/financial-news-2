The U.S. and European financial
markets aren’t equipped to handle a default by  Greece  or other
countries in the euro zone, said Jes Staley, chief executive
officer of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s investment-banking unit.  “What’s going on with sovereign debt in Europe is very
troubling,” Staley said on Bloomberg Television’s Inside Track
With Erik Schatzker. He said it was notable when German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said it “was not a good thing” to ask
banks to voluntarily write down their Greek sovereign debt
earlier this year.  “Raising the notion that a European government or any
government would actually back away from its obligations is
something that the market really is not set up to deal with,”
Staley said. “Once you establish that a country in the  euro
zone  can walk away from its debt obligations where does it
stop?”  Staley said U.S. Treasury debt is still the safest bet for
investors, even after its creditworthiness was downgraded by
 Standard & Poor’s  in August.  “Hopefully, one of the lessons out of the 2008 financial
crisis is nothing is risk free,” he said. “Triple-A securities
are not cash, we’ve learned that. Sovereign debt isn’t without
its risk.”  On a relative basis, U.S Treasuries “will continue to be
the safest asset in the world and a downgrade in and of itself
doesn’t really change the equation.”  JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is based in New
York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
