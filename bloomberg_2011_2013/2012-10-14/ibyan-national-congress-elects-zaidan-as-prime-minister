Libya’s National Congress elected
former congressman Ali Zaidan as the country’s new prime
minister, and gave him two weeks to form a government.  Zaidan beat out Mohamed Al-Harari, a local government
minister, in a 93-85 vote with one lawmaker filing an empty
ballot, Mohammed Magariaf, president of the parliament, said in
televised comments after the vote yesterday. Lawmakers met
yesterday to discuss a pared-down list of four candidates.  The election comes a week after lawmakers in the 200-member
legislature withdrew confidence from his predecessor, Mustafa
Abushagur, after he twice failed to name a cabinet they found
acceptable. Abushagur had held the job for less than a month.  Libya has struggled with its transition following last
year’s uprising that ended with the ouster and death of Muammar Qaddafi. The government has been trying to assert its authority
and to disband and disarm militias in the wake of the Sept. 11
attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that left the American
ambassador and three others dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
