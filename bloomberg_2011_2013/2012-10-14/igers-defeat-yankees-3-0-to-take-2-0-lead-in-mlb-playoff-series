The  Detroit  Tigers beat the New York
Yankees 3-0 to lead the American League Championship Series by
two games to none.  The Yankees moved from being the 5-2 favorite to win the
World Series to the 5-1 long shot to earn a record-extending
28th Major League Baseball title, according to the Las Vegas
Hotel’s Super Book, after captain Derek Jeter was ruled out of
the rest of the postseason with an ankle fracture sustained in a
6-4 loss to Detroit yesterday.  The Tigers entered today as the new favorites, at 3-2, to
win a fifth World Series and first since 1984, with the San
Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals at 3-1.  The Giants host the Cardinals today in the first game of
the National League Championship Series.  After two games at Yankee Stadium in New York, the Tigers
host the next three games in the best-of-seven series, on Oct.
16, 17 and 18.  Jeter, who was replaced on the roster by  Eduardo Nunez ,
won’t travel with the team to Detroit, Yankees manager Joe
Girardi told reporters before today’s game. The 38-year-old
shortstop will instead meet with foot and ankle specialist
Robert Anderson in  Charlotte , North Carolina, in the coming
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
