Egypt ’s Muslim Brotherhood said
‘thugs’ and not members of its political party were behind
Friday clashes with secular activists that left 30 people
injured in central Cairo.  “Thugs” wearing T-shirts with the slogan of the Freedom
and Justice Party “committed these crimes which were quickly
attributed to FJP and Brotherhood youth,” the Brotherhood said
in a statement published on its official website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
