Seth Doege threw for six touchdowns
as Texas Tech University handed fifth-ranked  West Virginia
University  a 49-14 loss, its first of the college football
season.  In other games involving the Top Ten schools in the
Associated Press Writers’ Poll, it was No. 1 Alabama 42,
Missouri 10; No. 9 Louisiana State 23, No. 3 South Carolina 21;
No. 4 Florida 31, Vanderbilt 17; No. 6 Kansas State 27, Iowa
State 21; No. 7 Notre Dame 20, Stanford 17 (OT); No. 8 Ohio
State 52, Indiana 49; No. 10 Oregon State 42, Brigham Young 24.  Doege, who completed 32 of 42 passing attempts for 499
yards yesterday, connected three times with Darrin Moore, who
had nine receptions for 92 yards for the Red Raiders.  “I thought Seth did a tremendous job running our
offense,”  Texas  Tech coach Tommy Tuberville said. “He’s hard-
nosed and he ran the ball.”  Doege threw his first 39-yard touchdown pass to Jace Amaro
two minutes into the game, then followed with a 19-yard scoring
pass to Eric Ward seven minutes later. West Virginia quarterback
Geno Smith, who tallied 275 passing yards on 29 of 55 attempts,
threw his only touchdown, a 7-yard pass to Stedman Bailey, to
trail 14-7 in the first quarter.  “Those guys did a great job of just attacking us,” Smith
said. “They attacked us the entire game.”  Doege went on to connect on five unanswered touchdowns
before the Mountaineers’ Dustin Garrison sprinted two yards with
two minutes, 41 seconds left to play at Jones AT&T Stadium in
Lubbock, Texas.  Texas Tech improved to 5-1 overall and 2-1 in the Big 12,
while  West Virginia  fell to 5-1 overall and 2-1 in the
conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
