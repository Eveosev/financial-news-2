Kenya , the largest economy in East
Africa, raised the maximum prices of gasoline, diesel and
kerosene after the cost of imported fuel products increased, the
Energy Regulatory Commission said.  Super petrol, the most commonly used gasoline grade,
climbed 6.31 shillings to 115.26 shillings a liter in the
capital, Nairobi, the regulator said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Diesel prices increased 5.04 shillings a liter to 106.11
shillings, while the cost of kerosene, a fuel used for cooking
and lighting, rose 6.36 shillings to 86.01 shillings, it said.  The price changes take effect tomorrow and end Nov. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
