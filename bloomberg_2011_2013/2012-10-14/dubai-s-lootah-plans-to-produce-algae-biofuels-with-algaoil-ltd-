S. S. Lootah Group , a Dubai-based
holding company, signed an agreement with AlgaOil Ltd. to
develop biofuels from algae.  AlgaOil , a producer of algae with high oil content in the
 Philippines , will set up ponds for large-scale algae output and
convert it for use as biofuel with Lootah Biofuels, according to
an e-mailed statement mail from S. S. Lootah today. Lootah
Biofuels, a wholly owned subsidiary of S. S. Lootah, said it
plans large-scale production of algae oil in Dubai, under the
