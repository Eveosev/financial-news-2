Ireland’s Shane Lowry had a five-
under-par final round at golf’s Portugal Masters today to beat
England’s  Ross Fisher  by one shot and secure his first European
Tour victory since 2009.  The 25-year-old, who finished on 14-under 270 in Vilamoura,
had his only previous victory at the Irish Open whilst still an
amateur. He turned professional just four days later.  Lowry’s final round included an eagle, five birdies and two
bogeys. Fisher finished on 13-under, with New Zealand’s Michael Campbell another shot back. Austria’s Bernd Wiesberger, the
overnight leader, was fourth.  Lowry collects a check for 375,000 euros ($485,700).  To contact the reporter on this story:
