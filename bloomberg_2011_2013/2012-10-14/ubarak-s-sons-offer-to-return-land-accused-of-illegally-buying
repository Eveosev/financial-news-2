Ousted President  Hosni Mubarak ’s two
sons reiterated a request today to return land they’re accused
of having illegally purchased with the aid of his last premier,
a Giza  Criminal Court  said today.  Gamal and Alaa Mubarak offered to return the land in
exchange for charges to be dropped, the court said in a faxed
statement. The court adjourned the hearing until Nov. 18 to
allow for the formation of a committee to look into the request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
