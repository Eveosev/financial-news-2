Alpine Holding GmbH, the Austrian
builder whose bonds tumbled last week, said it may have a
“significant” loss this year and is in talks with Spanish
owner  Fomento de Construcciones & Contratas SA  on its finances.  Alpine, based in Salzburg,  Austria , said “certain”
projects are responsible for the loss, according to an OTS
statement released late yesterday. Talks with its sole owner,
the Madrid-based construction company, focus on providing an
“appropriate” equity level for the company, Alpine said in the
statement.  “Contrary to the issuer’s prior assessments, in particular
due to the evolution of certain projects, the annual financial
statements for the 2012 financial year would show a significant
loss,” it said in the statement. With support by its
shareholder and the funding banks, Alpine is “confident that it
will continue to meet all of its financial obligations,” the
company said.  Alpine, which built German soccer team Bayern Munich’s
AllianzArena stadium, has about two-thirds of its output in
Austria and  Germany , and more than 20 percent in eastern and
southeastern  Europe . The company, which employs about 15,000,
was acquired by FCC in 2006. Net income was 13.4 million euros
($17.3 million) last year, 18 percent less than a year earlier.  The company said in its  annual report , published April 30,
that it expects 2012 net income to match the prior year’s level.
It sold a 100 million-euro bond in May, and in the prospectus
said it wouldn’t provide a profit outlook.  ‘Growing Concern’  Alpine said  in August  that it has “growing concern” about
its business in  Poland , where it is mired in legal battles
including one over its contract to build the A1 motorway, saying
their “outcome is hard to predict.”  Alpine’s three bonds with 290 million euros outstanding
recovered today after tumbling last week, when magazine Profil
first reported the company may have a loss on writedowns. The
notes sold in May, which mature May 2017, were quoted at 61
cents on the euro today, up from 55 cents Oct. 11, according to
prices on the exchanges where the bonds are listed. A 90
million-euro bond maturing June 2016 was quoted 18 cents higher
at 60 cents, while a 100 million-euro security due 2015 was up
11 cents at 66 cents.  The company, whose net debt doubled to 550 million euros by
the end of June from 277 million euros at the end of 2011, met
creditor banks for talks last week. Alpine’s creditors include
 Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  with 100 million euros outstanding,
Raiffeisenlandesbank OOe AG with 82 million euros, and UniCredit
Bank Austria AG with 78 million euros, according to the Profil
report. Spokesmen for Erste, Raiffeisen and UniCredit declined
to comment on the Alpine loans, citing bank secrecy rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
