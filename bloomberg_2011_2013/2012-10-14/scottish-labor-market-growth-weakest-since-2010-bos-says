The Scottish labour market expanded
in the third quarter at the slowest rate since the last three
months of 2010, according to the Bank of  Scotland  Labour Market
Barometer published today.  The barometer for the quarter was 51.6 -- anything above 50
represents expansion -- down from 54.3 in the three months
through June, and 50.6 in the fourth quarter of 2010, the bank
said. It declined to 52.3 in September from 52.4 a month
earlier. As well as the number of placements, the barometer also
includes vacancies, availability for work and salaries.  The number of people placed in permanent jobs reached a
four month high, while the number who found temporary work was
the highest since April, the Edinburgh-based unit of  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said in an e-mailed statement  “Scotland’s job market continued to improve in September
with a welcome increase in people appointed to both permanent
and temporary jobs alongside a rising number of vacancies,”
Donald MacRae, Bank of Scotland’s chief economist, said in the
statement.  The Scottish labour market has expanded every month over
the past year, while the U.K. market contracted in five of the
past 12 months, according to  data  from KMPG and the Recruitment
and Employment Federation. The Scottish labour market last
shrank in October 2010, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
