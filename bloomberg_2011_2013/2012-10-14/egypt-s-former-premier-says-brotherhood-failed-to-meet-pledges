Egypt ’s former prime minister said
the Muslim brotherhood failed to deliver on reforms pledged by
its presidential candidate.  “The regime has failed to satisfy the daily basic needs
and has fallen short of meeting promises made,” Ahmed Shafik,
who briefly served as  Hosni Mubarak ’s last premier, said in a
YouTube video posted on the state-run Ahram Gate website today.  The Brotherhood, which nominated Mohamed Mursi for the
presidency, is trying to monopolize power and is not working in
the interests of the nation, Shafik said.  Shafik, a former aviation minister, was among several
officials accused of illicit gains in connection with land deals
that benefited an air force pilots’ association. Shafik was
narrowly defeated by Mursi in the final round of the
presidential race in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
