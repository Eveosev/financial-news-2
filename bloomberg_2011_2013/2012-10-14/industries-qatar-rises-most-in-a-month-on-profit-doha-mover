Industries Qatar gained the most in
a month after the second-biggest petrochemicals maker in the
 Middle East  posted a 27 percent increase in third-quarter
profit, beating analysts’ estimates.  The  shares climbed  1.1 percent to close at 144.1 riyals in
Doha after net income rose to 2.62 billion riyals ($720
million), according to Bloomberg calculations based on  nine-
month results  provided by the company today. The mean estimate
of five analysts was for a profit of 2.15 billion riyals,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Industries Qatar, which makes petrochemicals, fertilizer
and steel, is utilizing the world’s third-largest natural gas
reserves to increase output and diversify the Persian Gulf
emirate’s economy away from petroleum exports. The company’s
fertilizer unit ramped up its Qafco 5 plant in the first quarter
with the Qafco 6 plant scheduled to start later this year.
Ethylene prices gained 44 percent during the quarter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The volume from Qafco 5 and the price of petrochemicals
had an impact” on earnings, said Ahmed Shehada, head of trading
at Qatar National Bank Financial Services in Doha. “Based on
the companies expansion in 2012 and 2013, with Qafco 6 coming
into play, you are going to see stronger dividend payouts in the
years ahead.”  Nine-month revenue increased to 14.2 billion riyals from
12.5 billion riyals, while earnings per share rose to 12.1
riyals from 11.35 riyals, according to the company statement.  The stock has gained 8.4 percent this year compared with a
3.3 percent decline for the benchmark QE Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
