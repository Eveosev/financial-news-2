Three people were killed today by
unidentified gunmen in an attack on a Nigerian church in the
northeastern Maiduguri, a military spokesman said.  “A family of three was gunned down when they out from
church at Gwange ward,” Sagir Musa, a spokesman for the
military Joint Task Force in charge of the region, said by phone
today from the city. A bomb targeting troops patrolling the Bama
area of Maiduguri exploded today without any casualties, he
said.  Authorities in  Nigeria  blame Boko Haram for a surge in gun
and bomb attacks in the north and the capital, Abuja, since
2009.  Nigeria’s population of more than 164 million is split
almost equally between Christians in the south and Muslims in
the north. The West African nation is  Africa ’s largest oil
producer and sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
