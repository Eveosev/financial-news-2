Citadel LLC, the Chicago-based firm
run by billionaire  Kenneth Griffin , handled more share volume on
the Nasdaq Stock Market in September than any other brokerage,
according to Crain’s Chicago Business.  The firm is not required to disclose its trading volume,
according to the Crain’s article, which cited “informed
sources.”  Citadel’s Griffin told the newspaper his firm executes
about one in eight U.S. stock trades and one in five stock
option trades and recently started trading so-called penny
stocks and international shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
