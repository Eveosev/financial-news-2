Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas’s
Civic Democratic Party was routed in regional elections as
voters voiced their anger at his plans to narrow the country’s
budget deficit by raising taxes.  The Civic Democrats won one of 13 regions where elections
were held over the last two days and took 12.3 percent of all
ballots cast nationwide. The opposition Social Democrats
received 23.6 percent of the votes, while the Communists came
away with 20.4 percent.  The result weakens Necas’s center-right government as it
prepares for a battle in parliament to push through its
austerity agenda. Lawmakers will vote on the tax increases by
the end of the year. Necas has staked his government’s survival
on the outcome.  Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek has repeatedly warned
that a failure to pass the tax plan could undermine investors’
confidence. The Czech government on Oct. 1 sold 750 million
euros ($971 million) of Eurobonds maturing in 2022 at 1.16
percent, the lowest rate ever achieved by the nation on foreign
debt markets, according to Kalousek.  Left-wing candidates also fared better in the first round
of the Senate election, a separate ballot in which voters chose
27 members of the 81-seat upper house of the Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
