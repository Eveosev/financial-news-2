ZTE Corp. (000063) , China’s No. 2 mobile-
phone equipment maker, said it may post a third-quarter loss of
as much as 2 billion  yuan  ($319 million) after delays in some
overseas projects and collective purchasing by local carriers.  The net loss would compare with 299 million yuan in profit
in the same period last year, the company said in a statement to
the Shenzhen Stock exchange. Net loss in the first nine months
may be between 1.65 billion yuan and 1.75 billion yuan, against
a profit of 1.07 billion yuan in the comparable period last
year, it said.  Sales for the July-to-September quarter may have fallen
about 13 percent from last year, according to the statement.
The gross margin may have slipped by 13 percentage points over
the same time last year because of the recognition of some low-
margin contracts in the period, it said.  ZTE’s operational results may also be “negatively
impacted” as the company and its subsidiaries are being
investigated by U.S. Department of Commerce and  Department of
Justice  for its dealings with  Iran , the statement said without
elaborating. The company is assisting the investigations, it
said.  --William Bi. Editors: Vidya Root, Alex Nicholson  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
