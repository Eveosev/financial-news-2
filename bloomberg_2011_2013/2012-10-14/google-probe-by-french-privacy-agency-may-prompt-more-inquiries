  Google Inc. (GOOG)  could face a fresh
round of criticism from European watchdogs after a French
regulator reports on whether changes to its privacy policy
violate data-protection rules.  France ’s  National Commission for Computing and Civil
Liberties , or CNIL, will announce its conclusions tomorrow.
Given the European Union’s patchwork approach to data
protection, regulators may then decide to pursue their own cases
against the company.  As a result, the matter may not end with France for Google,
said Nick Graham, a data protection lawyer at SNR Denton in
 London . “While CNIL’s views will be persuasive, other data-
protection regulators in other EU countries could take a
different line and levy their own sanctions.”  Google, operator of the world’s largest search engine, is
facing privacy investigations by authorities around the world as
it debuts new services and steps up competition with  Facebook
Inc. (FB)  for users and advertisers. Google  changed  its system this
year to create a uniform set of policies for more than 60
products, unleashing criticism from regulators and consumer
advocates concerned it isn’t protecting data it collects.  “Our new privacy policy is an important part of our
layered approach to providing users with clear and comprehensive
information about how we use data,” Al Verney, Mountain View,
California-based Google’s spokesman in Brussels, said in an Oct.
11 e-mail. “We are confident that our privacy notices respect
the requirements of European data protection laws.”  CNIL Audit  After Google  announced  its plans in January, European
privacy regulators asked their French counterpart to look into
whether the resulting controls meet the bloc’s standards on
their behalf as they weren’t given time to vet it, CNIL said.  The report “has been approved and shared with all European
authorities,” CNIL said Oct. 11. The audit’s goal “was to
clarify the implications of these new rules for Google users.”  The two have had several public exchanges since the inquiry
began. Google twice rebuffed CNIL requests to wait to implement
the changes until it could assess whether they comply with
European standards. CNIL also submitted two rounds of questions
to Google, once seeking details on the new policy and how it
affected users, and a second time asking to clarify or expand on
the earlier responses.  In a February  letter , CNIL said its preliminary analysis
showed the policy may not meet EU requirements and criticized
Google for not alerting all European privacy authorities about
its plans earlier. Some “only heard about the changes a few
days before the announcement,” Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin,
CNIL’s chairwoman said in the letter.  Dangerous Precedent  “For a company to willfully ignore the collective concern
of regulators worldwide sets a very dangerous precedent,” said
Nick Pickles, director of U.K. privacy advocate  Big Brother
Watch . Google “has appeared far from frank and there’s a great
deal of uncertainty about the willingness of the company to
engage with these issues and ensure consumers do have a clear
understanding of what happens to their data.”  Google didn’t change existing privacy settings or collect
additional data on users, the company’s global privacy counsel,
Peter Fleischer, told European privacy watchdogs at the Article
29 Data Protection Working Party in a letter on Google’s  blog .  “We briefed most of the members of the working party in
the weeks leading up to our announcement,” Fleischer wrote in a
Feb. 3 entry. “None of them expressed substantial concerns.”  Europe ’s privacy watchdogs differ in their investigative
and enforcement powers. EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding
proposed changing the bloc’s 17-year-old data-protection rules
and how they’re administered to toughen protections and make
things simpler for companies, putting them under one regulator
rather than potentially facing multiple inquiries on the same
subject, as Google faced on its Street View mapping service.  In the meantime, agencies are striving to coordinate
actions to speak with one voice and minimize redundant efforts.
CNIL’s work conducting one investigation into a Europe-wide
question on Google is one of the first examples of this.  To contact the reporter on this story:
