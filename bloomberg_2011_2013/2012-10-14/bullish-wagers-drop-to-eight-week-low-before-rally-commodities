Hedge funds  cut bullish commodity
wagers to the lowest since the middle of August before signs the
 U.S. economy  is improving and declining grain stockpiles drove
prices to a three-week high.  Speculators reduced net-long  positions  across 18 U.S.
futures and options by 0.4 percent to 1.24 million contracts in
the week ended Oct. 9, the lowest since Aug. 14, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show. Corn bets dropped to the
lowest since July before the U.S. government cut its stockpile
forecast on Oct. 11. Soybean-oil wagers tumbled 64 percent, and
those on crude oil contracted for a third week.  U.S.  consumer confidence  unexpectedly jumped in October to
the highest level since before the recession began, and jobless
claims fell to a four-year low, reports showed last week. The
economy is improving more than forecasters anticipated,
according to the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which is at
the highest since the end of February. Commodities jumped 11
percent since June 30 as central banks from the U.S. to Europe
to  Japan  announced measures to bolster growth.  “Economic fears remain and try to beat the markets, but
the trickle of fundamental reports continues to flow in and
support commodities,” said  James Paulsen , the Minneapolis-based
chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, which
oversees about $325 billion. “There is growing evidence that
the U.S. economic recovery has been gearing up and is more
broadly based and hence less vulnerable to external shocks.”  GSCI Gains  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
gained 0.9 percent last week, touching 674.77 on Oct. 11, the
highest since Sept. 19. The MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities fell 2 percent, and the dollar gained 0.4 percent
against a basket of six major trading partners. Treasuries
returned 0.4 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows. The
GSCI gauge fell 0.3 percent to settle at 663.08.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
October consumer  sentiment  index increased to 83.1, the highest
since September 2007, from 78.3 the prior month, data showed
Oct. 12. Applications for jobless benefits dropped 30,000 to
339,000 in the week ended Oct. 6, the fewest since February
2008. Cars sold at a 14.9 million annual  rate  in September, the
fastest pace since 2008, according to Ward’s Automotive Group.  China ’s rail-infrastructure investment will probably exceed
520 billion  yuan  ($83 billion) next year, 21st Century Business
Herald reported on Oct. 12, citing the railway ministry. The
country raised planned investment this year to 516 billion yuan
on Oct. 10, from 496 billion yuan previously.  IMF Forecast  Europe’s debt crisis will still be a drag on global growth
and may limit gains for commodities, said  John Stephenson , who
helps manage $2.7 billion at First Asset Investment Management
Inc. in Toronto. Europe accounts for about 18 percent of global
copper demand and 22 percent of oil consumption, data from
Barclays Plc and  BP Plc (BP/)  show.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecasts on
Oct. 8 and warned of even slower gains unless officials in the
U.S. and Europe address threats to their economies. The world
economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, the slowest since the
2009 recession, the Washington-based lender said. Advances in
developed economies are “tepid,” IMF Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  said in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp. in Tokyo on Oct. 12.  Alcoa Outlook  Industrial production in Germany, Europe’s largest economy,
declined in August as companies scaled back investment, the
 Economy Ministry  said Oct. 8. The start of the U.S. earnings
season has overshadowed better-than-estimated economic data,
with more than $750 billion erased from the value of global
equity markets last week.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, cut its global consumption forecast by 1 percentage
point on Oct. 9 because of slowing Chinese demand.  “While China is trying to improve conditions, its biggest
trading partner has not been able to do much about its
condition, and that makes me bearish going forward,” said John Stephenson, who helps manage $2.7 billion at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. “Europe has gone from
one problem to another.”  Inflows into commodity funds in the week ended Oct. 10
totaled $1.26 billion, with gold and precious metals accounting
for $1.2 billion, according to  Cameron Brandt , the director of
research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks money flows.  Citigroup Index  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index jumped to 49.4 on
Oct. 12 from this year’s low of minus 65.3 on July 19. A
positive reading suggests the economic releases have on balance
been better than the Bloomberg consensus. President  Barack Obama 
and Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  are trying to
convince voters before the Nov. 6 election that they are best
equipped to spur growth and accelerate hiring.  Bets on higher crude-oil prices fell 3.1 percent to 161,004
contracts, CFTC data show. Futures in  New York  capped the first
weekly gain in a month as OPEC production fell to the lowest
level in eight months. Production in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries dropped 510,000 barrels a day to
31.17 million last month as supply from Nigeria, Iran and  Saudi
Arabia  declined, the  International Energy Agency  said Oct. 12.  Gold wagers rose for an eighth week to 198,194 futures and
options, the highest since Aug. 23, 2011. Holdings in exchange-
traded products backed by the metal reached a record 2,582.98
metric tons on Oct. 11.  Farm Goods  A  measure  of 11 U.S. farm goods showed speculators lowered
bullish bets in agricultural commodities by 1.6 percent to
663,172 contracts. That’s the fifth consecutive decrease, the
longest retreat since April.  Corn holdings dropped 4.5 percent to 260,466 contracts, the
lowest since July 17. Futures rose 0.6 percent in Chicago last
week, reaching $7.76 a bushel on Oct. 11, the highest since
Sept. 17.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its outlook for
global inventories of the grain by 5.4 percent on Oct. 11 and
said reserves as a percent of consumption will fall to 13.7
percent, the lowest since 1974. The worst U.S. drought in more
than 50 years has cut output by the most since 1996.  Prices for corn, wheat and soybeans will rise on tighter
supplies as stockpiles are “critically low,” analysts at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report Oct. 12.  “The economic data out of the U.S. seems to be getting
better, and China may be close to bottoming,” said John Toohey,
a vice president of equities investments with USAA Investments
who helps manage about $50 billion in San Antonio. “This is a
good time to be ready to invest into commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
