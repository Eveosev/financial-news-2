The dollar and yen remained weaker
versus most peers as signs of economic improvement in  China  and
speculation European leaders are progressing toward resolving
the region’s debt crisis curbed demand for haven assets.  Investor appetite for the U.S. and Japanese currencies was
tempered before European Union leaders gather for a summit this
week, when they are expected to discuss measures to contain
fiscal turmoil within the euro area. The greenback and yen also
stayed lower versus  Australia ’s dollar following a decline last
week after a report showed bigger-than-expected gains in Chinese
exports.  “Some of the European concerns have been alleviated and
that’s positive for sentiment,” reducing demand for the dollar
and yen, said Janu Chan, economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in
Sydney. “Given that Chinese export data was stronger than
expected, it could be signaling the slowdown in the Chinese
economy is stabilizing.”  The dollar was at $1.2949 per euro as of 8:05 a.m. in Tokyo
after falling 0.2 percent to $1.2951 on Oct. 12. It was little
changed at 78.45 yen.  Japan ’s currency fetched 101.56 per euro
following a 0.3 percent drop to 101.61 at the end of last week.  The greenback was little changed at $1.0234 against
Australia’s dollar after a 0.5 percent weekly decline, while the
yen traded at 80.28 per so-called Aussie from 80.27 on Oct. 12,
when it completed a 0.2 percent five-day slide.  EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Oct. 18-19 after a
weekend in which international finance chiefs expressed some
optimism that a firewall is in place to contain the euro’s
turmoil and urged further action to quell the main threat to
global growth.  In China, the customs administration said Oct. 13  overseas
shipments  increased 9.9 percent in September from a year
earlier. That compares with the 5.5 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Figures for  third-quarter
growth  in the world’s second-biggest economy are due for release
on Oct. 18 and are forecast to show a 7.4 percent increase from
a year earlier, versus a 7.6 percent gain in the previous
period, according to a separate poll.  To contact the reporters on this story:
