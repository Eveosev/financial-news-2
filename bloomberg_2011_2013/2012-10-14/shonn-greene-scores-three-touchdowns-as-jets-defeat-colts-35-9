Aaron Rodgers  threw six touchdown
passes to lead the  Green Bay Packers  to a 42-24 victory against
the Houston Texans, whose loss leaves the  Atlanta Falcons  as the
National Football League’s only unbeaten team.  The Falcons improved to 6-0 yesterday by beating the
Oakland Raiders 23-20 in Atlanta on a 55-yard field goal by Matt Bryant with one second left. The  New York Giants  cruised past
the San Francisco 49ers 26-3 in a rematch of last season’s
National Football Conference championship game, while the  New
York Jets  ended their two-game home losing skid with a 35-9 win
against the Indianapolis Colts.  The Packers entered last night’s game in Houston with a 2-3
record and rolled past the previously unbeaten Texans as Rodgers
passed for 338 yards, with three touchdown passes to  Jordy Nelson , two to  James Jones  and one to Tom Crabtree. The Texans
had three turnovers in falling to 5-1.  “We were all just tired of answering questions of what
happened to the Packers and what happened to me,” said Rodgers,
who was the NFL’s Most Valuable Player last season as the
Packers went 15-1. “We just got back to the way we’re capable
of playing. We haven’t gone anywhere.”  The Baltimore Ravens held on for a 31-29 win against the
Dallas Cowboys as Dan Bailey missed a 51-yard field goal with
two seconds left, while the Seattle Seahawks upset the New
England Patriots 24-23 in Seattle on Russell Wilson’s 46-yard
touchdown pass to Sidney Rice with 1 minute, 18 seconds left.  Browns Win  The  Cleveland Browns  got their first win of the season,
34-24 against the Cincinnati Bengals, to ensure the NFL won’t
have an 0-6 team for the first time since 2006. The  Washington
Redskins  defeated the Minnesota Vikings 38-26 as quarterback
Robert Griffin III threw for one touchdown and rushed for 138
yards and two scores a week after suffering a concussion.  The  Detroit Lions  beat the Philadelphia Eagles 26-23 in
overtime after rallying from a 10-point deficit on the road with
5:18 left in the fourth quarter.  In yesterday’s other Week 6 games, it was the Miami
Dolphins 17, the St. Louis Rams 14; the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 38,
the Kansas City Chiefs 10, and the Buffalo Bills 19, the Arizona
Cardinals 16 in overtime. The Tennessee Titans four days ago
beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-23.  The Week 6 schedule concludes tonight as the San Diego
Chargers (3-2) host the Denver Broncos (2-3).  At Candlestick Park in San Francisco, the Giants scored 26
unanswered points after allowing a first-quarter field goal and
had three interceptions of 49ers quarterback  Alex Smith , who had
thrown just one through his first five games this season.  Manning’s Touchdown  Eli Manning threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Victor Cruz
with 10:04 left in the second quarter to put the Giants ahead
for good and  Ahmad Bradshaw  added a 1-yard touchdown run on the
opening possession of the second half.  Bradshaw finished with 116 yards on 27 carries and  Lawrence Tynes  added four field goals for New York, which improved to 4-2
and has won four of its past five games. The 49ers, who
outscored the Jets and Buffalo Bills 79-3 in winning their
previous two games, fell to 4-2.  The last time the teams met, the Giants won 20-17 in
overtime in San Francisco to advance to last season’s Super
Bowl, where they beat the Patriots.  After consecutive losses to the 49ers and Texans in East
Rutherford, New Jersey, Shonn Green had a career-high 161 yards
rushing and three touchdowns as the Jets rolled past the Colts.
The Jets’ defense also forced four turnovers, including three by
rookie quarterback  Andrew Luck .  ‘Great Win’  “This is really a great win for us,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan 
said. “We certainly needed one. We knew we’d be challenged, but
I thought our guys stepped up and really responded.”  Jets quarterback  Mark Sanchez  completed 11 of 18 passes for
82 yards, including a pair of 5-yard touchdown passes in the
first half to  Stephen Hill  and Jason Hill.  At M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, the Ravens improved to
5-1 and pushed their home winning streak to 15 games with the
help of a 108-yard kickoff return by Jacoby Jones that tied a
record for the NFL’s longest scoring play.  Baltimore, which gave up 481 yards of offense, including
227 yards rushing, never trailed after Jones’s touchdown gave it
a 24-13 third-quarter lead.  The Cowboys pulled within 24-23 midway through the fourth
quarter and then within two points on Dez Bryant’s 4-yard
touchdown catch with 32 seconds left. Bryant had a two-point
conversion pass that would have tied the game slip through his
hands. The Cowboys got the ball back when they recovered the
ensuing onside kick. A pass interference penalty on the next
play gave Bailey a chance for a winning kick, which went wide.  The Falcons overcame three interceptions by quarterback
 Matt Ryan  to win their seventh straight home game.  Atlanta rallied from a 13-7 deficit and took a 20-13 lead
with 2:40 to play in the fourth quarter as Asante Samuel
returned an interception 79 yards for a touchdown. The Raiders
(1-4) tied it again with 40 seconds remaining as Darren McFadden
reached the end zone on a 2-yard run. The Falcons then drove 43
yards in 39 seconds to set up Bryant’s winning kick.  To contact the reporter on this story:
