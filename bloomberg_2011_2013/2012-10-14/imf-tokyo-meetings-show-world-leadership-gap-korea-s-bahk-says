Financial chiefs failed to agree on
how to address global economic challenges at International
Monetary Fund meetings in  Tokyo , showing the world lacks
leadership, South Korea’s finance minister said.  “Ministers discussed a short-term response for the global
economy, but their opinions weren’t harmonized in one
direction,” Bahk Jae Wan said in remarks to reporters yesterday
embargoed for today, the last day of the IMF gathering. “The
world has a leadership problem.”  The Washington-based IMF’s last week highlighted the risk
of a deeper slowdown as Europe wrestles with its sovereign debt
crisis. South Korean Central Bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said
yesterday in Tokyo that Asian countries doubt the IMF’s
transparency and fairness, underscoring the challenge of forging
a unified response.  Participants in the IMF meetings discussed major risks to
the global economy posed by  Europe , the looming U.S. fiscal
cliff and  China ’s slowing economy, Bahk said.  “The gap remains between the euro zone and other regions
over solutions for Europe’s crisis and on how quickly they need
to be addressed,” Bahk said. “The euro zone itself is far from
a full agreement and the outcome from this IMF meeting is
unlikely to help boost market confidence significantly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
