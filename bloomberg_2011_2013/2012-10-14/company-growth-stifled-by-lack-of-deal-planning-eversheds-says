The growth of global businesses is
being stifled by weaknesses in planning mergers and
acquisitions, Eversheds LLP said.  Dealmakers at 43 percent of more than 400 multinational
companies surveyed by the international law firm said
“challenges” during the integration of acquisitions into their
companies were due to planning errors before to the deal,
 Eversheds  said in an e-mailed report.  “Businesses need to join the dots between the different
stages of the deal cycle more effectively and move the focus
from just simply ‘doing the deal’ to thinking about life for the
business beyond the deal,” Robin Johnson, mergers and
acquisitions partner at Eversheds, said in today’s report.  Integration of a target proceeded as expected for 86
percent of companies that involved their in-house legal teams at
an early stage of a transaction and for 63 percent of companies
that brought in lawyers later, according to the report. A lower
proportion of failures were reported when lawyers with
experience of 10 or more cross-border mergers and acquisitions
were used, the company said.  Eversheds interviewed more than 400 general counsels or
legal experts at companies around the world who were involved in
cross-border deals of at least $100 million in the past three
years. In total, respondents worked on more than 3,000 trans-
boundary deals, and 80 percent of respondents were not Eversheds
clients, according to the law firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
