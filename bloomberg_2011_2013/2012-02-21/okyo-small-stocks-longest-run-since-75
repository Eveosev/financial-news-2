Small Tokyo-listed companies have
capped the longest streak of daily advances in almost 37 years.  Japan ’s  TSE Second Section Price Index (TSE2) , a capitalization-
weighted index of smaller companies listed at the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, added 0.2 percent to 2,308.56 at the 3 p.m. close
today, rising for a 26th consecutive day. That’s the longest
streak since May 13, 1975, said Takamichi Sugawara, an assistant
manager in the information service division of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.  Even after rising for 26 days, shares on the index trade at
an average of 0.68 times  book value , compared with 1 times for
the Topix Index, Japan’s broadest gauge, and 1.24 times for the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average. A number less than one means that
companies can be bought for less than value of their assets.  The streak “suggests money is flowing into the Japanese
market across the board,” said Makoto Sengoku, a market analyst
at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co. “The TSE’s second section is a
market that’s very undervalued. That’s another reason behind
investors buying the shares.”  Companies on the Tokyo bourse’s second section should have
at least 800 shareholders and a market value of at least 2
billion yen ($25 million), bourse spokeswoman Yukari Hozumi said
by telephone. For inclusion in the first section, where Toyota
Motor Corp. and Canon Inc. are listed, companies are required to
have at least 2,200 shareholders and market capitalization of 50
billion yen or more.  Nippon Seiki Co., which makes instrument panels for cars
and boats, and Kabuki-za Co., which owns a traditional Japanese
theater and runs restaurants, are  the biggest companies  on the
Topix second section by market value.  To contact the reporters on this story:
