The  New Jersey Devils  are “very
close” to a deal with a new investor to pay down the National
Hockey League team’s $80 million in overdue debt, the  New York
Post  reported, citing unidentified sources.  The NHL has funded the Devils for the past few months,
loaning it $10 million against future revenue, the newspaper
said. The Post didn't identify the possible investor or
disclose how it got the information.   Devils’ controlling owner Jeffrey Vanderbeek, a former
 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  executive, will have to find extra
cash by the start of the next season, or could be forced to
sell, the Post said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
