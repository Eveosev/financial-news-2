The Boston  Red Sox  acquired second-
year pitcher Chris Carpenter and a player to be named from the
 Chicago  Cubs as compensation for losing General Manager  Theo Epstein  to the National League club.  Carpenter, 26, made his Major League Baseball debut last
year with the Cubs, posting a 2.79 earned-run average in 10
games. Selected by Chicago in the third round of the 2008 draft,
the right-hander gave up three runs and struck out eight in 9
2/3 innings of relief.  Epstein, who won two World Series championships in nine
seasons as the Red Sox’s general manager, left Boston in October
to become the Cubs’ president of baseball operations. He had one
year remaining on his contract in  Boston , entitling the team to
compensation that wasn’t determined at the time of his
resignation.  Commissioner Bud Selig’s office had reviewed the
compensation issue. Epstein said in a  statement  on the Cubs’
website that the teams “were able to reach agreement on their
own without intervention from MLB.”  The Red Sox placed two-time All-Star relief pitcher Bobby Jenks on the 60-day disabled list to make room for Carpenter on
the 40-man roster, according a news release from the American
League team.  The Cubs will also receive a player to be named from Boston
under the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
