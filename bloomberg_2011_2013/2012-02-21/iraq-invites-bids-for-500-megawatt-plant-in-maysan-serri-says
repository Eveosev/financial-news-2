Iraq invited companies to submit
bids to build a 500-megawatt electricity plant fuelled by
natural gas in the eastern province of Maysan, Mussab Serri, an
electricity ministry spokesman, said today in an interview.  The work doesnâ€™t include the supply of the four turbines
that will generate electricity in the plant, which will be
supplied by  General Electric Co. (GE)  under a separate contract, he
said in Baghdad. The contract will be awarded in March, he said.  Iraq will invest $15 billion by 2015 on building  power
plants  after three decades of wars and economic sanctions
reduced electricity capacity and caused blackouts, Kosay Sattar,
director of planning at the electricity ministry, said on Feb.
