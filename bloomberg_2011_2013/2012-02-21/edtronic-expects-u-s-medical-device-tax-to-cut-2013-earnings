Medtronic Inc. (MDT) , the world’s biggest-
maker of heart rhythm devices, said it is planning for a U.S.
tax on medical products that will cost the company $125 million
to $175 million annually starting next year.  Medtronic, which reports earnings on a fiscal calendar that
ends April 30, will provide a forecast for the 2013 year in May.
The estimate will include four months during which the company
was subject to a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices that
was part of the 2010 health-care law, Chief Financial Officer
Gary Ellis said.  The Minneapolis-based company estimates it will pay a tax
of $40 million to $60 million in the 2013 fiscal year, based on
the draft regulations currently available, Ellis said today in a
telephone interview. Medtronic is trying to determine how much
of the tax it can pass on to hospitals and other customers who
purchase the company’s devices, he said.  “We’ve looked at this as basically one of the costs we’re
going to have to cover as we put together our plans for fiscal
year 2013 and as we put together our initiatives on a long-term
basis,” Ellis said in a conference call with investors. “We’re
going to have to make the tradeoffs and there’s probably going
to be things that we can’t do as a result of that,” he said.
“It means we won’t have as much to invest going forward.”  Medtronic  fell  2.4 percent to $38.99 at 4:05 p.m. in New
York Stock Market composite trading. The shares have declined
5.5 percent in the past 12 months.  Paying for Uninsured  The tax was designed to raise $20 billion to expand health
insurance coverage for the uninsured. The  Internal Revenue
Service  hasn’t given final guidance on exempt products or when
the tax will be assessed.  Medtronic also is looking for other ways to counter-balance
the new expense, Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak said.  “We don’t view the medical device tax any differently from
other pressures that come our way,” he said in a telephone
interview. “We like to focus on things we can control. One of
our main strategies is to make sure we get our costs under
control.”  Medtronic today reported fiscal third-quarter profit rose
1.2 percent to $935 million, or 88 cents a share, from $924
million, or 86 cents. Profit excluding one-time items was 84
cents a share, matching the average of 26 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
