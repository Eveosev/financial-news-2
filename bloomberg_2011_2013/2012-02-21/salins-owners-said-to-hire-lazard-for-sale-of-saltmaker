The private equity owners of  Salins
Group (SMLDS)  are considering a sale of  France ’s largest salt producer,
three people familiar with the plan said.  Chequers Capital and Abenex Capital, both based in Paris,
hired Lazard to manage the disposal, which may value the company
at about 300 million euros ($394 million), said the people, who
declined to comment because the sale is private.  The company, whose main salt production site is located
near the medieval wall of the southern town of Aigues-Mortes,
makes products that include La Baleine table salt, the more
expensive artisanal salt Fleur de Sel de Camargue, as well as
salt used for icy roads and industrial purposes.  Salins, founded in 1856, produces close to 2.2 million
metric tons of salt, according to its website. Chequers and
Abenex bought Salins from  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  in 2004. It was
sold to  Credit Agricole  in 2000 for $270 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spokesmen for Chequers and Lazard declined to comment.
Representatives of Abenex couldn’t be reached immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
