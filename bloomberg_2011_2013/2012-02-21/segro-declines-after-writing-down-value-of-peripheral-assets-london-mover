Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.’s largest
publicly traded owner of industrial properties, declined 2.1
percent in  London  trading after writing down the value of
peripheral assets by more than analysts expected.  Net asset value adjusted for share options declined 9.8
percent to 340 pence a share in the second half of 2011, the
Slough, England-based company said today in a statement.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. had expected 450 pence, while the average
analyst estimate was 354 pence, according to a note to
investors.  The company wrote down the value of so-called non-core
assets by 187 million pounds ($296 million). Chief Executive
Officer David Sleath forecast in November that the company might
make 150 million pounds of writedowns for older properties or
those in peripheral locations.  The writedown was “the key driver of the miss on net
asset value,” said Osmaan Malik, an analyst at JPMorgan with an
“overweight” rating on the stock.  Segro declined 5 pence to 231.7 pence. The shares advanced
more than 13 percent this year to a three-month high yesterday
compared with an 8.9 percent gain for the  FTSE 350 Real Estate
Investment Trust Index. (F3REITS)   In November, Sleath also announced a three-year program to
sell 1.6 billion pounds of real estate to cut debt and focus on
more profitable assets near major transportation hubs or large
cities across  Europe .  Depreciating Properties  The properties that Segro plans to retain lost 0.4 percent
of their value, Sleath said on a conference call. The decline
contributed to a 2011  net loss  of 30.4 million pounds, or 4.1
pence a share, compared with a profit of 210.3 million pounds,
or 28.5 pence, a year earlier.  Profit excluding changes in property values and one-time
items rose to 136.6 million pounds, or 18.4 pence a share, from
126 million pounds, or 17.1 pence, a year earlier. The company
cut vacancies to the lowest since 2007, trimmed costs and raised
rents.  “There’s been good earnings growth and there’s good
momentum in the business,” Sleath said on the conference call.  Segro opened 15 projects last year, adding 9 million pounds
of annual rent, while this year 20 more will open to generate
annual rental income of 18.9 million pounds.  Sleath said that he plans to raise as much as 500 million
pounds this year from disposals. He said the company is in talks
with potential buyers that would enable the company to “make
significant further progress in coming months.”  Segro sold five industrial estates in southern  England  to
funds run by Ignis Asset Management for about 80 million pounds,
according to a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
