The  International Monetary Fund  no
longer wants to fund a third, or 30 billion euros ($40 billion),
of the upcoming aid payments to  Greece  because of the countryâ€™s
failure to implement reforms,  Bild-Zeitung  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The IMF has held internal discussions on complete
withdrawal from the aid program for Greece, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
