U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since 2008, as
earnings from Home Depot Inc. to  Macy’s Inc. (M)  tempered concern
that Greece’s debt crisis will persist even after a bailout.  Home Depot, the world’s largest home-improvement retailer,
and Macy’s, the second-biggest U.S. department-store chain,
added more than 1.7 percent as profit beat estimates.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) 
and  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  rose at least 1.9 percent to pace gains in
commodity producers.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the biggest retailer,
fell 3.9 percent as low prices hurt margins.  The S&P 500 added 0.4 percent to 1,366.51 at 10:41 a.m. New
York time. The benchmark index is at the highest level on a
closing basis since June 2008. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
rose 39.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,989.15.  “The Greek bailout keeps the wheels on the bus,” James Dunigan, who helps oversee $107 billion as chief investment
officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said in a
phone interview. “The ride is a little smoother, but it doesn’t
solve the longer-term issues,” he said. “In addition, the U.S.
market got a bit extended. After the run-up we’ve had this year,
a little pause wouldn’t surprise me.”  European finance ministers approved 130 billion euros ($173
billion) in aid for Greece by tapping into European Central Bank
profits and coaxing investors into providing more debt relief to
shield the region from a default. Greece’s debt may still
balloon to 160 percent of gross domestic product in a worst-case
scenario, analysis by the  International Monetary Fund  and
European officials indicated.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  advanced 8.6 percent this year amid optimism
policy makers would save Greece from default and reports on U.S.
manufacturing, housing and jobless claims that bolstered
confidence.  ‘Topping Phase’  “We’re in a topping phase,”  Barry James , who helps
oversee $3 billion as president of James Investment Research in
Xenia,  Ohio , said in a telephone interview. “Our indicators are
getting less positive. The news is out about the Greece bailout.
Yet we see a rolling recession throughout  Europe . It’s not a buy
and hold market in our opinion. We’re on edge.”  Energy and  raw material  producers had the biggest gains in
the S&P 500 among 10 industries. The S&P GSCI gauge of 24
commodities added 1 percent. Schlumberger advanced 1.9 percent
to $79.24. Alcoa increased 2.5 percent to $10.40.  Home Depot (HD)  gained 1.7 percent to $47.49. The company
attracted customers who spent more as U.S. unemployment sank to
a three-year low in January and builders began work on more
houses. Warmer weather helped sales at stores open at least a
year advance 5.7 percent, the biggest gain since a 7.7 percent
increase in the first quarter of 2004. That topped the average
estimate for a 3 percent gain by five analysts.  Lowe’s, Macy’s  Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the second-largest U.S. home-improvement
retailer, rose 1.1 percent to $27.99.  Macy’s added 2.9 percent to $37.29. Its profitability
shrank less than analysts projected as it was able to sell
women’s handbags and accessories with its planned promotions
rather than by slashing prices during the holiday season.
Planned promotions can be  profitable  while last-minute efforts
to clear excess inventories erode margins.  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  jumped 6.5 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $120.02. The company bought out its largest shareholder
stake at a 31 percent discount and asked him to quit the board
after a probe by the casino operator uncovered allegedly
improper payments to Philippine gambling officials.  Wal-Mart lost 3.9 percent to $60.06. Chief Executive
Officer  Mike Duke  is working to contain Wal-Mart’s costs and
last quarter started pulling the company’s greeters from store
lobbies to help with customer-service tasks. The retailer is
seeking to keep prices low as its low-income shoppers suffer
from persistent unemployment.  Restate Results  Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT)  tumbled 12 percent to
$15.73. The oilfield-services and equipment provider said it
hasn’t repaired material weakness in internal controls related
to taxes and may restate results for 2008 through 2011.  The  S&P 500  is approaching the  cheapest level  ever compared
with bonds as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s zero-
percent interest rates drive investors and companies from cash.  Profits that doubled since 2009 pushed the index’s so-
called earnings yield to 7.1 percent, close to the highest on
record when compared with the  10-year Treasury rate , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg since 1962. American companies
have boosted capital spending 35 percent over six quarters, the
most since 2006.  “Conditions are almost ideal for equity investors relative
to all other investments,”  Keith Wirtz , who oversees $14.6
billion as chief investment officer for Fifth Third Asset
Management in Cincinnati, said in a Feb. 14 telephone interview.
“The Fed’s keeping rates low for the foreseeable future to try
to stimulate the environment for employee hiring and business
activity. What does that mean for  capital markets ? Savers are
not being rewarded.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
