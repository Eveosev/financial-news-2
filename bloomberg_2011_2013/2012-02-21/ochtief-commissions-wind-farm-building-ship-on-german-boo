Hochtief AG (HOT)  commissioned its fourth
heavy-duty unit to erect wind farms at sea as  Germany ’s biggest
builder banks on “huge demand” from the country’s switch to
alternative energy sources.  The ship will be equipped with a 1,200 metric ton crane,
Hochtief’s Solutions unit said by e-mail today. It will be built
by  Poland ’s Crist shipyard and is to start operating in 2013, it
said.  “We are banking on the move to alternative energy sources
and accommodating market players’ huge demand with our special-
purpose vessel,” Rainer Eichholz, a board member at the unit,
said in the statement.  Germany plans to install 25 gigawatts of turbines off its
coast by 2030 to help replace its nuclear reactors, ordered shut
by 2022 after the Fukushima Dai-Ichi disaster in  Japan  in March.
Hochtief, with 20 billion euros ($26 billion) of sales in 2010,
seeks to benefit from projects costing more than 1 billion
euros. It set up a company to develop wind farms for sale and
plans to charter out its construction vessels.  The vessel will cost in the “low three-digit” million
euros, Bernd Puetter, a spokesman, said by phone.  The ship, named Vidar after a Norse god who avenged the
death of his father by slaying his killer, a wolf, is financed
through an operate-lease structure with a subsidiary of
Santander acting as the lessor, and with the involvement of KfW
IPEX Bank GmbH, Norddeutsche Landesbank, CaixaBank and Bankhaus
Lampe, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
