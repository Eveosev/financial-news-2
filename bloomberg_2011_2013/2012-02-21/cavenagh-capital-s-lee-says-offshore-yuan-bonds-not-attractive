Lee Ka Shao, the Singapore-based
chief investment officer at Cavenagh Capital, a hedge fund set
up by former Morgan Stanley and DBS Holdings Ltd. managers,
comments on Dim Sum bonds at a conference in  Singapore .  “I’m not a buyer of Dim Sum bonds. If you’re using it as a
shrewd way to bet on the currency, it’s the wrong way. You see a
lot of the issuers are not good investment-grade issuers in the
first place.  “The key for market participants like myself is the 3
percent annualized” appreciation of the yuan, he said. “Given
that some stocks can rally 10 percent in one day, forget it.
It’s not something I’m interested in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
