Gilts snapped three days of declines
as concern that Greece will struggle to implement the austerity
measures in its bailout plan boosted demand for the relative
safety of U.K.  government bonds .  Yields on 10-year government bonds fell from the highest
level since December. The pound weakened against the euro as
short-term demand for euro-region assets was boosted after
Greece won 130 billion euros ($172 billion) in aid. Sterling
slid for the first time in five days against the dollar amid
speculation its 1 percent rally in the past four days was
excessive.  “Inflows to gilts accelerate each time there’s a fresh
wave of worry about Greece,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. “When
some of that’s alleviated, those flows reverse.”  Yields on the  10-year gilt  fell one basis points to 2.22
percent at 4:25 p.m.  London  time, after reaching 2.25 percent,
the most since Dec. 7. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021
advanced 0.085, or 85 pence per 1,000-pound ($1,585) face
amount, to 113.125. Two-year  note yields  were two basis points
higher at 0.45 percent.  European finance ministers earlier today agreed to give
Greece the aid it needs to avoid bankruptcy next month. The
nation signed up to a program of austerity and economic reform
aimed at slashing debt to 120.5 percent of gross domestic
product by 2020 from about 160 percent last year.  Gilts Sale  Gilts also advanced as the U.K. debt agency sold 3.75
billion pounds of index-linked bonds maturing in March 2062. The
security, sold by banks, was priced at 113.456, equivalent to a
real yield of 0.0995 percent, the Debt Management Office said
today in a statement.  U.K. government revenue exceeded spending by 7.75 billion
pounds, compared with a surplus of 5.2 billion pounds a year
earlier, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
London. The median of 10 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey
was 6.3 billion pounds. January is the biggest month of the year
for tax collection.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is refusing to
bow to pressure from opposition politicians to ease back on his
fiscal squeeze or cut taxes to promote growth when he presents
his budget next month. Moody’s Investors Service said last week
that while the U.K.’s Aaa rating was at risk from the crisis in
 Europe , the government’s commitment to  deficit reduction 
supported the top grade.  The pound fell 0.3 percent to $1.5802 after rising to
$1.5881 yesterday, the strongest since Feb. 9. Sterling gained
0.5 percent to 83.97 pence per euro.  “The package for  Greece  removes some of the market
uncertainty so that’s good in the short term,” for the euro
against the pound, said Peter Kinsella, a senior currency
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “But we think
implementation of the package is going to be fraught with
difficulties.”  Sterling has dropped 0.6 percent over the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. That extends this year’s loss to
1.3 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
