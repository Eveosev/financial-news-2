The Canadian Wheat Board said it
boosted revenue by 18 percent to C$6.071 billion ($6.01 billion)
in the year ended July 31, up from C$5.149 billion a year
earlier.  Farmers in Western Canada received payments of C$5.5
billion last year, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based Wheat Board said
in a  report  today on its website. The grain marketer exported
15.8 million metric tons of wheat, durum and barley, the fewest
shipped in six years. About 2.7 million tons of wheat, 290,000
tons of durum and 211,000 tons of malting barley were sold
domestically, the Wheat Board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
