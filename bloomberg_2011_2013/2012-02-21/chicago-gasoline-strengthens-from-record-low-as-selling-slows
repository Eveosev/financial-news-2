Chicago  gasoline rose against
futures for a third day since falling to a record low over
speculation that some refiners cut back on fuel sales.  The seller or sellers must have backed off, Steve Mosby,
vice president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in Kansas
City,  Missouri , said in a message.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  narrowed 9 cents to 31.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:34 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread reached 63.5
cents on Feb. 15. Prompt delivery rose 14.8 cents to $2.7545 a
gallon.  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, strengthened 2
cents to a discount of 10.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
