The Australian government sold A$900
million ($965 million) of inflation-linked notes at a yield of
1.37 percent, the least ever in offerings that started in 1985.  The government sold the 1.25 percent Feb. 21, 2022 notes at
a gross price of A$98.930 per A$100 face value, the Canberra-
based Australian Office of Financial Management said today in a
statement. The sale implies that investors expect the  inflation
rate  to average 2.80 percent over the lifetime of the debt, the
government funding arm said in a separate presentation to
investors.  That would be the highest so-called breakeven rate for 10-
year Australian debt since Aug. 1, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The AOFM yesterday said it planned to sell A$750 million
of the debt, also known as linkers, at a spread of six to eight
basis points to the existing 2020 inflation-linked notes. The
rate at todayâ€™s sale was six basis points higher than the 2020
yield, the AOFM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
