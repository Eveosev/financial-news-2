West Texas Intermediate oil may
reach $130 a barrel within the next six months, said John Hofmeister, founder and chief executive officer of the advocacy
group Citizens for Affordable Energy.  “Demand continues to rise in  Asia  and whether we use less
or not doesn’t matter,” Hofmeister, a former executive at  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , said in an interview on CNBC. “Price is going
up because supply can’t keep up with demand.”  U.S. oil and natural gas production has increased slightly
because of shale output, he said.  “It’s a trickle when we need a river of new supply,”
Hofmeister said.  Oil futures for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  touched $105.44 today, up $2.20 from the Feb. 17 close
and the highest price since May 5.  Hofmeister, former president of Shell Oil Co., the U.S.
unit of Royal Dutch Shell, questioned the availability of spare
production capacity maintained by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.  “I think OPEC is about maxed out,” he said during the
interview. “When people talk about spare capacity at OPEC, I
just don’t see it. I don’t see it coming through and I’m not
sure it’s there,”.  Hofmeister said Western countries will suffer economically
because of high gasoline and diesel prices by mid-year.  “The bad boys in the  Persian Gulf  are going to play
havoc,” he told CNBC. “They’d love to see the West suffer
economically. I believe by summer we will be suffering
economically. Iran is in the mix of all this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
