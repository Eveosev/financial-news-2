Swift Transportation Co. (SWFT) , the
largest truckload carrier in  North America , is seeking $874
million in term loans to refinance existing debt, according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction.  The financing will include a $674 million term loan B-2 due
in December 2017 and a $200 million term loan B-1 maturing in
December 2016, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the terms are private.  Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and  Wells Fargo & Co .
are arranging the financing for the Phoenix-based company, the
person said. Swift Transportation will host a lender call
tomorrow at 11 a.m. in  New York  to discuss the deal.  Swift is also seeking a $400 million revolving line of
credit that will be due in September 2016, the person said.  The company’s existing $874 million term loan pays interest
at 4.5 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate with a 1.5 percent minimum on the benchmark, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt was sold to investors at 99
cents on the dollar, the data shows.  David Berry, a spokesman for Swift, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  A term loan B is sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank  loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds . In a revolving credit facility, money can be
borrowed again once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
