A surplus of the largest  oil tankers 
competing to load crude at Persian Gulf ports shrank to this
month’s lowest level, a survey showed.  There are 9  percent more  very large crude carriers
available for hire over the next 30 days than there are likely
cargoes, according to a Bloomberg survey of six shipbrokers and
owners today. That was the smallest excess since Jan. 31.  The VLCC surplus reached a 14-month low of 5 percent on
Jan. 17, helped by stronger crude demand before  China ’s New
Year. The ships are  earning  $15,906 daily on the benchmark Saudi
Arabia-to-Japan voyage, according to the London-based Baltic
Exchange. That’s a decline of 29 percent from Jan. 17, its
figures show.  “March cargoes are behind schedule, so activity is
expected to pick up this week,” Oslo-based investment bank RS
Platou Markets AS said in an e-mailed report today.  Charter rates  for VLCCs, each able to haul 2 million
barrels of crude, on the benchmark route rose for an eighth
session yesterday to 54.65 Worldscale points.  The points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or flat
rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a metric ton, are revised
annually by the Worldscale Association in  London  to reflect
changing fuel costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
