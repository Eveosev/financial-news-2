The U.K., Netherlands and  Sweden 
refused to sign off the European Union’s operating budget for
2010, saying that cost overruns are unjustified at a time when
national governments are having to slash their spending.  The three northern European nations  voted against 
discharging the accounts at a meeting in Brussels today after
auditors found the error rate in the 122 billion-euro budget
($132 billion) climbed to 3.7 percent from 3.2 percent. It was
the first time Britain refused to approve the accounts.  “In these challenging times, member states should uphold
the same high standards for the EU budget as they would for
national budgets,” Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
and his Swedish and Dutch counterparts, Anders Borg and Jan De Jager, said in a joint statement. “We should remember that
national taxpayers stand behind the EU budget, and that’s why we
are calling for important and urgent improvements to the quality
of EU financial management.”  The EU approved a 2.1 percent increase in spending this
year, a smaller rise than in 2011 after governments of the 27-
nation bloc insisted on budget restraint to match domestic
austerity aimed at tackling the debt crisis. Osborne said the EU
budget should remain frozen in real terms in 2013.  This year’s budget is set at 129.1 billion euros, compared
with 126.5 billion euros last year. Almost half the EU’s budget
goes to agriculture. The other main part of the budget goes to
foster development in poorer European regions, which together
with agriculture soaks up about four-fifths of the total.  The 2012 budget is the sixth under a multi-year EU spending
program that locked in farm spending through 2013. The program
fixed total expenditure in 2007-2013 at 864 billion euros, or
1.05 percent of the region’s gross domestic product. National
spending in the EU averaged 51 percent of domestic GDP in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
