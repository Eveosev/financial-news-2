Japan has two nuclear reactors
operating as of today with capacity of 2,268 megawatts, or 4.6
percent of the total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  halted the 870-megawatt No. 3
reactor at its Takahama nuclear plant in western Japan today for
regular planned maintenance, Yusuke Inoue, a spokesman for the
utility said by phone.  Reactors have been closed for maintenance, safety checks
and stress tests following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami
that caused uranium fuel meltdowns and radiation leaks at Tokyo
Electric Power Co.â€™s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant. The shutdown of
the Takahama No. 3 reactor leaves  Kansai Electric , the Japanese
utility that relies the most on nuclear generation, with all its
atomic power plants offline.  The following table shows the status of the 54 reactors
with capacity of 48,960 megawatts operated by Japanese power
companies. Capacity figures are in megawatts.
