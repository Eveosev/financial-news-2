Ten months after the debut of the
BlackBerry PlayBook tablet computer,  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) 
released software allowing users to get built-in e-mail without
having to tether the device to a BlackBerry smartphone.  The software provides dedicated calendar and contacts
programs and lets users integrate messages from social-
networking sites, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, to their
inboxes. The product also adds “thousands” of downloadable
applications to the App World store, RIM said in a statement
today.  The lack of built-in e-mail resulted in stinging reviews
when the Playbook debuted in April, and repeated delays in
introducing the e-mail software upgrade hurt sales. RIM shipped
150,000 units in the quarter ended Nov. 26, down from 500,000 in
the quarter of their introduction, prompting RIM to book $485
million in pretax costs to write down the value of its PlayBook
inventory.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sold 15.4 million iPads in the fourth
quarter.  RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, fell 1.3 percent to $14.88
at the close in  New York . The stock has fallen 79 percent in the
past 12 months.  RIM said in October that the PlayBook OS 2.0 upgrade
wouldn’t include BlackBerry Messenger, the free instant-
messaging service that has fueled sales outside  North America .
There was no mention of Messenger in today’s statement.  The lack of BlackBerry Messenger and the need to add new
BlackBerry Mobile Fusion software to link the PlayBook to
company networks “may reduce the appeal of PlayBook among RIM’s
core markets: enterprises and BBM fans,” RBC Capital Markets
analyst  Mike Abramsky  said today in a note. He rates RIM
“sector perform.”  The upgrade includes an improved version of BlackBerry
Bridge, the software that tethered the PlayBook and BlackBerry
wirelessly, to let the smartphone act as a remote keyboard and
mouse for the tablet. The PlayBook’s virtual keyboard now also
incorporates predictive text software that anticipates what word
the user will enter next, to improve typing speed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
