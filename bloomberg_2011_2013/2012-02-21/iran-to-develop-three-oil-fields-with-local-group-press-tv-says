Iran  signed a contract valued at
$800 million with an Iranian group to develop the Kouhmond,
Boushkan and Kouhkaki oil fields, the state-run  Press TV  news
channel reported, citing Deputy Oil Minister Ahmad Qalebani.  The agreement was signed yesterday between Petroleum
Engineering and Development Co., an affiliate of the National
Iranian Oil Co., and  Inter Naft Gas Prom Pars Co.,  a Tehran-
based company with partners in Ukraine which aims to promote the
economic development of both countries, according to its
website.  The Kouhmond heavy oil field, 80 kilometers (49 miles) east
of the port city of Bushehr, in southern Iran, has reserves
estimated at 1 billion barrels, Press TV said. Kouhkaki is
northeast of Kouhmond, close to the city of Khormoj, and
contains 780 million barrels of light crude; Boushkan is 100
kilometers north of Bushehr and holds reserves estimated at 340
million barrels, according to the report.  The three fields will be developed in two phases and
produce 11,000 barrels of crude oil a day after completion of
the first phase and 22,000 after the second, Press TV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
