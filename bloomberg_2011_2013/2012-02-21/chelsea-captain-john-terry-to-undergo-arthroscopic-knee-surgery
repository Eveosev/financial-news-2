Chelsea captain  John Terry  will
undergo arthroscopic knee surgery today that may keep him out
for as long as six weeks, manager Andre Villas-Boas said.  Terry, 31, hurt his knee in last month’s F.A. Cup game
against Portsmouth. He’d missed the Blues’ last four matches,
though had been training ahead of last night’s 3-1 Champions
League defeat to Napoli in  Italy .  “Four weeks would be excellent,” Villas-Boas said in
post-match comments on Chelsea’s website. “We will have to wait
to see how the operation goes and hopefully the player can
return in that frame of time. Normally it’s four or six weeks.”  Team doctors will be able to set a timetable for his return
once the procedure is completed, Chelsea said. The Blues failed
to prevent the opposition from scoring in any of the four
matches that Terry missed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
