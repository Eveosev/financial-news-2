The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:58 a.m. Bogota time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 0.3 percent to 14,607.48, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.4 percent to 1,708.20.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA  (EEB CB),  Colombia ’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, fell 0.9 percent to
1,075 pesos.  The company said 2011 consolidated profit dropped 72
percent from a year ago to 305 billion pesos ($172 million).
That was 41 percent less than brokerage Bolsa y Renta’s
estimate, according to an e-mailed report from analysts
including Juan Camilo Martinez.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA  (ETB CB), the
phone company serving Colombia’s capital, rose 0.8 percent to
520 pesos, after earlier gaining as much as 4.7 percent.  Investors may be speculating that  Empresa de Energia de
Bogota  SA is reducing its dividend payment to save money that
will be used to subsidize ETB as part of Mayor  Gustavo Petro ’s
plan to create a holding company for the city’s public
utilities, said  Rupert Stebbings , analyst at Celfin Capital.  Fabricato SA (FABRI)  , Colombia’s biggest textile maker,
fell 1.1 percent to 89.5 pesos. The company is expected to
report that fourth-quarter profit dropped from a year ago on
higher cotton prices, Celfin said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
