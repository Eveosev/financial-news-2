Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.â€™s largest
publicly traded owner of industrial properties, said full-year
earnings excluding items rose 8.4 percent as the company reduced
vacancies and costs.  Profit excluding changes in property values and one-time
items rose to 136.6 million pounds ($216 million), or 18.4 pence
a share, from 126 million pounds, or 17.1 pence, a year earlier,
the Slough, England-based company said in a statement today. Net
asset value declined 9.8 percent from six months earlier to 340
pence a share, Segro said.  Earnings exceeded the 17.5 pence a share  average estimate 
of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer
David Sleath plans to sell 1.6 billion pounds of real estate to
help reduce debt and focus the company on more profitable
properties close to major transportation hubs or large cities
across Europe.  Segro gained 5.9 pence, or 2.5 percent, to 236.7 pence in
 London  yesterday. The shares are the second-best performer of
the 11 stocks forming the  FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust (F3REITS) 
Index, advancing more than 13 percent this year compared with an
8.9 percent gain for the index as a whole.  Segro sold five industrial estates in southern England to
funds run by Ignis Asset Management for 80.2 million pounds,
according to a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
