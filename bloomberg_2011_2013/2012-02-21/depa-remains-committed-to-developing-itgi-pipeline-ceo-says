Greek gas supplier  Depa SA  is
convinced that the  Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy  pipeline
is the best solution for transporting Caspian Sea gas to  Europe ,
Harry Sachinis, Depa chairman and chief executive officer said.  “The ITGI project presents the best solution for the
opening of the Southern Gas Corridor and for  Azerbaijan , or
other gas producing countries, to export their gas to Europe,”
Sachinis said today in an e-mailed statement.  The group of companies developing the second phase of the
Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan ruled out yesterday using ITGI
for transferring gas to the EU. The group comprises  BP Plc (BP/) ,
Socar,  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Total SA (FP) ,  OAO Lukoil (LKOH) , Naftiran Intertrade
and  Turkiye Petrolleri AO. (TUPRS)   “We understand that this is just a provisional decision,”
Sachinis said in the e-mail.  ITGI is “the most advanced” of the gas pipeline projects
entering the European Union by its south-eastern borders and is
“the only one” with all the necessary permits and agreements
in place, and Depa remains committed to continuing its
development, Sachinis said.  ITGI is a venture of Depa and  Italy ’s  Edison Spa. (EDN)  Both the
Italian and Greek governments yesterday reiterated their support
for the project which they said also has the potential to
furnish the European market with natural gas from the  Middle
East  and eastern Mediterranean regions where Cyprus and  Israel 
have recently discovered gas deposits.  Earlier the Greek newspaper Imerisia reported that Depa may
buy a stake of as much as 15 percent in the Trans-Adriatic
Pipeline venture, citing unidentified people in the Greek Energy
Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
