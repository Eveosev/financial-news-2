Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group
Inc. (DTG) , the car-rental company that was the target of bidding by
two competitors, delayed by one year the expiration of a
shareholder provision intended to prevent a hostile takeover.  Dollar Thrifty’s shareholder rights plan will expire May
30, 2013, the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company said today in a
statement. No changes were made to the plan implemented May 18,
which allows other shareholders to buy Dollar Thrifty at a 50
percent discount if an investor acquired at least 20 percent of
the shares or adds to an existing 20 percent holding without
board approval.  Dollar Thrifty, the fourth-largest U.S. car-rental company,
said in October it planned to operate independently after being
the target of bidding by  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  and  Avis
Budget Group Inc. (CAR)  The company said Feb. 9 it completed a $100
million stock-repurchase agreement, buying 1.45 million shares
at an average price of about $68.91.  “Our board believes that it would be imprudent and
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties not to maintain the
protections of the rights plan as we monitor the actions of our
competitors,”  Scott Thompson , Dollar Thrifty’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement. “The scarcity value of our
long-established brands, unleveraged capital position and cash
rich balance sheet requires protection.”  Dollar Thrifty  rose  2.3 percent to $75.05 at 9:47 a.m. New
York time. The shares gained 4.4 percent this year through Feb.
17.  The company separately reported that fourth-quarter net
income more than doubled to $33.9 million, or $1.08 a share,
from $12.5 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier.  Excluding costs its considers one-time items,  Dollar
Thrifty  reported a profit of $1.09 a share. The average estimate
of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 75
cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
