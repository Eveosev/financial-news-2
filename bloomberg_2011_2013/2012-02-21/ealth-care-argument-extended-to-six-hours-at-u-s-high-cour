The U.S. Supreme Court extended next
month’s argument over President Barack Obama’s health-care law
to six hours, adding 30 minutes to what was already the longest
session in decades.  Responding to a request from both sides, the justices today
scheduled an extra half-hour for the first day of arguments,
which will run from March 26 to 28.  The first day will center on the Anti-Injunction Act, a law
that one federal appeals court concluded prevents judges from
ruling until 2015 on the central issue in the dispute: the
requirement that Americans either buy insurance or pay a
penalty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
