Iran  approved 3,444 candidates, or
about 70 percent of those who registered, to run in next month’s
parliamentary elections, the first time Iranians will vote since
the disputed contest in 2009 that led to days of mass protests.  The Guardian Council, which supervises the vote, “has
approved any would-be-candidates whose situation was in line
with the law,” Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, a spokesman for the
council said today, according to the official  Islamic Republic
News Agency . Candidates will be able to begin campaigning on
Feb. 23, IRNA said.  The re-election of  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  as president in June
2009 led to allegations of fraud that brought millions onto the
streets in protest and prompted a violent crackdown by security
forces. This year’s vote will pit backers of Ahmadinejad against
his opponents, some of whom accuse the president of questioning
the authority of Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .  The elections take place with Iran under increasing
pressure from international sanctions over its nuclear program.
The punitive measures have contributed to a drop in the value of
Iran’s national currency, the rial, and an increase in the price
of  consumer goods .  To contact the reporter on this story:
