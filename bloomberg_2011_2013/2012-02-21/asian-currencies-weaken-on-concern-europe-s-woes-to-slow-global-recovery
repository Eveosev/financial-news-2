Asian currencies snapped a two-day
advance on concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will damp
demand for exports and slow a global recovery.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell the most in a
week after Taiwan’s overseas shipments dropped more than
predicted last month and economists forecast that data this week
will show  Singapore ’s industrial output shrank for a second time
in three months. Asian stocks retreated from a six-month high on
concern  Greece ’s debt crisis will persist even after a second
bailout.  “There are still lingering concerns emanating from
Europe,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a currency trader at
Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  Indonesia’s rupiah slipped 0.3 percent to 9,050 per dollar
in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The Philippine peso dropped 0.2 percent to 42.645 and
the ringgit was little changed at 3.0250.  European finance ministers approved 130 billion euros ($172
billion) in aid for Greece by tapping into European Central Bank
profits and coaxing investors into providing more debt relief to
shield the region from a default. Greece’s debt may still
balloon to 160 percent of gross domestic product in a worst-case
scenario, analysis by the  International Monetary Fund  and
European officials indicated.  Consumer Prices  An agreement “doesn’t really mean the Greek problem will
be fundamentally solved,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at
the Japan Center for Economic Research in  Tokyo .  The rupiah slid for the first time in three days after
finance ministry data showed global funds sold 3.3 trillion
rupiah ($365 million) more Indonesian bonds than they bought
last week.  The ringgit slipped from a one-week high before the
government unveils inflation data for January tomorrow. Consumer
prices rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier, the least in a
year, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.568 per
dollar after a government report yesterday showed the island’s
exports fell 8.6 percent in January, compared with economists’
forecast for a 4.8 percent drop.  Elsewhere, Singapore’s dollar slumped 0.4 percent to
S$1.2565, and the  Thai baht  declined 0.1 percent to 30.76.
 China ’s yuan gained 0.1 percent to 6.2964, Vietnam’s dong gained
0.8 percent to 20,868, and South Korea’s won rose 0.1 percent to
1,122.70 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
