Thermal coal at Qinhuangdao,  China ’s
biggest delivery port for the fuel, will extend declines in the
next two years as production outpaces demand and transport
constraints ease, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said.  Prices may fall 5 percent this year and another 10 percent
in 2013,  Michael Parker , an analyst based in  Hong Kong  said in a
report today. The decline will also occur as China’s 2012 coal
production growth of 6.6 percent outpaces demand increases of 5
percent, the note shows. This continues in 2013 as consumption
changes slow to a gain of 4.2 percent amid an output expansion
of 6.1 percent.  China is expected to add about 11,000 kilometers (6,800
miles) of coal-dedicated railroads between 2011 and 2014,
raising transport capacity by 1.3 billion metric tons by 2015,
according to the report. Trains will be able to carry 334
million tons more this year than in 2011, an increase of 15
percent, the analyst wrote.  “Transport costs will decline as transport by truck is
reduced,” said Parker. “This level of growth will exceed
domestic coal production growth and will result in a continuing
truck-to-rail transition, creating further downward pressure on
coal prices.”  The spread between coal prices at Qinhuangdao and mine-
mouth rates in the northern Shanxi province has fallen 41
percent over the past two years, and 25 percent for  Inner
Mongolia , according to the report.  “This drop in the price spread is indicative of declining
transportation costs,” wrote Parker.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
