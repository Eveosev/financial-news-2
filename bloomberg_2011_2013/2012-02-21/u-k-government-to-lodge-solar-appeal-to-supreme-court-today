The U.K. government plans to lodge
an appeal today against two court rulings that said its early
cuts to solar subsidies were unlawful, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Energy and Climate Change said by phone.  The government in December lost a case against Solarcentury
Holdings Ltd., Homesun Ltd. and the environmental group Friends
of the Earth after seeking to bring in subsidy cuts on Dec. 12.
It lost an appeal last month, and said then that it will bring
in the reductions on March 3 if it fails in a bid to overturn
those rulings.  “If we are lucky this is just a cynical exercise to limit
the market to 3rd March and they will withdraw in a few
weeks,” Solarcentury Chairman Jeremy Leggett said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The government has until 4:30 p.m. tomorrow to file papers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
