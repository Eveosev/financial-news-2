Eiffage SA (FGR) , France’s third-largest
construction company, signed 3.5 billion euros ($4.6 billion) of
loans to refinance debt backing the 2006 acquisition of French
motorway network Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhone.  The five-year financing was split between a 720 million-
euro revolving credit obtained by APRR that pays an interest
margin of 150 basis points more than the euro interbank offered
rate, and a 2.8 billion-euro structured credit term loan for the
company’s Eiffarie unit paying 300 basis points more than
Euribor, according to an e-mailed statement from the company and
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The revolving credit will replace APRR’s existing 1.8
billion-euro undrawn facility maturing in February 2013, the
Asnieres Sur Seine-based company said. Eiffarie will use
proceeds from the  term loan  to help refinance about 3.8 billion
euros of debt due the same month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again once it’s
been repaid. APRR, rated at the lowest investment grade BBB- by
 Standard & Poor’s , has sold about 2.6 billion euros of bonds
since January 2011, according to Bloomberg data. It issued 500
million euros of 2018 bonds last month at spread of 415.5 basis
points above German government debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
