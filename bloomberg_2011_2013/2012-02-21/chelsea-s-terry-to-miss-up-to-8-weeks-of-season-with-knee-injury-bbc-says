Chelsea captain  John Terry  may miss
as long as two months with a knee injury, the British
Broadcasting Corp. said on its  website .  Terry will have surgery, which may sidelined him until
April, the  BBC  said, without saying where it got the
information.  The defender hurt his knee in last month’s F.A. Cup third-
round game against Portsmouth. He’d missed the Blues’ last four
matches but had been training ahead of tonight’s  Champions
League  round-of-16 opener against Napoli in  Italy .  In addition the Champions League, Terry would also miss a
possible F.A. Cup quarterfinal,  England ’s international
exhibition match against the Netherlands and Premier League
matches if sidelined for two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
