Soybeans rallied to the highest
level in five months after the U.S. said last week that
exporters sold 2.92 million metric tons to  China , the biggest
one-day deal on record. Corn and wheat gained.  The May-delivery contract rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$12.8025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
price for the most-active contract since Sept. 23. The oilseed
traded at $12.7575 at 12:04 p.m. in  Singapore .  The deal with China includes 2.75 million tons for delivery
in the year that begins Sept. 1 and 173,000 tons before Aug. 31,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Feb. 17. China agreed to
buy a total of 13.4 million tons (492.3 million bushels) in
contracts signed last week in Iowa and California, the U.S.
Soybean Export Council said Feb. 17.  “Last week’s large soybean-supply agreement between the
U.S. and China continues to provide underlying support to the
oilseed complex,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in an e-mail today.  Commodities from grains to metals to oil advanced after a
European Union official said euro area finance ministers reached
an agreement on a second bailout package for  Greece  that’s aimed
to stave off a default next month.  Corn for May delivery rose 0.2 percent to $6.4625 per
bushel, while wheat for delivery in the same month added 0.1
percent to $6.485 per bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
