Shandong Helon Co. (000677) , the fiber maker
that was  China ’s first company to lose its investment-grade
credit rating, said its Xinjiang unit reached an agreement to
repay debts to Xinjiang Talimu Agriculture Development by
handing over power plants and land.  The two plants, each with capacity of 15 megawatts, and the
land they were built on will be used to repay 253 million yuan
($40 million) of borrowings, Shandong Helon said in a statement
to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange today. The assets will be valued
by an independent asset appraisal institute and the unit will
pay the balance with cash if they are priced at less than 253
million yuan, it said.  China Lianhe  Credit Rating  Co. downgraded its long-term
rating on Shandong Helon to CCC from BB+, according to a
statement posted on Chinabond website on Feb. 15, after cutting
the grade four steps in December. The company has 400 million
yuan of bonds coming due in April, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shares of Shandong Helon have been suspended since August
when the company said it had discovered a matter that may have a
“relatively large” impact on its stock price and which hadn’t
been disclosed. The company said in June the securities
regulator had started investigating company on suspicion of
violating the  securities law .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
