Indonesia ’s rupiah pared losses
after European leaders agreed on a second bailout for Greece.
Bonds declined.  The benchmark stock index rallied 0.6 percent as the 130-
billion euro ($172 million) rescue package, which will enable
Greece to meet March bond repayments, was announced today. Many
Indonesian corporates are buying dollars at the moment,
weakening the rupiah, according to Enrico Tanuwidjaja, a
Singapore-based senior currency analyst at Malayan Banking Bhd.  “There’s some support to the rupiah after the Greek
deal,” said Aris Setiawan, a foreign-exchange trader at PT
Rabobank International Indonesia in Jakarta. “But the local
demand for dollars is still significant. I’ve had a few clients
wanting to buy dollars today.”  The rupiah declined 0.3 percent to 9,052 per dollar as of
4:38 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell as much as 0.6 percent
earlier. The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May
2022 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.26
percent, according to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  Global funds  sold  3.3 trillion rupiah ($365 million) more
local securities than they bought last week, bringing total
foreign holdings to 232.4 trillion rupiah as of Feb. 17,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on the
government’s benchmark 10-year notes climbed 22 basis points
since Feb. 9, when  Bank Indonesia  cut its benchmark  reference
rate  by 25 basis points to 5.75 percent.  “Bond markets are consolidating,” Tanuwidjaja said. The
rise in the 10-year yield “could drive an outflow of funds,”
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
