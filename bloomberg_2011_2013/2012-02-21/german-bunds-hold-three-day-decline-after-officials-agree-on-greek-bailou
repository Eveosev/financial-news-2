Italian and Spanish bonds rose for a
fourth day after European finance ministers agreed on a second
bailout for  Greece , spurring optimism the euro-area debt crisis
will be contained.  The extra yield investors demand to hold  Italy ’s 10-year
debt instead of German bunds shrank to the lowest since
September after Greece won 130 billion euros ($172 billion) in
aid following overnight talks in Brussels. German two-year note
yields reached to the highest level in two months as demand for
the region’s safest assets waned. Spain and the European
Financial Stability Facility sold bills.  “Spain and Italy had the most to lose from a contagion
effect if things had gone wrong, so they are the ones seeing the
most relief,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at
WestLB AG in  London . “To a large degree, a resolution in Greece
was priced in so anything we see that’s positive today will be
more of a sigh of relief than a shout of joy.”  The Italian  10-year (GBTPGR10)  yield dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 5.44 percent at 4:33 p.m. London time
after falling to 5.36 percent, the lowest since Sept. 9. The 5
percent bond due March 2022 climbed 0.3, or 3 euros per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 97.19.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of bunds narrowed six basis points to 346 basis points
after shrinking to 337 basis points, the least since Sept. 8.  Spain ’s 10-year  yield  declined five basis points to 5.11
percent, with the spread over bunds falling to as little as 308
basis points, the narrowest since Feb. 8.  Saving Europe  The assistance for Greece brings to at least 386 billion
euros the amount spent or committed to save the nation along
with Ireland and  Portugal  from bankruptcy, and to insulate
 Europe  from the financial crisis. Concern the turmoil would
spread pushed Italian and Spanish 10-year bond yields to euro-
era highs last year.  “The Greece deal looks comprehensive, reasonable, of
course, and seems to be richer in detail than the European Union
summit results, implying a lower risk of market
disappointment,” said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income
strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “I expect an
only moderate bond-market reaction, with bunds lower and
peripheral bonds firmer.”  Greek Writedown  Investors will forgive 53.5 percent of their principal and
exchange their remaining holdings for new Greek bonds and notes
from the EFSF, the International Institute of Finance, which
represented bondholders, said in a statement.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose one basis point to 1.97
percent. Germany’s two-year yield was little changed at 0.26
percent after rising to 0.29 percent, the highest since Dec. 15.  The Greek benchmark October 2022 bond gained, with the
yield dropping 42 basis points to 33.42 percent and the price
climbing to 21.28 percent of face value.  Greece will enjoy economic growth now the rescue package
has been approved, said  Charles Dallara , IIF managing director.  “It rarely happens that there is not a rebound for at
least a period of 18 to 24 months,” he said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview in Brussels. “I’m quite
optimistic there will be a rebound, and it may catch all of us
by surprise.”  Portugal’s 10-year  bonds  fell, with the yield rising 18
basis points to 12.43 percent.  Spanish Auction  Spain sold three-month bills at an average yield of 0.396
percent, versus 1.285 percent at the  previous auction  of the
maturity on Jan. 24. It sold six-month securities at 0.764
percent, compared with 1.847 percent at the previous auction.  The nation’s borrowing costs have declined since the
 European Central Bank  lent the region’s banks 489 billion euros
of three-year loans on Dec. 21. The ECB is planning a similar
longer-term refinancing operation on Feb. 29.  “It was obviously a very strong result” at the auction,
said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “It could still be LTRO-related flow
or positioning for the next one, perhaps. There hasn’t been a
massive risk-on move today, which this result would imply, so it
suggests other factors are at work.”  The EFSF sold 1.99 billion euros of 182-day bills at an
average yield of 0.19 percent. Investors bid for 3.12 times the
securities on offer.  German bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.6 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds gained 9.3 percent and Greek bonds dropped 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
