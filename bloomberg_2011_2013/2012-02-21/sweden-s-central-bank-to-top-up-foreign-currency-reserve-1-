Sweden ’s central bank said it has
decided to borrow the equivalent of 10 billion kronor ($1.5
billion) in foreign currency through the Debt Office to restore
reserves.  Participation in loan arrangements from the  International
Monetary Fund  in recent years has entailed the use of funds from
the foreign currency reserve, the Stockholm-based bank said in a
statement.  “During the financial crisis, the Riksbank decided to
reinforce the foreign-currency reserve by borrowing foreign
currency to the value of 100 billion kronor,” Riksbank said.
“At year-end 2011, these loans amounted to 86.7 billion
kronor.”  The krona was little changed against the euro at 8.815 as
of 4:36 p.m. in Stockholm.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
