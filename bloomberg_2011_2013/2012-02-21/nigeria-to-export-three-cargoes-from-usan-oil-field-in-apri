Nigeria  will export three cargoes
from the new Usan field in April, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Total SA (FP) , the operator of the field and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
will receive one shipment each, while Glencore International Plc
will get one lot from state-owned Nigeria National Petroleum
Co., the plan shows. The consignments are 950,000 barrels each.  The deepwater field is scheduled to start output this year
and produce 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at its peak,
Guy Maurice, head of Totalâ€™s Nigerian unit, said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
