Foreign banks operating in  India 
should be required to offer as much as 40 percent of their loans
to small companies and exporters, a committee set up by the
banking regulator recommended today.  The overseas banks must provide at least 32 percent of the
loans to so-called priority sectors, including agriculture, the
committee said in a statement. Their Indian competitors already
face a 40 percent requirement.  The proposal is an attempt to ensure credit to sectors that
generate jobs, according to the report by a committee headed by
M.V. Nair, chairman of  Union Bank of India .  Thirty-seven 
overseas banks led by Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc had a
combined market share of  5.1 percent  of total lending, data
published by the  Reserve Bank  of India show.  “This move will put pressure on the profitability and
asset quality of foreign banks operating in India,” said Nitin Kumar, banking analyst at Quant Broking Pvt., a Mumbai-based
brokerage. “It is not a very profitable business and the
foreign banks will struggle to meet the target.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
