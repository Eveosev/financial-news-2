Christian Meissner, head of  Bank of
America Corp .’s corporate-finance and investment-banking
businesses, said banks will have to content themselves with
pretax margins of 10 percent to 15 percent,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing an interview.  Lenders may have to accept margins of 8 percent to 10
percent during certain times and for certain parts of their
operations, he said, according to the newspaper.  Investment-banking activities may migrate to  Asia  from
 Europe  in the longer term because of tougher regulation,
Meissner was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
