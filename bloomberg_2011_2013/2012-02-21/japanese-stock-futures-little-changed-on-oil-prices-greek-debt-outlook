Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed and Australian equities slipped as oil rose while
investors warned Greece will soon violate the terms of its
second bailout.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese
camera maker that gets 31 percent of its sales in Europe, slid
0.3 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, lost 0.6
percent after bellwether Dell Inc. forecast first-quarter
revenue that missed analysts’ estimates, citing lackluster
demand for personal computers and competition from Apple Inc.
Medusa Mining Ltd., an Australian gold explorer, fell 3.6
percent in Sydney after reporting first-half profit slumped.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 9,480 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,490
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,470 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200  Index (CRY) 
slipped 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.5
percent in Wellington.  “Even though  Greece  got the latest bailout, there are
still a lot of hurdles to face,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-
based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.,
which has almost $100 billion under management. “The main
driver for strength in recent times has been monetary easing
around the globe or good economic data, and last night was
pretty quiet on that front.”  Greek Outlook  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index added less than 0.1 percent in New York
yesterday, when European finance ministers approved a 130
billion euro ($172 billion) bailout for Greece to avoid a March
bankruptcy. Even with investors and central bankers chipping in
to relieve the debt burden, economists from Citigroup Inc. to
Commerzbank AG concluded Greece may again fail to deliver amid a
fifth year of recession, looming elections and social unrest.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 12 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.3 percent advance by the
S&P 500 and a 9.1 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.7 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese equities traded in the U.S. slipped the most in two
weeks on speculation a second reduction in banks’ reserve
requirements in two months won’t be enough to bolster credit in
the world’s second-largest economy. The Bloomberg China-US 55
Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. sank 2
percent to 106.66 yesterday in New York, the biggest drop since
Feb. 6.  Crude oil for March delivery gained 2.5 percent to $105.84
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since May 4. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index (CRY) 
of raw materials added 1.6 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
