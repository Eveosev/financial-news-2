Vitro SAB (VITROA) , the Mexican glassmaker
that defaulted on $1.5 billion of bonds in 2009, rose to the
strongest level since June 2008 as the company moves ahead with
its restructuring plan.  Vitro rose 8.4 percent to 17.34 pesos at the close in
Mexico City, posting its fifth straight day of gains. It has
soared 20 percent since Feb. 14. Today was stock’s highest
closing level since June 30, 2008.  The company said on Feb. 7 that a Mexican judge gave
approval for it to restructure defaulted debt over the
objections of U.S. creditors who said it was unfair for $1.9
billion of intercompany loans that Vitro created after the
default to be included in a vote on the refinancing plan.
Noteholders, including Elliott Management Corp., had argued that
the inclusion of intercompany debt let Vitro dictate terms.  The stock is rising after some of the lawsuits the company
faced “turned out positive,” Leon Cabrera, a trader at CI Casa
de Bolsa, said by phone from  Mexico  City.  The refinancing plan for the company based in San Pedro
Garza Garcia, Mexico, swaps the defaulted debt for $814.6
million of new bonds maturing in 2019 with an interest rate of 8
percent and $95.8 million of debt convertible to shares with a
12 percent rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
