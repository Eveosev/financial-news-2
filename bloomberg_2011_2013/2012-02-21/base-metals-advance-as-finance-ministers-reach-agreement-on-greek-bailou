Copper rose for a second day as
European governments agreed on a second bailout for  Greece .
Zinc, lead and nickel advanced.  Three-month copper climbed as much as 1.6 percent to
$8,364.75 a metric ton and traded at $8,350 by 3 p.m. Shanghai
time. May-delivery copper on the Comex gained 2.2 percent to
$3.7965 a pound, while the most-active contract on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange closed 1.2 percent higher at 60,050 yuan
($9,535) a ton.  Greece won a second bailout after European governments as
finance ministers awarded 130 billion euros ($173 billion) in
aid, engineered the central-bank profits transfer and coaxed
investors into providing more debt relief in an exchange offer
meant to tide Greece past a bond redemption next month.  “The news boosted sentiment, leading to a broad market
rally as the euro advanced,” said  Li Ye , an analyst at Shanghai
Jiuheng Futures Co. “We may see a choppy trading day ahead with
further news coming out of  Europe .”  The euro climbed to a three-month high against the yen and
reversed losses versus the dollar. The greenback declined
against most of its 16 major counterparts.  Refined copper imports by China fell 18 percent to 335,480
tons in January from a record in December, the first decline in
eight months, data from the General Administration of Customs
showed today.  On the LME, aluminum rose 1 percent to $2,201.75 a ton,
zinc gained 1.7 percent to $2,015 a ton and lead climbed 1.7
percent to $2,085.25 a ton. Nickel advanced 1.3 percent to
$20,010 a ton and tin rose 2.1 percent to $24,000 a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
