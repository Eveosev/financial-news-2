Pandora A/S (PNDORA)  fell the most in six
months in Copenhagen trading as the Nordic region’s biggest
jewelry maker offered retailers the option of returning products
that don’t sell.  Pandora fell as much as 12 percent, the most since Aug. 2,
making it today’s  second-biggest loser  in the Copenhagen all-
share index. The stock of the Glostrup, Denmark-based company
retreated 2.7 kroner to 82.30 kroner at 9:47 a.m. in the Danish
capital.  The  shares plunged  84 percent last year, when the company
cut its sales growth forecast to zero, sacked its chief
executive officer and dropped out of  Denmark ’s blue-chip index.
Pandora was reported to the police in January for failing to
publish price-sensitive information in a timely manner. The
company said today it will spend as much as 800 million kroner
($143 million) to swap retailers’ old jewelry for better selling
products, a decision that will contribute to a 10 percent
decline in sales this year.  “Inventory adjustments are hampering the outlook, which is
pushing the stock down,” Ole Kjaer Jensen, chief share trader
at Sydbank A/S, said by phone. “The report was actually descent
as the company is making a good profit.”  Pandora reported 2011 net income of 2.04 billion kroner,
beating the median estimate of 1.83 billion kroner in a
Bloomberg survey of eight analysts. Pandora said it expects to
generate 2012 sales of about 6 billion kroner, which missed the
average estimate of 6.66 billion kroner in the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
