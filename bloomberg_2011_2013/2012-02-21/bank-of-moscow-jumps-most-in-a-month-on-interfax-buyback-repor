Bank of Moscow , the lender that
received  Russia ’s biggest state bailout last year, jumped the
most in more than a month after Interfax reported VTB Group may
buy back shares in the company from retail holders.  VTB may offer 1,108.65 rubles per share in the buyback,
Interfax said, citing Ekaterina Petelina, a board member at VTB.
Bank of Moscow’s stock rose 4.9 percent to 970.70 rubles at the
close in Moscow, the biggest daily advance since Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
