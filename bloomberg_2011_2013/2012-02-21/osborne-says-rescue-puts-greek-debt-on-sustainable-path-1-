U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  welcomed a euro-area agreement on a second
bailout for Greece that he said puts the country’s debt load on
a sustainable path.  After 13 1/2 hours of talks in Brussels that ended early
today, euro-region finance ministers awarded 130 billion euros
($173 billion) in aid, engineered a central-bank profits
transfer and coaxed investors into providing more debt relief in
an exchange meant to tide Greece past a March bond repayment.  “Last night’s developments were very encouraging for the
whole European economy,” Osborne told reporters today before a
meeting of European Union finance chiefs in the Belgian capital.
“We have Greece taking some very difficult decisions to face up
to its debts as other countries like Britain are having to deal
with their debts. We have got the euro zone collectively
standing behind their currency, which is something that Britain
has urged them to do all along.”  Osborne said the agreement is good for Britain, “because
resolving the euro zone crisis is the biggest boon Britain could
get for its economy this year.”  The Greeks must now deliver on their promises made to
secure the rescue, Osborne said, “but I don’t think  Greece  has
any other option.”  The bailout package signaled the euro area’s willingness to
support the single currency and Greece. “Hopefully we can all
move on now and get the European economy growing,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
