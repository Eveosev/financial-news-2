Azerbaijan ’s Ministry of National
Security said it uncovered a terrorist group with ties to Iran’s
Revolutionary Guards Corps, or Sepah, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah,
state television channel AzTV reported.  The authorities have detained an unspecified number of the
group’s members, who’d acquired weapons and explosives and were
planning attacks against the Israeli embassy and a Jewish
cultural center in Baku, the Caspian Sea nation’s capital, AzTV
said today. They had also collected intelligence for Sepah, it
added. The U.S. deems Sepah and Hezbollah as terrorist
organizations.  Azerbaijan’s ties to  Israel  and the U.S. have stoked
tensions with Iran, which protested alleged Israeli intelligence
activity in the oil-rich former Soviet republic, the state-run
Iranian Students News Agency reported Feb. 13. Azerbaijan said
last month it thwarted a terrorist plot against the Israeli
ambassador in Baku by a group linked to  Iran .  The outlawed Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, which authorities
say has links to Iran, said in a statement yesterday that nearly
20 of its members had been arrested in the last few days. Azeri
police also detained a journalist who was working for Iranian
state television and the Fars news agency after he was found in
possession of drugs, according to an Interior Ministry statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
