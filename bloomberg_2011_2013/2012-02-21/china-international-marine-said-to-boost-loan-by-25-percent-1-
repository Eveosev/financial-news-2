China International Marine

person familiar with the matter.  The loan was arranged by HSBC Holdings Plc, ING Groep NV
and Standard Chartered Plc, and is expected to be signed on Feb.
23, said the person, who declined to be identified because the

Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, E Sun Commercial Bank, First Commercial Bank Co.,
