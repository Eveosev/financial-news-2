Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services chief, will discuss banker bonuses with U.S.
regulators during a visit to the country this week.  The talks may also cover the implementation of bank capital
rules agreed to by the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ,
and regulation of financial derivatives, the European Commission
said in an e-mailed statement.  The Commission has said that it’s weighing tougher rules on
banker pay in response to awards which Barnier has said lack
“all reason, common sense and morality. The Frenchman will meet
regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  and
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  during his two-day visit,
which begins on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
