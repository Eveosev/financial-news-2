Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S.
cable company, will debut a service streaming television shows
and movies to current customers that competes with Internet and
video rivals.  Xfinity Streampix, available Feb. 23, complements the
75,000 shows and films Comcast already offers consumers that
subscribe to both TV and Internet service through Xfinity On
Demand, according to an e-mailed statement. For some users,
including those that don’t purchase broadband from Comcast, the
package will cost an additional $4.99 per month.  “This is about adding value to our existing multi-channel
subscription,” Marcien Jenckes, general manager of video
services at Philadelphia-based Comcast, said in a telephone
interview today. There are no plans to offer the service to non-
customers, he said.  The cable provider has licensing agreements with companies
including  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ,  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s Sony Pictures and  Time
Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s  Warner Bros . to offer the new service.  Comcast fell 0.3 percent to $29.07 at 1:22 p.m. New York
time. The shares rose 23 percent before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
