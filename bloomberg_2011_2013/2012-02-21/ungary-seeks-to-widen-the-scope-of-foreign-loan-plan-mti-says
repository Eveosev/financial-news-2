Hungarian ruling party lawmaker
Antal Rogan proposed that all foreign-currency mortgage holders
with a maximum loan of 30 million forint ($138,722) be allowed
to temporarily service their debt at lower exchange rates, state
news service  MTI  said.  Initially, only debtors whose property value was under 30
million forint at the time they took out the mortgage were
allowed to take part in the program, MTI said. Lawmakers are
currently debating the plan, the news service said.  The government and local banks agreed in December to share
foreign-currency mortgage losses by allowing debtors to repay
their loans at below-market exchange rates for five years, MTI
said.  *  To contact the reporter on this story:
