Wienerberger AG (WIE)  fell in Vienna
trading after the world’s biggest brickmaker’s 2011 net income
missed analyst estimates, even as the company returned to profit
after two years of losses.  Shares  declined  1.7 percent to 9.325 euros at the 5:30
close of trading in the Austrian capital, the biggest decline
since Feb. 10.  The manufacturer had net income of 9 million euros ($12
million euros), compared to a loss of 67 million euros a year
earlier, according to the Vienna-based company’s Chief Executive
Officer Heimo Scheuch. It was expected to report a profit of
11.8 million euros, according to the  average estimate  of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales increased 16 percent to 2 billion euros and operating
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
rose 23 percent to 258.6 million euros, on the higher end of
Wienerberger’s predicted 250 million euro to 260 million euro
range.  The brickmaker, which has 232 plants in Europe and  North
America , closed five plants and mothballed another six last year
in the U.S., the U.K.,  Belgium  and the former  Yugoslavia  to
counter weaker demand in Europe and North America. Total plant
utilization increased to 65 percent from 60 percent. The company
is expanding its offering and last week bought the 50 percent in
plastic-pipe-systems maker Pipelife it didn’t already own from
Solvay SA for 162 million euros.  Wienerberger proposed a  dividend  of 0.12 euros a share,
beating the estimate by Bloomberg research and analysis, after a
0.10 euro dividend last year.  The brickmaker predicts a profit this year and has a mid-
term operating Ebitda goal of 500 million euros in 2014 or 2015,
the CEO said. Wienerberger didn’t provide a 2012 forecast
because of “limited visibility” in eastern  Europe  and the
U.S., it said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
