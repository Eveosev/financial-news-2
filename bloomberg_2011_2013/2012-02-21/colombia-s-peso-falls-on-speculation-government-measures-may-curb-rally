Colombia ’s peso fell on speculation
the government may announce new measures to curb a rally that
has made the currency among the best performers in  emerging
markets .  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 1,776.25 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:56 a.m. Bogota time. It touched 1,770 on Feb. 9, its
strongest intraday level since August. The peso has jumped 8.4
percent in the past three months, the second-most among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after the
 Mexican peso .  “What we have now is some uncertainty over whether the
government will take more measures to control the peso,” said
 Camilo Perez , analyst at Banco de Bogota.  The central bank began on Feb. 6 to buy a minimum of $20
million daily in the  currency market , which is scheduled to
continue for at least three months. The bank’s co-director Juan Jose Echavarria told reporters Feb. 15 that the bank would like
to see a weaker peso.  The bank’s dollar purchases have yet to weaken the peso as
foreign direct investment flows continue to grow, Perez said.  Foreign direct investment into Colombia may rise to $16
billion this year, from a record $14.5 billion last year, Trade
Minister Sergio Diaz said Feb. 9 in Bogota. Foreign direct
investment in January reached $1.6 billion, the second-biggest
monthly flow in at least 12 years, according to statistics on
the central bank’s Web site.  Colombia’s exports rose 43 percent to $5.5 billion in
December from the same month a year before, the national
statistics agency reported on its Web site Feb. 16.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
increased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.39
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.185 centavo to 120.633 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
