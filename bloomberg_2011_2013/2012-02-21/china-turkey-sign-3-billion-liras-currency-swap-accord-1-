China  and  Turkey  signed a three-year
currency swap agreement worth 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion), or
3 billion liras, the Turkish central bank said.  The accord signed with the People’s Bank of China will
facilitate bilateral trade in the Turkish and Chinese currencies
and may be extended, the central bank in Ankara said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  China has been expanding currency-swap agreements as it
promotes the international use of the yuan. The nation last
month signed a 35 billion yuan currency swap with the United
Arab Emirates, and in December entered a 70 billion yuan, three-
year deal with Thailand.  Turkey and China are holding “advanced” talks on currency
swaps that would enable the two countries to trade in their
local currencies, Turkish central bank Governor Erdem Basci said
in Istanbul on Sept. 28.  The agreement was announced during a visit to Turkey by
China’s Vice President  Xi Jinping , who held talks with Turkish
President Abdullah Gul in Ankara yesterday.  Xi called on the international community to let countries
in West Asia to solve their domestic unrest by themselves, with
diplomatic mediation by other countries, China’s official Xinhua
News Agency reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
