That was 41 percent less than brokerage Bolsa y Renta’s

fibers producer, rose 9.8 percent to 9.33 pesos. The shares have
fallen 33 percent in the past year.  “It’s one of  Colombia ’s most punished stocks and now
investors are taking advantage of a good moment in the market to
buy something more speculative that could give them short-term
returns,” said Santiago Melo, an analyst at Alianza Valores SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
