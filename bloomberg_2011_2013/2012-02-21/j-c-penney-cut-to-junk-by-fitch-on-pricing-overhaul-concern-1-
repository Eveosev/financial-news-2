J.C. Penney Co.’s  debt  was
downgraded to speculative grade by  Fitch Ratings  on concern that
the retailer’s overhaul of pricing and reduction of promotions
will fail to lure shoppers.  Penney’s issuer rating and $3.1 billion of unsecured debt
was lowered to BB+, one step below investment grade, from BBB-,
New York-based Fitch said today in a statement. Secured bank
debt totaling $1.5 billion was cut to BBB- from BBB.  Penney’s steps may not draw consumers, hurting efforts by
the Plano, Texas-based department store chain to boost sales,
Fitch said. Chief Executive Officer Ron Johnson told analysts
last month his plan to introduce a three-tier price model and
scale back discount promotions to 12 per year may triple
revenue.  “Things are likely to get worse over the near term,”
Monica Aggarwal, a Fitch analyst in  New York , wrote in a note to
clients. Revenue may slump in 2012 as Penney offers fewer sales
in “a marked departure from the industry’s high-low promotional
strategy,” she said.  Penney slumped 3.1 percent to $41.35 today. The shares have
climbed 18 percent this year.  Standard & Poor’s , which also rates J.C. Penney at BB+,
lowered the company to junk in April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
