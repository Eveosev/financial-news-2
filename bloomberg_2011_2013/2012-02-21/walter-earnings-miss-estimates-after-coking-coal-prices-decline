Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) , the U.S. mining
company that paid C$5.3 billion ($5.3 billion) for Western Coal
Corp. in April, posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates after metallurgical-coal prices fell.  Net income dropped 8.8 percent to $83.8 million, or $1.34 a
share, from $91.9 million, or $1.72, a year earlier, Birmingham,
Alabama-based Walter said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of
$1.50 a share.  Sales of metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking,
rose 60 percent to 2.4 million tons. The average selling price
for hard coking coal was $244 a metric ton. The company’s so-
called average cash cost of production climbed to $131.74 a ton
from $91.14.  “Average realized pricing was a little lower than we were
looking for and average costs were a little higher,” Jim Rollyson, a Houston-based analyst with Raymond James Financial
Inc., said in a telephone interview.  Walter reiterated its guidance of 11.5 million to 13
million tons of coal production in 2012. It sold 8.7 million
tons in 2011.  Walter rose 1.7 percent to $66.64 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
