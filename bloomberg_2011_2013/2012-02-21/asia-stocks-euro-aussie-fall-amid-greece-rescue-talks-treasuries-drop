U.S. equities pared early gains as a
surge in oil dragged down transportation and consumer shares
while Greece’s approval for a second bailout failed to spur
enough confidence to keep the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index at an
almost four-year high. Treasuries declined.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent to 1,362.21 at 4 p.m. in New
York after earlier climbing as much as 0.5 percent to top its
highest closing level since June 2008. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  trimmed its advance after climbing above 13,000 for the
first time since May 2008. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.5
percent. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped six basis points
to 2.06 percent. Oil reached a nine-month high near $106 a
barrel as  Iran  said it stopped selling to  France  and Britain.  European finance ministers approved 130 billion euros ($173
billion) in aid for Greece by tapping into European Central Bank
profits and coaxing investors into providing more debt relief to
shield the region from a default. The early rally in U.S.
equities was also triggered by better- than-estimated earnings
at companies from Home Depot Inc. to Macy’s Inc.  “When you reach a headline level, there’s always some
fall-back in the short-term,” Madelynn Matlock, who helps
oversee about $14.5 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati, said in a telephone interview. “Having a deal in
 Greece  means that at least in March we don’t have the prospect
of a disorderly default facing us. Obviously, this doesn’t solve
any long-term problems. On top of that, in a climate where
nobody in the developed world has wonderful growth, the last
thing you need is higher  oil prices .”  Energy, Airline Shares  Energy companies in the S&P 500 rallied 0.8 percent as a
group, paced by gains of more than 1 percent in Exxon Mobil
Corp. and Chevron Corp. The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index
slumped 6.4 percent, the most since October, amid concern about
higher fuel costs. US Airways Group Inc. lost 11 percent and
United Continental Holdings Inc. sank 9.1 percent.  Gauges of clothing makers and retailers of food and
consumer staples lost at least 1.4 percent for the biggest
declines among 24 industries in the S&P 500.  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  slid 3.9 percent, the most since August, after the biggest
retailer’s quarterly earnings trailed analysts’ estimates as an
emphasis on low prices hurt margins.  The S&P 500 earlier rose as much as 0.5 percent to
1,367.76, above its highest close since June 2008.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) 
rose 2.6 percent for the biggest gain in the Dow, which closed
15.82 points higher at 12,965.69 after climbing as high as
13,005.04.  European Stocks  About three shares fell for each that advanced in the  Stoxx
600 (SXXP) . Segro Plc, the U.K.’s largest publicly traded owner of
industrial properties, sank 2.1 percent after saying net asset
value declined 9.8 percent. Real-estate companies fell 1.5
percent as a group for the biggest drop among 19 industries.  Europe  is still struggling to avoid the threat of default
as investors warned Greece will soon risk violating the terms of
its second bailout in three years. The nation signed up to a
program of austerity and economic reform aimed at slashing debt
to 120.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from about
160 percent last year.  Economists from Citigroup Inc. to Commerzbank AG concluded
Greece may again fail to deliver on austerity goals amid a fifth
year of recession, looming elections and social unrest.  “The Greek bailout keeps the wheels on the bus,” James Dunigan, who helps oversee $107 billion as chief investment
officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said in a
phone interview. “The ride is a little smoother, but it doesn’t
solve the longer-term issues.”  Treasury Auction  The two-year Treasury yield increased less than one basis
point to 0.303 percent following an auction of $35 billion of
the notes. The notes yielded 0.310 percent, matching 0.310
percent in pre-auction treading and compared with 0.25 percent
at the previous sale on Jan. 24. The Treasury auction drew a
bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids
with the amount of securities offered, of 3.54 compared with an
average of the past 10 auctions of 3.49 percent.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six trading partners, fell 0.3 percent. The Australian
dollar weakened against all 16 of its major counterparts, losing
0.8 percent versus the U.S. currency, after minutes of the
nation’s most-recent central bank policy meeting showed there is
scope for monetary easing.  Brent oil for April settlement increased $1.63, or 1.4
percent, to $121.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Iran stopped selling oil to France and Britain yesterday,
preempting a European Union ban, an official news website said.
EU nations bought a combined 18 percent of Iran’s exports of
crude and condensates, or 452,000 barrels a day, in the first
half of 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Department. France
purchased 49,000 barrels a day and the U.K. 11,000 barrels.  Commodities Rally  Nineteen of the 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI
Index advanced, sending the gauge up 1.7 percent. Copper
advanced the most in 11 weeks, climbing 3.5 percent to $3.8445 a
pound in  New York . Spot gold increased 1.2 percent to $1,755.60
an ounce and silver advanced 3.7 percent.  Commodities also rallied in the first U.S. trading session
since  China ’s central bank cut reserve requirements for banks in
an effort to boost lending and support economic growth. U.S.
markets were closed yesterday for the Presidents’ Day holiday.  The yield on the Spanish two-year note declined seven basis
points to 2.76 percent as the government sold 2.5 billion euros
of three- and six-month bills. The yield on the 10-year Italian
bond dropped four basis points to 5.44 percent, driving the
extra yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of
bunds six basis points lower.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  lost 0.3 percent. Russia’s
Micex Index slid 1.3 percent. The Turkish lira slipped 0.6
percent after the central bank cut its highest lending rates.
 India ’s Sensex rose 0.8 percent after trading resumed following
yesterday’s holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
