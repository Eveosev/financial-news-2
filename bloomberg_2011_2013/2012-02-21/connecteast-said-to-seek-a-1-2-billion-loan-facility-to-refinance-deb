ConnectEast Group, the owner and
operator of EastLink motorway in  Melbourne , approached banks
seeking a loan of about A$1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) to
refinance debt, three people familiar with the matter said.  The facility may involve loans with between three- and
seven-year maturities, the people said, asking not to be
identified as details are private.  The company expects to complete the refinancing process in
the second quarter of the year, Melbourne-based ConnectEast
spokesman Peter De Luca said in an e-mailed response to queries
from Bloomberg.  “Refinancing discussions are underway with lenders
covering a range of tenors in the bank debt market,” he said,
with reference to some of the company’s debt which is due in
November.  ConnectEast has a A$1.2 billion debt facility with portions
due in November this year and November 2014, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , Societe
Generale SA,  United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB)  and BOS International
arranged the loans in 2004, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
