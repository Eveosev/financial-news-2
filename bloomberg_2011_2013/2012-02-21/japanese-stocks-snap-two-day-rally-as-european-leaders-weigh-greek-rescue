Japanese  stocks  dropped, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  retreating from a six-month high, on
speculation the market had advanced too quickly even after
European leaders agreed to a second Greek bailout.  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  led steelmakers lower after jumping 8.4
percent yesterday.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a maker of video-game consoles
that gets 34 percent of its sales in  Europe , slid 1.6 percent.
 Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ,  Japan ’s least profitable major automaker,
slumped 9.9 percent on a report it plans to raise capital.
Airlines and shipping stocks fell as oil traded near a nine-
month high.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.2 percent to 9,463.02
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo, while the broader Topix
Index lost 0.3 percent to 816.29. The benchmark Nikkei 225 has
gained 4.5 percent since Feb. 14, when the  Bank of Japan 
surprised investors by expanding its bond purchases to support
the economy.  “There’s consensus that Greece is in a tough situation and
its outlook is gloomy,” said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist
in Tokyo at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-
largest lender by market value. “The markets had priced in the
bailout agreement to a degree, and we are seeing profit-taking
after the event.”  The 14-day relative strength  index  for the Nikkei 225 was
77 today, above the 70 threshold that some traders see as a sign
of overheating. The 25-day Toraku index, which compares the
number of stocks that have advanced with those that declined on
the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange, rose to 136 yesterday. Investors view
a reading above 120 as a sign shares may fall.  ‘Overheated’  JFE Holdings slid 1.9 percent to 1,679 yen after jumping
yesterday, when steel and iron makers rose the most among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups after Credit Suisse Group AG raised
stock price estimates in the sector.  The Topix has gained 12 percent this year as U.S. economic
data boosted confidence the world’s largest economy is
recovering and as Europe takes concrete steps to contain its
debt crisis. The Topix’s rise has  increased  the value of stocks
on the gauge to 1 times estimated book value, up from 0.8 in
November.  “The market is overheated and it will take a few days
before it cools down,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at
SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Investors won’t chase
higher prices aggressively until that happens.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.5 percent
today after U.S. markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  Greek Bailout  Euro-area finance ministers today reached agreement on a
second bailout package for Greece that is vital to staving off a
default in March. The deal includes a 53.5 percent writedown for
private investors in Greek bonds, Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Jean-Claude Juncker  told reporters today.  Nintendo lost 1.6 percent to 11,460 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronics maker that gets almost 17 percent of its revenue in
Europe, fell 0.7 percent to 7,010 yen.  Mazda slumped 9.9 percent to 145 yen after NHK Television
reported the automaker is preparing to raise as much as 100
billion yen ($1.25 billion) in capital as it braces for a loss
of the same amount. The company said in a filing no decision had
been made on a share sale.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 8.8 percent to 21.63,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.2 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
Nikkei 225 was 50 percent above the 100-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
