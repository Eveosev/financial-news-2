Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party
raised the possibility of ending the governing coalition over
the choice for a new president after the junior  Free Democratic
Party  threw its weight behind democracy activist Joachim Gauck,
FDP Chairman Philipp Roesler told  Die Welt  newspaper.  Roesler, who is economy minister and vice chancellor, told
Merkel that his party was willing to vote for Gauck even if he
wasn’t supported by Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and its
Bavarian sister party, the  Christian Social Union , Welt said.
The chancellor’s reaction was “sharp,” Roesler told the paper.  Still, trust among the three parties hasn’t suffered,
Roesler said. Merkel’s coalition in 2010 pushed through
 Christian Wulff  as president over Gauck, who was backed by the
opposition. Wulff quit amid corruption allegations on Feb. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
