EON AG (EOAN) â€™s works council Chairman Hans Pruefer opposes bonus payments to executives this year,
Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung  reported  in a preview of an
article to be published tomorrow, citing an interview with
Pruefer.  Such bonuses would be unacceptable following the
announcement of 11,000 job cuts at the energy provider last
year, WAZ cited Pruefer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
