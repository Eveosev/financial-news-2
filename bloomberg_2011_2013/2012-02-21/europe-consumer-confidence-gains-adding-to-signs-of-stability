Euro-area  consumer confidence 
improved for a second month in February, adding to signs the
region’s economy is stabilizing after contracting in the fourth
quarter.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
rose to minus 20.2 from minus 20.7 in January, the Brussels-
based European Commission said in an initial estimate today.
Economists had forecast a gain to minus 20.1, the median of 26
estimates in a  Bloomberg survey  showed.  European retailers are seeking ways to cope with slowing
global growth and the region’s debt crisis that has forced
governments from Spain to France to step up budget cuts. In
Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy,  investor confidence  jumped to
a 10-month high in February and services industries expanded
last month.  “We’re past the worst provided the debt crisis won’t
worsen,” said  Christoph Weil , a senior economist at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt. “We still see a slight economic contraction in
the first quarter followed by an expansion. Sentiment should
continue to improve.”  The  European Central Bank , which has provided lenders with
unlimited cash up to three years, purchased  government bonds  and
lowered borrowing costs, estimated the euro-region economy will
expand about 0.3 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2013. ECB
President Mario Draghi said on Feb. 9 that he sees some
“tentative signs of stabilization in economic activity.”  The commission will publish its latest economic forecasts
on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
