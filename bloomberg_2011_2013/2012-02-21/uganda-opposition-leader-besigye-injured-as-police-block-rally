Ugandan opposition leader  Kizza Besigye  was injured along with with three senior members of his
party when they claim police fired rubber bullets and assaulted
them in halting a planned rally in the capital.  Besigye, leader of the Forum for Democratic Change, was
injured as police blocked his access to the venue of the
gathering, Wafula Ogutu, the party’s spokesman, said by phone
from the capital, Kampala. Besigye and two other officials are
at a city clinic, he said.  Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesman Ibin Senkumbi
declined to comment when reached on his mobile phone today.
Asuman Mugenyi, spokesman for the national force, didn’t answer
a call to his mobile phone.  At least 11 people died and more than 480 were injured
during similar demonstrations, led by Besigye, that started in
April over the rising cost of living, according to the  Uganda 
Red Cross. A second round of protests was held in October, when
inflation surged to an 18-year high of 30.4 percent.  “The government of Uganda is gravely concerned at reports
of people being injured during an unlawful public protest,”
Fred Opolot, the director of state-run Uganda Media Center, said
in an e-mailed statement. “As yet, details of what happened are
unclear.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
