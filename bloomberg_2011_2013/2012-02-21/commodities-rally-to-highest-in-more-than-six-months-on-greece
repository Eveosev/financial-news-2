Commodities jumped to a six-month
high as euro-area finance ministers reached agreement on a
second debt bailout for  Greece  and U.S. equities rallied,
boosting prospects for raw-material demand.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
rose 1.7 percent to close at 699.92 at 3:46 p.m. in New York,
after reaching 700.79, the highest since July 27. Metals led the
gains with silver up 3.7 percent and aluminum gaining 3.5
percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed above 13,000
for the first time since 2008.  Greece won a rescue after governments in Europe wrung
concessions from private investors and tapped the  European
Central Bank  to shield the region from a default. Finance
ministers awarded 130 billion euros ($173 billion) in aid.
Investors who were waiting for a Greece resolution are
“planting themselves long commodities,” said James Cordier of
OptionSellers.com.  “In the U.S., we have the Dow touching 13,000, and that is
opening a whole lot of eyes to the fact that the  U.S. economy  is
getting possibly much better,” Cordier, a portfolio manager,
said in a telephone interview from Tampa, Florida. “You have
investors really pouring money into the riskier assets and, of
course, commodities get to be the big winner.”  Economic Growth  The S&P GSCI has advanced 8.5 percent this year, helped by
higher U.S. factory output and a jobless rate in January that
was the lowest in three years. The central bank of  China , the
largest metals and energy consumer, has also cut  reserve
requirements  for banks. Chinese Vice President  Xi Jinping  says
that the global economy faces an “uphill struggle” as it seeks
to recover from a financial crisis.  Copper futures for May delivery climbed 3.5 percent to
settle at $3.8445 a pound on the Comex in  New York , the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since Nov. 30.  Spot gold rose 1.4 percent to $1,759.27 an ounce. Zinc rose
2.3 percent to $2,028 a ton on the London Metal Exchange. The
