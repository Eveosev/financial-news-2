Timothy F. Geithner , who took over
the Treasury Department in the midst of the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression and oversaw the almost
doubling of U.S. public debt, has done better for investors than
 Robert Rubin  while falling short of  Henry Paulson .  Since Geithner assumed office in January 2009, returns on
Treasuries have exceeded bonds of other countries by 0.3
percentage point on an annualized rate, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. That’s less than Paulson’s 7.5
percentage points. Under Rubin, returns on Treasuries lagged
behind foreign issues by 1.6 points.  Bond yields and the government’s average cost to borrow
have fallen to record lows, making it cheaper to finance the
nation’s $1.3 trillion  budget deficit  than in all but six of the
last 24 years. Geithner, who said he wouldn’t be asked to remain
in his post should President Barack Obama win the November
election, presided over the loss of the nation’s AAA  credit
rating  and the growth of the  nation’s debt  to $10 trillion from
$5.75 trillion.  “It’s been an environment where you don’t have a script to
go by,” said  Sean Simko , who manages $8 billion of bonds at SEI
Investments Co. in Oaks, Pennsylvania, in a telephone interview
Feb. 13. “He’s made and had to make many difficult choices
throughout his tenure. The end result shows the U.S. has kept
its integrity in the  bond market .”  Big Deficits  During Geithner’s term the U.S. has run the first three $1
trillion budget  deficits  in its history, contributing to the
decision by  Standard & Poor’s  to lower the U.S. credit rating to
AA+, the first time the U.S. hasn’t had the top credit rating.
Borrowing rose to more than $2.1 trillion in each of the last
three years from $922 billion in 2008.  The economy, recovering from the 18-month recession that
ended in June 2009, is expected to grow 2.2 percent this year
according to the median forecast of 89 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey, below the average growth rate for the terms of
Rubin from 1995 to 1999,  Lawrence Summers  from 1999 to 2001 and
John Snow in 2003 to 2006.  “Over the last 25 years, I do not think any Secretary of
the Treasury has faced the challenges that we’ve faced in the
last four years,” Mary Miller, the Treasury Department’s
assistant secretary for financial markets, said in a telephone
interview Feb. 17. “We are doing everything we can to protect
what is really a national resource, which is a very, very safe,
liquid, deep market.”  Average Maturity  Geithner’s Treasury has kept bond yields around record lows
and  demand  for government securities at all time highs. His
lengthening of the  average  maturity of U.S. debt to 62.8 months,
the longest since 2002 under  Paul O’Neill , may shore up credit
quality and depress yields amid contained inflation, according
to Steven Lear, deputy chief investment officer of fixed income
at JP Morgan Asset Management, which oversees $150 billion in
fixed income.  Investors have embraced longer-duration securities, with
the 30-year  yield  at 3.17 percent, compared with an average of
4.57 percent during the past decade. They bid a record $3.04 per
dollar of debt for each of the $2.135 trillion of notes and
bonds sold at auction in 2011, government data show.  Treasuries returned 28.9 percent from July 2006 through
January 2009, Paulson’s tenure under President  George W. Bush ,
compared with 12.1 percent gains on non-U.S. sovereign debt.
U.S. bonds gained 10.5 percent on an annualized basis during his
term, the Bank of America indexes show.  Faster Growth  U.S.  government securities  of all maturities returned 12
percent, or 3.8 percent on an annual basis, since 2009 as
Geithner’s term started with the 10-year yield at 2.64 percent,
only 0.61 percentage point above the then-record low. It fell to
1.67 percent last Sept. 23.  During the faster growth of Bill Clinton’s presidency, the
 10-year yield  fell 2 percentage points to 5.83 percent as all
Treasuries appreciated 42.6 percent, or an annualized 8.3
percent from January 1995 through July 1999, compared with 52.5
percent returns for foreign debt. During Rubin’s tenure the
economy grew at an average annualized rate of 3.9 percent. Lloyd Bentsen, Clinton’s first Treasury boss from January 1993 to
December 1994 had the worst relative returns of any secretary in
the past 24 years, at a minus 3.2 percent.  Yields Rise  Yields on the benchmark 10-year note increased about two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2 percent last week,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2
percent security due in February 2022 fell 1/8, or $1.25 per
$1,000 face value, to 99 31/32. The yield was 2.04 percent as of
9:21 a.m. in  New York .  Geithner, 50, the last remaining member of the Obama
administration’s original economic team, said during a Bloomberg
Television interview on Jan. 25 that he doesn’t expect the
president to ask him to stay in office if re-elected.  After earning a bachelor’s degree from  Dartmouth College  in
Hanover,  New Hampshire , and a master’s degree from Johns Hopkins
University’s School of Advanced International Studies in
 Washington , Geithner worked for three years at a global
consulting firm founded by Henry A. Kissinger before joining the
Treasury in 1988, becoming Under Secretary in 1998. He was a
director at the  International Monetary Fund  from 2001 to 2003
and then President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Bear Stearns  As clients pulled assets in a run from Bear Stearns Cos. in
March 2008, Geithner’s New York Fed assumed $29 billion of risky
mortgages held by the company to make it a palatable acquisition
for JPMorgan Chase & Co. That September the Fed and Treasury
were unable to arrange a rescue for Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and were unwilling to bail it out. The firm’s implosion
froze U.S. credit markets.  Geithner handled the disbursement of more than half of the
$700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program passed in October
2008 and oversaw stress tests for the 14 largest U.S. banks.  “Geithner is a Treasury Secretary who’s had to carry
baggage from his past roles,” said  David Kotok , chairman and
chief investment officer of Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland
Advisors Inc., which manages $1.5 billion, in a telephone
interview Feb. 16. In his time at the New York Fed he
contributed to “a ratcheting up of moral hazard” as the
government bailed out failing enterprises, Kotok said.  U.S. public debt rose to $10.1 trillion in January 2012
from $5.75 trillion in January 2009, after rising from $4.28
trillion in July 2006 when Paulson took office. The debt
declined under Rubin and Summers.  Political Will  S&P cited rising debt and political gridlock in its
downgrade message Aug. 5. “The primary focus remained on the
current level of debt, the trajectory of debt as a share of the
economy, and the lack of apparent willingness of elected
officials as a group to deal with the U.S. medium term fiscal
outlook,” the rating company said.  Treasuries rallied, repudiating the downgrade decision,
with the 10-year note yield falling to 2.06 percent on Aug. 19
from 2.56 percent on Aug. 5.  “We have a deficit and a debt  problem ,” said Thomas Atteberry, who manages $4.5 billion in fixed income assets at
First Pacific Advisors in  Los Angeles , in a telephone interview
Feb 16. “I’m disappointed that I have not heard him come
forward and say look, this is a problem, we need to deal with
it. We need to sit down and find a compromise plan, a compromise
way to move things forward.”  Debt Crisis  Debt prices have been supported as the European debt crisis
continues to worsen, and as the Fed has said it intends to hold
short-term borrowing costs about zero through 2014. Investors
have bid $3.17 for each of the $261 billion notes and bonds
auctioned so far this year.  “There aren’t a lot of safe assets in the world,” said
Thomas Girard, who helps manage $115 billion in fixed income at
New York Life Investment Management in New York, in a telephone
interview Feb. 15. “By default you’re getting people to buy
your paper. Should  Tim Geithner  get credit for that? I’m not
sure that he should.”  Interest payments will cost the government 3.1 percent of
gross domestic product this year, according to Office of
Management and Budget and International Monetary Fund data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from 4.8 percent in 1991, the
highest in the past 50 years, during George H.W. Bush’s
presidency. Since 1980, the only incumbent with a lower ratio
than Obama was Bush in 2004.  The average yield of Bank of America Treasury index has
fallen to 1.04 percent on Feb. 16, from 1.64 percent when Obama
took office and from 5.27 percent when Paulson was sworn in. The
average 10-year yield has been 3.03 percent under Geithner
compared with 5 percent average since 1992.  “You have to put him in the context of the crisis that
he’s faced,” said Michael Materasso, senior portfolio manager
and co-chairman of the fixed-income policy committee at Franklin
Templeton Investments in New York, which oversees $320 billion
of bonds, in a telephone interview Feb. 15. “The stress-testing
of his capabilities has been continuous.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
