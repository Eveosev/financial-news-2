The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is
approaching the  cheapest level  ever compared with bonds as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s zero-percent  interest
rates  drive investors and companies from cash.  Profits that doubled since 2009 pushed the index’s so-
called earnings yield to 7.1 percent, close to the highest on
record when compared with the  10-year Treasury rate , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg since 1962. American companies
have boosted capital spending 35 percent over six quarters, the
most since 2006.  “Conditions are almost ideal for equity investors relative
to all other investments,”  Keith Wirtz , who oversees $14.6
billion as chief investment officer for Fifth Third Asset
Management in Cincinnati, said in a Feb. 14 telephone interview.
“The Fed’s keeping rates low for the foreseeable future to try
to stimulate the environment for employee hiring and business
activity. What does that mean for  capital markets ? Savers are
not being rewarded.”  The U.S. government and the Fed lent, spent or guaranteed
as much as $12.8 trillion to end the worst recession since the
1930s. That and Bernanke’s three-year effort to drive down
interest rates are paying off with rising consumer confidence
and expanding factory output. The  S&P 500  is off to its best
annual start since 1997 as riskier assets lure money from
 savings accounts  offering some of the lowest yields on record.  Bailed Out  Individuals are responding with indifference amid the
slowest economic recovery in at least six decades.  New York
Stock Exchange volume  fell to the lowest level in 13 years last
month. While unemployment  slipped  to 8.3 percent in January from
9 percent in September, joblessness remains more than two
percentage points above its average level since 1990, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Existing home sales reached an
annual rate of 4.6 million in December, 23 percent below the
average between 1999 and 2006.  The S&P 500 climbed 1.4 percent to 1,361.23 last week,
within three points of a three-year high. Reports showed housing
starts increased more than forecast and claims for U.S. jobless
benefits slipped to a four-year low.  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) , the
biggest maker of equipment for semiconductor plants, increased
as much as 5.5 percent after saying sales this quarter may be 20
percent above analysts’ estimates.  The index rose 0.1 percent to 1,362.21 today.  Cash Return  Investors who kept money as cash have missed out. A balance
of $10,000 would have earned $184.60 in interest since December
2008, based on the average monthly savings rate compiled by
Bankrate.com. For Treasuries, the return was $1,644. U.S.
equities generated $5,690  including dividends .  Fed policy makers highlighted concern about the rate of
capital spending when they pledged to keep interest rates low
for at least two more years on Jan. 25. “Growth in business
fixed investment has slowed,” they said, altering the last
statement from “business fixed investment appears to be
increasing less rapidly.” Factories in the U.S. boosted
production 0.7 percent in January for the biggest back-to-back
increases in more than two years, the Fed said Feb. 15.  “The real target for the low rates is indeed businesses,”
John Canally, who helps oversee about $330 billion as an
economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial Corp. in
 Boston , said in a Feb. 14 phone interview. “They want to push
money out on the risk spectrum. They want that to be put to use
buying a new piece of equipment or expanding a plant or adding a
third assembly line.”  Labor Market  One of the Fed’s two mandates is restoring employment. Of
the 8.8 million jobs lost in the U.S. due to the recession,
about 3.2 million have been recovered, figures from the Labor
Department show. On Feb. 7, Bernanke cited Labor Department data
released Feb. 3 showing the share of working-age people in the
 labor force  had declined to the lowest level in 29 years.  S&P 500 companies  increased capital expenditures 35 percent
from June 2010 through the end of 2011, the fastest rate since
June 2006, when stocks were in the middle of a five-year  bull
market , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Earnings in the S&P 500  have more than doubled to $96.58
since 2009 and are projected to reach a record $104.28 this
year, more than 11,000 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
show. The earnings yield, or annual profits divided by price,
climbed to 7.1 percent, 5 percentage points more than the rate
on 10-year Treasuries. That’s wider than in 97 percent of months
in 50 years of Bloomberg data.  Bullish Precedent  The spread was last this wide in the  four months  before the
 S&P 500 (SPX)  reached a 12-year low in March 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The benchmark gauge for American equities has
increased 101 percent since then, including an  8.3 percent
increase in 2012 , the best start to a year since 1997.  Low valuations  and signs of recovery have failed to lure
individuals back to equities. Stocks are trading at a 14 percent
discount to their average price-earnings ratio over the past
five decades. The multiple has been stuck below the mean of 16.4
times earnings since May 2010, the longest stretch below the
average since the 13 years beginning in 1973, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  U.S. gross domestic product expanded an average 2.4 percent
a quarter in the 2 1/2 years since the recession ended in 2009,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The world’s largest economy
hasn’t had a smaller post-recession recovery rate since at least
the 1940s, the data show. In the 2003 bull market, GDP rose 2.7
percent on average, before the S&P 500 surged 102 percent. For
the 1982 rally, the rate was 5.7 percent. Equities more than
tripled in that cycle.  ‘Very Sluggish’  “The old story was that the steeper the recession, the
stronger the bounce back,” Nick Sargen, chief investment
officer at Fort  Washington  Investment Advisors in Cincinnati,
said in a Feb. 16 phone interview. The firm oversees $40
billion. “This is the worst recession since the Great
Depression, and yet despite all that the Fed has done, despite
huge stimulus from the federal government, the economy is just
growing at this very sluggish 2 percent pace.”  Even as the S&P 500 doubled, investors pulled money from
mutual funds that buy U.S. stocks for a fifth year in 2011, the
longest streak in data going back to 1984, according to the
 Investment Company Institute  in Washington. Withdrawals were
$135 billion last year, the second-highest total after 2008. Net
inflows have amounted to almost $1 billion in 2012.  Debt to Equity  Capital investments surged in 2006 as the  total debt-to-
assets ratio  in the S&P 500 was climbing to 38.8 in the third
quarter of 2007, the highest point since at least 1998, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The ratio is about 32 percent lower
now. Companies spent the past three years paying down debt and
cutting costs, boosting the S&P 500  profit margin  to 13.8
percent, compared with 8.3 percent in 2009, the data show.  S&P 500 companies increased cash and equivalents for 12
straight quarters to $998.6 billion in the third quarter, 60
percent more than in September 2007, just before the index
reached an  all-time high of 1,565.15 , according to S&P. The
total excludes financial, utility and transportation companies.  Applied Materials’ second-quarter profit and sales forecast
topped estimates on Feb. 16, signaling semiconductor makers are
pulling out of a spending slump. Customers such as Samsung
Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. are
stepping up spending, according to Patrick Ho, an analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in  Dallas .  Disney, Apple  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  boosted capital investments by more than 10
percent each fiscal year since 2009, increasing them by 69
percent last year. The largest U.S. entertainment company by
market value put the first of two new  cruise ships  into service
last year and is expanding Disneyland Hong Kong, while designing
a theme park in  Shanghai .  The company also announced a $16 billion buyback plan in
May. The stock  trades at 15.6  times reported earnings, compared
with the average of 26 in the five years before the financial
crisis, Bloomberg data show.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world’s largest company by market
capitalization,  boosted  its capital investments 60 percent each
year, on average, since 2008, helping raise the return to 39
percent last year from 20 percent in 2006, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Cupertino, California-based company’s
 earnings  are expanding so fast that even with a 24 percent rally
this year, the stock is trading at about half its average
valuation since 1990, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Companies have a lot of cash, and it’s not prudent for
investors to pay up for cash,” LPL’s Canally said. “Doing a
little bit of  capital spending  has a pretty high multiplier
effect on the economy, where cash on the balance sheet doesn’t
have any. That’s what the Fed’s trying to drive at.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
