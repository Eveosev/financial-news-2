Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the world’s largest
home-improvement retailer, reported fourth-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates as warmer weather helped spur an
increase in residential spending.  Net income in the quarter ended Jan. 29 increased 32
percent to $774 million, or 50 cents a share, from $587 million,
or 36 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based Home Depot said today
in a statement. Analysts projected 42 cents, the average of 24
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Home Depot attracted customers who spent more as U.S.
unemployment sank to a three-year low in January and builders
began work on more houses. Warmer weather helped sales at stores
open at least a year advance 5.7 percent, the biggest gain since
a 7.7 percent increase in the first quarter of 2004. That topped
the average estimate for a 3 percent gain by five analysts.  “It was a pretty fantastic quarter given the continued
pressure on the U.S. consumer and the overall softness of the
U.S. recovery,”  John Tomlinson , an analyst at ITG Investment
Research in  New York , said today in a telephone interview. “The
warmer weather helped outdoor home renovation projects and
allowed builders to get a head start on construction.”  Home Depot  rose  0.5 percent to $46.92 at the close in New
York. The shares increased 20 percent last year.  The company projected full-year earnings of $2.79 a share,
with stock buybacks. Analysts projected $2.77 a share. The
retailer said it will repurchase about $3.5 billion in stock.  Construction Spending  Full-year revenue may increase by about 4 percent to $73.2
billion, compared with analysts’ estimate of $72.5 billion.  In the fourth quarter, the number of customer transactions
rose 3.6 percent to 303 million, and shoppers spent $52.54 on
average, an increase of 2.4 percent from a year earlier.  Revenue rose 5.9 percent to $16 billion. Analysts predicted
$15.5 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Home Depot estimated that warmer weather contributed 200 to
250 basis points to higher sales in the quarter,  Craig Menear ,
executive vice president of merchandising, said today on a
conference call.  Construction spending in the U.S. rose 1.5 percent in
December, Commerce Department figures showed Feb. 1. That was
more than the median analyst estimate of a 0.5 percent gain. The
increase, which included a 0.8 percent gain in homebuilding
outlays, was the biggest jump since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
