Russian stocks declined the most in
two months as Urals crude retreated from a nine-month high and
investors speculated a second bailout for  Greece  won’t be
sufficient to solve the debt crisis.  The 30-stock  Micex (INDEXCF)  retreated 1.3 percent to 1,558.42 by
6:45 p.m. in Moscow, the most since Dec. 21. OAO Gazprom, the
world’s biggest gas producer, sank 1.2 percent. OAO Lukoil,
 Russia ’s second-largest oil producer, lost 2.3 percent. VTB
Group, Russia’s second-biggest bank, fell 1.4 percent. The
dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  decreased 1.1 percent to 1,655.35.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export, fell for the first time
in six days, dropping 0.5 percent. European finance ministers
awarded 130 billion euros ($173 billion) today in aid to Greece
and agreed on a 53.5 percent writedown for investors in the
nation’s debt, while analysis by the  International Monetary Fund 
and European officials indicated Greece’s debt may still balloon
to 160 percent of its gross domestic product.  Europe  is Russia’s
biggest trading partner.  “Investors looked beyond Greece and understood that this
morning’s deal is no way a solution,” Peter Westin, chief
strategist at Aton LLC in Moscow, said by phone. “Everybody had
been waiting for a decision on Greece, and now when they got it,
they are looking for the next milestone.”  The Micex has climbed 11 percent this year and trades at
6.1 times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies.
 Brazil ’s Bovespa index, which is valued at 10.7 times estimated
earnings, has jumped 17 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 9.8 times
estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index has a
ratio of 16.3.  OAO  Sberbank (SBER) , Russia’s biggest lender, fell 0.8 percent,
slipping from its strongest level since Aug. 4. United Co.
Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer, dropped 4.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
