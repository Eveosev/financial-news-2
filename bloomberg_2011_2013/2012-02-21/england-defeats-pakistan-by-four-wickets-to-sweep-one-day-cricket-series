Kevin Pietersen ’s second straight
century led England to a 4-0 sweep of Pakistan in their one-day
international cricket series.  Pietersen struck a career-best 130 in Dubai yesterday as
England made 241-6 chasing the victory target of 238 to complete
a four-wicket win. He got out with England two runs short of
victory before  Tim Bresnan  won the match with a boundary with
four balls to spare.  Pietersen became the second England batsman, following
captain  Alastair Cook , to hit back-to-back centuries as their
team won all the matches of a one-day international series
against Pakistan for the  first time since 1987 .  “Four-nil is a pretty special end to a what’s been good
series for us,” Pietersen, who scored 111 on Feb. 18, said at
the presentation ceremony.  The series sweep lifted England above  Pakistan  into fifth
place in the International Cricket Council’s  one-day rankings .
Pakistan won all three Test matches between the teams, who will
now play three Twenty20 games.  Pakistan, which won the toss yesterday, got half centuries
from Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali to reach 237 all out from its 50
overs. Jade Dernbach was England’s best bowler with 4-45 and
Danny Briggs took 2-39 in his ODI debut for the national team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
