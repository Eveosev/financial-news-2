Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL) , Australia’s
biggest soft-drink maker, posted a 54 percent rise in second-
half profit as a one-time gain from selling its beer unit to
 SABMiller Plc (SAB)  outweighed the effect of stalling domestic demand.  Net income rose to A$438.2 million ($467 million) in the
six months ended Dec. 31 from A$284.6 million a year earlier.
Second-half figures were calculated by subtracting first-half
earnings from the A$591.8 million full-year profit the Sydney-
based company reported today.  Cooler summer weather in Australia’s eastern states
combined with stalling  consumer spending  to crimp sales in the
company’s biggest market. The result was helped by a A$170.3
million gain from the sale of Coca-Cola Amatil’s stake in the
Pacific Beverages beer business to SABMiller, and it may
exercise an option to buy spirit assets from the London-based
brewer.  “Considering the weather it’s a pretty consistent
performance,” David Cooke, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Ltd.
in Sydney, said by phone yesterday. “A quality company like
this should be able to deliver high single-digit or low double-
digit earnings growth.”  The full-year profit of A$591.8 million beat the A$573
million average of nine  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Excluding items, profit for 2011 rose 5 percent to A$532
million, it said.  Most Challenging  The past 12 months were “undoubtedly the most challenging
year the business has faced in over a decade,” Chief Executive
Officer Terry Davis said in the statement.  Coca-Cola Amatil  shares  fell 0.3 percent to A$12.08 at
12:02 p.m. in Sydney. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index declined
0.2 percent.  The company agreed in December to sell its stake in the
Pacific Beverages beer venture for A$305 million to clear the
way for SABMiller to complete its A$10.5 billion acquisition of
Foster’s Group Ltd.  Coca-Cola Amatil said it expects to spend as much as A$200
million by the middle of this year if it exercises a related
option to buy Foster’s spirits and pre-mixed drinks business
from SABMiller. It would aim to return to the local beer
business as soon as a two-year exclusion period under its
agreement with SABMiller lapses.  “While in the short term we may not be able to compete in
beer in  Australia , we are not restricted in our other markets,”
Davis said.  Australian Slowdown  Annual earnings before interest and tax from Australian
beverages rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier to A$607.2
million as the cooler weather curbed demand before Christmas.
The pace of growth slowed from 7.3 percent in 2010.  Indonesia & Papua New Guinea profit jumped 18 percent to
A$88.1 million while earnings from New Zealand & Fiji slipped
2.3 percent to A$80 million. Earnings from the Alcohol, Food &
Services unit fell 1.2 percent to A$93.2 million.  One-time items added A$59.8 million to annual profit, with
the gain from the Pacific Beverages sale partially offset by
A$110.5 million in restructuring costs in its food business as
it fired employees and wrote down the value of inventory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
