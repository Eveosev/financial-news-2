Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili said the political coalition he’s formed to take on
President Mikheil Saakashvili will win October’s parliamentary
vote and promised closer ties with the European Union and NATO.  His movement, Georgian Dream, will “deepen integration
with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization” and the 27-member
EU, while guaranteeing the Black Sea nation’s security,
Ivanishvili told reporters today at a presentation in the
capital, Tbilisi.  Opposition politicians including coalition partner Irakli Alasania,  Georgia ’s former envoy to the  United Nations , accuse
Saakashvili of delaying NATO and EU integration by stifling
democracy. The president, who has advocated membership of both
alliances, led Georgia into a five-day war with Russia in 2008
over the breakaway republic of  South Ossetia .  Saakashvili’s National Movement had 42 percent backing,
while Ivanishvili’s party had 18 percent support, according to a
December poll of 4,000 people by the International Republican
Institute that had a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points.
Forbes magazine put Ivanishvili’s wealth at $5.5 billion last
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
