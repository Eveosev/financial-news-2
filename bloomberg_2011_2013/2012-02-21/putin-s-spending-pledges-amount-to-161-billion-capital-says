Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s campaign pledges before next month’s presidential vote
will raise government spending by 4.8 trillion rubles ($161
billion) through 2018,  Capital Economics  said.  Spending will rise as much as 5 percent of economic output
in that period, Neil Shearing, chief emerging-markets economist
at the London-based research company, said in an e-mailed note.  Putin, 59, who is facing unprecedented protests against his
12-year rule as he seeks a new Kremlin term, has stepped up
efforts to court voters. Russia will spend 23 trillion rubles in
the next decade on upgrading its military, Putin said yesterday.
He has also promised to refrain from raising the  retirement age 
and to increase pensions and state wages.  While  Russia ’s public debt is low at 10 percent of gross
domestic product, meaning there’s some scope for the government
to fund additional spending through increased borrowing, the
“non-oil” budget deficit would increase to about 15 percent of
GDP, if the pledges are fully implemented, Shearing wrote.  This would push up the oil price Russia needs to balance
its budget to $130 per barrel from $117 per barrel at present
and about $55 per barrel in 2008, according to Shearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
