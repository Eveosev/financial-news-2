Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP) ,  Africa ’s
largest food retailer, said sales are increasing this year after
profit grew 20 percent in the fiscal first half on new stores
and “particularly good” spending over the December holidays.  Net income advanced to 1.4 billion rand ($183 million), or
2.80 rand a share, in the six months ended Dec. 31, from 1.2
billion rand, or 2.34 rand a share, a year earlier, the Cape
Town-based company said today in a stock-exchange statement.
Sales rose 13 percent to 41 billion rand.  Shoprite benefited from “the size of its store footprint
and the efficiency of its infrastructure,” Chief Executive
Officer Whitey Basson said in a presentation in Johannesburg.
Shoprite will show sales growth in January and February, the
CEO said.  In the second half of the fiscal year, the company
“expects to maintain satisfactory growth in turnover and
profitability as the benefits of an expanded infrastructure
become more apparent,” Basson said.  Shoprite sales may also increase because of rising food
prices, the CEO said.  Inflation (SACPIYOY)  was unchanged at 6.1 percent in
December, the statistics office said on Jan. 18.  The retailer opened 59 stores in the first half, and
another 174 will be added by June 2013, it said. Shoprite, which
has 123 supermarkets in 15 countries outside of  South Africa ,
sees African new store development gathering pace.  Congo Store  The company opened 10 new stores in African countries
outside of South Africa in the six months through December and
plans to open another 12 before June, including its first store
in the  Democratic Republic  of Congo, Basson said.  “I wouldn’t trade Shoprite for any big group in  Europe 
right now because we are close to the better opportunities in
Africa,” Basson said. Besides the planned openings, Shoprite is
“investigating a number of new store locations,” he said.  Shoprite had an exchange-rate gain of 27.7 million rand,
compared with a loss of 13.4 million rand a year earlier, as the
rand weakened against the  U.S. dollar  and other African
currencies. The rand fell 18 percent against the dollar last
year, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The  shares  rose 1.4 percent to 134.50 rand at the close in
Johannesburg, giving the company a market value of 73 billion
rand. The stock has gained 39 percent in 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
