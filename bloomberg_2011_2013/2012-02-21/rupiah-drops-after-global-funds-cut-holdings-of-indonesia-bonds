Indonesia ’s rupiah snapped a two-day
rally after overseas investors reduced holdings of the nation’s
bonds.  Global funds sold 3.3 trillion rupiah ($365 million) more
local notes than they bought last week, according to finance
ministry data. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index declined
the most in a week as euro-area finance ministers haggled in
Brussels over the terms of new loans that are vital for Greece
to avoid bankruptcy.  “The rupiah is being driven by events surrounding
Greece,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a Singapore-based senior
currency analyst at Malayan Banking Bhd. “Investors are waiting
for a deal in Europe to be finalized.”  The rupiah declined 0.5 percent to 9,067 per dollar as of
9:26 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds was
little changed at 5.25 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield has climbed 20 basis points since Feb. 9,
when  Bank Indonesia  cut its benchmark reference rate by 25 basis
points to 5.75 percent.  “The bond markets are consolidating,” Tanuwidjaja said.
“The 10-year yield has corrected to about 20 basis points
higher, so that could drive an outflow of funds.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
