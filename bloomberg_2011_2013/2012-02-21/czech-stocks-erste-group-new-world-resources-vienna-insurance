slid 0.2 percent to 1,016 at the close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG)   fell for a second day,
sliding 1.5 percent to 849 koruna.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  
dropped 0.7 percent to 475 koruna.  European shares fell from the highest in six months, led by
financial companies on speculation a Greek bailout deal will not
