The jersey worn by  New York  Knicks
point guard Jeremy Lin while outdueling  National Basketball
Association  scoring leader  Kobe Bryant  was auctioned for charity
at $42,388.  The winning bid in the  Charitybuzz.com  auction that ended
yesterday came from a person in the New York area who requested
anonymity, Glenda Luft, a spokeswoman for the website, said in
an e-mail.  There were 34 bids cast in the auction that began on Feb.
13. The listing, which included four tickets to the Knicks’ home
game tonight against the  Atlanta Hawks  and a chance to meet Lin
at the game, drew an opening bid of $1,100.  Lin, the first Chinese- or Taiwanese-American to play in
the NBA and the first Harvard University graduate to join the
league since  Ed Smith  in 1953-54, has led the Knicks (16-17) to
an 8-2 record since coming off the bench to score 25 points and
hand out seven assists in a Feb. 4 win against New Jersey.  His ascension set off an international craze that has come
to be known as “Linsanity,” sending Knicks’ ticket prices,
television ratings and social media interest in the second-year
NBA player skyrocketing.  The 23-year-old Lin moved into the Knicks’ starting lineup
on Feb. 6 and helped New York beat the Lakers 92-85 on Feb. 10,
scoring a career-high 38 points to Bryant’s 34. New York reeled
off a seven-game winning streak before dropping two of its last
three contests.  The proceeds from the auction benefit the Garden of Dreams
Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works closely with
 Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG) , the Knicks’ owner, in what its
website described as making “dreams come true for kids facing
obstacles.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
