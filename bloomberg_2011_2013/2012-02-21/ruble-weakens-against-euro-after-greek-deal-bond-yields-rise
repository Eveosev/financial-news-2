The ruble weakened for the first
time in three days against the dollar and bonds declined amid
concern a bailout secured by  Greece  won’t be enough to solve the
nation’s debt crisis.  The Russian currency depreciated as much as 0.3 percent,
before paring declines to close less than 0.1 percent weaker at
29.8125 per dollar at 7 p.m. in Moscow, its first retreat since
Feb. 16. The yield on Russia’s 114 billion rubles ($3.8 billion)
of OFZ bonds due 2021 rose for a second day, climbing three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.92 percent.  European finance ministers awarded Greece 130 billion euros
($173 billion) in aid and persuaded investor representatives
into providing more debt relief in an exchange offer meant to
tide Greece past a bond redemption next month. The European
Union is  Russia ’s largest trading partner.  “People got short on the basket against the ruble before
the actual decision” on Greece, Mikhail Palei, a currency
trader at VTB Capital in  London , said by e-mail. “There was a
lot priced in. We may be in a ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact’
type of thing.”  The ruble was little changed at 34.1417 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket after gaining 0.7 percent in
the previous two sessions. The Russian currency was steady at
39.43 per euro.  “We recommend positioning for ruble weakness via a long
EUR-RUB position,” HSBC Holdings Plc analysts Murat Toprak and
 Alexander Morozov  wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “Our
macro metrics suggest that the ruble is one of the most
expensive currencies within the  Europe , Middle East and Africa
region.”  Relative Valuation  The ruble has rallied 5.9 percent against the euro in 2012,
after losing 8.6 percent last year. The Czech koruna has gained
4.4 percent against the European currency this year, and  South
Africa ’s rand strengthened 4.6 percent.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, traded at $104.37 per
barrel in New York futures trading, down 0.6 percent from its
level at yesterday’s 7 p.m. close in Moscow. Investors increased
bets that the ruble will weaken, with non-deliverable forwards
showing it at 30.1623 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 30.149 per dollar yesterday.  The ruble has strengthened 1.2 percent against the dollar
this month, after appreciating 6.5 percent last month.  Brazil ’s
real has gained 2.1 percent against the greenback in February,
 India ’s rupee strengthened 0.7 percent and  China ’s yuan rose 0.2
percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps fell two basis points to
208 basis points, down from last year’s peak of 338 on Oct. 4,
