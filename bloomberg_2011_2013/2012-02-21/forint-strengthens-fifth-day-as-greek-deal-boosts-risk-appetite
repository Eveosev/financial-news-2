The forint gained against the euro
for a fifth day after  Greece  won a bailout, boosting bets
 Europe ’s debt crisis will be resolved and increasing investor
appetite for riskier assets.  The currency of Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted
eastern member, appreciated 0.3 percent to 286.79 per euro by
10:23 a.m. in Budapest. The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
weakened, lifting yields seven basis points to 8.544 percent.  Finance ministers awarded Greece 130 billion euros ($173
billion) in aid, engineered a central-bank profits transfer and
forced investors to provide more debt relief in a deal that will
support the nation past a March bond repayment.  “The forint extended yesterday’s rally thanks to the Greek
agreement early this morning,” Levente Papa, a currency and
fixed-income strategist at  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, and colleagues wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
