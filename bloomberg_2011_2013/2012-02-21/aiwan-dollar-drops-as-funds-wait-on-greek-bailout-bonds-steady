Taiwan ’s dollar fell for the first
time in three days after the island’s export orders dropped by
the most in more than two years. Government bonds rose.  The  Taiex (TWSE)  index of shares declined 0.4 percent after
official data yesterday showed export orders, an indication of
shipments in the next one to three months, fell 8.6 percent in
January from a year earlier. Euro-area finance ministers awarded
130 billion euros ($172 billion) in aid to  Greece  today after
talks in Brussels.  Foreign funds bought $38 million more local
stocks than they sold yesterday, compared with net inflows of
$266 million on Feb. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Inflows into Taiwan’s capital markets are slowing so the
currency remains in its range-trading mode around the current
level,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at Union Bank of
Taiwan in Taipei. “Investors are a bit cautious with limited
positive news that could boost the stock market.”  The  Taiwan dollar  slipped 0.1 percent to close at NT$29.568
against its U.S. counterpart in Taipei, according to Taipei
Forex Inc.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.282
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  Benchmark
10-year rates  gained one basis point to 1.281 percent, after
touching 1.26 percent on Feb. 16, the lowest closing level since
Dec. 19.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.397 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
