Lachlan Murdoch , the oldest son of
News Corp.’s Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch , left London
before this weekend’s release of a Sunday version of the Sun
tabloid, a spokeswoman said today.  Lachlan accompanied his father on the trip in place of
younger brother James, News Corp.’s deputy chief operating
officer, who was occupied with other business, according to the
New York-based company. The Murdochs flew to the U.K. to
reassure employees after reporters were arrested in a bribery
probe. Rupert Murdoch said he will stay for several weeks to
oversee the release of the new Sunday tabloid under the Sun
masthead.  Lachlan spent two hours touring the newsroom on Feb. 17.
Lachlan, 40, stepped away from  News Corp. (NWSA)  in 2005 to focus on
businesses outside of his family. This month, he was named
chairman of Ten Networks, an Australian television broadcaster.
News Corp. has been battling allegations that its U.K. reporters
hacked into voicemails and paid police and other public
officials for stories.  Evidence of hacking led to the closing of the company’s
News of the World Sunday tabloid and police investigations have
resulted in more than two dozen arrests.  Ten employees of the Sun have been arrested so far and
Lachlan’s brother James, who oversaw the U.K. operations, has
been compelled to appear before Parliament to testify about how
much he knew.  To contact the reporters on this story:
