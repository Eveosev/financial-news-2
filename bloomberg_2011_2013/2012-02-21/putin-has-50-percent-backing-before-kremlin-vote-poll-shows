Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s support remained at 50 percent for a second week,
suggesting he’ll win March 4 elections in the first round of
voting, according to the Public Opinion Foundation.  “I don’t expect any serious changes to these numbers,”
Grigory Kertman, a senior analyst at the foundation, which is
also known as FOM, said today by phone. Putin needs more than 50
percent backing to avoid a second round of balloting.  A runoff would pit the premier against the second-placed
candidate, currently Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov with 9
percent, according to FOM. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who heads the
 Liberal Democratic Party , is next with 6 percent, followed by
billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov  with 5 percent and the Just Russia
party’s Sergei Mironov with 3 percent. The pollster surveyed
3,000 likely voters Feb. 18-19. It didn’t give a margin of
error.  A separate poll published Feb. 17 by the state-run All-
Russian Center for the Study of  Public Opinion , known as VTsIOM,
put Putin’s support at 55 percent. Putin will win with 58.6
percent of the vote, VTsIOM predicted yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
