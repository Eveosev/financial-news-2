Asad Shafiq and  Azhar Ali  both hit
half centuries for Pakistan to set England a target of 238 to
win their fourth one-day cricket international in Dubai and
sweep the series.  Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat, and lost Mohammad
Hafeez on 1 when he was caught by Craig Kieswetter off Jade
Dernbach. Pakistan recovered to 202-4, with Shafiq bowled by Tim
Bresnan on 65, and Ali caught by Eoin Morgan on 58 off Dernbach.
 Shoaib Malik  was trapped leg-before-wicket by Danny Briggs,
leaving Pakistan on 202-5, and it lost the rest of the wickets
for 35 runs.  Dernbach was 4-45, while Steve Finn and Briggs, making his
ODI debut for England, both took two wickets.  England  has already won the one-day series, having taken
the first three matches. Pakistan swept their three Test
matches, and the two will go on to play three Twenty20 matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
