Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest
maker of wireless networking equipment, renamed its Multimedia
business unit as the Support Solutions division after
strengthening services for billing and charging systems.  The unit will include mobile commerce systems such as
electronic wallets integrated with calling accounts, Stockholm-
based Ericsson said in a statement. It is shutting a consumer
money transfer service opened last year and announced a suite of
new mobile wallet products.  In January, Ericsson completed its  purchase  of Telcordia, a
Bell Labs spinoff that makes charging and billing systems, to
expand in  information systems  for telephone companies. Billing
is increasingly central to phone companies’ strategy as they
seek to maximize profits from consumer use of Internet services
such as Facebook and video.  “We will capture the growth momentum in selected areas and
leverage our acquisition of Telcordia,” said Per Borgklint, who
heads the division. “We already have a leading position in key
areas such as charging and billing where we serve 1.6 billion
people with our solutions.”  Ericsson’s television and media products for operators and
content owners will continue to be part of the unit, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
