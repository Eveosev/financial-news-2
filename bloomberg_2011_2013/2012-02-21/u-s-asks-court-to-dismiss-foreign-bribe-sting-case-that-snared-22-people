The U.S. asked a court to dismiss
the biggest prosecution of individuals accused of foreign
bribery after two trials in the case ended with acquittals and
hung juries.  The U.S. Justice Department today requested that a federal
judge in  Washington  dismiss the indictment, which originally
accused 22 security-industry officials of planning to make
payments to a federal agent posing as a representative of the
West African country of Gabon to secure a stake in a fake $15
million weapons deal.  It was the first time the government used a sting operation
involving undercover techniques to charge violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  In its filing, the government said it “carefully
considered” the outcomes of the first two trials of 10
defendants and the impact of rulings in those cases on future
trials of the remaining defendants, as well as the resources
needed to continue with “another four or more” trials.  “Continued prosecution of this case is not warranted under
the circumstances,” according to the filing.  The government asked that the case be dismissed with
prejudice, meaning it couldn’t try to charge the defendants
again for the same crimes.  Laura Sweeney , a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment beyond today’s filing.  The case is U.S. v. Goncalves, 09-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
