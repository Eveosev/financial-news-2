Medtronic Inc. (MDT) , the world’s biggest
maker of heart-rhythm devices, said fiscal third-quarter profit
increased 1.2 percent as rising global demand for pacemakers
eased a slump in sales of defibrillators and spinal products.  Net income  in the three months ended Jan. 27 rose to $935
million, or 88 cents a share, from $924 million, or 86 cents, a
year earlier, the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement.
Profit excluding one-time items was 84 cents a share, matching
the average of 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Medtronic struggled for the past 18 months with sluggish
growth of existing products and falling pretax income, even as
it introduced a raft of new devices for the spine, bowel and
heart, said  Michael Weinstein , a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst in
New York. Revenue of $3.92 billion for the third quarter was $91
million below estimates, he said in a note to clients today.  “Divisional revenues were generally lower than expected
across the board,” said  Larry Biegelsen , a Wells Fargo
Securities analyst in New York, in a note to clients.
“Implantable cardioverter defibrillator and spine sales were
much weaker than expected,” he said.  Demand for defibrillators, used to shock a stopped heart
back into a normal rhythm, continued to plummet, with sales
dropping 8.3 percent to $674 million. Sales of spinal products
also fell, led by a 20 percent drop in demand for biologics such
as its embattled bone-growth product Infuse.  Sales of pacemakers were $467 million, up 3.8 percent.
Global demand for the company’s new drug-coated stents and heart
valves boosted cardiovascular sales 8.1 percent to $837 million.  The company forecast  earnings  to $3.44 to $3.47 per share
for fiscal 2012, from $3.43 to $3.50, including dilution from
the January 2011 acquisition of Ardian Inc. Analysts currently
estimate earnings of $3.45 per share for the year.  Medtronic  fell  2.4 percent to $38.99 at 4:05 p.m. in  New
York  Stock Market composite trading. The shares have declined
5.5 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
