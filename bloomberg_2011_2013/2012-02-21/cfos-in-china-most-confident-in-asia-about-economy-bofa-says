Chief financial officers in  China 
expressed more confidence in their local economy than their
peers in other Asian nations, according to a survey conducted by
Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The 7.5 ranking for the confidence the CFOs had in the
Chinese economy compared with a regional average of 5.9 for
 Asia , according to a statement distributed before a briefing
today in Beijing.  Inflation (CNCPIYOY)  was the issue that CFOs in China
were most-concerned about, according to the statement.  Seventy-five CFOs in China took part in the survey, which
was based on a total of 465 interviews with financial executives
in  India , Australia,  Japan  and other parts of Asia conducted
from Sept. 28 to Nov. 30. The executives were CFOs for companies
with at least $500 million of annual revenue, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch.  Foreign competition was cited by 35 percent of the CFOs in
the survey as being a significant concern, according to the
statement. When asked where they thought that competition would
come from, 72 percent said China, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
