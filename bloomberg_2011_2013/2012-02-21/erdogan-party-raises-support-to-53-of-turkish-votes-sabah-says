Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s party has increased its support by more than 3
percentage points to 53 percent since the elections in June,
Sabah reported, citing a survey by Sonar Arastirma.  The governing  Justice and Development Party , or AKP, is
successful according to 51 percent of the survey’s 3,000
participants from 26 cities and 30 villages, the Istanbul-based
newspaper  said . A third of the people said AKP isn’t successful.  Support for the main opposition  Republican People’s Party ,
or CHP, declined to 20 percent from 26 percent in last year’s
parliamentary election, while the Nationalist Action Party, or
MHP, raised its share of the votes by 3 percentage points to 16
percent, Sabah said, citing Sonar. The pro-Kurdish Peace and
Democracy Party, or BDP, would get 7 percent support in an
election today, Sonar said, according to Sabah.  The Sonar poll shows that  Turkey ’s most important  issues 
are economic problems and inflation, according to 71 percent of
the participants, followed by unemployment and terrorism, Sabah
reported. No margin of error was given for the survey, which was
conducted earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
