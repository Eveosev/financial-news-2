Societe Generale SA (GLE)  is raising 1.75
billion euros from a sale of senior unsecured fixed- and
floating-rate notes, according to a banker involved in the
transaction.  The bank is selling 1 billion euros of floaters maturing in
September 2013 that will be priced to yield 88 basis points more
than Euribor, the banker said. The lender is also raising 750
million euros from fixed-rate bonds due in March 2017 that will
price at 222 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
