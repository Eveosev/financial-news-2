Wuhan East Lake High Technology
Group Co. (600133) , which develops and runs an industrial zone in central
 China , rose the most in a year after saying it would buy
construction assets from its largest shareholder.  The shares gained by the 10 percent daily limit to 9.67
yuan as of 1:51 p.m. in  Shanghai  trading, the biggest increase
since February of 2011. China’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.1 percent.  State-owned  United Investment Group , Wuhan East Lake’s
largest shareholder with 14.36 percent, will sell its  Hubei
Provincial Road & Bridge Co.  unit for not more than 96.4 million
new Wuhan East Lake shares priced at 9.55 yuan each, the company
said in a statement to Shanghai’s Stock Exchange yesterday after
markets closed. Wuhan East Lake’s shares resumed trading today
after an almost 10-month suspension.  United Investment will hold 28.3 percent of the company
after the transaction, said Wuhan East Lake, which through its
subsidiaries also operates pharmaceutical manufacturing and
software development businesses.  “This restructuring will maximize the growth of the
company’s profitability, resolve business risks, and rebuild the
company’s business focus,”according to the statement. The
company is based in Wuhan, capital of the central Chinese
province of Hubei.  Wuhan East Lake said its 2010 net income fell 75.3 percent
to 17.59 million yuan and it accumulated a net loss of 77.14
million yuan in the nine months to September 2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
