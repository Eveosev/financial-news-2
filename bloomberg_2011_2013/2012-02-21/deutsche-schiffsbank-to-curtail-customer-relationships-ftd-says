Commerzbank AG (CBK) ’s Deutsche
Schiffsbank unit plans to limit business relationships to
customers deemed strategically important,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported in a preview of an article to be published
tomorrow.  The bank’s shipping finance book will therefore become
smaller, FTD reported, citing an interview with Stefan Otto, a
spokesman for the board. Schiffsbank’s integration into
Commerzbank should be completed this quarter, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
