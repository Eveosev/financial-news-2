earlier losses, as an agreement to secure a second bailout for
 Greece  overshadowed concern that rising oil prices threaten
corporate earnings.  HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest lender by market value,
climbed 1.3 percent. Wharf Holdings Ltd. slipped 1.1 percent
after jumping 6 percent last week.  Air China Ltd. (753) , the world’s
largest airline by market value, slipped 1.6 percent on
speculation rising fuel costs will crimp earnings.  The Hang Seng Index added 0.3 percent to 21,478.72 as of
the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong, reversing losses of as much as 1
percent. The gauge rose to a six-month high on Feb. 17. The Hang

Hong Kong gained 0.2 percent to 11,689.69.  “Valuations remain attractive despite recent strong
gains,” said  Castor Pang , head of research at Core-Pacific

reluctant to put more money in the market as short-term
indicators show the market is overbought. Even with a Greek
bailout deal, there are still many variables in  Europe ,
particularly with regard to refinancing for Italy and Spain.”  HSBC, Esprit  Euro-area leaders today reached agreement on a second
bailout package for Greece that is vital to staving off a
default next month. The deal includes a 53.5 percent writedown

ended Oct. 15, 2010. The rally drove the gauge’s 14-day  relative
strength index , a measure of momentum, to about 74 on Feb. 17,
exceeding the threshold of 70 that indicates to some traders
it’s overbought.  Wharf Holdings, the fourth best performer in the  Hang Seng
Index (HSI)  this year, slipped 1.1 percent to HK$47.65.  Hang Lung
Properties Ltd. (101) , Hong Kong’s third-largest developer by market
value, dropped 1.7 percent to HK$29.35 after climbing 8 percent
last week.  Transport Companies  The Hang Seng Index climbed 16 percent this year through
