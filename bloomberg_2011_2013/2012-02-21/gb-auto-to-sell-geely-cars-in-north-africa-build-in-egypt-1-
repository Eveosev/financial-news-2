GB Auto (AUTO) , the biggest independent car
assembler in the  Middle East , said it signed an agreement with
 Geely Automobile Holding Ltd. (175)  to assemble the Chinese passenger
cars in Egypt and distribute them in North Africa.  The Cairo-based automotive company will sell Geely
passenger cars in “select high-growth markets across North
Africa,” it said in an e-mailed statement today. It will start
by selling two models in Egypt in the second quarter and
assemble vehicles starting in the third quarter. GB Auto will
continue to build Hyundai Verna models, it said.  “We selected Geely after an exhaustive global search,” GB
Auto’s chairman and chief executive officer Raouf Ghabbour said
in the statement. Geely products offer “the best value for
money in a critical segment that meets our consumers’ needs and
expectations.”  GB Auto has been assembling variations of the Hyundai
Accent, a four-cylinder sedan, in Egypt since 1995. That
agreement is due to finish at the end of 2013, Ghabbour said in
November. The company had about a 32-percent share of the
Egyptian passenger car market in 2011.  Shares of GB Auto  gained 0.9 percent yesterday to 23.61
Egyptian pounds, bringing their gain this year to 13 percent.
That compares with a 42-percent climb for the benchmark  EGX 30
Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
