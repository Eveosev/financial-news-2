Charter Hall Office REIT (CQO) , the
takeover target of two overseas funds, posted a loss after the
sale of seven U.S. properties and said it will pay investors 48
Australian cents a share from the divestitures.  The Australian property trust swung to a loss of A$59.9
million ($64.2 million) in the six months to Dec. 31, compared
with net income of A$64.8 million a year earlier, the Sydney-
based company said in a statement. Operating earnings, which
exclude gains and losses on investments, rose 1.4 percent to
A$65 million.  Charter Hall Office in August agreed to sell its U.S.
assets for $1.71 billion to entities affiliated with Beacon
Capital Partners, as it shifts its focus homeward, and has so
far received proceeds of about A$241 million from the completed
sales, it said today. Shareholders are expected to receive a
total of about A$1.11 a share when all the sales are completed,
it said.  The trust is also the subject of a A$1.2 billion takeover
bid by Government of Singapore Investment Corp. affiliate and a
Canadian pension fund.  Shareholders will vote on the offer by GICâ€™s Reco Ambrosia
Pte and The Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada on
March 15, and will receive A$2.49 a share on or soon after the
anticipated March 30 closing date, the company said today.  Charter Hall Office  shares  were unchanged at A$3.55 at the
close of trading in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
