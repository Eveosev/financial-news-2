Chinese equities  traded in the U.S.
slipped the most in two weeks on speculation the second
reduction in banks’ reserve requirements in two months won’t be
enough to bolster credit in the world’s second largest economy.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. sank 2 percent to 106.66 yesterday in New
York, the biggest decline since Feb. 6. Refiner  China Petroleum
and Chemical Corp. (SNP)  tumbled the most since May 2009 as the price
of oil surged to a nine-month high. Software developer AsiaInfo-
Linkage Inc. surged 11 percent after a report that KKR & Co. and
TPG Capital may bid for the company.  The People’s Bank of China said on Feb. 18 that the amount
lenders must keep in reserve will be cut by 50 basis points,
following a similar reduction in December. This won’t be enough
to alleviate a cash shortage that started in the fourth quarter,
and China’s slowing housing market may force further monetary
easing, according to Credit Agricole CIB.  Home prices  posted
their worst performance in at least a year in January,
government data on Feb. 20 showed.  “The incremental nature of this recent announcement
underlines the slow pace with which the PBOC intends to loosen
policy,”  Michael Shaoul , chairman of New York-based Marketfield
Asset Management, which manages $1.5 billion, including Chinese
stocks, said in an interview. “This is a very moderate easing
that still keeps the  reserve requirements  far above the levels
that were seen prior to the massive build-up in local liquidity
during 2009 to 2010.”  China ETF Drops  China’s monetary authority had raised the reserve-
requirement ratio for the biggest banks by 600 basis points, or
6 percentage points, between the end of 2008 and June last year
in a bid to tame inflation and prevent a price bubble in the
housing market. Standard Chartered Plc predicts at least three
more cuts to the ratios this year, while HSBC Holdings Plc sees
a minimum of two.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 0.8 percent to
$39.93, the biggest one-day drop since Feb. 10. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  was little changed at 1,362.21. U.S. markets
were closed Feb. 20 for a public holiday.  American depositary receipts of China Petroleum,  Asia ’s
biggest oil refiner known as Sinopec, sank 7.4 percent to
$111.76, the biggest slump since May 11, 2009, on speculation
rising  oil prices  may see losses for the company’s refining
business.  The ADRs, each representing 100 common shares in the
company, traded 1.1 percent below Sinopec’s Hong Kong-traded
stock, which has declined 6.4 percent over the past two trading
days to HK$8.76, the equivalent of $1.13 per share.  Oil Surge  Crude oil for March delivery climbed to $105.84 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement price
since May 4. Euro-area finance ministers agreeing on a second
bailout for debt-stricken  Greece  and  Iran  halting sales of oil
to  France  and Britain on Feb. 20, according to an official news
website, bolstered prices.  Graham Cunningham, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Citigroup
Inc.,  downgraded  Sinopec to “neutral” from “buy” on Feb. 20,
while cutting its 12-month price target to HK$9.90 from
HK$10.90.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore oil explorer, fell 4.7
percent to $221.85 in New York, the biggest one-day drop since
Nov. 21.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 0.8 percent to
2,381.43 yesterday, the highest level since Dec. 1. The yuan
strengthened 0.1 percent to 6.2964 per dollar, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  Shrinking Margin  ADRs of online travel agency  Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP) 
fell the most in two months tumbled 7 percent to $22.96 in New
York, the biggest one-day drop since Dec. 8. Each ADR represents
0.25 common shares in the Shanghai-based company. Ctrip’s
competitor  Elong Inc. (LONG) , whose biggest shareholder is U.S. online
travel agency Expedia Inc., climbed 1.5 percent to $17.37 in  New
York , the highest level since September.  Operating margin , a measure of profitability, excluding
stock compensation will decline to 30 percent this year, from 35
percent in 2011, Ctrip’s Chief Financial Officer Jie Sun said on
a conference call on Feb. 20. First-quarter sales will rise
between 15 percent to 20 percent from a year earlier, the
company said in a Feb. 20 statement, slowing from 30 percent
growth a year ago.  “The stock may come under pressure in the near term given
unfavorable margin trends and heightened competition,” Andy Yeung, a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer & Co Inc. wrote
in a note yesterday, cutting his 12-month price target for the
stock to $34 from $42 while maintaining an “outperform”
rating.  Stock Downgrades  Fawne Jiang, an equity analyst at Brean Murray Carret &
Co., cut her recommendation on Ctrip to “sell” from “hold”
yesterday. Jin Yu, a Shanghai-based analyst at  China 
International Capital Corp., downgraded Ctrip to “hold” from
“accumulate.”  Sina Corp. (SINA) , which provides a Twitter-like service in China,
retreated 5.5 percent to a more-than three-week low of $64.05 as
analysts forecast fourth-quarter profitability may have
declined, with the company’s earnings report due on Feb. 27.  Gross margin dropped to 55.7 percent last quarter, from
56.1 percent in the third quarter of 2011 and 57.8 percent a
year ago, according to the  average estimate  of nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter sales gained 23 percent to
$129.6 million, compared with the company’s forecast of $128
million to $131 million provided on Nov. 8.  AsiaInfo Bidders  AsiaInfo, which sells telecommunications software to
China’s biggest wireless carriers, jumped 11 percent to $12.95,
the highest level since Aug. 3. Private-equity firms including
KKR and TPG are lining up potential bids for Beijing-based
AsiaInfo in a deal that may be worth more than $1 billion,
Reuters reported today, citing people they didn’t identify with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Jessica Barist Cohen, who is responsible for AsiaInfo’s
investor relations in New York, didn’t return a call seeking
comment.  Owen Blicksilver , a spokesman for TPG, declined to
comment on the report, while  Kristi Huller , a spokeswoman for
KKR, also declined to comment.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics are scheduled to
release their preliminary Chinese manufacturing index for this
month, known as the Flash PMI, today. The gauge was at 48.8 in
January, below the 50 threshold for expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
