Emirates Telecommunications Corp.
advanced the most this month after the United Arab Emirates’
biggest phone company said it planned to outsource some
operations to cut costs and proposed a 2011 dividend.  Shares of the company also known as Etisalat surged as much
as 3 percent, the most since Jan. 29, to 9.6 dirhams before
trading at 9.52 dirhams at 12:53 p.m. in the U.A.E. capital,  Abu
Dhabi . The stock has the  heaviest weighting  on emirate’s index
and was the biggest gainer by index points today. The  ADX
General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.9 percent to 2,526.62, the highest intraday
level since Oct. 3. It’s advanced 5.2 percent so far in 2012
after last year’s  12 percent  drop.  “There is some excitement on cost cutting,” said Shehzad Janab, the head of asset management at Dubai-based Daman
Investments. He added investors were also responding to
Etisalat’s dividend plan. The company’s board proposed yesterday
a dividend of 60 fils for 2011, the same amount it paid for
2010.  Etisalat, which has posted declining profit for the past
two years, said late yesterday it was looking at ways to reduce
costs and improve services. The company that derives about  three
quarters of its revenue  from the U.A.E. has lost market share to
Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co., known as Du.
Etisalat’s shares, which fell 15 percent last year, are up 4.5
percent so far this year.  The company’s board “discussed the reduction and control
of operating expenditures by initiating restructuring and
outsourcing plans as a future strategy,” it said in an e-mailed
statement.  Etisalat missed analysts’ estimates when it reported on
Feb. 9 a 23 percent  drop in 2011 profit  to 5.84 billion dirhams,
compared with the 7 billion-dirham  mean estimate  of nine
analysts. Earnings suffered from an impairment of 1.02 billion
dirhams ($278 million) related to canceled licenses in  India .  Six analysts  recommend  investors buy Etisalat shares, while
four have a hold recommendation on the stock, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
