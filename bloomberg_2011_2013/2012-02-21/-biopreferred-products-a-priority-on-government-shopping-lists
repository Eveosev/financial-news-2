The U.S. federal government will
increase its emphasis on purchases of bio-based products as a
way to bring jobs to rural areas, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  Federal workers will also get training in buying items
labeled “BioPreferred,” Vilsack said today on a conference
call with reporters. More than 3,000 companies now create about
20,000 bio-based products including cleaning agents, paints,
lubricants and personal-care goods from renewable sources,
Vilsack said.  The goal is to create “more contracts, more opportunities
for these bio-based businesses,” Vilsack said on the call,
which included Commerce Secretary  John Bryson . “That should
lead to more jobs in rural America.”  The BioPreferred labeling program, begun in 2009,
identifies products make from renewable sources such as corn,
with a goal of lowering petroleum consumption. To qualify for
the designation, an item must contain enough renewable material
to meet or exceed U.S. Department of Agriculture-specified
standards.  The government also said it will provide $15 million in
awards for projects that promote regional  job creation , and
increase efforts to help community and technical colleges train
new health information-technology workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
