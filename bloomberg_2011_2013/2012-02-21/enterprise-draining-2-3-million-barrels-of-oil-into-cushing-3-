Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  have begun draining about 2.3 million barrels of
oil from the Seaway pipeline into tanks at Cushing,  Oklahoma , as
they prepare to reverse the line’s flow to take oil to U.S. Gulf
Coast refiners.  The work began over the weekend, said Randy Burkhalter, a
Houston-based vice president of  investor relations  at
Enterprise, who declined to say how long it would take. The
reversed flow is expected to begin by June 1, he said.  “The market has been anticipating this purge and had
expected it to start February 15,” said Abudi Zein, a senior
vice president at Genscape Inc., an energy information provider.
“This will push storage higher, but the effect on prices should
be muted.”  Enterprise and Enbridge announced Nov. 16 the reversed line
would have an initial capacity of about 150,000 barrels a day.
Pump modifications expected to be completed by early 2013 will
boost daily capacity to 400,000 barrels, Enbridge said.  The Seaway pipeline is emptying at a rate of about 90,000
barrels a day, according to Zein.  The line held 2.3 million
barrels before the purge began, he said.  Genscape has been monitoring consistently higher pumping on
the line since Feb. 18, Zein said. Louisville, Kentucky-based
Genscape uses remote sensing technology to measure power
consumed by pipeline pumping stations. The energy used is
proportional to the power required to ship the crude, according
to the company’s  website .  Inventories at Cushing climbed 2 million barrels to 32.5
million in the week ended Feb. 10, the highest level since Sept.
2, according to the Energy Department. Last year’s peak of 41.9
million was the highest since the department began publishing
Cushing data in 2004.  Oil for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
touched $106.07 today, the highest intraday price since May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
