Aareal Bank AG (ARL) , the German lender
that provides property financing in more than 25 countries in
 Europe ,  Asia  and  North America , said full-year profit climbed 50
percent after gains in commission and interest income.  Net income rose to 114 million euros ($151 million) from 76
million euros a year earlier, the Wiesbaden, Germany-based
lender said in a statement today. Fourth-quarter profit was 29
million euros, Aareal said, without providing a year-earlier
figure. Net commission income rose 17 percent while net interest
income climbed 7.5 percent.  Aareal expects a “considerable decline” in net interest
income this year as it counters uncertainties stemming from
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis with “a very cautious liquidity
and investment strategy.” While the lender forecasts loan-loss
provisions of 110 million euros to 140 million euros this year,
Aareal said it can’t “rule out additional allowances for
unexpected credit losses.”  “Within the scope of the sovereign debt crisis that is
still unresolved, the management board believes financial
markets will remain volatile during the current year and
therefore expects the risks in the financial system to
persist,” Aareal said in the statement. “The risks in relation
to economic development have also increased in recent months.”  Aareal had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.3 percent at the
end of last year and a core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial
strength, of 11.3 percent, the German lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
