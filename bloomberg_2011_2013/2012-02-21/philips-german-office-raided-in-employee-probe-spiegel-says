Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA) ’s
Hamburg, Germany office was raided by police today investigating
an employee of the company accused of corruption,  Spiegel
 reported.  A 56-year-old employee is alleged to have sent two public
officials invitations to a conference in Dortmund in September,
prompting 38 police officers to raid the company’s German
headquarters, according to the magazine.  Steve Klink, an Amsterdam-based spokesman for Philips,
confirmed that the raid had taken place and said the company was
cooperating with the police with their inquiries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
