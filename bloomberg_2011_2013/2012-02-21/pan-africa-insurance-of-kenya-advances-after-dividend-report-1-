Pan Africa Insurance Holdings Ltd. (PAIL) ,
the Kenyan unit of  South Africa ’s  Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , rose to its
highest intraday level in almost a month after it proposed a
dividend.  The insurer gained as much as 3.8 percent to 20.5 shillings
as of 11:39 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at this level
would be the highest since Jan. 4, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Pan Africa plans to pay 2 shillings a share dividend.  “The dividend yield is 10 percent, that is pretty high,”
Cynthia Omondi, an analyst at Nairobi-based African Alliance
Kenya Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
“People want to participate in the dividend.”  Shareholders will vote on the proposed dividend during an
annual general meeting May. 16, the company said yesterday.
Profit for the year through December fell 25 percent to 443.4
million shillings ($5.32 million) following poor performance of
investments in stocks and bonds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
