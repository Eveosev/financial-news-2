Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG)  slid for a
second day, leading Czech shares down, as speculation a Greek
bailout deal won’t solve the nation’s debt crisis hurt demand
for riskier assets in  Europe .  The Austrian company slid 1 percent to 853 koruna by 11:59
a.m. in Prague, adding to a 1.8 percent drop yesterday. The  PX (PX) 
equity index, where VIG has a 13 percent weighting, retreated
0.2 percent to 1,016.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
