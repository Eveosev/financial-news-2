Kenya ’s Parliament may decide as
early as today on a date to debate lawmakers’ bid to remove
central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u from his post.  The house business committee is set to meet to discuss
Parliament’s agenda for next week, Adan Keynan, chairman of the
panel of lawmakers that made the recommendation, said in a phone
interview from Nairobi, the capital.  A panel of lawmakers set up to study the shilling’s drop to
a record low of 106.75 per dollar on Oct. 11 wants President
Mwai Kibaki to form a tribunal to investigate whether Ndung’u’s
actions contributed to the currency’s slump, according to the
committee’s report presented to Parliament on Feb. 14. Ndung’u,
who should vacate his post during the probe, didn’t “react in
good time” to the shilling’s decline, resulting in a hoarding
of foreign currency and speculative trading, the panel said.  Samson Burgei, a spokesman for the Central Bank of Kenya,
declined to comment when called on his mobile phone today.  Ndung’u, a 52-year-old former economics professor at the
University of Nairobi, was re-appointed for a second, four-year
term as governor of the central bank in March 2011. The shilling
has gained 25 percent against the dollar since a record low as
the central bank increased its benchmark  interest rate  by 11
percentage points to a record 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
