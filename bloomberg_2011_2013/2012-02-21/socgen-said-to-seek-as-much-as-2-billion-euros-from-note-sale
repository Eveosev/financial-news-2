Societe Generale (GLE)  SA will raise as
much as 2 billion euros from its two-part sale of senior
unsecured bonds, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The offering includes an 18-month floating-rate note
portion of as much as 1 billion euros that may be priced at 88
to 90 basis points more than Euribor, the person said. A five-
year fixed-rate tranche of up to 1 billion euros may yield 222
to 225 basis points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, the
person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
