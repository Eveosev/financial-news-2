Ethanol declined the most in three
weeks as corn fell on signs that demand for the grain may ease.  The biofuel dropped 1.4 percent. Corn futures decreased for
the first time in three days on speculation that near-record
supplies of ethanol will reduce purchases of the biggest U.S.
crop, the primary ingredient in U.S. production of the
alternative fuel.  “Ethanol followed corn,”  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest
in  Chicago , said by telephone. “Ethanol prices are down due to
the big break in the corn market.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery declined 3.1 cents to
$2.184 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn for May
delivery fell 1.8 percent to $6.335 a bushel.  Stockpiles in the U.S. rose for a ninth straight week to an
all-time high of 21.5 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 10,
the Energy Department said. Daily output is down 3.6 percent
from the record set in December.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the  Gulf
Coast  at $2.225 a gallon and in  New York  at $2.24, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol in Chicago was unchanged at
$2.175 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive was steady at
$2.295.  The biofuel is blended with gasoline to augment supply and
meet federal mandates. There are 209 ethanol distilleries in the
U.S., with the capacity to produce 14.8 billion gallons
annually, according to the  Renewable Fuels Association , a
Washington-based trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
