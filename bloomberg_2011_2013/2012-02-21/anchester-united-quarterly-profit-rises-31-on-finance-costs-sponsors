Manchester United’s (MNU)  second-quarter
profit rose 31 percent as the defending Premier League soccer
champion reduced its finance costs and paid less tax.  Net income was 10.5 million pounds ($16.6 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared to 8 million pounds in the
year-earlier period, MU Finance Plc said today in its website.
Net finance costs declined 3 million pounds to 12.2 million
pounds, while revenue rose 8.7 percent to 101.3 million pounds.  The record 19-time English champion benefited from a
sponsorship deal with shipping company DHL and extra broadcast
income. Commercial revenue rose 14 percent to 29 million pounds.
The team reduced debt by 69 million pounds to 439 million pounds
and was left with 50.9 million pounds in cash and equivalents at
the end of the period.  United, which leads Real  Madrid  as soccer’s most valuable
brand according to a report by Brand Finance Plc, got approval
from Singapore’s stock exchange in September to raise about $1
billion in an initial public offering. The team hasn’t set a
date for the sale.  United has continued to repurchase its bonds, and bought
5.3 million pounds worth in the quarter. It now owns 92.8
million pounds of its senior secured notes. The team will
continue to hold them and they may be sold back to the market
depending on the club’s needs, it said today.  Six-Month Results  In the six-month period, United’s commercial revenue rose
16.3 percent to 58.6 million pounds on the accord for DHL to
sponsor its training uniform, a profit-sharing agreement with
jersey supplier Nike Inc. and other sponsorships. The DHL
contract is worth 40 million pounds over four years.  Media income rose 13.4 percent to 60.9 million pounds on a
bigger share of broadcast revenue from  Champions League 
organizer UEFA, while ticket and hospitality sales at Old
Trafford rose 5.9 percent to 55.5 million pounds.  United’s broadcast share increased because it won the
Premier League. Coach  Alex Ferguson ’s team dropped out of this
season’s Champions League after the group phase for the first
time in six years.  Staff costs rose 14.7 percent to 76.5 million pounds on
higher player salaries and employees hired to support the growth
of United’s sponsorship and commercial operations. Net finance
costs almost doubled to 31.6 million pounds, in the six month
period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
