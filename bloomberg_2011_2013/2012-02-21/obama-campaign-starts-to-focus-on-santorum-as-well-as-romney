President  Barack Obama ’s re-election
campaign is now focusing on former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum ’s record in addition to  Mitt Romney ’s, marking a shift
for a campaign that has directed most of its fire on the former
Massachusetts governor.  “Governor Mitt Romney and Senator Rick Santorum claim they
will champion spending cuts deep enough to cut taxes and balance
the budget,”  James Kvaal , the campaign’s policy director, said
in a memo e-mailed to reporters. “In fact, they have both
proposed irresponsible and reckless tax plans that would drive
up the deficit by trillions of dollars, while their claims to
balance the budget through spending cuts are completely
unrealistic.”  While Romney and Santorum have both won Republican
presidential nominating contests in four states, the Obama
campaign had been directing most of its criticism at Romney. A
national  Gallup daily tracking poll  of 1,194 registered
Republican voters released today shows Santorum leading Romney
by 10 percentage points, 36 percent to 26 percent. The margin
of error of the poll, covering Feb. 15-19, is plus or minus
four percentage points.  After a morning stop in  Ohio , Santorum spent much of
yesterday in the western part of Michigan, which along with
Arizona holds a primary on Feb. 28. Romney, who was born and
raised in Michigan, campaigned in Ohio ahead of its March 6
contest, saying he would present the best alternative to Obama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
