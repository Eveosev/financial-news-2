Telefonica SA (TEF)  said it will sell its
stake in satellite company Hispasat SA for 124 million euros
($164 million) to Abertis Telecom as  Spain ’s biggest phone
operator disposes of assets to reduce debt.  The sale of the 13.23% holding to  Abertis Infraestructuras
SA (ABE) ’s telecommunications unit is subject to government approval,
Madrid-based Telefonica said in a statement today. Telefonica’s
debt at the end of September was  55.43 billion euros .  “The sale is positive for Telefonica but it’s still too
small to cut debt in a significant way,” Andres Bolumburu, a
Madrid-based analyst at Banco Sabadell, said by phone. “All
steps taken toward cutting debt are good, but the company really
needs to keep selling more non-core assets and more valuable
ones.”  Telefonica cut its dividend in December for the first time
in a decade as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis hurt business.
Telefonica has reduced its stake in Hispasat from more than a
fifth since the satellite company was set up in 1989 and will
have no remaining holding after the sale to Abertis.  Telefonica reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 24
before the stock market opens in  Madrid .  Toll-road operator Abertis owns 33.4 percent of Hispasat,
while several state-owned entities own 25.7 percent, according
to a presentation sent by Telefonica today.  Telefonica shares have slipped 1.5 percent this year,
underperforming the 2.3 percent gain of the IBEX 35 Index, and
valuing the company at 60.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
