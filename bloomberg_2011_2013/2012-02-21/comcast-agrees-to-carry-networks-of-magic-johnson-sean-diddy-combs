Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S.
cable operator, agreed to distribute new independent networks
led by basketball hall of famer Earvin “Magic” Johnson and rap
artist Sean “Diddy” Combs.  Johnson and GMC TV, formerly the Gospel Music Channel, will
later this year introduce “Aspire,” a network targeted at
black families that will broadcast movies, comedy and
inspirational programs, according to a statement. Combs’s
“Revolt” will air in 2013 with live performances and music
videos.  Comcast agreed to carry 10 new independently owned and
operated networks as a provision of its acquisition of  NBC
Universal  in January 2011. Eight of the 10 will be owned and run
by Hispanic or black individuals, Comcast said last year.  Philadelphia-based Comcast also said it had agreed to
distribute two networks in the “Hispanic category.” Film
director  Robert Rodriguez  will spearhead “El Rey,” an English-
language network for Latino audiences. The company will also
carry “BabyFirst Americas,” a channel for infants.  Comcast  fell  0.7 percent to $28.98 at 11:40 a.m. in  New
York . The shares had gained 23 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
