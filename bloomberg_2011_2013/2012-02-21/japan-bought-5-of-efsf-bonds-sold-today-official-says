Japan  bought about 5 percent of the
debt sold by the European Financial Stability Facility today, a
Japanese Finance Ministry official said.  The government bought 100 million euros ($132 million) of
the 1.99 billion euros of bonds, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity because of the ministry’s policy.  China  and Japan, Asia’s two biggest economies, have pledged
support for efforts to resolve a European sovereign debt crisis
that threatens to drag down the global economy. A decline in
European stocks after Greece secured a second bailout today
indicated concern that the package may not solve the nation’s
long-term challenges.  The EFSF, designed to finance rescue packages for Greece,
Ireland and  Portugal , was downgraded by Standard & Poor’s last
month to AA+ from AAA after the ratings company cut its
assessments of France and Austria, two of the guarantor nations.
In a previous sale by the EFSF on Jan. 17, Japan bought 120
million euros of the 1.5 billion euros of bonds sold, the
official said previously.  Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi said Feb. 19 that his
nation and China are committed to help resolve Europe’s debt
crisis through the  International Monetary Fund  once euro-region
members take further steps themselves.  China is willing to get “more deeply” involved in
resolving the debt crisis, and Europe must send a clearer
message to show how it’s working to strengthen its finances,
Premier  Wen Jiabao  said Feb. 14 in Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
