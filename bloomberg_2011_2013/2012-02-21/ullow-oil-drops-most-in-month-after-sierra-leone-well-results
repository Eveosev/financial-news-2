Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  dropped the most in a
month after an exploration well in  Sierra Leone  showed the
reservoir may not be commercial.  Tullow, which holds a 20 percent interest in the Jupiter-1
well, dropped 3.6 percent to 1,543 pence in  London  trading, the
biggest decline since Jan. 18. The shares pared losses after the
company said it closed a $2.9 billion sale of assets in Uganda
that had been delayed.  “It appears the well was a technical success, but there
are questions about whether it’s commercially viable,”  said
Braden Purkis, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Corp. in London.
“That, combined with Tullow trading at 52-week highs as of
yesterday, as led people to think the company has gotten ahead
of itself.”  Tullow is trying to add reserves after unlocking new oil
provinces in Uganda, Ghana and French Guiana, where it has found
about 4 billion barrels since 2007. Shares reached a record
1,611 pence yesterday.  No potential reserves for the discovery were given by the
well’s operator  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  Spain’s Repsol SA is
also a partner in Jupiter-1.  Investec Securities Ltd. analyst Stuart Joyner said that
investors may want to “sell into strength” after the well
results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
