The  New York Yankees  have signed
All-Star outfielder Raul Ibanez to a one-year contract, the
Major League Baseball team announced today in a statement.  The terms of the contract weren’t announced. The  Associated
Press  reported yesterday that the deal was worth $1.1 million.  The 39-year-old outfielder batted .245 with 20 home runs
and 84 runs batted in last season with the  Philadelphia
Phillies . In a 16-year-career with the Phillies, Seattle
Mariners and Kansas City Royals, Ibanez has 252 home runs, 1,054
RBI and a .280 batting average.  Ibanez has hit at least 20 home runs in six of the last
seven seasons, including a career-high 34 in 2009, when he was
named to his only All-Star team. A Manhattan native, he has also
hit more than 30 doubles in each of his last 10 seasons, the
longest such active streak in baseball, according to the
release.  The Yankees were looking for a left-handed batter who can
share the designated-hitter role and also play occasionally in
the field.  All three of the Yankees’ primary outfielders from 2011 --
Curtis Granderson, Nick Swisher and  Brett Gardner  -- are still
with the team. Catcher Jorge Posada, who led the team in
appearances at DH last year, retired last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
