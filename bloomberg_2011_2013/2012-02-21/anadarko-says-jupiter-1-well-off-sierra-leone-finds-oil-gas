Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  said the
Jupiter-1 exploration well off  Sierra Leone  found oil and gas.  The well was drilled to 21,212 feet (6,465 meters) and
encountered 98 net feet of oil and gas, the company said in a
statement today. Repsol SA and  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  are partners in
the well, which was more than 15 miles (25 kilometers) from
Anadarko’s Mercury discovery.  Jupiter-1 will be plugged for further appraisal, while the
rig is used to drill a second Mercury well, Anadarko said.  Anadarko also reported a successful appraisal well at its
Lagosta gas discovery off Mozambique. The Lagosta-3 well
encountered 577 feet of gas in several layers, the company said.
Partners include Cove Energy Plc and Japan’s Mitsui & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
