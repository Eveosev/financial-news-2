China’s stocks fall, erasing gains,
as airlines and shipping companies declined on concern higher
 oil prices  will curb earnings growth.  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.1 percent to
2,361.08 at 10:34 a.m. local time, erasing an advance of as much
as 0.4 percent. The CSI 300 Index was little changed.
China Southern Airlines Co., the nation’s biggest domestic
carrier, slumped 0.8 percent to 5.06 yuan. Cosco Shipping Co.
declined 1.3 percent to 5.53 yuan. Oil traded near the highest
price in nine months in  New York  amid speculation supplies may
be disrupted after  Iran  said it halted some crude exports.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. rose 0.2 percent
to 4.41 yuan, pacing gains for lenders on the prospect the
government will take more measures to ease liquidity in the
financial system after announcing a cut in lenders’ reserve-
requirement ratios.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
