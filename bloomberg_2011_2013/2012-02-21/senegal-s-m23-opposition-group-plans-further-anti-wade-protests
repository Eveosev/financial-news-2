Two presidential candidates and the
opposition group Mouvement 23 plan to hold a protest in Dakar,
 Senegal ’s capital, as demonstrations against President  Abdoulaye
Wade  continue five days before the country votes.  The groups will gather at the Place de l’Independence, a
public square in the center of Dakar, later today, said Oumar
Diallo, a lawyer with Senegalese human-rights group Raddho,
which is part of M23. Candidates Idrissa Seck and Cheikh Bamba
Dieye are taking part, he said by phone today.  Place de l’Independence is “a symbolic place when you
think about Senegal’s independence,” Diallo said. Protests at
that location have not been authorized by Senegal’s government,
he said.  At least nine people have been killed and dozens injured in
the demonstrations where protesters have clashed with police,
 according  to U.K.-based  Amnesty International ’s Senegal office.
The protests started on Jan. 27 when the  Constitutional Court 
approved Wade’s bid to run for a third term in office in the
Feb. 26 election. The leader argued that a law limiting
presidential tenures to two didn’t apply to him because he was
already in office when it was enacted.  Wade faces 13 candidates in the vote. A second round will
be held next month if no one wins 50 percent of ballots.  A demonstration yesterday held by Y’en a Marre, another
group that opposes Wade’s third-term bid, was peaceful, said
Alioune Sane, a spokesman for the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
