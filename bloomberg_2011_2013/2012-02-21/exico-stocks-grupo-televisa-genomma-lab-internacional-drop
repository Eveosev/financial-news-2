The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:33 a.m. local time.  The IPC  index  fell 0.5 percent to 38,096.95.  Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB)  , the Mexican
producer of over-the-counter drugs, dropped 6.3 percent to 27
pesos. The company said it plans to acquire all shares of
Prestige Brands Holdings Inc. for $16.60 per share, valuing the
bid at $834 million, according to a filing today to the Mexican
stock exchange. The offer represents a 23 percent premium over
Prestige’s closing price on Feb. 17.  Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO)  , the world’s largest

The positive impact on cable and telecom profit margins from
lower interconnection rates in the second half of 2011 may be
“partially offset shortly” as the company faces pressure to
transfer part of the rate cut to clients, Gregorio Tomassi, an
analyst at Banco Santander SA, said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
