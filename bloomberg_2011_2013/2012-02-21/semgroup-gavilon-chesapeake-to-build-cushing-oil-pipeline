SemGroup Corp. (SEMG) , Gavilon Midstream
Energy LLC and an affiliate of  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  will form
a joint venture to build a pipeline to deliver crude oil to a
storage facility in Cushing,  Oklahoma , from production in
western and north central areas of the state.  The project is expected to be in service in the third
quarter of 2013, according to a statement today. The 210-mile
pipeline will have an initial capacity of 140,000 barrels a day
and can be expanded to 180,000 barrels.  Lateral lines from Alva and Arnett, Oklahoma, will
intersect and bring crude oil to a 1 million-barrel capacity
tank farm in Cushing.  Cushing is the largest U.S. oil-storage hub and delivery
point for crude futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The hub’s total capacity in operation was 66.5 million
barrels at the end of September, according to the Energy
Department.  Oklahoma’s oil production was 211,000 barrels a day in
September, department data show. It’s 8.8 percent higher than a
year earlier and the most since August 1998.  “The pipeline and storage facility will meet growing
midstream requirements resulting from the burgeoning drilling
activity in western Oklahoma and the Mississippi Lime play,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
