The  zinc  industry faces a “chronic
supply problem” as limited funding for smaller companies
hinders new-mine development, said Harlan Meade, the chief
executive officer of Canadian producer  Selwyn Resources Ltd.   About 550,000 metric tons of additional supply is needed in
the next few years to meet demand as older mines start to close
next year and the metal is more widely used in new applications
such as fertilizer, Meade said in a presentation today at the
 International Zinc Conference  in Rancho Mirage,  California . Zinc
is commonly used to rust-proof steel.  The appeal of zinc equities as an investment is less than
it is for other metals, and  debt capital  is expensive for small
producers that are often the ones who explore and develop new
mines, Meade said. The result will be high zinc  prices ,
sustained by “a chronic supply problem” and further industry
consolidation, he said.  “Mine-development financing is the major challenge for the
zinc industry,” Meade said. It is “a challenge that will be
difficult to overcome given the lack of market interest in zinc
companies.”  Zinc for delivery in three months rose 2.3 percent to
$2,028 a metric ton today on the London Metal Exchange. The
metal has gained 9.9 percent this year, after dropping 25
percent in 2011.  Selwyn, based in  Vancouver , explores for lead and zinc in
 Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
