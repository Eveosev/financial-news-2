First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, rose to the
highest in six months as investors bet it would pay dividends
for 2011, with the bank’s results expected as soon as next week.  The stock climbed for a sixth day, rising 4 percent to
11.37 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the highest since
Aug. 18. That takes its gain this year to 28 percent, compared
with a 1.2 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-
Share Index (NGSEINDX)  over the same period.  “Investors are taking position on the stock in
anticipation of getting dividends from the bank,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Lagos-based brokerage
Kundila Finance, said by phone today. “This is virtually the
end of February and the result is expected any moment from
now.”  Earnings at Nigerian lenders are rising after the west
African nation’s central bank fired eight chief executives of
the country’s 24 lenders and set up a state-owned company to buy
bad debts amassed in 2008 and 2009 and triggered by loans to
equity speculators. The central bank introduced a December
common year-end for the country’s lenders and 2011 results are
expected from the end of February.  Third-quarter net income rose 32 percent to 42.9 billion
naira ($273 million), First Bank said in a statement to the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange  on Oct. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
