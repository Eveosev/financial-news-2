Hungary’s rate-setting Monetary
Council will have to “keep in mind” the forint’s recent
strengthening and the easing of market tensions at its February
policy meeting, Reuters reported yesterday, citing central bank
Deputy Governor Ferenc Karvalits.  Talks with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union on financial assistance will be difficult as the
international lenders will want to see guarantees of faster
long-term  growth  and a sustainable debt path, the newswire cited
Karvalits as saying.  Asked about potential  rate  cuts after a financing agreement
is reached, Karvalits said internal and external uncertainties
were too numerous to forecast such a move, adding that the
bank’s Inflation Report due in March will be key, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
