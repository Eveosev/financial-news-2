BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  France ’s biggest
lender, is cutting 2011 bonuses by about half and Societe
Generale SA will reduce payouts 44 percent, adding to the list
of firms taking aim at compensation for investment bankers.  The following table updates Bloomberg’s compilation of pay
decreases at banks and securities firms, with summaries of the
terms. Links to news stories with more complete descriptions are
in the column at right.  Wall Street firms are curbing pay and changing compensation
formulas to limit expenses as they grapple with lower revenue.
Some are giving less cash and more stock, and others are
deferring a greater percentage of total pay. Revenue shrank last
year as mergers and trading slowed, turning financial stocks
into 2011’s worst performers in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Among the most recent disclosures:  --  Societe Generale (GLE) , based in Paris, cut the bonus pool at
its corporate and investment bank by “something like 44
percent,” said Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Oudea  in a Feb.
16 interview with Bloomberg Television.  -- BNP Paribas, also Paris-based, reduced by half the 2011
bonus pool for capital-markets professionals, Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said on Feb. 15.  --  UBS (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, cut its 2011 bonus pool
by 40 percent, and reduced bonuses at its investment bank by
60 percent, the Zurich-based company said on Feb. 7.
