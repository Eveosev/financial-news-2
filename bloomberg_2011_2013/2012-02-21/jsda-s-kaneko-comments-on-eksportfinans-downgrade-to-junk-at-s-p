Toshiyuki Kaneko, manager at the
planning unit of  Japan ’s Securities Dealers Association,
comments on the downgrade to junk of  Norway ’s Eksportfinans ASA.  Kaneko made the comments in an e-mail to Bloomberg news
received yesterday.  “It is a regret to learn that S&P downgraded its rating on
Eksportfinans on February 15 reportedly based on the discussion
with the Norwegian Government.”  “We have yet to receive any direct response from the
Norwegian Government. In the meantime, we will keep watching
closely how the things develop.”  “JSDA has not directly communicated with the bondholders
of Eksportfinans, but has been informed of their concerns
through the securities firms who are members of JSDA. Their main
concerns are; while not resulting in default, the downgrading of
the bonds brought about repercussions including substantial
decreases in market value of the bonds, inevitable disposal
based on pre-determined investment policies and exclusion of
Eksportfinans issues from indexes, and since a clear debt
repayment plan has not been presented, investors, particularly
those who hold longer-dated bonds, are anxious about the
company’s debt repayment in the future.”  “JSDA has already conveyed the above concerns to the
Norwegian government and Eksportfinans by the letter sent to
them. JSDA expects, for the sake of the bondholders, that the
debt repayment plan of Eksportfinans will be announced as soon
as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
