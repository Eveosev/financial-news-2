Macy’s Inc. (M) , the second-biggest U.S.
department-store chain, posted fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates after using promotions to lure shoppers
during the holiday season without cutting prices too deeply.  Net income in the three months ended Jan. 28 rose 12
percent to $745 million, or $1.74 a share, from $667 million, or
$1.55, a year earlier, Cincinnati-based Macy’s said in a
statement today. Excluding one-time items, Macy’s earned $1.70 a
share. Analysts projected $1.65, the average of 12  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Macy’s profitability shrank less than analysts projected as
it was able to sell women’s handbags and accessories with its
planned promotions rather than by slashing prices during the
holiday season. Planned promotions can be profitable while last-
minute efforts to clear excess inventories erode margins.  “The results were modestly better than our expectations,”
 Joel Levington , head of corporate credit at Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. in  New York , said in an e-mail. “Macy’s solid
operational execution, and growing earnings base, has it well-
positioned.”  Gross margin -- the fraction of revenue left after
subtracting the cost of goods sold -- narrowed to 41 percent
from 41.3 percent a year earlier, Macy’s said. Five analysts on
average estimated the measure would shrink to 40.9 percent.  The shares  rose  1.2 percent to $36.69 at the close in New
York. Macy’s increased 27 percent last year.  Saks Results  Macy’s fourth-quarter one-time items included expenses for
store closings announced last month and a gain from the sale of
store leases.  Revenue climbed 5.5 percent to $8.72 billion in the fourth
quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year advanced 5.2
percent.  For the current fiscal year, Macy’s projected profit of
$3.25 to $3.30 a share. Analysts  estimated  $3.27 on average.  Saks Inc. (SKS) , the New York-based luxury retailer, also
reported profit today that exceeded analyst estimates, sending
its shares higher. Per-share profit before one-time items
totaled 17 cents, compared with an analysts’ average estimate of
14 cents.  Saks  rose  3.3 percent to $11.23 at the close. The shares
fell 8.9 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
