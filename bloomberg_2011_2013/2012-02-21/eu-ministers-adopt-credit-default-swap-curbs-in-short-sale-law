European Union finance ministers
adopted a short-selling law that includes an optional ban on
naked credit-default swaps tied to sovereign debt.  The legislation, which would also curb so-called naked
short-selling of stocks and  government bonds , was approved at a
meeting in Brussels today. The decision marks the final stage in
the adoption of the law, which was also approved in November by
lawmakers in the European Parliament.  Investors buy CDSs as insurance to protect themselves from
losses if a bond issuer defaults. A sovereign CDS trade becomes
naked when an investor buys the swap without being at risk of
suffering such losses.  The short-selling and naked-CDS curbs will come into effect
on Nov. 1, according to a copy of the law published on the  EUâ€™s
website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
