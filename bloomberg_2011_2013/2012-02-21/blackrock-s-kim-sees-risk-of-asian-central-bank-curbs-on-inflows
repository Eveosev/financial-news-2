Joel Kim, Singapore-based head of
fixed income for the Asia Pacific at BlackRock Inc., comments on
capital flowing into regional markets. He was speaking at a
conference in  Singapore .  “If you look at the first months of this year, there have
been very strong inflows into emerging-market equities and debt.
That in itself is going to push up or exert pressure on
currencies.  “Asian central banks probably aren’t going to ease that
much. There are in our view inflationary pressures. You just
have to look at what’s happening to oil. We’re back to a
situation where central banks will stem these inflows.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
