France ’s lower chamber of Parliament
will probably today pass President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s bills to
create a tax on financial transactions and to increase the
country’s main value-added tax to 21.2 percent.  The parliament in Paris will debate the two bills, which
are part of a revised 2012 budget law, later today. The Senate
is scheduled vote tomorrow. The increase in VAT, a  sales tax ,
from 19.6 percent will be enacted in October.  Budget Minister Valerie Pecresse said at the National
Assembly today the VAT increase would compensate for cuts in
labor charges that could create as many as 120,000 jobs. Sarkozy
hushed the Parliament to vote on the new levy as he seeks to
make France the first country to implement a European-Union wide
financial-transaction tax. He said he plans to impose the levy
in August. The tax will apply to share purchases, including
high-frequency trading and credit default swap transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
