Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s
second-largest oil and gas producer, said full-year profit
dropped 4 percent on one-time charges, including expenses for
the delay of its Pluto project in Western Australia.  Net income was $1.51 billion in the 12 months ended Dec. 31,
from $1.58 billion a year earlier, Perth-based Woodside said
today in a statement. That compared with the $1.62 billion
average estimate of 10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 15 percent to $4.8 billion, while production
fell 11 percent to 64.6 million barrels of oil equivalent.  Chief Executive Officer Peter Coleman faces rising costs
and increasing sales competition from  North America  as he seeks
to develop more than $70 billion in liquefied natural projects.
Woodside’s A$14.9 billion ($15.9 billion) Pluto venture is among
eight LNG projects under development in  Australia .  Shares of Woodside rose 1.2 percent to A$36.37 at 10:21 a.m.
in Sydney, while the benchmark dropped 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
