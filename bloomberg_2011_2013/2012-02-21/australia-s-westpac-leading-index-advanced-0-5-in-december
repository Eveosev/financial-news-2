An Australian index of leading
economic indicators advanced in December as gains in  money
supply  and U.S. industrial production outweighed declines in
stocks and dwelling approvals.  The index, a gauge of future economic growth, rose 0.5
percent from a month earlier to 283.4,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
the Melbourne Institute said in a statement in Sydney today.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens
unexpectedly paused interest-rate reductions this month, after
cutting at back-to-back meetings late last year, on optimism
Europe will contain its fiscal problems and the domestic economy
will strengthen. Australia recorded its weakest jobs growth in
19 years in 2011 as a stronger currency, fueled by a A$456
billion ($486 billion) pipeline of resource projects, hurt the
nation’s manufacturing and services industries.  “We still expect the current easing cycle to see further
rate cuts as global growth concerns reemerge and domestic
fragility becomes more apparent across non-mining sectors and
the labor market,” said  Matthew Hassan , a senior economist at
Westpac who predicted the central bank to lower rates in May.  Westpac’s leading index tracks eight gauges of activity,
including company profits and productivity, to give an
indication of how the economy will perform over the next three
to nine months. The coincident index, a measure of the current
state of the economy, rose 0.1 percent in December to 270.6, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
