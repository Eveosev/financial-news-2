  Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL) ,  Hungary ’s
former phone monopoly, fell from the highest in more than seven
months as a technical indicator suggested the rally was
overdone.  The shares fell 1 percent to 574 forint by the close in
Budapest. Magyar Telekom’s 1.2 percent jump yesterday pushed the
stock’s 14-day  relative strength index  to 73, the highest since
April. A reading above 70 indicates to some technical analysts a
security may decline. The RSI last stood at 68.  To contact the reporter on this story:
