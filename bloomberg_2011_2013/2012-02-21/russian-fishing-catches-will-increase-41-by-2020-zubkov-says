Russia ’s fishing catches will
increase 41 percent to 6.05 million metric tons by 2020 from a
targeted 4.3 million tons this year, First Deputy Prime Minister
 Viktor Zubkov  said in an article published today in the
government newspaper,  Rossiyskaya Gazeta .  Fish catches exceeded 4.2 million tons last year, Zubkov
said in Rossiyskaya Gazeta. The harvest at fisheries is targeted
at 410,000 tons a year by 2020, he said.  The share of domestic seafood both caught and raised in
fisheries is seen at 80 percent of Russia’s total fish market
this year and may rise to 85 percent by 2020, according to
Zubkov.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
