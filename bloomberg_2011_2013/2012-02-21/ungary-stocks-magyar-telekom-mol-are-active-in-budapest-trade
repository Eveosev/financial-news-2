Hungary ’s benchmark BUX stock index
fell 0.8 percent to 19,192.62 as of the close in Budapest. The
following are among the most active equities in the Hungarian
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL)  , Hungary’s former phone
monopoly, slumped 1 percent to 574 forint after rising to the
highest in more than seven months yesterday. Magyar Telekom’s
1.2 percent jump yesterday pushed the stock’s 14-day relative
strength index to 73, the highest since April. A reading above
70 indicates to some technical analysts a security may decline.
The RSI last stood at 68.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, declined 1.7
percent to 19,010 forint. The European Commission will propose
to withhold subsidies from Hungary, a European official said
today. European stocks declined on speculation a Greek bailout
deal won’t be sufficient to solve the nation’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
