Societe Generale SA (GLE)  plans to sell
senior sunsecured debt in two parts including 18-month floating-
rate notes and five-year fixed-rate bonds, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  The 18-month floating-rate note may be priced at 90 to 95
basis points more than Euribor, the person said. The five-year
bonds may yield about 225 basis points more than the benchmark
mid-swap rate. SocGen is managing the sale, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
