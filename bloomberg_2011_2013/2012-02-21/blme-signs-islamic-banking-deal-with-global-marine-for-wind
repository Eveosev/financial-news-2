Bank of  London  and The Middle East
Plc, the London-based Islamic bank, signed a 14 million-pound
($22 million) deal to help Global Marine Systems Ltd. buy a
vessel to install subsea power cables at offshore wind farms.  The leasing transaction with the Essex, England-based
marine technology and engineering company is the Shariah-
compliant bank’s first in the renewable  energy industry ,
according to a statement from the bank.  The deal “allows us to contribute indirectly to the U.K.’s
attempts to diversify its sources of energy,” Jervis Rhodes,
head of corporate banking at BLME, said in the statement sent by
e-mail yesterday.  Nations from the U.K. to Germany are installing  wind
turbines  offshore to curb fossil-fuel emissions and meet targets
for renewable power. The U.K. plans to reach 18 gigawatts of
capacity from offshore wind parks by 2020 while  Germany  is
targeting 10 gigawatts by then. Parks will be built further from
shore in deeper waters as developers seek to industrialize the
technology to bring down costs.  The barge, called Cable Enterprise, will install subsea
power links that help transport power generated by the turbines
for use by consumers. As an Islamic bank, the transactions and
contracts BLME undertakes are Shariah compliant, or follow
principles of Islamic law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
