Euro-area finance ministers meeting
in Brussels have good prospects for reaching a deal on a second
Greek rescue package, though more talks are necessary, a
European diplomat said today.  Several rounds of talks have taken place between  Greece  and
the Institute of International Finance, which is leading the
debt talks on behalf of private creditors, as a majority of euro
states were pushing for bondholders to accept greater losses,
the diplomat said on condition of anonymity because the talks
are ongoing.  All 17 delegations at the talks are committed to reaching
an agreement at the meeting, which began at 3:30 p.m. yesterday,
the diplomat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
