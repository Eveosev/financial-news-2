Ricky Ponting ,  Australia ’s record
run-scorer and most-successful cricket captain, said he’ll play
on in elite Tests after being dropped from the one-day squad.  A regular in the national team since making his debut in
1995, Ponting said at a news conference at the Sydney Cricket
Ground that he doesn’t expect to play one-day international
cricket again. He said he’ll remain available for selection in
the five-day format.  “I still don’t see a finish line as far as my
international career is concerned,” Ponting said.  Selectors dumped Ponting from the one-day roster yesterday
after his worst batting slump in the shortened format, where he
averaged 3.6 runs in five innings. That followed the third-most
prolific Test series of his career, during which he amassed 544
runs in four matches against  India .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
