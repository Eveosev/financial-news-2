Depa SA, a Greek state-controlled
natural gas supplier, may buy a stake of as much as 15 percent
in the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline venture,  Imerisia  reported,
citing unidentified people in the Greek Energy Ministry.  Depa is a backer of another pipeline project for
transporting gas to  Europe , the  Interconnector Turkey-Greece-
Italy , use of which was ruled out yesterday by companies
developing the second phase of the Shah Deniz gas field in
 Azerbaijan , the Athens-based newspaper cited its informants as
saying.  It’s planned that both the Interconnector and the Trans-
Adriatic pipelines will cross  Greece . Shah Deniz is being
developed by BP Plc, Socar,  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Total SA (FP) , OAO Lukoil,
Naftiran Intertrade Co. and Turkiye Petrolleri AO.  The Interconnector could also be used to transport to
Europe recently discovered offshore deposits of gas in Cyprus
and  Israel , Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
