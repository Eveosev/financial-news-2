Ford Motor Co. (F)  boosted annual
compensation for board members by 25 percent and will pay 29
percent more to Edsel Ford II, its founder’s great-grandson, for
his work as a director and consultant.  Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, will pay its board
members an annual retainer of $250,000, up from $200,000, the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. Edsel Ford, a  director , also will receive
$650,000 a year in cash as a consultant, up from $500,000.  Ford reported $20.2 billion in net income for 2011, the
most since 1998. The results were boosted by a noncash gain of
$12.4 billion from eliminating a valuation allowance against
deferred tax benefits. The company’s shares lost 36 percent last
year after gaining 68 percent in 2010 and more than quadrupling
in 2009. The shares gained 14 percent this year.  “We review all the compensation levels on a regular basis,
and in the case of the board, determined this was needed to
ensure we continue to attract and retain the talent we have,”
Todd Nissen, a Ford spokesman, said in a phone interview.  Ford cut compensation to directors in half to $100,000 in
2006, when the company hired  Alan Mulally  as its chief executive
officer and borrowed $23 billion to restructure its operations,
Nissen said.  The board elected to forgo cash payments entirely in 2009,
Nissen said. The compensation was re-established to $200,000 in
2010. Sixty percent of director compensation is deferred into
Ford common stock units, the filing said.  Edsel Ford Contract  Edsel Ford, 63, has had a consulting contract with  Ford
Motor  since 1999. The increase in Edsel Ford’s consulting
compensation is the first he’s received since the arrangement
began, Nissen said. The company began paying Edsel Ford’s
consulting fee in cash rather than restricted stock during the
second half of 2010.  The company realized “substantial benefits” from Edsel
Ford’s activities on its behalf, according to the filing. His
services include dealer relations and representing the company
through education projects, heritage events and motor sports,
Nissen said.  The founding Ford family still controls the company through
a special class of stock that provides 40 percent voting power.
 Bill Ford , Edsel’s cousin, is executive chairman of the board.
Bill Ford, 54, and Edsel Ford are the only family members on the
board.  Ford’s board this month elected former Republican
presidential candidate  Jon Huntsman  to be the 15th member.
Huntsman, 51, the former U.S. ambassador to  China  and governor
of  Utah , is chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation.  Ford  fell  2 percent to $12.28 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
