property sale.  Net income rose to 131 million liras from 119.5 million
liras in the same period of 2010, Tofas said in a filing with
the Istanbul Stock Exchange after markets closed yesterday. The
company was expected to earn 121.4 million liras, according to
the average of 13 analysts  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Fourth-quarter profit was boosted by a one-off gain of 17.4

year ago, it said.  Profit climbed at a slower pace than the full-year figure,
