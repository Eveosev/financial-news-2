Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  was
sued in  New York  by Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg over
$71 million in mortgage-backed securities.  Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg said the offering materials
for the sale of the securities contained “misrepresentations
and omissions” about the characteristics of the mortgages,
according to the complaint filed in New York state court today.  The defendants, which include RBS Securities, obtained
mortgage loans from the banks that issued them and bundled them
into securities. Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg bought the
securities, which have declined in value or were sold at a loss,
according to the complaint.  “Each of the defendants knew, or at a minimum was
negligent in not knowing, that its representations and omissions
were false and/or misleading,” Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg
said in the complaint.  Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, based in Stuttgart, seeks at
least $71 million in damages.  Pholida Phengsomphone, a spokeswoman for Edinburgh-based
Royal Bank of  Scotland , declined to comment.  The case is Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg v. Royal Bank of
Scotland, 650482-2012,  Supreme Court  of the State of New York
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
