Eurasian  Development Bank , a
Russian-led lender backed by six former Soviet republics, wants
to expand Shariah-compliant financing after helping arrange a
deal last year, Chief Executive Officer Igor Finogenov said.  “Islamic finance is an opportunity for us to enter new
credit markets,” Finogenov told reporters in Moscow today. “We
hope it will allow us to diversify our liability base.”  The bank is looking to boost lending that complies with
Islam’s ban on interest after serving as mandated lead arranger
for a $60 million syndicated Murabaha facility for Kazan,
Russia-based AK Bars Bank in September. The Almaty-based
development bank was founded by Russia and  Kazakhstan  in 2006
and also includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan.  “We’re a Eurasian bank, and many of our member countries
are in areas that are traditionally close to Islamic culture,”
Finogenov said. That raises “the possibility of finding
projects that meet the criteria required for Islamic finance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
