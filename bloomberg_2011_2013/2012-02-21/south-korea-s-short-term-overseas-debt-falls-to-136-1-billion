South Korea ’s short-term overseas
debt fell last quarter as the government struggled with the
fallout from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Overseas debt maturing in one year or less declined to
$136.1 billion at the end of 2011 from a revised $139.9 billion
in the third quarter, the Bank of Korea said in a statement in
 Seoul  today. Long-term external debt increased to $262.2 billion.  Policy makers have introduced various measures to reduce
the volatility of capital flows while urging borrowers to rely
less on short-term overseas loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
