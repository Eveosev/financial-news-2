Canadian livestock and dairy farmers
can resume exports of cattle to  Peru  immediately, the Canadian
Agriculture Ministry said.  Exporters can ship cattle born after Aug. 1, 2007, with
“the bulk of the expected sales being dairy genetics,”
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said today in an e-mailed
statement. The Peruvian market for the Canadian cattle industry
is valued at more than C$2.5 million ($2.51 million) this year,
the agency said, citing Canada Beef and the Canadian Livestock
Genetics Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
