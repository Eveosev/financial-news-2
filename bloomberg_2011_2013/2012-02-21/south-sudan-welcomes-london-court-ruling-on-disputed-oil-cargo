South Sudan  welcomed the ruling by a
London court to withhold payment for a cargo of crude until
ownership of the oil was settled with neighboring Sudan.  The ruling was a “positive thing” because it means that
Sudan will not receive a share of the proceeds from the sale of
oil “stolen” by the Sudanese government, South Sudan
government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin said today by phone
from Juba, South Sudan’s capital. “We are satisfied as long as
it doesn’t go to Khartoum.”  South Sudan declared independence in July, taking control
of  oil fields  that produced about 75 percent of Sudan’s crude
output of 490,000 barrels of a day.  Talks have so far failed to yield an agreement on how much
landlocked South  Sudan  should pay to transport its oil through a
pipeline across Sudan. South Sudan halted output last month
after Sudan confiscated southern crude, saying it was taking it
to make up for unpaid fees.  The disputed oil includes 600,000 barrels of Nile Blend
that Sudan loaded onto the oil tanker Ratna Shradha on Jan. 19.
Oil trader Trafigura Beheer BV, confirmed yesterday that the
court ruled that all proceeds from the shipment, which it bought
from Sudan and sold to Tokyo-based JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp,
remain with the court until ownership is legally established.  Sudan Foreign Ministry Spokesman al-Obeid Murawih didn’t
answer his phone when Bloomberg called seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
