The  demand  for Mexican government
bills maturing in six months rose to a six-week high at an
auction today as foreign investors bet that central bank policy
makers will keep benchmark borrowing costs steady.  The bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of investor demand, rose
to 3.74, the highest since Jan. 10. The zero-coupon notes
 yielded  4.47 percent at auction, down from 4.48 percent on Feb.
14. The peso fell 0.8 percent to 12.7929 per dollar at the close
in Mexico City, trimming gains this year to 8.9 percent, still
tied with the Brazilian real for the most among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Foreign investors are shifting demand to longer-term Cetes
from those maturing in 28 days amid bets that policy makers are
likely to keep rates on hold in Mexico and the U.S. for an
extended period, according to  Eduardo Avila , an economist at
Monex Casa de Bolsa SA. The U.S. Federal Reserve has pledged to
keep the benchmark rate near zero at least through late 2014,
while in Mexico economists are joining traders in abandoning
predictions for  Banco de Mexico  to cut its 4.5 percent key rate.  “The fact that the Fed sees a quite long period in which
rates aren’t going to move incentivizes the foreign investor to
come to Mexico,” Avila said in an interview from Mexico City.
“With the horizon a little more clear they can get into notes
including those maturing in three months and six months.”  Mexico sold all 6 billion pesos of 28-day Cetes and 7
billion pesos of the 91-day securities it offered today, the
central bank said on its website.  Mexico  also sold all 8.5
billion pesos in 182-day bills it auctioned, the bank said.  The yield on peso denominated bonds due in 2024 increased
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.5 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of the
securities fell 0.30 centavo to 130.36 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
