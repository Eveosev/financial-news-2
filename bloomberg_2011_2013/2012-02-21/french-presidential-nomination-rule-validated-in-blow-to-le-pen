Presidential candidates can be
required to disclose the names of officials who signed petitions
in support of their campaigns,  France ’s constitutional court
ruled in a defeat for the National Front’s Marine Le Pen.  Requiring publication of the names of politicians
supporting a candidate doesn’t inhibit political diversity, the
Constitutional Council said in a ruling published on its
website.  “This publicity doesn’t in itself undercut the principle
of the free exchange of ideas and opinions,” the court said.
The rule “complies with the Constitution.”  The decision is a loss for Le Pen, a candidate for
president who advocates cutting immigration and exiting the
euro. Politicians must gather signatures from 500 elected
officials to show they have the institutional support needed to
appear on the ballot. Le Pen has said some followers refuse to
sign on for fear of retaliation for supporting her.  An poll released Feb. 19 showed 14 percent of respondents
supporting Le Pen, compared to 26 percent for President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and 32 percent for Socialist Party candidate  Francois Hollande .  Le Pen is the daughter of National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen. Her spokesman didn’t immediately return calls to comment
on the decision.  The French presidential election will be held in two
rounds, with the top two vote recipients of the April 22 ballot
competing in a May 6 run-off.  To contact the reporter on this story:
