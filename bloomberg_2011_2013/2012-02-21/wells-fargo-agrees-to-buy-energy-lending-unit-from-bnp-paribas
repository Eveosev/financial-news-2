Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  agreed to buy a
North American energy-lending business from  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA.
Terms weren’t disclosed.  The unit has about 175 customer relationships, almost $9.5
billion of loan commitments and about $3.9 billion in loans
outstanding, according to a statement from San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo. The unit is the “North American reserve-based and
related diversified energy-lending business” of Paris-based BNP
Paribas, according to the statement.  Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home lender, has said it’s
interested in buying assets from European banks as they seek to
cut risk.  “All BNP Paribas employees who have been part of the
energy business being acquired will be given an opportunity to
join Wells Fargo,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
