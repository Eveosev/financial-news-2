Former No. 1 draft pick Greg Oden of
the  Portland  Trail Blazers will miss the rest of the National
Basketball Association season following the fifth knee surgery
of his career.  Oden, 24, hasn’t played in an NBA game since Dec. 5, 2009
because of knee injuries.  The Blazers said in a  statement  that Oden was undergoing
surgery on his left knee yesterday when doctors discovered more
damage and determined a microfracture procedure was necessary.
The 7-foot center has now had three microfracture surgeries, a
process that entails making tiny fractures in the knee bone to
cause bleeding and stimulate new cartilage growth.  “It’s hard to put into words the heartbreak for everyone
involved, but especially for Greg,” Trail Blazers president
 Larry Miller  said. “He’s a young man who has experienced a
great number of physical challenges in his playing career and
today is yet another significant setback for him.”  The latest surgery may signal the end of Oden’s time in
Portland, if not his NBA career. He’s scheduled to become an
unrestricted free agent after this season and The Oregonian
newspaper reported that no player has returned to the NBA after
having three microfracture surgeries.  Oden, the first player taken in the 2007 NBA draft,
averaged 9.4 points and 7.3 rebounds in 82 games for Portland
during the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons. He had microfracture
surgery on his right knee that forced him to miss his first
season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
