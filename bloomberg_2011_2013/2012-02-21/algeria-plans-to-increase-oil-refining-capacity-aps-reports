Algeria will “soon” announce a
plan to increase its refinery capacity by 18 million metric
tons, the state-run Algerie Press Service reported, citing
Abdelhamid Zerguine, chief executive officer of Sonatrach, the
country’s state-owned oil company.  The country’s refineries can process 26 million tons of oil
a year, the Algiers-based news agency reported, citing Zerguine.
That’s about 520,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
