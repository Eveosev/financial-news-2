Almost 120 years ago, on Sept. 11, 1893, a young Indian man, clad in saffron robes, stood up at a massive gathering in  Chicago  and delivered  one of the most rousing and frequently quoted speeches  of modern religious history. The speaker's name was Narendranath Datta, but in India he went by  Swami Vivekananda , and this is how he is now remembered. The event was the first-ever  World Parliament of Religions , a visionary attempt to start a global dialogue among people of all faiths. Vivekananda's speech , and his  subsequent work in the U.S.  promoting the  school of Hinduism  called Vedanta, made him the first Indian to significantly impact the American cultural consciousness. Touring the country widely after his Chicago speech, Vivekananda opened a view in America of Hinduism, and Indian civilization, as something much more complex and vigorous than had been granted so far. As the commemorative plaque in Vivekananda's honor installed in 1995 at the  Art Institute of Chicago , where Vivekananda made his speech, says, "His unprecedented success (at the Parliament) opened the way for the dialogue between Eastern and Western religions." Although the conference was called the World Parliament of Religions, it was in truth hastily conceived as an adjunct to the  Chicago World's Fair of 1893 , celebrating the 400th anniversary of  Christopher Columbus 's arrival in the Americas. It was attended mostly by American Christians, who also did most of the speaking. The participation of Muslims was small, and Vivekananda himself came to the conference as the sole representative of Hinduism. What did Vivekananda say that has endured when so much else of what was transacted at the event has faded away? Indeed, it has perhaps not just endured, but may be even more relevant to our current moment in history than it was to its own. Briefly,  Vivekananda spoke  not just -- as he was expected to do -- about the splendor of his own religion, Hinduism, but also about the need for people in a globalizing world to accept that no single religious tradition had a monopoly over religious truth. He declared: Or, to put it another way, Vivekananda put before his American, mainly Christian, audience the question that cannot be avoided by both religious and secular thinkers all around the world today after the fading away of the illusion, briefly held towards the close of the 20th century, that we live in a post-religious world. The question is about what it means, as a person of faith, to think about other religions and the deeply held beliefs of others. Is the faith of another to be thought of, publicly or privately, as something inferior to one's own, or even of no validity altogether? Is it to be "tolerated" as somebody else's point of view, as a concession to diversity? Accepted as the equal of one's own faith? But how would that attitude then co-exist with one's own professed religious commitment? Is not to participate in the life of another faith to diminish one's own? And how can such participation or empathy be distinguished from a flabby relativism, an attitude of religious laissez-faire? Almost as important as what we believe, Vivekananda suggested, is what we believe about what others believe. As the nations of the world grow ever more multi-religious, the attitude we take in all honesty toward the religious Other becomes an ever more urgent question, even in -- perhaps especially in -- countries committed to religious liberty such as  India  and the U.S. Again, this question is especially relevant within the doctrine and practice of the great monotheistic traditions, but no one can dispute that even a more pluralistic tradition, like Hinduism, has today fallen prey in its interfaith attitudes to the temptations of monotheistic arrogance. The question raised so powerfully by Vivekananda is one that, as a practicing Hindu, I've often thought about. My thinking owes much to a writer who has thought seriously about the matter as a practicing Christian. In her splendid 1993 memoir " Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras ,"  Diana Eck , a Christian scholar of Hinduism at  Harvard University  (where she heads an initiative called the  Pluralism Project ), writes about how being a believer at the turn of the 20th century is different from being a believer in any of the centuries past. In a chapter called "Frontiers of Encounter," Eck observed: And in a recent piece called " What Vivekananda Valued ," the political commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta wrote about the relevance of Vivekananda in the context of the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of his birth early next year: As the efforts to mark Vivekananda's birth gather steam, Chicago, as much as any site in India, has emerged as a center of the movement. Last month  the Indian government announced  that it would provide a grant of $1.5 million to the  University of Chicago  to establish a Vivekananda Chair for Indian studies. The prime minister of India,  Manmohan Singh , has, meanwhile, added to his onerous list of duties by taking up the post of chairman of the National Committee for the Celebration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekananda. The  minutes  of the committee's first meeting reported that: Perhaps the prime minister need not have sounded so gloomy, or have left so much upon the shoulders of "the Indian American community." Meanwhile, The Telegraph reported that Vivekananda and the cinema were going to come together at long last: A film on the life of Vivekananda to be scripted, shot and released before Jan. 12, 2013? Clearly the monks of the Ramakrishna Math have some way to go before they understand the mechanics of film-making and distribution. Much of the film would have to be shot in America, to which Vivekananda gave some of the best of his 39 years. It's perhaps no surprise that Vivekananda's message went down so well in the U.S. As Ann Louis Bardach  wrote  in a piece in the New York Times last year, "His prescription for life was simple, and perfectly American: 'work and worship.'" But as for the larger message of Sept. 11, 1893,-- that of the importance of religious pluralism and interfaith dialogue -- that seems to be receding ever further in our post-Sept. 11 age.
