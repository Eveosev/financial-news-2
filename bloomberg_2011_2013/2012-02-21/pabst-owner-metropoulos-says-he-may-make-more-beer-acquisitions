Pabst Brewing Co. owner C. Dean Metropoulos said he will look to make more beer acquisitions, in
part to take advantage of the growing craft market.  “It’s a good time right now for financing,” Metropoulos
said today during a presentation at the Beer Industry Summit
hosted by Beer Business Daily in  San Diego .  Metropoulos, who with his sons purchased Pabst in 2010 for
about $250 million, said there are a number of interesting craft
brands he may consider, without naming any.  The company may expand into cider, Metropoulos’s son and
co-owner, Evan Metropoulos, also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
