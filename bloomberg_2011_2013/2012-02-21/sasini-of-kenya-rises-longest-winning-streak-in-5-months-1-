Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and coffee
grower, rose for a third straight day, its longest winning
streak since September, as leaf prices are seen to be
increasing.  The stock added as much as 4.2 percent to 11.30 shillings
by 12:28 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  Tea prices in  Kenya , the world’s biggest exporter of black
tea, are set to rise as frost and drought in the main growing
areas have cut production by as much as half, the Africa Tea
Brokers said yesterday.  Output is badly affected in the Rift Valley, which produces
60 percent of Kenya’s tea, Africa Tea Brokers Managing Director
Tom Muchura said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
