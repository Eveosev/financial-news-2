United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and
US Airways Group Inc. tumbled in  New York  trading, dragging an
industry index to the biggest drop in more than four months as
jet-fuel prices jumped.  Jet fuel for immediate delivery in New York Harbor rose 1.4
percent to $3.29 a gallon, the highest since May 4. The
Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index plunged 6.4 percent, the most
since Oct. 3.  United, the world’s biggest airline, fell 9.1 percent to
$21.24 at the close in New York, while Tempe, Arizona-based  US
Airways (LCC)  slid 11 percent to $7.89.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) , No. 2 in
traffic behind United, slumped 7.2 percent to $10.05.  All 11 passenger carriers in the Bloomberg index declined
today.  On Feb. 3, the gauge reached the highest since June as a
U.S. stock rally gathered strength on optimism that the economic
recovery was taking hold. The index has tumbled 11 percent since
then, even as the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
advanced 1.3 percent.  Jet fuel is approaching last year’s high of $3.42 a gallon,
the most since 2008, when the price reached a record $4.36. Fuel
accounted for 36 percent of Chicago-based United’s operating
expenses last year, and 27 percent of those costs at  US Airways ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
