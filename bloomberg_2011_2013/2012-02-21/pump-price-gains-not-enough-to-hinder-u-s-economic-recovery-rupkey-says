The employment rebound in the U.S.
suggests the economy will be strong enough to withstand recent
increases in gasoline prices, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  “There’s a lot of momentum here,” the New York-based
economist said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “The Hays
Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn. Gasoline price 
gains so far are “not enough to take anything off the economy 
at this moment,'' he said.  The national average unleaded regular gasoline price rose
to $3.57 per gallon yesterday, a 5 percent increase from $3.39 a
month ago, according to AAA, the nation’s largest auto group.  “It’s got to be something very, very big to slow the
economy,” Rupkey said. “Once the jobs creation begins again,
those new people have paychecks and that’s what powers the
economy forward.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 8.1 percent this
year as data from employment to spending underscore an economy
gaining steam. The  unemployment rate  slid to a three-year low of
8.3 percent in January after the economy added 243,000 jobs,
while retail sales gained 0.4 percent, according to reports
released this month.  The stocks rally is another sign that fears of a looming
slowdown are “greatly overblown,” Rupkey said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
