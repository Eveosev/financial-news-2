Pontus Wernbloom’s goal in stoppage
time gave  CSKA Moscow  a 1-1 tie with Real Madrid in their
opening Champions League round of 16 match.  Wernbloom scored just before the final whistle at Luzhniki
Stadium in Moscow to cancel out a first-half goal from Cristiano
Ronaldo.  Real, which has won European soccer’s top club competition
a record nine times, hosts the return match in the two-game
series on March 14.  Napoli and Chelsea open their series in  Italy  in tonight’s
second game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
