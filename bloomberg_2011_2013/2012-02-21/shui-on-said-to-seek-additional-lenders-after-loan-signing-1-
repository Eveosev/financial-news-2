Shui On Development Holding Ltd. (272)  may
complete a three-year loan as early as this week and will seek
additional commitments later via a so-called accordion
structure, said a person familiar with the matter.  About ten banks, including the loan’s arranger, Credit
Suisse AG, will lend to the facility, the person said. Shui On
is expected to sign the loan either this week or early next with
bank commitments totaling about $300 million, the person said.
The company initially sought $410 million however will continue
to accept commitments after this week via a structure which
allows lenders to join after the loan has been signed, the
person said.  Shanghai-based Shui On spokeswoman Ingrid Tang didn’t
immediately respond to two phone calls to her mobile seeking
comment on the loan.  The loan refinances an existing facility of about $300
million, another person familiar with the matter said on Jan 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
