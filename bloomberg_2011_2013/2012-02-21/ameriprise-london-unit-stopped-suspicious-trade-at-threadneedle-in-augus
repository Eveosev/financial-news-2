Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP) , the
Minneapolis-based insurer and money manager, said it blocked a
“suspicious attempted trade” at London investment unit
Threadneedle in August.  “The matter was immediately reported to the authorities
and the individual involved was subsequently dismissed,” Alison
Jefferis, a Threadneedle spokeswoman, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Ameriprise, under Chief Executive Officer James Cracchiolo,
has been working to increase the proportion of its profits
generated by its investment management and advisory businesses.
The company was spun off from American Express Co. in 2005.  “The main point is the attempt was stopped by our systems
and there was no loss as a result to our clients,” Jefferis
said in a telephone interview. Threadneedle has $114 billion in
assets under management, she said.  Police are investigating a $150 million attempted
fraudulent trade involving Argentine warrants by a former junior
trader at the asset manager, the Financial Times reported
earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
