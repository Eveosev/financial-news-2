Enterprise Group Ltd. (EGL) , an insurer in
 Ghana , fell to the lowest in more than a year on speculation
that the company will say bad weather increased the number of
claims paid in 2011, cutting the company’s earnings.  The stock dropped 10.5 percent to 34 pesewas by the 3 p.m.
in Accra, the capital, the lowest since Nov. 16, 2010.  “The company was very much exposed to rain floods that
took place in Accra in October last year,” Gerard Hagan-Aggrey,
a stock trader at Accra-based First Atlantic Merchant Bank Ltd.,
said by phone today. “The claims payments likely affected
Enterprise’s earnings in the year,” he said, declining to give
an estimate.  Enterprise Group’s results will be released in the next
week, Emmanuel Idun, director of finance, said by phone. He
declined to comment on the company’s performance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
