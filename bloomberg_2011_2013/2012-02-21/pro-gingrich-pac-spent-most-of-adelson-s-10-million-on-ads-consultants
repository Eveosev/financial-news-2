A political action committee
supporting Republican presidential candidate  Newt Gingrich 
burned through most of the $10 million it received from
billionaire casino executive  Sheldon Adelson  and his wife in
January.  While most of the money was spent on television, radio and
Internet advertising, almost $300,000 was paid to two
consultants who’d received only travel expenses amounting to
about $1,600 in December.  The payments record was included in the organization’s
January financial disclosure report, filed with the  Federal
Election Commission  yesterday. The report also shows that after
a 14-percentage-point loss to  Mitt Romney  in the Florida primary
at month’s end, the former House speaker’s campaign and the
super-PAC supporting him were both left with little money to
proceed in the next round of races.  The pro-Gingrich PAC, Winning Our Future, began February
with $2.4 million in the bank after raising $11 million and
spending $9.8 million in January, the FEC report shows. The
committee has one-seventh the $16.3 million available to Restore
Our Future, a group independently backing Romney.  Gingrich Campaign Debts  The Gingrich campaign was even more hard-pressed for cash.
Though it was second to Romney in January fundraising among the
Republican candidates, Gingrich’s campaign spent more than it
raised during the month and began February with almost as much
in campaign debt --$1.7 million -- as cash in the bank -- $1.8
million. Gingrich has spent much of the last three weeks on the
West Coast trying to raise cash.  Gingrich’s campaign spent $5.9 million in January including
$1.8 million for media buys, $858,000 for telemarketing,
$503,000 for online processing fees and $368,000 for ballot
access fees. Gingrich failed to qualify for the March 6 Virginia
ballot and joined a lawsuit challenging the decision to exclude
him.  The Adelsons’ $10 million donation and a $500,000
contribution from Texas billionaire Harold Simmons amounted to
more than 95 percent of what Winning Our Future raised in
January. The PAC raised $1 million from three members of
Adelson’s family in December.  Of the $9.8 million that Winning Our Future spent in
January, $9.2 million went to independent expenditures, a
category that includes outlays for television, radio and mail
advertising.  Ad Buys  The pro-Gingrich PAC spent about $5.4 million in  Florida ,
where Gingrich lost to Romney on Jan. 31. More than $4.2 million
of that total went to produce and air television and radio ads
to promote Gingrich or attack Romney.  Winning Our Future spent $3.4 million in  South Carolina ,
where Gingrich’s 12-point win over Romney in the Jan. 21 primary
gave him momentum that he couldn’t sustain.  The rest of the PAC’s January spending, $543,000, went to
operating expenses including payments to consultants. Winning
Our Future paid $206,000 to Rebecca A. Burkett, who serves as
chairwoman of the PAC, according to organizing papers it filed
with the FEC last December. Burkett received $156,000 for
fundraising services and $50,000 for consulting, yesterday’s 
filing said.  Gregg A. Phillips, the PAC’s managing director, received
$90,000 last month for strategic planning, the filing said.
Phillips defended the accuracy of a 28-minute video that attacks
Romney’s past service as a private-equity executive at Boston-
based Bain Capital LLC, according to a Jan. 13 letter Phillips
wrote to Romney. The video and the letter are posted on Winning
Our Future’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
