Church Street Health Management LLC
and four affiliates, providers of management services to 67
dental centers, filed for bankruptcy as part of a plan to sell
the businesses.  The companies had assets valued at $895.3 million and debt
of $303.4 million, according to Chapter 11 documents filed
yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Nashville,  Tennessee ,
where Church Street is based.  A sale in bankruptcy is the “best option to maximize the
value of the assets for stakeholders and to safeguard the
welfare of the patients,” Martin McGahan, Church Street’s chief
restructuring officer, said in court papers.  Affiliates Small Smiles Holding Co., Forba NY LLC, EEHC
Inc. and Forba Services Inc. also sought court protection from
creditors. Small Smiles is the parent of a group of companies
that provide management services to dental centers serving low-
income families in 22 states.  The 20 largest unsecured creditors are owed about
$21.1 million, according to court documents. National
Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units is the largest, owed
about $10.7 million for a settlement. Twelve state Medicaid
Fraud Control units are collectively owed about
$6.2 million.  The case is In re Church Street Health Management LLC,
