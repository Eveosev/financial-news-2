South Korea , the world’s second-
biggest liquefied natural gas buyer, will hold talks with energy
and commodity suppliers operating in Australia on expanding
cooperation to ensure supplies of the fuel and other minerals.  Representatives from companies including  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group will meet with officials from
the Knowledge Economy Ministry in Seoul today, the  ministry  said
in an e-mailed statement.  Australia supplied $11.9 billion of minerals to South Korea
in 2010, accounting for 42 percent of the country’s mineral
imports. South Korea had invested $2.8 billion in Australia as
of June, or 30 percent of its investment in overseas mineral
resources, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
