(Corrects description of Kishida’s comments in first
paragraph.)  Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said today that  Japan  won’t make concessions to China in
their dispute over islands that China calls Diaoyu and Japan
calls Senkaku.  “Japan will not concede,” Kishida said today in
Washington after a meeting with Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton . Japan will “uphold our fundamental position that the
Senkakus are an inherent part of Japan,” Kishida said.  Kishida said that Japan would “respond calmly” so as not
to provoke China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
