EFG Financial Products AG, the
Zurich-based structured products distributor, has raised more
than 1 million Swiss francs ($1.1 million) selling certificates
linked to a gauge of companies with business tied to Myanmar.  Most sales have taken place this month, Manuel Duerr, who
oversees distribution of structured products to individual
investors, wrote by e-mail. The company began offering the
investments tracking its Solactive Myanmar-Focused Asia Index on
 Switzerland ’s Scoach exchange in November. The equity gauge
includes 11 companies that currently focus their business on the
Southeast Asian nation or bordering countries, or plan to do so.  Myanmar remains one of the world’s few underdeveloped
markets with high growth potential, as President Thein Sein
seeks to liberalize the economy, Duerr said. Natural resources
in the nation span gas, gems and possibly oil, according to the
 World Bank .  The certificates were issued in the Swiss franc, euro and
U.S. dollar. The largest weightings in the index are on  PTT Pcl (PTT) 
and  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP) , both Thai oil and gas
companies, in addition to  Siam Cement Pcl (SCC)  and  UOL Group Ltd. (UOL) , a
Singaporean property developer, according to EFG.  Returns on the 10-year products directly follow the index
and don’t protect principal. The  gauge  has gained 12 percent as
of Jan. 17 since its Nov. 19 listing, according to Bloomberg
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
