economy accelerated for the first time in two years.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI)  advanced 0.8 percent

of the Twitter-like Weibo service in  China , jumped the most in a
week.  The rally in the China-U.S. gauge followed a 2.1 percent

The world’s second-largest economy expanded at a faster-than-
estimated 7.9 percent for the fourth quarter, up from a three-
year low of 7.4 percent in the previous period.  “The data confirmed improving  consumer confidence  we’ve
found in China in the last three months and most figures came
out a bit better than most people expected,” David Riedel, the
president of Riedel Research Group Inc. said in a phone
interview yesterday from  San Francisco . “Consumption-related
stocks, including hotels and travel agencies should benefit and
we expect the government to roll out more measures to encourage
domestic consumption.”  China Tourism  The China-US Equity measure climbed 0.7 percent to 101.69,
posting a weekly advance of 0.4 percent. The  Standard & Poor’s

climbed 3.2 percent to $18.58 after a three-day slide.  Ctrip.com

administration. The academy forecasts tourism sales will
increase 14.2 percent in 2013 to 2.96 trillion yuan.  Chinese airline passenger traffic gained 11.8 percent in

$1.75, the highest level in 13 months. Its seven-day rally was

it focuses on domestic sales of video surveillance systems,
Chief Executive Officer John Deng said in an interview at
Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York yesterday. Its business
will benefit from rising demand for safety in Chinese cities as
the nation seeks economic growth from urbanization, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
