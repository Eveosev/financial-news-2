Arsenal said leading scorer Theo
Walcott signed a long-term contract to remain at the English
Premier League soccer club.  The 23-year-old forward joined the north London club in
2006, and has scored 56 times in 244 appearances, the team said
today on its website. Sky Sports said the player signed a 3 1/2-
year extension to the pact that was to run out at the end of
this season.  Walcott has 14 goals from all competitions this season.
Last month, England midfielder  Jack Wilshere , forward Alex
Oxlade-Chamberlain, defenders  Kieran Gibbs  and Carl Jenkinson
and Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey also signed extensions.  “Theo’s contract extension now gives us a strong nucleus
of ambitious young players who have committed to the club and
want to be successful with us as a group,” manager Arsene
Wenger said today in the statement.   To contact the reporter on this story:
