One European Union member-state
opposed a proposal to delay auctions of 900 million carbon
permits from the three years through 2015, the EU regulatory arm
said on its website today without identifying the country.  Most nations don’t have a final position yet and “a
handful” of governments expressed support for the draft plan,
according to a summary of the Dec. 13 meeting of the EU Climate
Change Committee, which includes experts from member states.  The commission asked nations to indicate their positions on
the draft at that meeting. No vote was scheduled. The next
meeting of the committee is set for Jan. 23 and its agenda
includes further talks on the proposal, known as backloading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
