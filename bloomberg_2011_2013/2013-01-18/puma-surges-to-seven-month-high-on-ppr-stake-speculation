Puma SE (PUM) , Europe’s second-biggest
sporting-goods maker, surged to a seven-month high in Frankfurt
trading amid speculation  PPR (PP)  SA plans to increase its stake in
the company.  The shares rallied 4.2 percent to 240.95 euros at the close
of trading, the highest price since June 21. The volume of
shares changing hands was more more than triple the three-month
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  PPR owns an 82.4 percent stake in Puma and the Paris-based
company’s managing director, Jean-Francois Palus, became
chairman of the Germany firm in December.  “The market is speculating that PPR will continue to buy
shares, with a view to getting to 95 percent and then to de-
list,” said  David Noble , an event sales trader at Louis Capital
Markets in London. “Puma-PPR is an ongoing story, they have
bought shares in the past and will continue to do so
opportunistically.”  Paul Michon, a spokesman for PPR, declined to comment on
the speculation today. Palus said in July that buying Puma’s
outstanding shares was “not a priority.”  Puma shares had advanced 2.9 percent this year through
yesterday, versus a 5.4 percent rally for rival  Adidas AG. (ADS)   “Adidas shares have had a good run, therefore on the flip
side Puma could just be catching up today,” said Noble. “In a
tough market for consumer goods, brands have a better margin,
which is why luxury stocks have done so well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
