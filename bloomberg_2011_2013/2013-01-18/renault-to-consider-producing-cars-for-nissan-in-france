Renault SA (RNO)  is considering producing
cars in France for  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  and other partners as part
of a possible deal with the country’s unions on working
conditions and increased flexibility.  “The signing of an agreement in the framework of current
negotiations with unions to guarantee the global performance of
Renault in France will allow us to make commitments on the
allocation of volumes coming from our partners,” Renault said
in an e-mailed statement today.  French Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg said earlier
today on the radio station RMC that he had asked  Carlos Ghosn ,
chief executive officer for both Renault and Nissan, to look at
producing Nissan vehicles at underutilized Renault factories as
part of the current labor talks.  The Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based company plans to
eliminate 7,500 jobs through 2016 in its home country, including
5,700 posts that will disappear when employees retire or quit
and aren’t replaced. It’s also talking with unions on ways to
raise productivity, asking for a 6.5 percent increase in work
hours and greater mobility between factories.  The job cuts are intended to reduce fixed costs by 396
million euros ($529 million), Dominique Chauvin, head of the
CFE-CGC union at Renault, said on Jan. 15. The carmaker doesn’t
plan to shutter any factories, Ghosn said that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
