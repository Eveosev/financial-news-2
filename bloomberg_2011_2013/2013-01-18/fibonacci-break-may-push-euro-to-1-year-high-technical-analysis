The euro is set to rise to its
highest level against the dollar in more than a year after
breaking through an area of so-called resistance, Credit Suisse
AG said, citing trading patterns.  Breaching the $1.3309 resistance zone opens up an advance
for the shared currency through the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement level at $1.3493 and eventually to $1.40, Credit
Suisse analysts including Christopher Hine wrote in a note
today, a level last touched in October 2011. The current is a
follow-through from the completion of a long-term inverted head-
and-shoulders reversal pattern in December, they wrote.  “Only a sustained breakdown through $1.2998 neutralizes
the upside threat, while a violation of $1.2662 is required for
a bearish tone to emerge,” wrote Hine, vice president of
technical analysis for Credit Suisse in  London .  The euro weakened 0.4 percent to $1.3326 at 2:33 p.m. New
York time after appreciating on Jan. 14 to $1.3404, the
strongest level since Feb. 29, 2012.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance is an area on a price
graph where technical analysts anticipate sell orders to be
clustered.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
