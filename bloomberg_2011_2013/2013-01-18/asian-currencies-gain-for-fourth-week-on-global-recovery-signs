Asian currencies had a fourth weekly
gain, the longest winning streak since September, on optimism
the global economy is recovering.  China’s economic growth accelerated for the first time in
two years, with industrial output picking up, according to
government figures released yesterday. Housing starts in the
U.S., the world’s largest economy, topped estimates and
applications for jobless benefits declined, reports showed on
Jan. 17.  “There’s a lot of risk-on sentiment after U.S. data came
in stronger than expected,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-
based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. The pickup in
 China’s economy  “is also helping Asian currencies,” he said.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, advanced
0.2 percent this week. The gauge reached a 16-month high
yesterday. India’s rupee led gains, climbing 1.9 percent to
53.7050 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Thailand ’s baht appreciated 1.8 percent to 29.74, while
Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.3 percent to 3.0103.  China’s gross domestic product increased 7.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, after a 7.4 percent gain in
the previous three months. Housing starts in the U.S. climbed
12.1 percent last month to a 954,000 annual rate, exceeding all
84 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  ‘Bottoming Out’  “Global economic activity is finally bottoming out while
tail risk has diminished,” Credit Agricole CIB analysts led by
Hong Kong-based Mitul Kotecha wrote in a report released
yesterday. “While there is still plenty of event risk, ultra-
easy monetary policy, progress in  Europe  and a pickup in Chinese
growth mean that markets can breathe a sigh of relief.”  The baht completed its biggest weekly advance since 2011
and touched a 17-month high of 29.72 per dollar on Jan. 17 as
global funds favored higher-yielding assets. Overseas investors
bought $1 billion more of sovereign debt than they sold in the
four days to Jan. 17, boosting net purchases for the month to
$2.6 billion, and pumped $125 million into the nation’s
equities, Thai Bond Market Association and stock exchange data
show.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said on Jan. 17
exporters will face difficulties if the baht strengthens
further. The government’s 10-year bond yield of 3.72 percent
compares with 1.86 percent in the U.S. and 0.75 percent in
Japan.  Smoothing Operations  “Funds are flowing into the whole of Asia, especially
 Southeast Asia , and Thailand is one of the most attractive
places,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life
Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “It’s possible to see
smoothing operations to slow the pace of the appreciation, but
they may not aggressively intervene to weaken the baht.”  India’s rupee rose to an 11-week high yesterday after the
government allowed state refiners to gradually increase diesel
prices, a move that may help rein in energy subsidies and shore
up public finances.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is seeking to cut
spending on subsidies as part of a plan to narrow the  budget
deficit  to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product and avoid a
downgrade in the sovereign debt rating.  Elsewhere in Asia, the  Philippine peso  advanced 0.1 percent
this week to 40.575 against the greenback, and the Chinese  yuan 
traded at 6.2154 compared with 6.2161 at the end of last week.
South Korea’s won dropped 0.2 percent to 1,057.08, Taiwan’s
dollar fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.06, while Indonesia’s rupiah
was little changed at 9,630.  To contact the reporters on this story:
