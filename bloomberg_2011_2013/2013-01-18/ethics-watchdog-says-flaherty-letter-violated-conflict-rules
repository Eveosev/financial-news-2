Canada’s ethics commissioner said
Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  acted improperly when he sent a
letter to the country’s broadcasting regulator on behalf of a
constituent applying for a radio licence.  Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commssioner Mary Dawson
made the statement in an order posted on the agency’s website.
The order instructs Flaherty not to send any similar letters
without approval from her office.  Flaherty sent a letter dated March 30, 2012 to the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on behalf of
Doug Kirk, head of Durham Inc., supporting the company’s
application for a radio licence, according to the order.  Dawson won’t investigate further, since the “facts are
clear and an order has been made,” spokeswoman Jocelyne
Brisebois said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
