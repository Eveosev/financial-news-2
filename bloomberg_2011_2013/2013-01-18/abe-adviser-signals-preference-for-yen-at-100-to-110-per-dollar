Koichi Hamada, the former Yale
professor advising Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on
choosing a new central bank chief, signalled that a yen at 110
per dollar would pose a problem for the economy.  “I think 100 yen is a good level for  Japan , 110 is too
weak but 95 or 100 is no problem,” Hamada said after a speech
in Tokyo today, referring to the level of the yen against the
dollar. “We need to bring the yen back to a level that works
well for Japan’s economy.”  The yen has weakened about 4.5 percent since Abe took
office last month, with his administration pushing for more
monetary easing and a doubled inflation target at the central
bank. The government and  Bank of Japan (8301)  will issue a joint policy
statement at next week’s central bank meeting, Finance Minister
Taro Aso said earlier today.  Hamada, who once taught the current BOJ governor,  Masaaki Shirakawa , said that the central bank has no choice but to
conduct further monetary easing. He also said that the bank was
to blame for the failure of Elpida Memory Inc. by not expanding
its balance sheet sufficiently, which led to a strong yen.
Japanese exporters have been hampered in recent years by
strength in the yen, which reached a postwar high in 2011.  The currency was trading at 90.05 yen at 2:54 p.m in Tokyo,
after touching a 2 1/2 year low of 90.21 earlier in the day. A
range of 95-100 yen per dollar was last sustained in 2009.  Hamada also wondered if he should be advising Economy
Minister Akira Amari on the yen. The minister moved the yen this
week with comments he later said had been misinterpreted. Today,
he said that speaking about the currency was the finance
minister’s responsibility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
