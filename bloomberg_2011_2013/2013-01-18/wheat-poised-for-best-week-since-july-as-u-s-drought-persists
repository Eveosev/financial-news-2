Wheat rose, capping the biggest
weekly gain since July, on signs of improved export demand and
as a lingering drought threatens this year’s  harvest  in the
U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  Export sales  more than doubled to 536,200 metric tons in
the week ended Jan. 10, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Drought will persist in the southern Great Plains for the
next three months, the Climate Prediction Center in  College
Park , Maryland, said yesterday. Informa Economics Inc. said the
U.S. wheat crop will fall to 2.211 billion bushels from 2.269
billion last year.  “We did see good export sales this week, and we still have
dry weather,”  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler Commodities LLC
in Augusta,  Kansas , said today by telephone. “It’s nice to see
a bounce, and I feel we may have possibly put in a bottom in
this market.”  Wheat futures for delivery in March advanced 1.3 percent to
settle at $7.9125 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price rose 4.8 percent this week.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
