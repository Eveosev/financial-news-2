Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose
for a second day after the government said spending on railways
will increase this year, boosting demand for the construction
material in the world’s biggest consuming nation.  Rebar for delivery in May rose as much as 1 percent to
3,987  yuan  ($641) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
before trading 3,967 yuan at 10:14 a.m. local time. The alloy is
set to rise 1 percent this week, the sixth weekly gain in the
last seven weeks.  The government will spend 650 billion yuan this year on
railway construction, more than the 631 billion spent last year,
Xinhua News Agency said, citing Minister of Railways Sheng
Guangzu. China will also attract private capital participation
in rail projects by setting up a national railway development
fund as an investment platform, according to Xinhua.  “Spending on railways and other public infrastructure
projects is bullish for rebar,” Wu Zhili, analyst at Shenhua
Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen. “The market is
returning its attention to the positive outlook in the medium-
term.”  The average spot  price  for rebar is little changed at 3,733
yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was
unchanged at $145.40 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel
Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
