AWE Ltd. (AWE) , the Australian explorer
planning a $600 million oil project off  Indonesia , expects to
appoint a financial adviser within two weeks to help sell as
much as half of the development to a partner.  The company plans to complete the process to find an
investor for the Ande Ande Lumut venture by mid-year and to
decide in the third quarter whether to go ahead with the
project, Bruce Clement, managing director of Sydney-based AWE,
said today in a phone interview. Clement declined to name the
financial adviser AWE is planning to hire.  AWE is developing shale gas prospects in the Perth Basin of
Western Australia and planning to expand in Asia and New
Zealand. The company last year acquired from  Malaysia ’s  Genting
Bhd. (GENT)  two Indonesian oil blocks, including Ande Ande Lumut, which
had an estimated 76 million barrels of recoverable oil.  “This is a substantial oilfield development,” Clement
said. “There aren’t many 70 or 80 million barrel fields being
developed in this part of the world, and this is a significant
opportunity to be a partner and participate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
