LEG Immobilien AG, the apartment
landlord owned by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , plans to raise as
much as 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in an initial public
offering poised to be the largest by a German property company.  LEG will sell as many as 30.5 million shares for 41 euros
to 47 euros each, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a
statement today. That’s 57.5 percent of LEG’s shares. The stock
will begin trading in  Frankfurt  on Feb. 1.  Goldman Sachs, which bought the company for about 3.5
billion euros including debt in 2008, is seeking to profit from
a boom in German residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit
index of  German property stocks  has gained 38 percent in the
past 12 months.  “An investment in LEG shares offers the opportunity to
invest in a large pure-play residential property company with
high growth,” LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in
the statement. “In order to achieve future growth, we
constantly screen the market for potential acquisitions.”  LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
 Germany ’s most populous state. Goldman Sachs’ Whitehall Street
Real Estate fund holds about 95 percent of the company. Perry
Capital owns the rest.  The offer period for the IPO will run from Jan. 21 to Jan.
31. Goldman Sachs and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  will be lead managers.  Guy Hands  Deutsche Annington Immobilien AG, Germany’s largest owner
of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington,
controlled by  Guy Hands ’ Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., has
about 186,000 homes.  After the share sale, LEG will be Germany’s second-largest
publicly traded residential landlord by properties with 91,000
apartments. The biggest is  Gagfah SA (GFJ) , controlled by  Fortress
Investment Group LLC (FIG) , which has about 145,000 apartments.  LEG’s profit from its main business of renting apartments
was 243 million euros in 2011 and its funds from operations were
111.8 million euros, according to its last annual report. FFO
measures a property company’s ability to generate cash.  By comparison, Gagfah generated a rental profit of 419.6
million euros in 2011 and its FFO was 159.5 million euros,
according to its annual report.  Active Investor  Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
in the German real estate market. In April 2011, Whitehall
Street and Cerberus Capital Management LP raised 468 million
euros in an IPO of Berlin-based residential landlord  GSW
Immobilien AG. (GIB)   Whitehall Street also made an unsuccessful bid to buy
Baubecon, the residential property portfolio that  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
agreed to sell to  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  in May in a deal valued at
1.24 billion euros. Whitehall Street agreed to sell its stake in
17 German department stores, including Kaufhaus des Westens, the
country’s largest, in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
