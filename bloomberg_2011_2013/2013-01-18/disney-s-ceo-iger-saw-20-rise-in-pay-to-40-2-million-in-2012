Robert Iger , chairman and chief
executive officer of  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , collected $40.2 million in
total compensation last fiscal year, based on regulatory
reporting rules, a 20 percent increase.  Iger’s pay included $2.5 million in salary, $9.53 million
in stock awards, $7.75 million in option awards and a bonus of
$16.5 million, according a regulatory  filing  today. A change in
the value of his  pension plan  and other compensation added
almost $4 million more.  The increase came in a fiscal year when shares of Burbank,
California-based Disney returned 76 percent including dividends,
compared with 30 percent for the  S&P 500 index . Iger, 61, also
took on the added role of chairman.  Walt Disney ’s  profit  rose 18
percent to $5.68 billion in the year ended Sept. 30.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company, will
hold its annual meeting March 6 in Phoenix.  At last year’s meeting 57 percent of shareholders supported
the company’s executive pay plan, down from 77 percent the year
before. In today’s filing, Disney said the vote “fell below our
expectations.”  The company reconfigured its bonus terms after management
and the chairwoman of the compensation committee met with the
largest shareholders, according to the filing.  While the previous plan allowed management to collect 100
percent of their bonuses even if shareholder returns were weak,
the new plan bases awards equally on stock performance and
earnings, according to the filing. The company said 92 percent
of Iger’s targeted compensation is performance based.  Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds is proposing at
the annual meeting that investors vote to split the chairman and
CEO roles in the future, according to today’s filing. Disney’s
board opposes that plan.  Disney fell 0.1 percent to $52.34 at the close in New York.
It has gained 5.1  percent  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
