India ’s sovereign bonds were set for
a third weekly gain as inflation at a three-year low fueled
optimism the central bank will cut  interest rates  this month and
after the government unveiled measures to curb subsidies.  The wholesale-price  index  rose 7.18 percent in December
from a year earlier, the least since 2009, government data
showed this week.  Oil companies  have been allowed to adjust
prices of diesel over a period of time, Oil Secretary G.C.
Chaturvedi said in  New Delhi  yesterday. Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram is seeking to cut fuel subsidies as part
of a plan to narrow the budget  deficit  to 5.3 percent of gross
domestic product and avert a sovereign rating downgrade.  “Bonds have rallied as the low inflation number has
strengthened speculation of monetary easing,” said Debendra
Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at  Development Credit Bank
Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. The move to enable refiners to raise state-set
diesel prices is also positive for bonds, he said.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this week to 7.82
percent as of 9:27 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate fell two basis points today and
touched 7.80 percent on Jan. 14, the lowest level for a
benchmark 10-year security since July 2010.  The  Reserve Bank  of India, which last lowered the
repurchase  rate  by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April, will
again cut the rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent at a Jan.
29 review, 13 of 16 analysts predicted in a Bloomberg survey
this week. The rest expect a reduction to 7.5 percent.  “The repo rate may be cut by 25 basis points this month,”
Dash said.  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, rose three basis points
this week to 7.56 percent in Mumbai, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It fell one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
