DJ Spooky, or Paul D. Miller, is
currently artist in residence at the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art.  Hear his “Nauru Elegies” tonight, a confluence of music,
video, animation and a live Internet feed of GPS coordinates of
the South Pacific island.  Long exploited for its phosphate deposits, Nauru has turned
to offshore banking as a way to make money. For DJ Spooky, the
island is a symbol of postcolonial issues, the emerging digital
economy and ecological disaster.  DJ Spooky will also be giving a talk on Saturday in the
Oceanic Art Galleries.  Metropolitan Museum of Art , 1000 Fifth Ave. Information:

who’s been documenting human foibles and naked emperors for
decades.  John Updike said, “All cartoonists are geniuses, but Arnold
Roth is especially so.”  Roth’s work has appeared in publications as diverse as “The
 New Yorker ” and “Playboy,” and he has also created ads, record
covers and book jackets.  “The Pen-Ultimate Arnold Roth” runs through March 2 at the

spiral: At one point he steals whisky and an ATM card from the
pocket of a dead friend.  The work, by Jonathan Marc Sherman, is based on “Baal,”
Bertolt Brecht’s first full-length play.  Hawke, who also directed, is joined by Vincent D’Onofrio,

life-like puppets that interact with members of the audience,
demanding a scratch behind the ear for example.  It takes six people three months to build one T-Rex, so
there’s a high level of detail and scientific accuracy.  One caution: Kids under six might get too scared.  Erth’s Dinosaur Zoo runs through Jan. 27 at the New Victory
Theater, 209 W. 42nd St. Information: +1-646-223-3010;

punishment, her husband insists that from then on, the lover’s
abandoned suit be treated as an honored house guest.  After sold-out runs in Paris and  London , “The Suit” comes
to the  Brooklyn  Academy of Music.  Set in a South African township, the strange, moving story
is by Can Themba and staged by the legendary Peter Brook.  At BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton St., Brooklyn.

Orchestra conducted by Ivan Fischer, with Liza Ferschtman on
