An opposition group said Syrian
troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad stormed a suburb of
Homs, killing residents with knives and other blunt objects or
torching them along with their homes.  The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights  said 106
people were killed in the raid on Basateen al-Huswiya, a poor
suburb outside the city of Homs, that began on Jan. 15. The
group said on its Facebook page that it has fully documented the
names of 25 dead civilians so far, 14 of them from the same
family, including three children. It said it has received
information that other families were killed en masse, including
one that lost 32 members.  Elsewhere in  Syria , the official SANA news agency said
rebels fired a rocket into a residential area in Aleppo today,
causing many casualties. Twin blasts that ripped through a
university campus in Aleppo a few days ago killed more than 80
people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
