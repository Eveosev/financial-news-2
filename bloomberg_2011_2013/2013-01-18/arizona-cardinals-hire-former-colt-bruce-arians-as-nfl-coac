Bruce Arians, who led the
 Indianapolis Colts  to a 9-3 record as interim coach this season,
was named coach of the  Arizona  Cardinals.  Arians reached an agreement on a four-year contract with a
team option for a fifth, the Cardinals said, without disclosing
financial terms.  Arians, 60, was the offensive coordinator for the Colts and
substituted in 12 National Football League games for coach Chuck Pagano while he was treated for leukemia.  The Cardinals released Ken Whisenhunt the day after they
finished the 2012 season with a 5-11 record.  Arians joined the Colts after spending eight seasons with
the Pittsburgh Steelers. He also was an assistant coach for New
Orleans and Kansas City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
