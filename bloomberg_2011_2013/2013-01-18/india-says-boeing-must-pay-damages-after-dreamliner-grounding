Boeing Co. (BA)  must compensate state-run
Air India Ltd. for losses the national carrier may have incurred
after grounding its fleet of 787 Dreamliner aircraft, an Indian
official said.  “We have to understand the scale of the problem, the
delays it will cause and what impact it’ll have overall,” Civil
Aviation Minister Ajit Singh told reporters in  New Delhi  today.
The Indian carrier will wait for the U.S. safety review to be
completed before seeking damages, he said.  Air India joins Poland’s state-run Polskie Linie Lotnicze
Lot SA in studying claims for compensation after the  Federal
Aviation Administration  grounded the 787 to prove that lithium-
ion batteries in the model were safe. The global grounding
followed a battery fire that forced an All Nippon 787 to make an
emergency landing in Japan on Jan. 16 and other incidents last
week.  Air India  hasn’t yet changed its plan to purchase the
Dreamliners, of which it has six in its fleet and 21 more on
order, Singh said. The carrier, which in April received a
government bailout worth 300 billion rupees, had plans to induct
two more Dreamliners by March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
