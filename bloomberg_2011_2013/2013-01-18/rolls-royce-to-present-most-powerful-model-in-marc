Rolls-Royce,  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW) ’s ultra-luxury car brand, will debut a new model,
called the Wraith, expanding its lineup to tap growing demand
from wealthy consumers in the U.S. and  China .  The new model will be the “most dynamic and powerful” car
in the brand’s 108-year history, the Goodwood, England-based
carmaker said today in a statement. Rolls-Royce will unveil the
vehicle at the  Geneva Motor Show  on March 5 and deliveries will
start in the fourth quarter.  “Rolls-Royce Wraith will draw superlatives when it is
unveiled,” Chief Executive Officer Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes said
in the statement. “Wraith alludes to an almost imperceptible
but powerful force, something rare, agile and potent, a spirit
that will not be tethered to the earth. It is the perfect name
for our new model.”  Rolls-Royce, which currently sells the $380,000 Phantom and
smaller Ghost, competes with  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Bentley at the top
end of the auto market. Bentley outsells Rolls-Royce by more
than two to one, thanks to the sporty $189,900 Continental GT.  Global sales of cars costing more than 100,000 euros
($130,000) are forecast to beat the 2007 peak this year and will
climb 35 percent to almost 540,000 by 2015, according to IHS
Automotive. The jump is fueled by a 52 percent surge in demand
in  North America  and 34 percent climb in China.  The name of the new Rolls-Royce is derived from a 1938
model. The BMW unit didn’t release any details about the car.  To contact the reporter on this story:
