Banco do Brasil SA ,  Latin America ’s
biggest lender by assets, fell the most in two months after
saying it may increase a stake in Banco Votorantim SA, which
reported five straight quarterly losses through September 2012.  Shares declined 2.4 percent to 26.18 reais at 1:11 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after earlier falling as much as 4.5 percent in the
steepest intraday drop since Nov. 8. The MSCI Brazil/Financials
Index slid 0.5 percent.  Banco do Brasil is studying the possibility of increasing
its stake in Votorantim, and the transaction would involve only
preferred shares of the bank, according to a regulatory filing
today. The state-controlled lender in January 2009 bought a 50
percent interest in Votorantim, a bank specializing in corporate
and auto loans.  “From what we’ve seen so far, Banco do Brasil’s investment
in Votorantim was a terrible decision,” Rodolfo Amstalden, an
analyst at consulting firm Empiricus Research, said by phone
from  Sao Paulo . “Now it’s saying it may inject even more money
there.”  Votorantim’s net loss jumped almost five times to 497
million reais in the third quarter of 2012, according to a
regulatory filing on Nov. 8.  Banco do Brasil gained 8 percent last year, while the
 financials index  fell 1.3 percent during the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
