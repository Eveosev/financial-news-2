Liquefied natural gas consumption by
 Japan ’s 10 regional power utilities increased by 15 percent last
year as almost all the country’s atomic plants stayed shut.  Power companies used 56.6 million metric tons of LNG in
2012, up from 49.1 million tons a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on  data  updated today by the
 Federation of Electric Power Cos . LNG consumption increased by
20 percent in 2011.  Fuel oil use rose by 80 percent in 2012 to 16.2 million
kiloliters (279,000 barrels a day) from the previous year, while
crude consumption jumped 70 percent to 14.8 million kiloliters.
Coal use increased by 0.2 percent to 50.1 million tons.  All 50 of Japan’s functioning reactors were idled in May
for safety checks after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
Two units at  Kansai Electric  Power Co.’s Ohi plant northeast of
 Osaka  were permitted to resume in July.  Kansai Electric plans to restart two additional units at
its Takahama nuclear plant after July 2013, the company said in
a November statement.  Tokyo Electric  plans to start seven
reactors at its Kashiwazaki Kariwa plant between April 2013 and
September 2015, according to a business plan announced in May.
Decisions to begin generation will need approval from the
country’s Nuclear Regulation Authority, Cabinet members and
local authorities.  Rising Thermal Generation  Last month’s  LNG consumption  advanced 1.4 percent from
December 2011 to 5.05 million tons, according to the utilities’
 data  released today. Fuel oil use rose by 23 percent in December
to 1.67 kiloliters, while oil consumption rose 3.2 percent to
1.43 million kiloliters. Coal use declined 2.4 percent to 4.63
million tons.  Thermal power generation rose 4.1 percent in December from
a year earlier. The average operating rate of nuclear plants in
December was 5.3 percent, down from 15 percent a year earlier.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of  fuel oil , crude, LNG and coal for 2012 and for
the month of December. Fuel oil and crude volumes are in
kiloliters, while those for LNG and coal are in tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
