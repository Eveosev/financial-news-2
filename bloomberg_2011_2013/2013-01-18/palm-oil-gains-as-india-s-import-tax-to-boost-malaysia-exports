Palm oil  gained on speculation that
Malaysia may increase exports of refined oils to India after the
world’s biggest buyer said it will tax unprocessed cooking oils
for the first time since 2008.  The contract for delivery in April advanced as much as 1.4
percent to 2,412 ringgit ($801) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and ended the morning session at 2,405
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Futures are set to gain 1.4 percent
this week, the first such advance in three weeks.  Crude palm and  soybean oil  imports will be taxed at 2.5
percent, while the tariff on purchases of refined cooking oils
will be maintained at 7.5 percent, India’s  Agriculture Ministry 
said in a statement yesterday. The benchmark price for
calculating the tariff will be changed for the first time since
2006 on all cooking oils on a fortnightly basis, the government
said in another statement on its website.  “India’s import tax on crude palm oil may favor Malaysia
as we have an edge over  Indonesia  in exports of refined oils,”
said Paramalingam Supramaniam, director at Pelindung Bestari
Sdn. in Kuala Lumpur.  Indonesia, the biggest supplier of palm oil to India, may
lose its market share because of the taxes, keeping its
stockpiles high, Susanto, head of marketing at Indonesian Palm
Oil Association, said in an e-mail today. Crude palm oil imports
totaled 5.99 million tons out of a total crude cooking oil
purchases of 8.4 million tons in the year ended Oct. 31,
according to the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India.  Refined palm oil for delivery in May rose 0.3 percent to
6,730  yuan  ($1,082) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for September rose 0.7 percent to 8,740 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to $14.365 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in March lost 0.2 percent to 51.39 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
