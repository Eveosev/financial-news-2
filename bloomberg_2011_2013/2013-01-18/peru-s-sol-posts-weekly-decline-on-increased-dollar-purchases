Peru ’s sol posted its first weekly
decline since November as the central bank stepped up dollar
purchases to stem the local currency’s rally.  The sol weakened 0.3 percent to 2.5523 this week, according
to prices compiled by Bloomberg. It fell 0.2 percent today.
Peru’s sol has gained 5.5 percent in the past year, the most
among the six most-traded currencies in  Latin America .  The central bank bought $20 million in the spot market
today, bringing the total purchased this week to $970 million.
Banco Central de Reserva del Peru also said in a statement today
that it raised the foreign portfolio limit for pension funds to
32 percent from 30 percent, which will allow the funds to invest
an additional $750 million abroad.  “The central bank is sending a signal that it doesn’t like
the fast pace in which the sol is appreciating,” said Juan Carlos Odar, an economist at  Banco de Credito del Peru (CREDITC1)  in  Lima .  Mining companies, which account for 60 percent of the
country’s exports, are buying soles before an annual deadline
for income tax payments in April. Accelerating growth in the
Andean economy is also attracting foreign investment from
abroad, according to Odar.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.72 percent at 3:39 p.m. in Lima,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
