Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (2330) , the world’s largest contract chipmaker, climbed the most in
two weeks in Taipei trading after forecasting first-quarter
sales that beat analyst estimates.  TSMC  gained  as much as 2.2 percent to NT$101.50, the most
since Jan. 2, before trading at NT$101 as of 9:39 a.m. in
Taipei. Its depository receipts  climbed  2.6 percent in New York
yesterday. The benchmark  Taiex (TWSE)  index added 0.8 percent.  First-quarter  revenue  will be NT$127 billion ($4.4 billion)
to NT$129 billion, higher than estimates for NT$124 billion, the
Hsinchu-based company said yesterday. Superior technology and
continued growth in mobile devices is driving demand for the
company’s manufacturing capacity, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Morris Chang told investors yesterday.  “TSMC is using better pricing, outgrowth and better cost
controls to maintain margins and offset rising tax,” Randy Abrams, who  rates  the stock outperform at Credit Suisse Group AG
in Taipei wrote in a report. “Strong technology mix continues
to improve ASPs, a rare trend in tech.”  Revenue in the made-to-order chip foundry industry will
climb 7 percent this year, with TSMC’s own sales to outpace that
figure, Chang said yesterday. Capital expenditure will be around
$9 billion, surpassing last year’s record $8.3 billion, he said.  Twenty of 32 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg recommend
buying TSMC stock, while 11 have a hold rating and one rate it
as a sell.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
