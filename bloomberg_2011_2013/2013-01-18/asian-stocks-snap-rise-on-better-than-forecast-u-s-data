Asian  stocks  rose for the first time
in three days, with the regional benchmark heading for its
biggest advance in a month, after economic reports in China and
the U.S. beat estimates and the yen traded near a 30-month low.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest automaker, gained
2.1 percent to its highest since October 2008. Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s biggest lender by
market value, added 1.7 percent in Hong Kong. Rio Tinto Group,
the world’s second-largest mining company, rose 2.7 percent in
Sydney after Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese resigned
without getting a cash windfall.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 1.2 percent to 132.72 as
of 7 p.m. Tokyo time. Almost four shares rose for each that fell
on the gauge, which is set for a 0.7 percent advance this week.
Chinese shares traded in Hong Kong and  Shanghai  climbed after
the nation’s economic growth accelerated for the first time in
two years and industrial output picked up.  “This rally can continue as the economic recovery in  China 
and the U.S. will support company earnings,” said Michiya Tomita, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co., which oversees $70 billion. “Everyone seem to
be bullish on the Japanese market, which also supports sentiment
around Asia. The weaker yen will boost Japanese exporters’
earnings.”  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index is rallying for a third month
amid signs the U.S. and Chinese economies are recovering and
Japanese shares rallied for a 10th week on speculation Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe will pursue more aggressive stimulus
policies. The Asian benchmark trades at 14.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500
and 12 times for the Stoxx 600.  Receding Risks  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained 1.4 percent, while
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.1 percent. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of mainland companies traded in the city
climbed 2.1 percent, the highest close since August 2011.  The nation’s economy expanded 7.9 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to government data. That compared with median
estimate of 7.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey and 7.4
percent in the previous three months. Industrial output in
December rose a more-than-expected 10.3 percent and fixed-asset
investment for the year gained 20.6 percent.  “Some of the macroeconomic risks that the markets have
been dealing with for the last couple of years continue to
recede,” Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at
Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said on Bloomberg
Television. His firm manages about $54 billion in assets. “The
intervention the Bank of  Japan  is undertaking to weaken the yen
should produce better profits for Japanese multinationals.
China’s story is one of accelerating GDP growth.”  Weaker Yen  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  jumped 2.9 percent to its
highest close since April 2010. The gauge extended its rally for
a 10th week, the longest streak of weekly gains since April
1987, as the yen traded near a 2 1/2-year low amid speculation
the Bank of Japan will decide to conduct open-ended asset buying
to stoke inflation at a two-day policy meeting starting Jan. 21.  Japanese stocks are the most sensitive to yen swings in 24
years, leaving $343 billion in equity gains since November at
the mercy of the currency, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News.  South Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.7 percent, while Taiwan’s
Taiex Index climbed 1.5 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 0.3 percent.  Exporters Gain  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index added 0.6 percent in New York
yesterday, when data showed builders started more houses than
forecast in December and first-time claims for unemployment
benefits fell more than forecast last week.  Exporters advanced. Toyota gained 2.1 percent to 4,300 yen.
 Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a Japanese carmaker that gets about 44 percent
of sales from North America, climbed 3.2 percent. Sony Corp.
soared 12 percent after announcing the sale of its New York
headquarters for $1.1 billion.  Chinese lenders and raw-material producers gained on signs
growth is rebounding. ICBC, as the nation’s biggest lender is
known, rose 1.7 percent to HK$5.94 in Hong Kong.  Jiangxi Copper
Co. (358)  climbed 1.7 percent to HK$21.45. Aluminum Corp. of China
Ltd. increased 3.1 percent to HK$3.97.  Rio Tinto jumped 2.7 percent to A$66.35 in Sydney. The
company said Albanese resigned as CEO without a cash windfall,
forgoing his bonus for a third straight year after failed deals
in aluminum and coal led the miner to $14 billion in writedowns.  Chip Rally  Japanese semiconductor-equipment makers rallied after Intel
Corp., the world’s biggest chipmaker, and  Taiwan  Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp., the largest producer of contract producer
chips, announced plans to raise capital spending this year.  Tokyo Electron Ltd., the world’s No. 2 maker of
semiconductor-production machinery, surged 8.4 percent to 4,125
yen. Advantest Corp., the biggest producer of memory-chip
testers, climbed 8.2 percent to 1,380 yen.  TSMC added 2.2 percent to NT$101.50 in Taipei after
forecasting first-quarter sales that beat estimates.    First-
quarter revenue will be NT$127 billion to NT$129 billion ($4.4
billion to $4.5 billion) against estimates for a NT$124 billion
gain, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said yesterday.  Trauson Holdings Co. surged 41 percent to HK$7.25 in Hong
Kong, heading for its biggest advance since June 2010, after
Stryker Corp. offered $764 million in cash to acquire the
Chinese maker of orthopedic implants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
