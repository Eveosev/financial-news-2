Oprah Winfrey ’s interview with
cyclist  Lance Armstrong  attracted the second-largest audience
ever to her OWN television network, missing the record set last
year with members of Whitney Houston’s family.  Last night’s telecast drew 3.2 million viewers and 1.1
million more in a rerun, Los Angeles-based OWN said today in an
e-mailed statement. The Houston family interview last March 11
attracted an audience of 3.5 million.  The interview with the seven-time Tour de France winner,
who was stripped of his medals last year, comes as Winfrey’s
cable network, co-owned with  Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) ,
seeks to lift ratings and break even in the second half of the
year. Armstrong, 41, ended 13 years of denials by admitting for
the first time he had used performance-enhancing drugs.  Part 2 of the interview is slated to run tonight. Part 1
was the highest rated weekday telecast ever for OWN, the network
said. The interview was streamed 600,000 times, with viewers
watching online from 190 countries.  Discovery, based in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland , gained 0.6
percent to $67.72 at the close in New York. The stock advanced
55 percent in 2012.  Winfrey, 58 has boosted the audience of OWN since taking
over as chief executive officer in July 2011 and hosting
“Oprah’s Next Chapter.” She also scored ratings wins
interviewing Rihanna and pastor Joel Osteen.  Program Slate  “Our America With Lisa Ling,” “Welcome to Sweetie
Pie’s” and “Six Little McGhees” were among OWN’s most-watched
programs, the network said on Jan. 4.  The network expects to reach about 85 million U.S. cable TV
homes by May, Discovery CEO  David Zaslav  said at a Dec. 4
investor conference. He reiterated the company’s projection that
OWN would break even in the second half of 2013.  The network increased its average prime-time audience by 61
percent to 328,000 viewers in the fourth quarter of 2012 from a
year earlier. Almost three-fourths were female, according to
Nielsen data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
