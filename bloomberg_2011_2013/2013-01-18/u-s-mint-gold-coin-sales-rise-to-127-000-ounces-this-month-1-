Sales of American Eagle gold coins
so far this month are 67 percent higher than the total for
December, according to data from the U.S. Mint. Silver-coin
sales also gained.  Gold-coin  sales  reached an estimated 127,000 ounces,
compared with 76,000 ounces in December, data from the mint’s
website show. In January 2012, the total was 127,000 ounces.  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , Credit Suisse Group AG and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
the three most-accurate gold forecasters tracked by Bloomberg
Rankings over the past two years, project record average prices
for gold in 2013, after 12 straight annual increases for the
metal. Central-bank stimulus will sustain buying as a hedge
against inflation and currency devaluation, they said.  “The physical market in gold and silver has picked up over
the past several months,” Scott Carter, the chief executive
officer at Los Angeles-based Lear Capital, said in a telephone
interview. “There’s a real drive for diversification with
metals because of concerns about national debt and currency
devaluation.”  Silver-coin sales this month are at 6.01 million ounces,
compared with 1.64 million in December. The mint said yesterday
that said it sold out of 2013 American Eagle silver coins and
will resume sales on or about the week of Jan. 28, when
inventory is replenished.  To contact the reporter on this story:
