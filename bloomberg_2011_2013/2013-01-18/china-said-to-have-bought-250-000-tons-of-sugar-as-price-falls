China , the world’s second-biggest
sugar consumer, bought 250,000 metric tons as a 23 percent
decline in prices in the past year made imports attractive, said
two executives with direct knowledge of the matter.  The raw-sugar cargoes will arrive in January and February
at about $460 a ton, cost-and-freight to China, said the
executives, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. At least one shipment is sourced from
 Guatemala , they said.  China’s purchases may help curb a second year of global
surplus and the slide in  New York  futures. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. cut its price forecast this week to 18.5 cents a pound in
three and six months from an earlier estimate of 22 cents,
citing rising inventories.  “The purchase by the Chinese may provide some support to
global sugar prices as it signals that when prices fall to
certain levels buyers such as China and India may be ready to
step in and make purchases,” Dong Shuangwei, an analyst at
Capital Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing today.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.7 percent to 18.52
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S at 5:17 p.m. Singapore time.
White sugar for delivery in May gained 0.3 percent to close at
5,527  yuan  ($889) a ton on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange
today. The most-active contract in Zhengzhou has declined 14
percent in the past year as farmers boosted planting.  China usually issues an annual import quota for 1.94
million tons under a framework with the  World Trade Organization 
at the start of the calendar year. So far, the government hasn’t
handed out the quota for this year. Imports outside the quota
pay a duty of 50 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
