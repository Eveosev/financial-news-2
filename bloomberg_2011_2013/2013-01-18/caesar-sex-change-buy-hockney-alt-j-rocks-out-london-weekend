Alt-J is a box-office hit on the
follow-up tour to its debut CD, “An Awesome Wave,” which won
the Mercury Prize.  The quartet from Leeds performs songs such as
“Tessellate” and “Breezeblocks.” The quirky titles have
drawn comparisons with New York’s Vampire Weekend. There are
dashes of Jeff Buckley and psychedelic pop in there, too.  Alt-J plays tonight and tomorrow at the O2 Shepherd’s Bush
Empire, Shepherd’s Bush Green, W12 8TT.  Information: +44-844-477-2000,  http://www.altjband.com  and

Minister David Cameron, currently on display at the  London Art
Fair . Artist Annemarie Wright polled people online about the
politician, and drew a life-sized portrait where the lines are
actually handwritten opinions. Price: 6,500 pounds ($10,400).  Also at the Woolff gallery is a large, shadowy close-up of
a man’s face. “Steve” (2012), by Texas-born Zac Freeman, is
composed of discarded remote-control parts, mobile phones,
computer keys and buttons. And it’ll set you back 16,000 pounds.  Happy to spend more? There’s a 28,000 pound crayon sketch
by David Hockney, dated 1962, at the Fine Art Society. A fat,
cigar-smoking Italian is draped in a sports towel bearing the
number ``8.'' Hockney’s improbable title: “Italian Athlete.”  There are plenty more gems at the  London  Art Fair, which
ends Jan. 20 at the Business Design Centre on Upper Street in
Islington, N1:  http://www.londonartfair.co.uk  or call
+44-844-8480-136.  Dining in the Upper Street area just got better with the
opening of the Bangkok-style Naamyaa Cafe at Angel. This is the
new casual Asian restaurant of Alan Yau, the man who created
Hakkasan, Wagamama and Busaba Eathai. The Hong Kong restaurateur
is known for his high standards and (post-Hakkasan) low prices.

Shakespeare in the last year. Now comes an all-female “Julius
Caesar.”  Director Phyllida Lloyd has transposed this most imperial
of tragedies to a women’s prison. Togas are out, sweatpants are
in. Caesar (Frances Barber) is the boorish prison boss, and
Brutus (Harriet Walter), the treacherous friend who kills her
off with a drink of bleach.  At times the connection between a single-sex jailhouse and
ancient  Rome  seems forced. Yet when the seasoned actors deliver
their powerful lines, it all seems worth it.  “Julius Caesar” ends Feb. 9 at the Donmar Warehouse.

It’s worth the five-minute walk to 10 Greek Street. This is a
casual venue in Soho with unfussy food that is prepared with
care. It’s inexpensive and unpretentious and it can get very
busy. Information:  http://www.10greekstreet.com/  or
+44-20-7734-4677.  Sunday  Jordanian-born pianist Karim Said, 24, is a protege of
conductor Daniel Barenboim.  He gave his first solo recital at age 8, and is now a
member of Barenboim’s bridge-building West Eastern Divan
Orchestra. In the first of three 2013 recitals, he plays
Debussy, Janacek and Schoenberg.  At the Purcell Room at 1 p.m. on Sunday. Information:
