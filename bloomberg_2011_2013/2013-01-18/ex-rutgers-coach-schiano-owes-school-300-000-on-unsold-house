Former Rutgers University football
coach Greg Schiano must pay the school the $300,000 balance of
an interest-free loan he got to build a multimillion dollar home
in Piscataway, New Jersey, by Jan. 26.  Schiano , 46, who resigned in January to coach the National
Football League’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has been trying to sell
the house since April and has cut the price twice, to $1.95
million from $2.3 million. The coach bought land from the
university and was given the $800,000 loan from the athletic
department in 2007 to build a house about two minutes from the
school’s High Point Solutions Stadium.  Under the agreement, the school forgave $100,000 of the
loan each season Schiano remained as coach, with any balance
remaining when he resigned due one year later. Schiano owes
$300,000 by Jan. 26, according to university spokesman E.J.
Miranda.  The 8,468-square foot (787 square meters), five-bedroom,
five-and-a-half-bath  home  is near the university golf course,
said  Michael Santini , owner of Golden Key Realty in
Martinsville, New Jersey, and the listing agent. It has a
heated, in-ground pool with waterfall and spa, three-car garage,
camera security system and media room with 10-foot ceilings.  “It’s one of those properties where the builder used only
top-of-the-line materials and did it right, from the granite
around the fire pit that seats 50 to the Sub-Zero
refrigerators,” Santini said.  Schiano declined to comment through a Buccaneers spokesman.  Price Reductions  The house has been on the market for 282 days. Initially
listed at $2.3 million last April 17, the price was reduced to
$2.15 million on Sept. 7 and again to $1.95 million on Sept. 28,
according to Santini.  Santini said that Schiano has $2.2 million invested in the
home and is prepared to wait for the right buyer. Homes in the
area are older and many are priced in the $700,000 to $1 million
range.  Schiano left the New Brunswick, New Jersey, school after
posting a 68-67 record in 11 seasons. He led the program to its
first postseason bowl victory and a No. 12 final national
ranking in 2006, the highest ever for the team. The Buccaneers
went 7-9 in his first season in the NFL.  He was paid $2.03 million, including bonuses, in his final
season with the Scarlet Knights. The Buccaneers paid Rutgers
$500,000 last February to buy Schiano out of his contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
