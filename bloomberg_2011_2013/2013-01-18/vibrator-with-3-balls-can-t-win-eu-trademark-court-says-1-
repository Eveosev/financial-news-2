A vibrating sex toy in the shape of
three balls can’t win European Union-wide trademark protection,
an EU court ruled today.  “The shape in question doesn’t diverge considerably from
the norm or what’s usual in that sector,” the  EU General Court 
in Luxembourg ruled today. “Even if vibrators often have an
elongated shape, several other shapes do exist in this market
alongside each other with products that have a spherical,
rounded or flattened appearance.”  Fun Factory GmbH, a Bremen, Germany-based company selling
sex toys, sought the EU-wide intellectual property right for the
shape, which it said distinguishes itself from the usual “pole-
like” design of such products. The EU trademark agency in
Alicante,  Spain , disagreed in a  decision  in January 2012.  OHIM, the EU trademark agency, decided last year that the
vibrator’s shape was functional and adapted to the human body,
and as such not distinctive enough to gain protection.  “The shape of the product is determined by its purpose,”
the EU agency said last year. “There’s no clear distinction
from the usual design and generic shape” of such products.  Fun Factory declined to immediately comment on the ruling,
which can be appealed a last time to the  EU Court of Justice .  The case is: T-137/12, FunFactory v. OHIM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
