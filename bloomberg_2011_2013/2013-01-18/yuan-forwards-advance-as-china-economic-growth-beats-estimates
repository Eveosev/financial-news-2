Yuan forwards rose for a second day
after  China ’s economic growth topped estimates, quickening for
the first time in two years. In the onshore  spot market , the
currency traded within 0.05 percent of a 19-year high.  Gross domestic product  rose 7.9 percent in the three months
ended Dec. 31, official data showed today. That compares with
the slowest pace in three years of 7.4 percent in the previous
period and a  median estimate  for a 7.8 percent gain in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Asian stocks advanced as a
jump in housing starts and a drop in jobless claims in the U.S.
added to signs of a recovery in the world’s largest economy,
brightening the outlook for Asian exports.  “The data boosted confidence that China’s growth is
regaining momentum, which will drive demand for the  yuan ,” said
Stella Lee, president at Success Wealth Management Ltd. in Hong
Kong. “A better export outlook will also support the yuan.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.08 percent
to 6.2740 per dollar as of 10:08 a.m. in Hong Kong, a 0.93
percent discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts were little changed from a
week ago. The Chinese currency rose 0.05 percent to 6.1840
versus the greenback in the offshore market.  The yuan was at 6.2154 per dollar in  Shanghai , little
changed from yesterday’s 6.2160, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.2124 per dollar on
Jan. 14, the strongest level since the government unified the
market and official exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Reference Rate  The People’s Bank of China raised the  reference rate  by
0.02 percent to 6.2752 per dollar today. The spot is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  China’s industrial output rose 10.3 percent in December,
the fastest pace since March, compared with the 10.2 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 44 analysts, according
to a report today. Retail sales climbed 15.2 percent from a year
earlier, compared with the median analyst estimate of 15.1
percent and a 14.9 percent increase the previous month.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, declined 30 basis
points, or 0.3 percentage point, to 1.45 percent this week,

five basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
