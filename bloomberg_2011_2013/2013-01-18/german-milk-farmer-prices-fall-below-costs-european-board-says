German dairy farmers are contending
with a “huge gap” between production costs and the prices they
receive, the European Milk Board said.  Production costs in October were 43.06 euro cents ($0.57) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) in northern regions and 51.03 euro cents a
kilogram in the south, the Hamm, Germany-based producer lobby
said in a  report  dated yesterday, citing a study it commissioned
with the MEG Milch Board. The average price farmers received
last year was 31.50 cents a kilogram, according to the report. A
farm-gate price of 50 euro cents a kilogram is “essential,”
the EMB said.  “The study shows clearly the huge gap between production
costs incurred and the prices producers are paid,” the group
said. “These figures are key findings on the way to achieving
cost-covering milk prices. For the EMB it is essential that
policy-makers use these figures and set up an EU-wide monitoring
agency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
