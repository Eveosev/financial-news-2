Truworths International Ltd. (TRU) ,  South
Africa ’s sixth largest clothing retailer, said sales in the
first-half through December rose 15 percent even as more
consumers struggle to meet payments on store cards.  Revenue increased to 5.5 billion rand ($617 million)
compared with a year earlier while sales at stores open for more
than a year rose 10 percent, the local owner of brands such as
Uzzi and Daniel Hechter said in a statement. Earnings per share
for the period are expected to be 16 percent to 20 percent
higher, Truworths said.  “Credit sales contributed 72 percent to retail sales”
compared with 73 percent a year earlier, the Cape Town-based
company said. “The credit environment has become more
challenging with consumer delinquency levels increasing
nationally.”  Africa’s biggest economy probably expanded at the slowest
pace since the 2009 recession last year, putting pressure on
 consumer spending . South African retail sales growth quickened
in November, increasing 3.4 percent from a year earlier, having
fallen in the two previous months.  Fellow South African retailers  Mr Price Group Ltd. (MPC)  and
 Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  put out worse-than-expected trading
updates earlier this week, causing a sell-off in retail stocks.  Truworths rose 0.4 percent to 100.10 rand by 2:38 p.m. in
Johannesburg, rising for the first time in seven days. About 1.5
million shares changed hands, about the same as the three-month
daily average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
