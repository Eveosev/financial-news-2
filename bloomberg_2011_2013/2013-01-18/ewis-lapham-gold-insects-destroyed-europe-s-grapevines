In 1863, vineyards in  France ’s Rhone
Valley began to sicken. Leaves drooped, the fruit did not ripen,
and inevitably the plants died. Vast tracts were affected, yet
no one knew the cause of the catastrophe.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Finally, in 1868, a group of scientists led by Jules-Emile
Planchon came to the rescue: They dug up healthy and diseased
vines and compared the difference.  Planchon spotted the tiny gold insects covering the roots,
each about the size of a pinprick. They sucked sap, starving the
plants.  Since they resembled the insects recently found on oak
leaves, Phylloxera quercus, Planchon called them Phylloxera
vastatrix -- the destroyer.  This plague, as well as a devastating series of fungal
infections, came from North America. As Europeans imported New
World nursery stock, along came pests and diseases against which
Old World growth had no resistance.  I spoke with Paul Lukacs, author of “Inventing Wine: A New
History of One of the World’s Most Ancient Pleasures,” on the
following topics:  1. Divine Gift  2. Drink & Discuss  3. Aristocratic Beverage  4. Technological Advances  5. Wine for All  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
