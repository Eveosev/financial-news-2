The naira fell, extending its worst
week against the dollar in nine, on speculation government
spending will rise and as corporate demand for foreign exchange
increased after the central bank reduced supply.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened less
than 0.1 percent to 157.1 a dollar by 2:49 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has retreated 0.5 percent this
week, the worst five-day performance since Nov. 16, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria’s legislature approved a 4.98 trillion-naira ($31.7
billion) budget for 2013 in December, 7 percent higher than this
year, and raised the benchmark oil price in this year’s budget
by $4 to $79 a barrel, giving more funds to the government for
spending. The budget will be based on an exchange rate of 160
naira a dollar. President Goodluck Jonathan hasn’t yet signed
the budget or rejected it.  “Given the intended liquidity injections and assumption of
dollar-naira at 160 in the 2013 budget, the naira might come
under pressure due to increased government spending,” Kunle
Ezun and Kenneth Asenime, analysts at  Ecobank Transnational
Inc. (ETI) , wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today. “This
increased spending will boost money supply growth, leading to
price and exchange-rate pressures.”  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold  $120.30 million  this week
at auction, a 38 percent decline from last week, according to
data on its website. The regulator sells foreign exchange at
auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to stabilize the naira. Fuel
imports have been a source of pressure on the naira, according
to the Abuja-based bank.  Planning Ahead  “People are just getting deposits for the year ready,”
Jide Solanke, an analyst at First Securities Discount House
Ltd., said by phone from Lagos today. “Firms are planning how
to go ahead for the rest of the year.”  Yields on naira debt due 2022 fell 10 basis points to 11.27
percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021
declined two basis points to 3.716 percent today.  Nigeria’s  inflation rate  eased to 12 percent in December,
from 12.3 percent a month earlier, the first decline in three
months as the effects of flooding that damaged agricultural
output began to recede, the West African nation’s statistics
bureau said yesterday.  Ghana ’s cedi rose 0.1 percent to 1.9065 a dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
