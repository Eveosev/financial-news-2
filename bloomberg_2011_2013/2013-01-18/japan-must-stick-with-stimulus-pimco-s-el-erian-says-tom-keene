Japan ’s government has to follow
through with plans for stimulus spending, monetary easing and a
doubled inflation target to sustain a weakened yen, said Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer of bond giant Pacific
Investment Management Co.  “It is critical to go from announcement to implementation
to outcomes,” El-Erian said on  Bloomberg Radio ’s
“Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “Structural reforms is what
it’s going to take to sustain moves in the Japanese markets.”  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe needs to carry out stimulus
spending while Japanese consumers will have to accept rising
prices for goods such as oil as the yen depreciates, El-Erian
said.  “Japan is attempting a major paradigm shift,” El-Erian
said. “That is going to fuel talk about currency wars and trade
tensions.”  The yen plunged 17.8 percent during the past 12 months
against nine other developed-market peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes as Japanese officials have moved to
double the inflation target to two percent.  The yen fell 0.1 percent to 89.96 at 9:49 a.m. in  New York ,
and has weakened about 6.6 percent since Abe took office last
month.  El-Erian, who recently returned from Japan after meeting
with Pimco employees, said he won’t be traveling to Switzerland
to attend the  World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos
from Jan. 23-27.  “Davos tends to be reactive,” El-Erian said. “It’s less
good of a predictor of what is likely to happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
