TNK-BP reissued a tender to sell a
cargo of Russian Urals crude oil for loading next month from the
Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, according to two traders with
knowledge of the matter.  The 140,000 metric-ton shipment is for loading Feb. 7 to
Feb. 8, two days later than yesterday’s offer, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The tender closes today.  Novorossiysk,  Russia ’s largest Black Sea port, halted
loading crude tankers yesterday because of storms, according to
OAO Transneft.  Loadings are expected to resume later today if the weather
improves as forecast, Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for Transneft,
said yesterday by phone from Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
