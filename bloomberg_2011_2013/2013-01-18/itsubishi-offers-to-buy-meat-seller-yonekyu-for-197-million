Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest
trading house by market value, offered to buy meat products
retailer  Yonekyu Corp. (2290)  for as much as 17.7 billion yen ($197
million) as it seeks to bolster income from businesses outside
raw materials.  The trader offered 950 yen for each Yonekyu share it
doesn’t already own and may delist the seller of hams and
sausages, it said today in a statement to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The offer is at a 28 percent premium to Yonekyu’s
closing price of 743 yen today.  Mitsubishi, which is Yonekyu’s biggest shareholder with a
23.55 percent stake, is expanding in businesses such as food,
retail and transport to counter volatile earnings from coal,
 iron ore , crude oil and natural gas that are prone to price and
demand fluctuations. Mitsubishi and BHP Billion Ltd. each own
half of the world’s biggest coking coal exporter.  Yonekyu today cut its net income forecast for the fiscal
year ending Feb. 28 by 92.5 percent to 30 million yen. The
company on Jan. 7 reported a 670 million yen loss for the nine
months to Nov. 30, citing worsening consumer demand and growing
competition that led to a drop in prices.  Last month, Mitsubishi said it plans to set up a shrimp
business with  Thai Union Frozen (TUF)  Group in  Thailand . Since 2010
the trader has invested in meat and livestock in China with
Cofco Corp., entered the salmon farming business in Chile and
added grain collection and coffee plantations in Brazil.  Metals and energy accounted for 64 percent of Mitsubishi’s
453.9 billion yen net income for the year ended March 31.
 Consumer goods  made up 12.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
