Susquehanna International Group LLP
is considering doubling the size of its European headquarters in
Dublin after increasing the number of people who work there by a
third in two years, two people with knowledge of the plan said.  The securities firm may move to a property with 55,000
square feet to 65,000 square feet (6,000 square meters) of
 office space , said the people, who asked not to be identified
because a final decision hasn’t been made. The  Bala Cynwyd ,
Pennsylvania-based company occupies offices in Dublin’s
International Financial Services Centre and has approached
landlords in the city’s docklands area seeking more space, the
people said. Susquehanna’s head of strategic planning David Pollard declined to comment.  Rents for Dublin offices have fallen 60 percent from their
2007 peak after the country’s real estate bubble burst, broker
CBRE Group Inc. said in a Jan. 10 report. Overseas companies
have been attracted by the cheaper rates, accounting for about
56 percent of all the office-space leasing in Dublin last year,
according to a Jan. 15 report from broker Lisney Ltd. That was
more than double the percentage in 2006.  One of the options being considered is the AIB
International House building in the IFSC, the people said.  Susquehanna has more than 200 workers in Ireland, according
to the company’s profile on the Grad Ireland website. That’s up
from 177 in 2011 and 152 in 2010, according to a filing with the
Irish Companies Registration Office. The company had 1,500
workers globally through the end of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Irish unit, Susquehanna International Group Ltd.,
reported a loss of about $180 million for 2011, the latest
available accounts filed to Companies Registry Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
