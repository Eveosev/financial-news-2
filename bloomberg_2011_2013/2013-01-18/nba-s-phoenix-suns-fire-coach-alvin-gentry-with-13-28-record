The Phoenix Suns fired coach Alvin Gentry with the National Basketball Association team in last
place in the Western Conference.  Phoenix has lost seven of its past eight games and is 13-28
this season, Gentry’s fifth with the team. An interim coach will
be named in the next 24-48 hours, the team said in a statement.  During his time with the Suns, Gentry’s teams had a 158-144
record. The Suns lost in the 2010 Western Conference finals in
their only playoff appearance under Gentry.  The team offered fans a  money-back  guarantee for its Dec. 6
game against the  Dallas Mavericks . After the Suns’ 97-94 loss,
the Suns received 365 refund demands, about 2 percent of that
night’s 17,517 attendance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
