Vale (VALE3)  SA, the world’s biggest iron-
ore producer, fell the most among peers after Brazil said it
will pursue the full amount of a $2 billion tax claim.  The shares declined 0.9 percent to a one-month low of 39.40
reais at 3:53 p.m. in  Sao Paulo . It was the steepest slide among
 15 rival mining companies  tracked by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s government is still seeking more than 4 billion
reais ($2 billion) in overdue royalty payments from Rio de
Janeiro-based Vale and may take the case to court, Energy
Minister Edison Lobao said yesterday in an interview.  “The news is pushing down the company’s shares,”  Pedro Galdi , chief strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW
Corretora, said in a phone interview. “It’s also being
pressured by iron-ore prices and global stock markets.”  The government and Vale are in discussions on additional
disbursements after the company set aside last year 1.4 billion
reais for outstanding taxes, Lobao said from Brasilia.  “The 1.4 billion reais doesn’t solve the situation,” he
said. “The government is charging over 4 billion reais and if
an agreement isn’t reached this will go to court.”  Vale is “very confident” it won’t need to pay more, Chief
Financial Officer Luciano Siani told investors in  New York  Dec.
3. Vale’s press office in Rio referred questions yesterday to
Siani’s comments.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery slid 0.2 percent to a two-
week low of $145.1 a ton today, according to data compiled by
The Steel Index Ltd. U.S. stocks retreated as data showed
consumer sentiment unexpectedly dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
