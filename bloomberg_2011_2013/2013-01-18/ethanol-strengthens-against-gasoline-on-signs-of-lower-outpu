Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline on speculation that plant closings and lower output
will help alleviate a glut.  The biofuel’s discount to gasoline narrowed 0.76 cent a day
after  Aemetis Inc. (AMTX) , a U.S. ethanol manufacturer, said it idled
its plant in Keyes,  California , absent a profit to make the
additive. A Jan. 16 Energy Information Administration report
showed  production  sank to 784,000 barrels a day last week, the
lowest level since the Energy Department’s analytical agency
began reporting data in June 2010.  “There’s still plenty of barrels out there but if we stay
sub-800,000 barrels we’ll clean that up very quickly,” said  Ian
Jackson , a trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago .  The grain-based additive was 42.18 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery advanced 3.6 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $2.375 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest settlement since Dec. 7. Prices have advanced
12 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for February delivery climbed 2.84 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.7968 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 3 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $2.445 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel
increased 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.345, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.395 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive
jumped 0.5 cent to $2.465.  Corn Gains  Corn for March delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$7.275 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 26 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
27 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale
of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production
that can be fed to livestock.  Jackson said the losses and potential plant closings raised
optimism that supply and demand will become balanced this year.  Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish engineering and renewable energy
company, said yesterday it idled output at ethanol mills in York
and Ravenna,  Nebraska , until market conditions improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
