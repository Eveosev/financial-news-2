The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
said it’s temporarily adding reserves to the banking system with
 repurchase agreements  as part of a program to test the central
bank’s operational readiness.  The transactions, part of a series of open-market
operations began in 2009, don’t represent any change in monetary
policy, according to a Jan. 16  statement  on the New York Fed’s
website.  In repos, the Fed buys  U.S. Treasury , mortgage-backed and
so-called agency debt from dealers for a set period, temporarily
raising the amount of money available in the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the dealers, and the
cash to the Fed.  The Fed has historically used repos and reverse repos to
help maintain the proper level of money in the banking system to
keep overnight  interest rates  close to the central bank’s
target. The Fed has held its target rate for overnight loans
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-
party repo market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
