The U.K. and  Australia  signed a
defense treaty, highlighting cooperation over the design of BAE
Systems Plc’s new Type 26 Global Combat Ship used by Britain’s
Royal Navy.  Defense Secretary Philip Hammond, visiting his Australian
counterpart in Perth today, will sign the accord that promises
greater cooperation in areas such as cyber security, defense
reform, personnel exchange, equipment and science and
technology.  Stephen Smith , the Australian defense minister, agreed to
collaborate with the U.K. on his nation’s future frigate
requirements and explore the possibility of cooperation over
mutual design work for the Global Combat Ship -- a design that
could meet the needs of the Royal Australian Navy.  “This defense treaty will drive forward closer cooperation
on a wide range of issues, making our forces more inter-operable
and maximizing our capabilities,” Hammond said in an e-mailed
statement. “In times of budget pressures for all nations, it
makes sense to maximize economies of scale and work with our
friends to get the best value for money on all sides.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
