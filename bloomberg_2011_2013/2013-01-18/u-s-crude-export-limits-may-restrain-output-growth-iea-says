Growth in U.S. tight oil production
may be limited by restrictions on crude shipments, according to
the  International Energy Agency .  U.S. legislation prevents “large-scale” exports and
domestic refineries will be unable to absorb increasing supplies
of light, tight oil that is contributing to production growth,
the Paris-based agency said in a monthly report today.  “While the need for export capacity is clear, U.S.
producers are hopelessly constrained in their capacity to export
domestic crude,” the IEA said in its report. “The U.S.
refining industry has limited capacity to absorb incremental
production of light, sweet oil.”  The U.S. will become the world’s biggest oil producer for
about five years starting in 2020 as tight oil production grows,
the IEA said in November. Policy makers are hesitant to ease the
export restrictions because of concern that domestic prices may
rise, the IEA said today. Most crude produced in the U.S.
requires a license to export, with the exception of oil produced
in  Alaska ’s North Slope.  To contact the reporter on this story:
