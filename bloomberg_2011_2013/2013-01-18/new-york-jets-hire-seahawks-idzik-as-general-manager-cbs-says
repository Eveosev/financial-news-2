The New York Jets hired John Idzik
as the National Football League team’s general manager, CBS
Sports reported.  Idzik, formerly the Seattle Seahawks’ vice president of
football operations, succeeds Mike Tannenbaum, who was fired by
the Jets after the season. CBS Sports reported the hiring on its
website, citing an NFL official it didn’t name.  Jets spokesman  Bruce Speight  didn’t immediately return an
e-mail seeking comment on the report.  The Jets finished with a 6-10 record and missed the
playoffs for the second season in row. The 43-year-old
Tannenbaum had been the team’s general manager since 2006 after
working as assistant GM beginning in 2001.  New York reached the playoffs three times and never won a
division title in Tannenbaum’s seven years overseeing personnel.
Their regular-season record was 57-55 during that span.  The team retained Rex Ryan as its coach for 2013 and fired
 Tony Sparano  as offensive coordinator after one season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
