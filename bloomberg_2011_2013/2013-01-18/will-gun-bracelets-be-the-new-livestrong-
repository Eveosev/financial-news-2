Newark,  New Jersey , Mayor  Cory Booker  has an answer to the gun problem in the
U.S.: bracelets. Booker has put his support behind the jewelry line " The Caliber Collection ,"
which features bracelets made from the metal of guns and bullet casings seized
by the Newark Police Department. He promoted the line on the  Rachel Maddow show 
Wednesday night, calling the program an effort to turn a weapon into "an
instrument of peace." The collection, which is part ofÂ  Jewelry for a Cause , has raised $20,000 for
the police department. These proceeds are used to finance more gun buybacks in
the city. The bracelets feature the serial number from the recovered weapon and
"NEWARK" written on the inside. Prices range from $150 for a basic steel cuff to
$375 for a brass bangle with a diamond. If you're looking to ditch your yellow silicone-gel Livestrong wristband in
light of  Lance Armstrong 's  doping admission , Booker's offering a social-
statement alternative. And it's more practical than some other options. You
could turn your swords into ploughshares, for instance, but what would you plow
in Newark? (Kirsten Salyer is the social media editor for Bloomberg View.  Follow  her on
