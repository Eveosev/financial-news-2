Yields on ruble bonds fell for a
second day on bets  Russia ’s government will open its domestic
 debt market  to the world’s biggest bond settlement system and as
signs of growth in the U.S. and China spurred appetite for
riskier assets.  An index of five-year government yields fell by four basis
points to 6.3585 percent by 12:48 p.m in Moscow. Russian 10-year
yields fell three basis points to 6.8 percent. The ruble was
little changed at 34.8188 against the central bank’s dollar-euro
basket, which it targets to curb exchange-rate moves that can
hurt exporters. The ruble has gained 0.2 percent against the
basket this week.  There are no obstacles stopping Euroclear Bank SA from
working in Russia and the country’s market watchdog will send it
a written response to a clarification request today, the  Federal
Financial Markets Service  said yesterday. China’s economic
growth accelerated for the first time in two years, while U.S.
housing starts beat economists’ estimates.  “Specific statements on Euroclear were made,” Vladimir Kolychev,  Rosbank (ROSB) ’s chief economist, said by phone today from
Moscow. “Foreign investors expect to enter the country’s bond
market.”  The ruble slid 0.2 percent to 30.2485 against the dollar
and was little changed at 40.4020 versus the euro. Ruble futures
showed the currency strengthening 0.2 percent to 30.533 per
dollar.  The ruble climbed against the basket this week as the
central bank curbed interventions after buying about 15.3
billion rubles ($506 million) of foreign currency at the start
of the year to curb the ruble’s advance.  Crude Oil  “High  oil prices  are supporting a strong ruble rate,”
Kolychev said. The ruble may climb to 34.65 to the basket by the
end of the first quarter, the level at which the central bank
intervenes to weaken it, he said.  Crude slid 0.2 percent to $95.30 in New York, 19 cents off
a four-month high. Oil and natural gas account for about 50
percent of Russia’s government revenue.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 158, according to
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
