Italy ’s  recession  will be worse than
previously expected, the country’s central bank said today as it
cut its 2013 estimate for gross domestic product on weakness in
the global economy and disappointing internal demand.  Italian GDP will probably  contract  1 percent this year, the
 Bank of Italy  said today in its economic bulletin. That compares
with a July estimate from the central bank for a 0.2 percent
reduction.  “In our country, internal demand still hasn’t reached an
inflection point,” the Bank of Italy said. The lower GDP
forecast was “due to the worsening of the international
scenario and the continuation of the weakness in business
activity in recent months.”  Italians are mired in their fourth recession since 2001 as
they prepare to vote next month in parliamentary elections. The
tax increases and budget cuts imposed by Prime Minister  Mario
Monti ’s caretaker government have pushed  joblessness  to 11.1
percent, the highest in more than 13 years. Household confidence
was near a record low last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
