     Jan. 18 (Bloomberg) --　 Japan   stocks  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
Index capping its longest weekly winning streak since 1986,
after the yen fell below 90 to the dollar for the first time in
2 1/2 years, and U.S. housing and jobs data beat estimates.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest carmaker by market
value, rose 2.1 percent to its highest since 2008.  Sony Corp. (6758) 
surged 12 percent to lead exporters higher on a weaker yen and
after announcing the sale of its New York headquarters for $1.1
billion.  Advantest Corp. (6857)  paced gains among makers of
semiconductor equipment after bellwether  Intel Corp . said it was
raising  capital spending . GS Yuasa Corp., a battery supplier to
Boeing Co., rebounded 3.3 percent on speculation defective
batteries linked to the grounding of 787s may be confined to a
small number of planes.  The Topix rose 2.4 percent to close at 911.44 in Tokyo,
gaining 1.4 percent for the week. The equity gauge rose for a
10th week, the longest such streak since July 1986. The  Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 2.9 percent to 10,913.30. Shares rose
after Economy Minister Akira Amari yesterday said Japan’s
currency has more room to fall.  “The yen has fallen after the politician’s comments and
that’s pushing up stocks,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief
strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which
manages the equivalent of about 6 trillion yen ($67 billion).
“In terms of overseas factors, Japanese stocks are getting
support from strong U.S. economic reports and Intel earnings.”  The Topix has risen 26 percent since Nov. 14, when
elections were announced, on optimism the new government will
take steps to fight deflation. The Cabinet approved a 10.3
trillion yen stimulus package on Jan. 11.  The Topix is trading at 1.08 times book value, compared
with 2.22 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.60 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Yen Weakens  Exporters rose after the yen touched 90.21 per dollar, the
lowest level since June 2010, while it also fell against 13 of
its 16 major counterparts. Japan stocks are at their most
sensitive to swings in the currency in 24 years, with the
negative correlation of the Topix to the yen the greatest since
1988.  Sony jumped 12 percent to 1,149 yen, its biggest gain since
2008. Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics said it
agreed to sell its 37-story New York headquarters to investors
led by the Chetrit Group for $1.1 billion.  Toyota gained 2.1 percent to 4,300 yen, the highest since
October 2008.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets 28
percent of its sales in  North America , jumped 12 percent to 220
yen, capping the largest gain since January 2009.  Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso said the government and
the  Bank of Japan  will release a joint statement at the BOJ’s
Jan. 21-22 meeting. The government has urged the central bank to
double its inflation target to 2 percent.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The equity gauge added 0.6 percent in New York
yesterday, when data showed builders broke ground on more homes
than forecast in December and first-time unemployment claims
fell more than forecast last week.  Stocks maintained gains after a report showed China’s
economic growth accelerated for the first time in two years.
Gross domestic product rose 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in
Beijing today, beating estimates for a 7.8 percent gain.  Makers of semiconductor equipment advanced after Intel said
it will spend around $13 billion on new plants and equipment in
2013. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s
largest contract producer of chips, forecast sales surpassing
expectations on rising demand for components used in phones and
tablets.  Advantest Surges  Advantest, the world’s biggest maker of memory-chip
testers, rose 8.2 percent to 1,380 yen.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) 
gained 8.4 percent to 4,125 yen, while Dainippon Screen
Manufacturing Co. advanced 4.9 percent to 472 yen.  GS Yuasa gained 3.3 percent to 315 yen after falling 9.2
percent the past two days. U.S. officials and Boeing are
investigating whether defective batteries from the same batch
caused failures in two 787 Dreamliners. If proved, flaws may be
confined to a small number of planes. Yuasa said it may take
months to complete its probe into the cause of an emergency
landing of an All Nippon Airways Co. Dreamliner on Jan. 16. ANA
and Japan Airlines Co. have since grounded their 787s.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 7.1 percent
to 23.90, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.9 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
