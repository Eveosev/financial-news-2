Gold traded little changed near the
highest price in a month before a report that may show China
halted a seven-quarter growth slowdown, curbing the outlook for
additional stimulus. Platinum fell.  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,688.25 an ounce at
9:55 a.m. in  Singapore , poised to gain 1.5 percent this week,
the most since Nov. 23. Prices gained to $1,696.28 an ounce
yesterday, the highest since Dec. 18. Gold futures advanced as
much as 2.3 percent to a record 4,907 yen a gram ($1,699 an
ounce) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange today.  Gold advanced yesterday after a report showed manufacturing
in the Philadelphia area unexpectedly contracted in January,
increasing pressure on the U.S. central bank to expand stimulus.
China’s gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, up from a three-year low of
7.4 percent in the previous period, a Bloomberg survey showed.  The market “keeps an eye on  China  as a barometer to see
how everyone else is going,” said David Lennox, an analyst at
Fat Prophets in Sydney.  Gold gained 7.1 percent last year as stimulus programs in
the U.S.,  Europe  and  Japan  boosted the metal’s appeal as an
alternative investment. China rolled out infrastructure projects
to boost growth, while limited inflation allowed officials to
hold off from raising interest rates.  Bullion for February delivery declined 0.2 percent to
$1,687.50 an ounce on the Comex.  U.S. Mint  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to $31.6875
an ounce, set to climb 4 percent this week, the biggest gain
since the period ended Nov. 23. Sales of 2013 American Eagle
silver coins are suspended after “temporarily” selling out,
the U.S. Mint said yesterday.  Spot platinum declined 0.4 percent to $1,686.25 an ounce,
up 3.3 percent this week. The metal has rallied 10 percent this
month on concern supplies will tighten. Anglo American Platinum
Ltd., the world’s biggest producer, said on Jan. 15 it will cut
jobs and output in South Africa. Holdings in exchange-traded
products backed by platinum climbed to a record 52.9816 metric
tons yesterday, data tracked by Bloomberg showed.  Palladium dropped 0.4 percent to $722.75 an ounce, poised
to advance 3 percent this week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
