Fiat SpA (F)  will produce a new  Alfa
Romeo  roadster with  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  as part of a plan to
revitalize the upscale Italian brand.  The Japanese carmaker will produce the vehicle, which will
be based on the next-generation Mazda MX-5, at its factory in
Hiroshima, the companies said today in a joint statement.
Production of the two-seat convertible will start in 2015.  Fiat Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  is
overhauling Alfa Romeo with new models in an effort to mimic
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s success with Audi, which is the German
carmaker’s main moneymaker. The agreement today finalizes plans
the Italian and Japanese companies announced in May.  The Alfa Romeo and Mazda roadsters will be developed for
the global market. Each version will have distinct styling and
use engines unique to each brand, the companies said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
