Candente Copper Corp. (DNT) , a Canadian
mining exploration company with operations in Peru, headed for
its biggest weekly drop in more than four years as community
opposition delayed a recently restarted drilling project.  Shares fell 6.3 percent to 45 cents at 12:46 p.m. in  Lima .
The drop pushed the loss since Jan. 11 to 25 percent, the
steepest weekly decline on a closing basis since November 2008.  Peru’s Deputy Mining Minister Guillermo Shinno said Jan. 16
that political groups planned to “paralyze” the Canariaco
deposit in the northern  Andes . The company had resumed
exploratory drilling Jan. 3 after reaching an accord with the
local community of Kanaris whose protests over land rights had
delayed the $1.5 billion project for a year.  “Investors don’t know what to believe as no one knows
who’s in charge of the community,”  Jorge Ramirez , an analyst at
Kallpa Securities SAB, said in a phone interview from Lima.
“Someone has to come forth and clarify the situation, as things
seem to be back to square one.”  Candente Chief Executive Officer Joanne Freeze didn’t
immediately return a telephone call and an e-mail seeking
comment.  The Vancouver-based company’s Canadian-traded shares fell
8.3 percent to 44 cents, pushing the weekly drop to 27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
