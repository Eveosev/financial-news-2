As Prime Minister Shinzo Abe searches for a new  Bank of Japan  governor, he should look outside an institution that has little credibility in global circles. Officialdom in  Tokyo  worries Japan's new prime minister will settle on a BOJ bureaucrat to succeed  Masaaki Shirakawa  when his term ends in April. Doing so would be meant to maintain the appearance of continuity while Abe taps a more compliant policy maker -- someone who will go further to grow the BOJ's balance sheet. That would be a mistake. Abe would do better by going with a respected economist with finance experience who is more open-minded and less doctrinaire than the University of Chicago-trained Shirakawa. One name making the rounds is Haruhiko Kuroda, a former Ministry of Finance official, who would be a fine choice. Since 2005, Kuroda has been running the  Asian Development Bank  in  Manila . During that time, he raised the international profile of an organization charged with reducing poverty in a region that's home to a critical mass of the world's extreme poor. That experience, fused together with his time as a MOF vice minister, mean Kuroda would bring some keen and timely insights to Tokyo. The whole game for the  BOJ , as it tries to defeat deflation, is traction. Its policies have gotten little to date, and the next central-bank head must think outside the box and with a level of creativity that currently eludes Tokyo. A man who's spent the last seven-plus years searching for new and innovative solutions to broaden economic growth could be just what the BOJ needs. Kuroda also would bring a mix of gravitas and strong government connections to the job. The central bank of the third-biggest economy desperately needs a fresh eye.  Japan  may find it in Manila.
