Romanian President Traian Basescu
rejected a proposal from the justice minister to appoint  Tiberiu
Nitu  as general prosecutor and  Ioan Irimie  to head the anti-
corruption prosecutorsâ€™ department.  Justice Minister Mona Pivniceru designated Nitu and Irimie
on Nov. 1 as the country seeks to ease European Union concerns
about the corruption in the country and the transparency of the
selection process for the top two anti-corruption jobs.  Basescu said the selection process lacked transparency and
failed to attract an increased number of qualified candidates,
according to an e-mailed statement today from his office in
Bucharest. He urged the justice minister to review the procedure
before nominating other candidates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
