China’s stocks  rose, capping the
benchmark index’s biggest weekly gain this year, after data
showed the economy accelerated for the first time in two years.  Gree Electric Appliances Inc. (000651)  and SAIC Motor Corp., the
largest Chinese makers of air-conditioners and autos, jumped
more than 4 percent, leading an advance for companies reliant on
growth in the economy. Poly Real Estate Group Co., the second-
biggest Chinese developer, surged 5.5 percent after a report
showed home prices rose in more cities last month. Beijing
Tongrentang Co. led a gauge of health-care companies to the
biggest gain among 10 industry groups this week.  “Economic growth is stabilizing and will pick up in the
first quarter,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist at Zheshang
Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “The rally we’ve seen over the past
month has reflected expectations of an economic recovery.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 1.4 percent to
2,317.07 at the close, extending this week’s gain to 3.3
percent. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 1.7 percent to 2,595.44. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in
 Hong Kong  jumped 1.9 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) ,
the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
added 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Chinese stocks have rallied since approaching four-year
lows on Dec. 3 on signs of an economic recovery and speculation
urban development would increase construction activity. The
Shanghai Composite has risen 18 percent, while the CSI 300 has
advanced 23 percent, entering a  bull market .  Economic Data  Average trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 7.1
percent higher than the 30-day average today. Thirty-day

17.1. The Shanghai Composite trades at 9.8 times earnings for
the next 12 months, near the highest level since May, according
to  daily data  compiled by Bloomberg.  China ’s  economic growth  accelerated more than estimated in
the fourth quarter, with industrial output picking up, after the
government implemented policies to revive domestic demand as
export growth slumped.  The fourth-quarter growth rate of 7.9 percent compared with
the median estimate of 7.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
53 analysts. The economy grew 7.8 percent last year, the
National Bureau of Statistics said. That compared with the
median estimate of 7.7 percent growth.  Industrial production rose 10.3 percent in December from a
year earlier, compared with the 10.2 percent median forecast of
44 analysts. Retail sales in December rose 15.2 percent from a
year earlier. The forecast was for an increase of 15.1 percent.  ‘Cyclical Recovery’  “China is in a cyclical recovery and we can see that the
recovery will continue into the first and second quarters, but
what happens after that is quite uncertain,” said Yao Wei,
China economist with Societe Generale SA. Yao is ranked by
Bloomberg as the most accurate forecaster for quarterly GDP.  A gauge of consumer-discretionary companies in the CSI 300
rose 3.3 percent, the most among 10 industry groups. Gree
Electric surged 6.4 percent to 28.30  yuan  after saying in a

percent to 14.29 yuan.  China Merchants Property Development Co. (000024) ,
the third biggest, gained 5.9 percent to 30.91 yuan.  Home Prices  New home prices climbed in 54 of the 70 cities the

data from the statistics bureau. Prices fell in eight cities,

percent to 27.58 yuan. The second-biggest maker of baijiu liquor
