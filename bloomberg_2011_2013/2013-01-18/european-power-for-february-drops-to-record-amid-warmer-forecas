European power for delivery in 2014
slid to a record as prices for emissions and coal tumbled.  Baseload 2014 German electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, lost as much as 1.2 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. In  France , baseload power for
delivery in 2014 declined as much as 0.8 percent.  German power for 2014 delivery lost as much as 50 cents to
42.55 euros ($56.54) a megawatt-hour, the lowest since Bloomberg
started tracking the contract in January 2010. It traded at
42.70 euros at 5:27 p.m. Berlin-time. In France, baseload power
for next year lost 35 cents to a record 45.70 euros.  European Union carbon permits plunged after low bids at an
auction by  Germany  forced the sale’s cancellation. December
permits dropped as much as 10 percent to a record 5.05 euros a
metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp slid 1.3 percent to $99 a metric ton, also a record low.
Power can track fuel and emissions prices, which affect the cost
of production at plants that burn fossil fuels.  “Forward-year power prices in coal driven markets are
currently facing an almost perfect storm: falling coal prices,
carbon hitting record lows on almost a daily basis,” Per Lekander, a Paris-based analyst at  UBS AG (UBSN) , said in an e-mailed
research note. Power prices may fall further as “the carbon
price is likely to continue its trend toward almost zero.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
