Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe â€™s second-
largest auto-parts supplier, plans to sign its 4.5 billion-euro
($6 billion) loan refinancing next week, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because
the information is private.  The new loans comprise a 3 billion-euro five-year  credit
line  and a 1.5 billion-euro three-year term loan, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt cuts the interest costs of
the Hanover, Germany-based company, with the shorter loan paying
an initial interest rate of 225 basis points more than benchmark
rates and the longer piece paying 200 basis points, the data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The debt to be replaced includes a 2.875 billion-euro  term
loan  paying an initial interest margin of 300 basis points more
than benchmarks and a 2.5 billion-euro revolving credit paying
250 basis points, according to the data. Under a revolver, money
repaid can be borrowed again.  Antje Lewe, a spokeswoman for Continental, said the company
was confident it would conclude negotiations with lenders and
sign the loan this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
