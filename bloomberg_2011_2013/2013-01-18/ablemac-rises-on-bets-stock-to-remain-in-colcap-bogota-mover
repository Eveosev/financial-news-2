Tablemac SA (TABLEMA)  jumped the most among
Colombian stocks after  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) , the country’s largest
bank, said the wood-products maker may qualify to stay in the
benchmark Colcap index.  Tablemac, based in Medellin, gained 4.4 percent to 7.62
pesos at the close in Bogota trading. The Colcap, which
currently includes 21 stocks determined by the Colombian stock
exchange, gained 0.6 percent.  The company won’t be replaced in the next Colcap
rebalancing, Bancolombia said in a report without providing
further details. The next re-weighting of the  index  will be
after the close of trading on Jan. 31, according to a statement
last month from the stock exchange.  Shares of Tablemac had tumbled earlier in the week as the
brokerage Corredores Asociados SA said Jan. 16 that Tablemac and
two other companies might be dropped from the index.  The stocks are weighted based on their “adjusted market
cap value,” according to the exchange.  Cemex Latam Holdings SA (CLH) , a cement company that Bancolombia
sees joining the Colcap, has gained 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
