Empresas Hites SA (HITES)  gained today,
marking its best start of the year since it began trading in
2009, after the cheapest of  Chile ’s five department store
operators was included in the Ipsa index.  Hites advanced 2.1 percent to 480 pesos at 11:53 a.m. in
Santiago, its highest price on a closing basis since Aug. 2011.
In the last week the stock has gained 7.7 percent, its biggest
weekly gain since Nov. 16. In the year-to-date, the stock has
increased 17 percent.  “Its currently the cheapest Chilean retailer” in terms of
its price-earnings ratio, Juan Pablo Castillo, an analyst at
Santiago-based Banco Penta, said in a phone interview. The stock
was also “overly punished” after an accounting scandal at
rival Empresas La Polar SA undermined investor confidence in the
industry, he said.  Hites, which was included in the Ipsa benchmark this year
by the Santiago exchange, currently trades at 13.4 times price-
to-earnings ratio. Peers Ripley Corp SA trades at 27 times, SACI
Falabella is valued at 34 times and Cencosud SA, trades at 25
times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hites fell 53 percent in 2011, the year that La Polar filed
for  bankruptcy protection  after announcing accounting
irregularities. The stock rebounded 27 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
