OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, snapped a seven-day rally after  Fitch Ratings  warned
it’s “very unlikely” to lift the country to investment-grade
because of the government’s economic policies.  The shares fell 1.2 percent to 4,599 forint by 11:46 a.m.
in Budapest after advancing 10 percent in the past seven trading
sessions. The benchmark BUX stock  index  slid 0.5 percent, paring
this week’s advance to 2.2 percent.  Hungarian shares and government bonds erased earlier gains
today after Fitch Ratings director Matteo Napolitano said at a
conference in Warsaw that the “unpredictable” policies of
Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government and the shrinking
economy made a rating upgrade unlikely. Fitch rates Hungary BB+,
the highest junk category, with a stable outlook.  OTP’s  relative-strength index  rose as high as 80 yesterday
and last traded at 74, above the level considered as
“overbought” by some analysts. The RSI gains helped explain
OTP’s retreat today,  Akos Kuti , the Budapest-based head of
research at broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., said in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
