Agriculture prices may be firm
through 2022 as demand increases for food and biofuels while
productivity growth slows, the European Commission said.  Grain supplies may be tight with “prices remaining above
historical levels,” the commission, the EU’s executive arm,
said today in a  report  on its website outlining the agricultural
industry’s prospects by 2022. Production in the 27-country bloc
may become more concentrated in wheat and corn at the expense of
other grains including barley.  “The cereal outlook points to high prices, albeit lower
than present levels, and the EU is expected to be able to
maintain its position as a net exporter,” the commission said.
“Markets are expected to remain tight, and thus price rallies
could occur in the event of production shortfalls.”  Total grain production in the EU may rise to 309 million
metric tons by 2022, compared with output of 279.3 million tons
in 2012, the commission said. Consumption may be 299.1 million
tons by 2022, up from 276.2 million tons a decade earlier.  EU meat  production  may contract by 2 percent during the
next two years as the economic downturn crimps demand while new
animal welfare regulations may limit supplies, the commission
said. Output may rebound by 2022, reaching almost 45 million
tons, similar to the amount produced in 2011, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
