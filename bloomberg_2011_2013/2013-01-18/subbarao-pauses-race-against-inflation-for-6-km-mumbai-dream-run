India ’s central bank Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao will don his sneakers to take part in the 6-
kilometer (3.7-mile) Mumbai Dream Run, seeking to show age and a
high-pressure job are no bar to staying healthy.  Describing himself as the oldest employee at the  Reserve
Bank  of India, 63-year-old Subbarao said he wants to spread
“the message about having an active lifestyle” when he pounds
the streets of India’s financial capital on Jan. 20. The event
follows the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon.  Subbarao, who became governor in 2008, said he’s taken part
in a run every year since he came to the central bank. He’ll
have just over a week to recover before his  Jan. 29 review  of
monetary policy in Asia’s No. 3 economy.  “It’s fun participating with so many other people,”
Subbarao said in an interview in his office in Mumbai yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
