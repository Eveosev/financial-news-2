European gasoline barges rose to the
highest in a week. February swaps traded at a discount to March,
keeping the market in contango for an eighth day.  Eni SpA,  Italy ’s largest oil company, plans to halt its
 Venice refinery  from today until Jan. 26, the local authority
said.  Light Products  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub changed
hands at $973 a metric ton, according to a survey of the Argus
Bulletin Board. That’s up from $965 to $972 yesterday and is the
highest since Jan. 10, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Total SA sold the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added
to finished fuel, to Trafigura Beheer BV, the survey showed.
Barges typically comprise 1,000 to 2,000 tons.  February gasoline swaps traded at $976.80 a ton, reflecting
a $3.42 discount, or contango, to March swaps, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London. The first- and
second-month swaps moved into this market structure on Jan. 9,
which may signal falling near-term demand or rising supply.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , fell 12 cents
to $6.84 a barrel as of 11:14 a.m. local time, PVM data showed.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, narrowed 16 cents to
$7.37 barrel. That’s the smallest spread in a week and compares
with $7.54 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for February delivery rose $1, or 0.1 percent, to
$953.50 a ton as of 12:35 p.m. on the ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange in London. The contract’s backwardation, or premium to
March, was unchanged at $6.75 a ton. This market structure can
signal rising near-term consumption or falling stockpiles.  Gasoil’s  crack  dropped to $16.45 a barrel versus $16.73 at
4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent fell 0.4 percent to $110.64 a barrel.  Refineries  Eni’s 80,000 barrel-a-day  Venice  refinery will flare gases
during the planned outage, according to a statement on Venice’s
city authority website.  Some European refiners have reduced production and more
will probably curb operations if profits don’t recover,
according to the  International Energy Agency . The cuts come
during the region’s winter, when demand for heating fuel usually
rises.  “Weak demand, in part due to a mild winter and the
progressive return from maintenance of European and Russian
refineries, has driven down European refining margins by $3 a
barrel in northwest Europe and $2 a barrel in the
Mediterranean,” the Paris-based energy adviser said in its
monthly oil market report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
