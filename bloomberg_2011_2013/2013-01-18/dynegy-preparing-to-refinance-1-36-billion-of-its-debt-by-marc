Dynegy Inc. (DYN) , the U.S. independent
power producer that exited from  bankruptcy protection  last year,
is preparing to refinance $1.36 billion of debt as early as
March to capitalize on low borrowing costs.  That schedule would be disrupted should the impasse between
President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans over
raising the U.S. debt ceiling trigger higher interest rates,
Chief Executive Officer Robert Flexon said today in a New York
interview.  The company currently has $1.7 billion of term loans that
expire in August 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dynegy is cutting costs to endure an electricity glut
expected to end about 2015, Flexon said. The Houston-based
company can reduce the interest rate on its term loans to about
3.25 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate from the current 7.75 percentage points, Chief Financial
Officer Clint Freeland told investors yesterday in  New York .  The power producer received a $150 million, 364-day
revolving line of credit this week that pays 3.25 percent more
than Libor, according to a Jan. 16 regulatory filing.  “We could really benefit from the refinancing,” Flexon
said. “If the markets suddenly close on us, then we will wait.
The timing of the national debt thing is not ideal for us.”  The company’s $1.1 billion  term loan  that matures August
2016 was quoted at 104.8 cents on the dollar today, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Dynegy, the owner of natural-gas and coal-fired power
plants, put a group of units into bankruptcy in November 2011
after electricity prices tumbled in the wake of the 2008
economic slump. The corporation sought bankruptcy protection in
July 2012, and completed its Chapter 11 reorganization in
October.  The company is the third-largest U.S. independent power
producer behind  Calpine Corp. (CPN)  and  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  Independent
power producers sell their output on wholesale markets or under
contract to utilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
