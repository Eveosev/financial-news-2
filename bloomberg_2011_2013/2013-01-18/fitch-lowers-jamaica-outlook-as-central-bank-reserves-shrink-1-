Jamaica ’s credit outlook was lowered
to negative by  Fitch Ratings , which cited the Caribbean island’s
“high vulnerability” to external shocks and financing
constraints after a plunge in central bank reserves.  “The sustained erosion of the country’s international
liquidity position has sharply reduced the authorities’ maneuver
capacity to manage external and fiscal pressures,” Fitch said
in a statement today. “Growth underperformance poses serious
challenges to sustained fiscal consolidation and debt
sustainability.”  The yield on Jamaica’s dollar bonds maturing in 2019 rose 2
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.40 percent at 1:26
p.m.  Jamaica’s $14.5 billion economy contracted 0.5 percent last
year while international  reserves  fell by $832 million to $1.98
billion over the same period, according to Fitch. Growth will
accelerate from 1 percent this year to 1.5 percent in 2017, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in an  October report , the
slowest pace among 32 nations in  Latin America  and the
Caribbean. Tourist arrivals fell in October and November from a
year earlier.  The Jamaican dollar has also come under pressure as
“domestic confidence slipped due to the delay in reaching a new
agreement” with the IMF, Fitch said. The currency has tumbled
7.1 percent over the past 12 months.  Fitch maintained Jamaica’s credit rating of B-, six levels
below investment grade. That puts the country in the same
category as  Ecuador .  To contact the reporter on this story:
