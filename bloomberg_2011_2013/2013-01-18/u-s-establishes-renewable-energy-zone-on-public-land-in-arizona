The U.S. identified about 192,000
acres of government-owned land in  Arizona  that are suitable for
commercial-scale solar and wind farms.  The agency also established the Agua Caliente Solar Energy
Zone, 2,550 acres in the state with strong sunlight and few
resource conflicts that are well-suited for solar projects,
according to a U.S. Interior Department statement today.  Agua Caliente is the third solar zone in Arizona and the
18th in the nation. Establishing such areas will facilitate
development by identifying sites where projects are unlikely to
face environmental hurdles and other potential problems.  Creating zones for renewable energy “lays a solid
foundation for making sure it happens in the right way and the
right places,” Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  said in the
statement. The agency is working with environmentalists, local
communities, American Indian tribes and other groups “to reduce
potential resource conflicts and expedite appropriate
projects.”  The U.S. is promoting wider use of renewable energy to
reduce consumption of foreign oil and create clean-energy jobs,
Salazar said. The agency has approved 34 utility-scale wind,
solar and geothermal projects on public land since 2009 with
more than 10,400 megawatts of capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
