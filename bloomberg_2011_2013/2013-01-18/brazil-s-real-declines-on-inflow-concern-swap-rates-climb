The real headed for the biggest
weekly drop since mid-December as signs of muted growth in
 Europe  and concern about intervention on the  currency market 
fanned speculation investment in Brazil will slump.  The real declined 0.3 percent to 2.0443 per dollar at 10:09
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , headed for a 0.5 percent weekly loss, the
biggest since the week ended Dec. 14. Swap rates on the contract
due in January 2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 8.67 percent, capping a 16 basis-point increase this
week.  The real fell with most emerging-market currencies as an
unexpected drop in U.K. retail sales signaled slowing growth and
sapped demand for higher-yielding assets. Government
intervention in the currency market and reduced forecasts for
global expansion have spurred concern among investors that there
will be less money flowing to Brazil’s economy this year, said
 Reginaldo Galhardo , a currency trader at Treviso Corretora in
Sao Paulo.  “As long as investors don’t see bigger inflows, they won’t
be comfortable buying reais,” Galhardo said in a telephone
interview. “The data in Europe is weighing on the market.”  Policy makers forecast the world’s biggest emerging market
after China expanded 1 percent in 2012, or about half the pace
of the U.S and Japan, according to Bloomberg surveys.  To contact the reporters on this story:
