Siemens AG (SIE) ’s medium-term sales goal
of 100 billion euros ($133 billion) is of secondary importance
to boosting profitability at  Europe ’s largest engineering
company, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  said.  Loescher doesn’t regret his 2011 decision to set the
target, he told Deutsche Presse Agentur in an interview, adding
that it’s more important to have profitable and capital
efficient growth. He also said press reports about a revolt
against him by other board members were “humbug.” Siemens
spokesman Guenter Gaugler confirmed the comments by phone.  Loescher has come under growing pressure to prove his
strategic skills, after most deals that he supervised soured,
and a push into more environmentally-friendly energy generation
led to spiraling costs. Profitability at Siemens last year
dropped back to the levels when Loescher started in 2007, and
the CEO issued a new program to cut costs in November after
acknowledging he’d been too slow to react to falling demand.  The 100 billion-euro sales target would put Munich-based
Siemens on par with General Electric Co., Loescher’s former
employer. He announced in October plans to sell solar thermal
energy and photovoltaic units, three years after creating the
business through  acquisitions .  Siemens predicts revenue this year “approaching the
level” of 2012’s 78.3 billion euros, Chief Financial Officer
Joe Kaeser reiterated Jan. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
