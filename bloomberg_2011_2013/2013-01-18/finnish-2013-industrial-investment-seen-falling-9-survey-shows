Fixed investment by industrial
companies in  Finland  will slide 9 percent in 2013 after the
nation fell into a  recession  last year, a survey from the
Confederation of Finnish Industries showed.  Investments will slide to 3.2 billion euros ($4.3 billion)
from about 3.5 billion euros last year, according to the  report 
from the Helsinki-based group. The decline will be led by waning
investments from large companies in the electronics, forest and
metal refining areas, the confederation said.  The northernmost euro member slid into a recession in the
second quarter as exporters suffer amid a slump in demand from
debt-riddled Europe. Papermaker  UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V)  and mobile-phone
manufacturer  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  announced job cuts at home yesterday.  The confederation canvassed 239 companies, encompassing
about 80 percent of industrial investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
