Azerbaijan  exported less crude oil
in the first 11 months of last year as the Caspian Sea nation
cut production.  The third-largest producer in the former Soviet Union
shipped 33.65 million metric tons in January through November,
down 7.5 percent from a year earlier, the State Statistics
Committee said today by e-mail. The export of natural gas
declined 5 percent to 5.8 billion cubic meters, it said.  Azerbaijan produced 43 million tons of oil in 2012, down
5.3 percent from the year before, the State Statistics Committee
said yesterday on its  website . Production of marketable natural
gas rose 5.4 percent to 17.2 billion cubic meters, it said.  The largest oil producers in the former  Soviet Union  are
Russia and Kazakhstan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
