Morgan Stanley (MS)  sold $110 million of
15-year auto-callable notes tied to the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, the bank’s biggest offering since August 2011.  The securities, issued Jan. 15, yield 7 percent annually
for the first five years before increasing twice more to pay 12
percent for the last five years so long as the benchmark doesn’t
fall below 70 percent of its initial value, according to a
 prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The bank automatically redeems the notes quarterly after
five years, if the index has risen above its starting level.
Investors receive their principal at maturity so long as the
benchmark doesn’t drop by more than 50 percent. The New York-
based bank distributed the securities for a 3.5 percent fee.  U.S. investors bought $10.2 billion of notes linked to the
 S&P 500  last year, the most in at least three years, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The index  rose  13.2 percent
during the 12 months ending Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
