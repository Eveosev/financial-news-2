SK Holdings Co. (003600) , which owns
electricity producer  SK E&S , tumbled in Seoul trading on
speculation a government ceiling on its power selling price to
state-utility  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  will erode earnings.  SK Holdings fell 6.1 percent to close at 170,000 won today
on the Korea Exchange, its steepest drop since Nov. 10, 2011.
 Korea Electric (015760)  rose 1.5 percent to 34,250 won. The key Kospi
index gained 0.7 percent.  Korea Electric, which purchases electricity from state and
private power generators, has faced increasing operating losses
since 2008. The utility will make a proposal on Jan. 28 to a
state committee to impose a cap on the price it pays private
power producers, the Korea Economic Daily reported today, citing
unidentified company and government officials.  “Optimism related to the power generator’s growth momentum
was the main driver for SK Holdings’ share gains last year,”
Kang Eun Pyo, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. in  Seoul ,
said by phone today. “The report today is dragging down the
parent’s shares.”  SK Holdings dropped 5 percent  this year  after advancing 48
percent in 2012. The Kospi rose 9.4 percent last year.  SK E&S  posted 165 billion won ($156 million) of operating
profit in the third quarter, or 17 percent of sales, according
to its regulatory filing to the exchange. It had an operating
margin of 7 percent in the same period the previous year,
according to the filing.  Power purchasing costs accounted for 84 percent of the
state utility’s overall expenses last year, according to its e-
mailed statement last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
