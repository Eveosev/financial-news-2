Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. (SC) , the
country’s largest pharmaceutical chain, declined the most in
almost three years as some Canadian provinces said they will buy
generic drugs in bulk.  The shares fell 5.2 percent to C$41.83 at the close in
Toronto today, the largest one-day drop since April 8, 2010. The
stock has fallen 2.3 percent this year.  Every province except  Quebec  and three territories plan to
buy six generic drugs, which represent about 20 percent of
publicly funded spending on such medicines in  Canada , in bulk to
lower prices, according to a government press  release . One of
the six drugs is Atorvastatin, a popular drug used to treat
high cholesterol, marketed by  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  under the brand name
Lipitor. The new prices are set to take effect by April 1.  The provinces will pay 18 percent of the equivalent brand
name drug price instead of the current 25 to 40 percent.  The lower price will put pressure on Shoppers same-store
sales and eventually its profit, said Brian Yarbrough, a retail
analyst at Edward Jones. He rates the stock a hold.  “It seems that every few years, they come out with more
and more drug reforms,” he said in a phone interview from St.
Louis. “This is the first time that all provinces have gotten
together for drug reform. The headwinds and more negative news
is driving down the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
