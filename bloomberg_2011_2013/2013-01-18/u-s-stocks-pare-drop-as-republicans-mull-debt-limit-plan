U.S. stocks pared losses as  House
Republicans  were said to consider a “very short-term” debt-
limit increase to keep the government funded through April 15.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.15 percent at
1,478.65 as of 11:23 a.m. in New York after slipping 0.3 percent
earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  was little changed at
13,596.75 after losing 21 points.  A member of the U.S. House Republican leadership said
consensus is growing among party members to craft “a very short-
term” debt-limit increase to try to force the Senate to adopt a
budget.  A debt-limit increase probably would last “until the
time” the Senate is supposed to pass a budget, Representative
 Kevin McCarthy  said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s
“Capitol Gains” program airing Jan. 20. The deadline for the
Senate to pass its budget is April 15, McCarthy said.   The Treasury Department has said the U.S. will exceed its
$16.4 trillion borrowing authority sometime from mid-February to  early March.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
