Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico
SAB (SANMEXB) , the Mexican unit of  Spain ’s biggest bank, had its biggest
two-day slide in three months after JPMorgan Chase & Co. said
earnings growth is slowing and cut its rating on the stock.  The shares have tumbled 9.4 percent in the past two days to
40.19 pesos at 1:11 p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest in a month.
The stock is down 11 percent from a record 45.15 on Jan 14.
Santander Mexico fell 3.8 percent today.  JPMorgan analyst  Saul Martinez  wrote in a Jan. 16 report
that he expects the Mexico City-based company’s earnings growth
to slow “to the single-digit range as cost pressure mounts and,
eventually, tax rates rise.” He cut his rating on the stock to
the equivalent of sell from neutral.  Some investors took the JPMorgan report as a signal to
lock-in gains, according to Martin Lara, a Mexico City-based
analyst with Corp. Actinver SAB, who has a hold recommendation
on the stock.  “That was an excuse for everybody to take profits,” Lara
said in a telephone interview. “If it continues to fall it’s a
good long-term investment opportunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
