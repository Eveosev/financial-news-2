Record Plc (REC)  jumped to an 18-month
high after the U.K.-based currency manager said its assets under
management increased by 4.6 percent last quarter.  The funds climbed to an equivalent $34 billion at the end
of 2012, from $32.5 billion on Sept. 30, boosted by increases in
existing mandates, Windsor, England-based Record said in a
statement today. The firm’s so-called passive hedging business,
which helps investors protect against  currency risk  on their
overseas portfolios, saw the biggest increase, it said. The
number of clients rose to 45 at Dec. 31 from 43.  “We are participating in a number of formal procurement
processes, particularly for passive hedging in  Switzerland ,”
Chief Executive Officer James Wood-Collins said in the
statement. “Whilst none of these were finalized in the quarter,
we are hopeful that we will be able to be successful in securing
additional mandates before the end of the financial year.”  Record, founded in 1983, provides currency-hedging services
for institutional clients. The company’s shares jumped 16
percent to 35.25 pence at 3:06 p.m. London time, the highest
level since June 21, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
