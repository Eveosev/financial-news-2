U.S. stock-index futures were little
changed as Morgan Stanley and General Electric Co. posted
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates, and as investors awaited
a report on  consumer confidence .  Morgan Stanley rose 2.8 percent to $21.34 in early New York
trading as earnings beat expectations. GE gained 3.1 percent as
earnings topped estimates.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  added 6.8
percent after Jefferies & Co. recommended investors buy the
shares.  Intel (INTC)  Corp. lost 5.2 percent after saying sales dropped
for a second straight quarter. AT&T Inc. fell 1.4 percent after
announcing a pension charge and saying smartphone subsidies put
pressure on earnings.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  futures expiring in March fell
less than 0.1 percent to 1,475.5 at 7:34 a.m. in New York. The
equity benchmark surged to a five-year high yesterday amid
better-than-forecast initial jobless claims and housing data.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 1 point, less than 0.1
percent, to 13,541 today.  “Earnings are probably going to be more company-specific,
and that moves single stocks more than it moves the market;
you’ll have investors digest this information and you could see
a little pause,” said Andreas Nigg, head of equity and
commodity strategy at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich, which
oversees about $32 billion. “The underlying economy is starting
to gain traction, most of the indicators I look at suggest the
worst is behind us and there are a lot of good things
happening.”  Consumer Confidence  A report due at 9:55 New York time may show U.S.  consumer
confidence  recovered from a five-month low in January. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of U.S. consumer
sentiment for January rose to 75 from 72.9 at the end of last
month, according to the median projection of 74 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  In  China , economic growth accelerated for the first time in
two years. A rebound in industrial output, retail sales and the
housing market drove gross domestic product 7.9 percent higher
in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau
of Statistics said in Beijing today. That compared with the 7.8
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey and 7.4
percent in the previous period.  Industrial output in December rose a more-than-expected
10.3 percent and fixed-asset investment for the year gained 20.6
percent.  Earnings Reports  Eleven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report fourth-
quarter earnings today. Some 71 percent of the 62 companies in
the gauge to have released results so far have  beaten analysts’
forecasts , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fourth-quarter profits at S&P 500 companies grew 2.5
percent, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
That would be the second-slowest quarterly growth since 2009.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the top equity global underwriter last
year, rose 2.8 percent to $21.34 in early New York trading after
reporting fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates. Profit
was $507 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$250 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding accounting charges
tied to the firm’s own debt, profit was 45 cents a share,
beating the 27-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  GE Advances  GE added 3.1 percent to $21.95 after reporting higher
profit than analysts estimated as earnings at all of its
industrial business climbed for the second straight quarter.
Adjusted income from continuing operations grew 13 percent to
$4.67 billion, or 44 cents a share, in the fourth quarter,  GE (GE) 
said today in a statement. That topped an average estimate of 43
cents a share in a Bloomberg survey.  RIM rose 6.8 percent to $15.93 in early New York trading
after Jefferies raised its recommendation on the stock to buy
from hold, saying the Blackberry smartphone manufacturer’s
quarterly earnings are likely to beat estimates in May and
August.  Intel plunged 5.2 percent to $21.50 in New York after the
world’s largest semiconductor maker reported a second straight
quarter of declining sales.  Fourth-quarter revenue dropped 3 percent to $13.5 billion,
the Santa Clara, California-based company said in a statement
late yesterday. Net income fell to $2.47 billion, or 48 cents a
share. Analysts estimated sales of $13.5 billion and earnings of
45 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  AT&T Falls  AT&T (T)  retreated 1.4 percent to $32.75 in early New York
trading. The largest U.S. phone company recorded a $10 billion
fourth-quarter charge for its pension plan and said smartphone
subsidies put pressure on profit.  Hurricane Sandy  and other
storms also hurt earnings, lowering fourth-quarter operating
income by $175 million, the Dallas-based company said in a
filing yesterday. AT&T reports fourth-quarter earnings on Jan.
24.  Capital One (COF)  dropped 6.6 percent to $57.50 in New York as
fourth-quarter profit missed analyst estimates because of higher
loan losses. Net income advanced to $843 million, or $1.41 a
share, from $407 million, or 88 cents, a year earlier, the
lender said late yesterday. That fell short of the $1.59 average
estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
