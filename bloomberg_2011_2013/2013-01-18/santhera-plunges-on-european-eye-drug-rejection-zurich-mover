Santhera Pharmaceuticals Holding AG (SANN) ,
the Swiss developer of an experimental treatment for a rare
inherited eye disease, fell to a record low after European
regulators recommended against approving the drug.  Santhera  plunged  as much as 31 percent to 3.30 Swiss
francs, the lowest since the company went public in November
2006. The shares traded 23 percent lower at 3.71 francs as of
11:34 a.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 13.6
million francs ($14.5 million).  A “narrow majority” of the European Medicines Agency’s
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use decided
Santhera’s Raxone was “not approvable at this time,” Liestal,
Switzerland-based Santhera said in a statement today. The
company has requested a re-examination of the decision, it said.  Members of the committee expressed concern about the
reliability of results from a trial of the drug because of the
small number of patients studied, Santhera said.  The company had sought approval for Raxone as a treatment
for Leber’s Hereditoar Optic Neuropathy, a genetically inherited
disease that causes blindness, mostly in men.  To contact the reporter on this story:
