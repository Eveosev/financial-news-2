The successor to the Financial
Services Authority needs to take a “radically different” path
to make sure consumers receive stronger protection and major
financial failings are discovered earlier, a U.K. Parliamentary
committee said.  The FSA “failed consumers badly” and the new agency must
take a different approach “to the widely discredited box-
ticking practices undertaken by the FSA,” Andrew Tyrie, the
chairman of the committee, said in an e-mailed statement.  The Financial Conduct Authority will take over as soon as
April from the FSA, which is being abolished as part of a
supervisory overhaul in the wake of the financial crisis that
saw the nationalization of Northern Rock Plc and bailouts of
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc.
The FCA will take on oversight of consumer protection, while the
Prudential Regulation Authority, which will become a unit of the
Bank of  England , will keep watch on systemic financial issues.  John Griffith-Jones, the former U.K. head of accounting
firm KPMG LLP, will be the incoming chairman of the FCA. While a
report from lawmakers said he “lacks deep experience of some of
the consumer-oriented conduct issues,” they still said his
appointment “forms part of a welcome and much-needed
fundamental shake-up of regulation.”  Both Griffith-Jones and the Treasury must take more
aggressive oversight of the regulator to ensure that the board
challenges the executive leadership of the FCA, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
