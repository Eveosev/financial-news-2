Investors added to stock funds for a
second week, the first back-to-back increase since April 2011,
amid rising investor confidence about emerging economies and a
global rally in equities.  About $7.2 billion flowed into stock funds around the world
in the week ending Jan. 16, according to data compiled by
research firm  EPFR Global , which began analyzing the data
starting in 1996. Deposits into equity funds exceeded bond funds
for a fifth week as the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  climbed to the highest
level in 20 months.  Signs of strengthening global growth and better-than-
estimated corporate earnings are helping lure investors back to
equities after they withdrew funds since the financial crisis.
Emerging-market equity funds took in more money than their
developed-market counterparts for the sixth time in the last
seven weeks, based on data from EPFR.  Chinaâ€™s economic growth accelerated for the first time in
two years during the fourth quarter, a report from the National
Bureau of Statistics said today. Investors added more than $10
billion to Chinese equity funds during the week, bringing its
streak of deposits to 19 weeks, EPFR data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
