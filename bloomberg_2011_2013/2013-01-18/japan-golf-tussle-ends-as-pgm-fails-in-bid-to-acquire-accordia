PGM Holdings K.K. (2466) , the Japanese golf
course operator led by Arihiro Kanda, said its 42 billion yen
($468 million) bid to take over  Accordia Golf Co. (2131)  failed as it
couldn’t obtain the minimum shares required.  PGM received offers from stakeholders for 174,580 shares,
falling short of the target of 209,224 shares, or 20 percent,
the Tokyo-based company said in a statement today. Shares of
Accordia have gained more than 50 percent since PGM announced
the hostile bid on Nov. 15.  Accordia sought support from investors to fend off the
offer and hired  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)  as an adviser. While
the bid’s failure will deny PGM the bigger scale it was seeking,
the result may benefit  Japan ’s declining golf industry by
ensuring competition between the biggest operators, said real
estate consultant Daisuke Seki.  “It could be a good thing for Japanese golfers, employees
and other stakeholders as the two companies are competing to
offer better services,” said Seki, chief executive officer of
Tokyo-based IB Research and Consulting Inc. “Golf courses can
just be land or they can be income sources. It’s up to the
operators.”  Shares of Accordia rose 2.3 percent to 83,000 yen at 2:31
p.m. in Tokyo, higher than the 81,000 yen that PGM offered to
pay for 50.1 percent of the stock. PGM fell 0.9 percent to
67,900 yen.  SESC Request  PGM said today that an article published by an unidentified
news organization yesterday, the deadline for the takeover bid,
impeded the offer by increasing the share price of Accordia. It
asked the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission to
examine whether any actions leading to the publication of the
story might have breached Japanese law, PGM said in a statement.  Bloomberg News reported yesterday that Accordia seeks to
sell about 10 golf courses to raise 15 billion yen to fund share
buybacks, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Accordia reiterated today that it opposed the takeover
plan, saying in a statement that the price was too low and the
method was hostile. It pledged to continue to maximize
shareholder value.  Higher Dividend  Accordia more than tripled its planned full-year  dividend 
last month to 5,500 yen. The company approached companies
including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Orix Corp. (8591)  as potential
investors to attract a higher bid, people with knowledge of the
matter said in December.  Goldman Sachs is the former owner of Accordia. The Wall
Street firm formed the company in July 2003 to revive failed
courses it bought after the collapse of Japan’s asset bubble.
The U.S. bank raised 124 billion yen selling a stake in
Accordia’s 2006 initial public offering.  PGM, formerly owned by Lone Star Funds, the U.S. buyout
firm, did an IPO in 2005. President Kanda used to work at
Goldman Sachs and Accordia and joined PGM in 2011. PGM hired
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s Japanese brokerage unit to advise it on the bid.  Golf club memberships have been declining in Japan as the
 population  ages and companies cut entertainment expenses. The
number of Japan’s golfers 15 years old and over fell to 9
million in 2011 from 17.8 million in 1991, PGM said in November.  PGM owns 122 golf courses and Accordia has 133, the
companies said in separate statements this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
