U.S. stocks  rose for a third week,
driving benchmark indexes to five-year highs, as earnings from
companies including General Electric Co. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. beat estimates and debt-limit talks progressed.  Energy, industrial and consumer companies climbed the most
among  10 groups  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as  GE (GE)  rallied
4.3 percent. A gauge of homebuilders rose to the highest level
since 2007 amid better-than-expected housing data. Morgan
Stanley jumped 11 percent after reaching profit-margin targets
six months ahead of schedule. Dell Inc. surged 18 percent amid
reports it’s in buyout talks. Bank of America Corp. and  Intel
Corp . sank at least 3.4 percent on disappointing results.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose 1 percent to 1,485.98, extending its 2013
advance to 4.2 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added
161.27 points, or 1.2 percent, to 13,649.70. Both measures
closed at their highest levels since December 2007.  “What’s driving the market is an improved economic
backdrop and some growing hope that the Congress will come to
some sort of reasonable solution to the overhang we’ve had,”
Hank Herrmann,  Overland Park , Kansas-based chairman and chief
executive officer of Waddell & Reed Financial Inc., said in a
phone interview. His firm manages $100 billion. “The early
indications on earnings are that they’ve been reasonably
constructive.”  Quarterly Results  Equities rose as about 72 percent of the 67  S&P 500 
companies that have reported quarterly results  beat  estimates.
Economic reports showed retail sales advanced more than forecast
in December and housing starts climbed 12 percent, capping the
best year for the industry since 2008. Confidence among American
households unexpectedly fell to a one-year low this month, as
higher payroll taxes create a risk that the biggest part of the
economy will slow in early 2013.  The benchmark index rallied on the final day of the week
after Speaker  John Boehner  said  House Republicans  plan to vote
on a three-month extension of U.S.  borrowing  authority in an
effort to force the Democratic-led Senate to adopt a budget
plan. Lawmakers in  Washington  remain divided about raising the
debt ceiling and cutting  government spending .  The Treasury Department has said the U.S. will exceed its
$16.4 trillion borrowing authority sometime from mid-February to
early March. Since 1960, Congress has raised or revised the
limit 79 times, including 49 times under Republican presidents,
according to the department.  Upcoming Earnings  Apple Inc., Google Inc. and more than 80 other companies in
the index are scheduled to announce earnings in the coming week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Analysts are turning more
optimistic, with fourth-quarter earnings projected to grow 3.8
percent, up from 2.5 percent at the end of last week, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The federal spending cuts, sequestration, that overhang
still exists,”  Timothy Ghriskey , who helps oversee $2 billion
as chief investment officer at Solaris Group LLC in  Bedford
Hills ,  New York , said in a Jan. 17 interview. “But I think what
the quarter is showing us so far is that managers actually
overall have not put the brakes on, that they continue to move
companies ahead, and will adjust to whatever federal environment
the government saddles us with.”  The S&P 500 has more than doubled from a 12-year low in
2009 as corporate earnings continued the three-year expansion
and the Federal Reserved expanded its bond purchases to keep
 interest rates  low to spur growth. The index is 5.1 percent
below its all-time high of 1,565.15 set in October 2007.  Vix Slumps  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, fell 6.7 percent during the week to 12.46, the
lowest level since April 2007.  Eight out of 10 S&P 500 groups advanced as energy,
industrial and consumer companies rose more than 1.5 percent.
The Dow Jones  Transportation Average (TRAN)  surged 2.2 percent to a
record while the Russell 2000 Index added 1.4 percent to an all-
time high.  GE increased 4.3 percent to $22.04. The company’s
industrial businesses surpassed gains in finance as emerging-
market expansion fueled the aviation and health-care divisions,
which helped build a record $210 billion order backlog.  Goldman Sachs rallied 5.3 percent to $144.45 after
quarterly profit beat estimates and full-year revenue grew for
the first time since 2009.  Morgan Stanley jumped 11 percent to $22.38. The owner of
the world’s biggest brokerage said earnings from that business
more than doubled in the fourth quarter. The brokerage’s higher
profitability strengthens Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman ’s
plan to boost returns as he requests regulatory approval to buy
Citigroup Inc.’s remaining 35 percent stake in the business.  Homebuilders Rally  An S&P index of  homebuilders  climbed 3.1 percent to the
highest level since August 2007. PulteGroup Inc., the largest
U.S. homebuilder by revenue, rose 6 percent to $20.49.  Lennar
Corp. (LEN)  added 2.8 percent to $42.08 after reporting fiscal fourth-
quarter earnings that  beat  analysts’ estimates as revenue jumped
42 percent and profit margins climbed.  Dell rallied 18 percent to $12.84. Silver Lake Management
LLC and partners are close to lining up about $15 billion in
funds for a buyout of the third-biggest maker of personal
computers, said people familiar with the matter.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  jumped 5.9 percent to $17.11 for the
biggest increase in the Dow. The personal-computer maker has
been approached by investment bankers about selling assets,
though it’s not currently considering such a move, according to
a person with knowledge of the matter.  Shrinking Revenue  Bank of America dropped 4.2 percent, the most in the Dow,
to $11.14. The second-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets said profit
tumbled 63 percent, hurt by shrinking revenue and more costs
from cleaning up bad mortgages.  Intel slumped 3.4 percent to $21.25. The world’s largest
chipmaker reported a second straight quarter of declining sales.
Intel also said sales may fall for a third quarter, highlighting
the company’s struggle to adapt in a world swiftly embracing
mobile devices and leaving behind the personal-computer industry
it dominates.  Apple declined 3.9 percent to $500 after the Nikkei
newswire reported that production of the iPhone was cut on weak
demand. Apple ordered about half the 65 million iPhone 5
displays it originally targeted for this quarter, Nikkei said,
citing an unnamed executive at a component maker.  Boeing Co. erased 0.2 percent to $75.04, after fluctuating
between gains and losses during the week as defective batteries
led regulators to ground the company’s global fleet of 787
Dreamliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
