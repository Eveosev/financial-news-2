The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped three basis points to 106 basis
points as of 8:31 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge has fallen seven basis points
this year, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell three basis points to
138.5 as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is on track for its lowest close since Jan. 11,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index retreated two basis
points to 115 as of 11:50 a.m. in Sydney, according to Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The measure has dropped 12.5
this year, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
