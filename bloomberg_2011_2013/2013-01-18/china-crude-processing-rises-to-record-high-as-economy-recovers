China ’s crude processing rose to a
record in December as the country added refining capacity and
industrial production increased amid the first acceleration in
the economy in two years.  China processed 43.12 million metric tons of crude last
month, up 8.4 percent from a year ago, according to  data  from
the National Bureau of Statistics today. That’s equivalent to
10.2 million barrels a day, beating the previous record of 10.17
million in November.  Refiners have stepped up operations amid a rebound in
economic growth. Gross domestic product expanded 7.9 percent in
the fourth quarter compared with 7.4 percent in the previous
period, snapping a seven-quarter slowdown, government figures
showed today. Industrial output rose 10.3 percent in December
for a fourth monthly gain, according to the data.  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  or Sinopec,  Asia ’s largest refiner,
almost doubled the capacity of its Maoming refinery last month
to more than 20 million tons a year.  “The economic recovery boosted refineries’ incentive to
process crude oil and the cold weather in the winter also
supports higher demand for heating fuel,” Shi Yan, a Shanghai-
based analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. said by phone. “I expect
refining to remain high this month.”  Sinopec and China National Petroleum Corp., the nation’s
two largest refiners, plan to process 0.6 percent more crude in
January than last month, C1 Energy, a Shanghai-based commodity
researcher, said Jan. 16.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
