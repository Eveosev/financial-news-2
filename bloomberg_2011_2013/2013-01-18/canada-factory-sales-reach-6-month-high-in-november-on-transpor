Canadian  factory sales  rose to a
six-month high in November and unfilled orders rose to the most
in more than three years as demand for automobiles and aircraft
increased.  Sales climbed 1.7 percent to C$49.9 billion ($50.4
billion), reversing a revised 1.2 percent decline in October,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The gain exceeded all 17
forecasts in a Bloomberg economist  survey  that had a median
projection for a 1 percent increase.  Canada’s gross domestic product probably rebounded to a 1.5
percent annualized pace at the end of last year after disrupted
energy production and weak investment slowed third-quarter
growth to 0.6 percent, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Automakers such as  General Motors Co. (GM)  have been
boosting Canadian production, most of which is sent to the U.S.  “A very strong report,” showing that “Canada is getting
a benefit from rising U.S. auto activity,” said Emanuella Enenajor, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
Toronto.  The report didn’t stem losses in the Canadian dollar as
part of a wider decline among currencies in countries that rely
on commodity exports, such as  Australia  and South Africa.
Canada’s dollar weakened 0.9 percent to 99.42 cents per U.S.
dollar at 10:06 a.m. in Toronto.  Motor vehicle sales rose 4.1 percent to C$4.61 billion in
November and aerospace and parts gained 6.5 percent to C$1.34
billion. Unfilled orders gained 3.6 percent to C$64.1 billion,
the highest since March 2009, Statistics Canada said.  Higher Volumes  Sales rose in 12 of 21  categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada, accounting for two-thirds of production. Primary metal
sales rose 5.9 percent to C$3.97 billion and chemical sales
increased 3.9 percent to C$4.05 billion.  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales rose
1.6 percent in November.  From a year earlier, sales rose 0.5 percent. New orders
grew at the fastest pace since March 2011 in November, rising
6.2 percent to C$52.1 billion, a gain also led by transportation
companies.  Aircraft Sales  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  of Montreal said Dec. 6 Delta Air Lines
Inc. agreed to buy 40 CRJ900 regional jets as the world’s
second-largest carrier broadens its replacement of older planes.
The firm order had a catalog value of about $1.85 billion, and
options for 30 more would boost it to $3.29 billion.  Magna International Inc. (MG) , North America’s largest auto-
parts maker, forecast sales growth of as much as 7.9 percent for
2013 on Jan. 16 as the manufacturer seeks customers in new
markets.  Canadian factory  inventories  fell 0.8 percent to C$65.5
billion in November, with the ratio of factory stockpiles to
sales falling to 1.31 from 1.35.  Even with today’s factory gain, sales have stagnated since
reaching about C$50 billion in December 2011.  Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem said in
a speech last week that while near-term economic momentum has
slowed, it should accelerate later this year. The central bank’s
 key rate  has been 1 percent since September 2010 and economists
forecast it will remain there at a decision on Jan. 23.  “A more robust international backdrop will be required to
lift manufacturing activity outside of the transport equipment
sector,” Mazen Issa,  Canada  macro strategist at TD Securities
in Toronto, wrote in a client note. “We anticipate such a
pickup will occur in the second half of 2013.”  The  number  of Canadians receiving jobless benefits fell by
4,470 in November from October, or by 0.8 percent, Statistics
Canada said in a separate report today. From the year-ago month,
the total number of beneficiaries fell 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
