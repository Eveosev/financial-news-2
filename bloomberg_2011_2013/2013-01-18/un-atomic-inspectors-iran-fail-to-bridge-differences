United Nations atomic inspectors
returned from Tehran without a deal after two days of
negotiations with Iranian officials over broader access to
suspected nuclear sites.  Iran  refused to let the International Atomic Energy Agency
team visit the Parchin military complex, where intelligence
given to the IAEA suggests nuclear work took place, said chief
inspector Herman Nackaerts. The sides will meet again on Feb.
12, he said, without providing more details.  “We had two days of intensive discussions,” Nackaerts
told journalists today at Vienna International Airport.
“Differences remain, so we could not could not finalize the
structured approach to resolve the outstanding issues regarding
possible military dimensions of  Iran’s nuclear program .”  Failure to clinch a deal doesn’t come as a surprise. IAEA
Director General Yukiya Amano warned on Jan. 11 that
negotiations with Iran would be difficult. The agency is in its
10th year of an investigation into whether the Islamic Republic
ever sought nuclear-weapons capabilities. Iran, under dozens of
international sanctions, maintains it never tried developing
atomic weapons.  The Tehran discussions were the eighth round of meetings in
the last year aimed at giving inspectors more access to people,
places and documents in the Persian Gulf nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
