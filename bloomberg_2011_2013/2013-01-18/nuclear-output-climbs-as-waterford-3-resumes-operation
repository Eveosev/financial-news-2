U.S. nuclear-power generation
climbed as  Entergy Corp. (ETR) ’s Waterford 3 plant resumed operation.  Production nationwide increased 0.1 percent to 92,503
megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, according to U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Output was
down  0.1 percent  from a year ago, with seven of 104 plants
offline.  Waterford 3, a 1,250-megawatt plant about 25 miles (40
kilometers) west of  New Orleans , went online for the first time
since Oct. 17.  The reactor  operated at 18 percent capacity, or
225 megawatts, early today. Entergy shut the unit for refueling
and maintenance, replacing two steam generators, a reactor
vessel head and a coolant pump, Carl Rhode, a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail today.  “Operators are currently in the process of returning the
unit to full power,” Rhode said.  Entergy boosted power at Pilgrim 1, located 38 miles
southeast of  Boston , to 90 percent from 50 percent yesterday.
The 685-megawatt plant’s was reconnected to the grid two days
ago after its recirculation pumps tripped offline last week.  Production in  the Northeast  rose 1.7 percent as a result,
the region’s third consecutive daily increase.  Western output fell as the 1,335-megawatt Palo Verde 3
reactor, operated by  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW)  50 miles west
of Phoenix, dropped to 57 percent capacity from full power
yesterday. Betty Dayyo, a company spokeswoman in Phoenix, didn’t
immediately return a phone message left before normal working
hours.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 43 days in
2011, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
