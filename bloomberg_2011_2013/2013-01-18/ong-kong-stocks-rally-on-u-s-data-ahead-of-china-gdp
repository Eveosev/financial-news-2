Hong Kong stocks gained, with the
city’s benchmark index headed for its first advance in four
days, before a report expected to show  China ’s economic growth
accelerated and as fewer Americans applied for jobless benefits.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a maker of power tools that
counts North America as its biggest market, gained 3.6 percent.
Beijing-based Soho China Ltd. led developers in China higher,
increasing 2.6 percent, after home prices in the country rose in
December from the previous year. Sands China Ltd., added 2.2
percent after its parent company, Las Vegas Sands Corp., said it
was seeking a buyer for its casino in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania .  “If we can break above the 23,600 level, momentum will
probably accelerate,” said Alex Wong, an asset-management
director at Ample Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “It’s too
early to call. It all depends on the China GDP reaction.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added percent 0.9 percent to 23,539.80
as of 9:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index of mainland companies rose 1.6 percent to 12,045.04.  To contact the reporter on this story:
