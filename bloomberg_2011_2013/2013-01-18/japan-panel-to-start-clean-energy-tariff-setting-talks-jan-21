A committee appointed by the
Japanese government will start talks on setting above-market
rates for clean energy project applications for the year
starting April 1.  The five-member committee will meet on Jan. 21 and make
proposals for the so-called feed-in tariffs, according to an e-
mailed statement from the  industry ministry .  Japan  began an incentive program in July to promote
renewable energy generation from resources such as solar, wind
and biomass following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. The
current tariffs expire at the end of March.  The tariff for solar is currently 42 yen (47 cents) per
kilowatt hour for 20 years, while wind gets 23.1 yen per
kilowatt hour for the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
