SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , Georgia’s
biggest lender, reported fourth-quarter profit that more than
quadrupled as revenue climbed.  Net income rose to $356 million, or 65 cents a diluted
share, from $74 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier, the
Atlanta-based lender said today in a statement. The  average
adjusted estimate  of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
per-share profit of 62 cents.  SunTrust has cut the amount it sets aside for soured loans
for 11 of the past 12 quarters, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer William Rogers said in
December the lender is reducing headcount and may increase the
pace of branch closings to trim expenses.  “Over the past several quarters, SunTrust has
significantly improved its asset quality, loan mix, and
profitability,”  Standard & Poor’s  said last month when it
revised its outlook on the company to positive. “The bank’s
asset quality metrics are now approaching those of its regional
banking peers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
