Mark Hotton, who is charged with
inventing bogus investors to bilk producers of the Broadway show
“Rebecca: The Musical,” is in plea negotiations, according to
a federal prosecutor.  “The defendant and government are engaged in active
discussions regarding a disposition,” Assistant U.S. Attorney
Edward Diskant told U.S. District Judge  John Koeltl  at a hearing
today in Manhattan federal court. The judge granted a delay
until March 29 to let the parties discuss an outcome “short of
trial.”  Hotton, a former Oppenheimer & Co. broker from West Islip,
New York, is accused of defrauding the producers of the musical
by leading them to believe he had secured $4.5 million from
overseas investors for supplemental funding to meet a shortfall.
Under an agreement with the producers, Hotton was paid more than
$33,000 in fees and commissions from March to June 2012.  After producers pressed him and his purported investors to
send the money they had pledged, Hotton allegedly orchestrated
the false illness, hospitalization and untimely death of one
investor. When it became clear that funding from Hotton’s bogus
backers would fall through, he tried to set up a $1 million loan
and lure the producers into paying him an additional $35,000 fee
for brokering it, prosecutors said.  Ira London, a lawyer for Hotton, declined to comment when
asked if his client was in plea talks with the U.S.  The case is U.S. v. Hotton, 12-2686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
