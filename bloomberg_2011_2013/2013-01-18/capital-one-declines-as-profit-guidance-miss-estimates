Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that gets more than half of its revenue from credit
cards, fell the most on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials
Index (S5FINL)  after fourth-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Capital One  dropped  7.5 percent to close at $56.99 in  New
York , the most since August 2011. Net income was $1.41 a share
for the three months ended Dec. 31, the McLean, Virginia-based
company said yesterday in a statement. That fell short of the
$1.59 average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Investors will be disappointed in the performance this
quarter, and will likely be discouraged by some of the guidance
out of the company for 2013,” Jason Arnold, an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets , said in a note after the results were
announced.  The lender said quarterly revenue in 2013 would be about
the same as the fourth quarter’s $5.62 billion, short of the
$5.76 billion first-quarter 2013  estimate  of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Net interest margin, the gap between what
banks pay depositors and what’s earned on loans, fell to 6.52
percent, a 0.45 percentage-point drop from the third quarter.  Capital One set aside $1.15 billion for loan losses in the
fourth quarter, an increase of $290 million from a year earlier
and $137 million over the third quarter. The increase occurred
as fewer loan losses were covered by acquisition accounting.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, 62, spent more
than $28 billion on acquisitions since 2005, including the
purchase last year of HSBC Holdings Plc’s U.S. card business.
Capital One also bought  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s online U.S. bank, which
helped boost  deposits  by more than $80 billion.  Dividend Plan  Full-year  net income  of $3.52 billion increased 12 percent
over the prior year. Fourth-quarter income from continuing
operations was $1.42 a share, missing the $1.58 adjusted average
estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fairbank repeated yesterday that investors can expect an
increase in the dividend this year, and that the lender won’t
initially seek to repurchase shares. The company must get
approval to distribute capital from the  Federal Reserve , which
subjects the largest banks to annual stress tests.  “Given that we did not request share repurchases right off
the bat, we’ve taken a somewhat conservative approach,” he said
on a conference call. “We felt the best thing to do was to
focus that request on dividends and get to a meaningful level.”  Capital One’s quarterly payout is 5 cents a share, yielding
about 1.4 percent annually. The company may raise the  dividend 
to 18 cents a share, KBW Inc. analysts led by Fred Cannon
estimated in a Jan. 13 note.  Capital One’s loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal of
future write-offs, averaged 3.66 percent during the final three
months of last year, the highest among the six-biggest U.S.
issuers, company filings show.  The lender will rebrand ING Direct USA as “Capital One
360” in February, replacing ING’s orange-ball logo with a
design incorporating the new name, according to a December e-
mail to customers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
