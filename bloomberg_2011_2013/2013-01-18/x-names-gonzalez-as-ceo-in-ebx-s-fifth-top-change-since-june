MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) , the
iron-ore producer of Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , named
Carlos Gonzalez as chief executive officer, the company’s second
change of its top executive in the last 15 months.  Gonzalez, currently mining director at Batista’s EBX Group
Co., will replace Guilherme Escalhao, 50, who is resigning from
the company, Rio de Janeiro-based MMX said in a regulatory
filing today. Escalhao was named as MMX’s top official in
October 2011 after the resignation of Roger Downey.  Escalhao is the fifth CEO of the six publicly traded
companies controlled by Eike Batista to be replaced since June.
EBX also named Otavio Lazcano as chief financial officer on Aug.
6, replacing Nicolau Chacur.  A former executive of  Vale SA (VALE5) , Gonzalez has worked on the
conception of MMX’s projects since joining EBX in 2005, the
company said in its filing. He also worked as chief operating
officer of  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ’s Minas-Rio iron-ore project in
Brazil since 2008 until returning to EBX in 2011, according to
the filing.  MMX’s press office declined to comment on the reasons for
Escalhao’s departure when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  MMX  declined  1 percent to 3.98 reais today in Sao Paulo.
The stock has dropped 46 percent in the past 12 months, 10 times
more than the 4.7 percent  fall  of Vale, the world’s largest
iron-ore producer.  (MMX will hold a conference call with investors to present
its new CEO on Jan. 21 at 10 a.m.  New York  time. Contact details
