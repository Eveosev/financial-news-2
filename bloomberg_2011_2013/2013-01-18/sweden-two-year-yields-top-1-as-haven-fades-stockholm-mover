Sweden’s two-year yield topped 1
percent for the first time since August as the nation’s haven
status faded on optimism European leaders have contained the
sovereign debt crisis.  Two-year yields gained as much five basis points to 1.00
percent, reaching that level for the first time since Aug. 21.
The spread, or difference in yield, to similar-maturity
benchmark German bonds was little changed at 76 basis points.  “Decreasing risk internationally has meant foreign
investors have decreased their holdings of Swedish  government
bonds ,” Roland Nilsson, fixed-income strategist at Swedbank AB,
said by telephone today.  Nordic bond yields have surged this year as investors grow
more comfortable investing in debt sold by struggling southern
European nations.  Spain ’s two-year yield has slid 43 basis
points this year to 2.55 percent, while  Italy ’s two-year yield
has dropped 58 basis points to 1.41 percent.  German two-year yields climbed today to the highest since
April, extending increases from yesterday amid speculation
financial institutions will begin paying back loans from the
 European Central Bank , pushing up overnight borrowing rates.
Reports showing economic growth in  China  exceeded economist
estimates also damped demand for the safest government debt.  Sweden has managed to sustain economic growth even as
exports slump. The Swedish Riksbank last month lowered its
benchmark rate to 1 percent to protect the economy and signaled
it won’t cut rates further.  Swedish bonds have lost 1.15 percent this year, according
to a broad market Bloomberg/EFFAS index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
