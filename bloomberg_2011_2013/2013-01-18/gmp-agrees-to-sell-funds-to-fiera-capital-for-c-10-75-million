GMP Capital Inc. (GMP) ,  Canada ’s second-
largest non-bank brokerage by assets, agreed to sell funds to
 Fiera Capital Corp. (FSZ)  for C$10.75 million.  GMP said it will sell funds including its GMP Diversified
Alpha Fund and the Canadian ABCP Fund, representing about C$570
million ($575.6 million) in assets under management, the
Toronto-based firm said today in a statement.  The assets will continue to be managed by Jason Marks,
chief executive officer of GMP’s GP Investment Management unit
and other managers, who will join Montreal-based Fiera. GMP will
be entitled to 25 percent of performance fees earned from the
assets for three years, the firm said.  GMP also named Dan McClure as co-CEO of GMP Investment
Management. He’ll succeed Marks when the transaction closes,
expected in the first quarter.  Marks and the other managers will have a minority ownership
interest in a newly created Fiera unit that will hold the
assets, Fiera said in a separate release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
