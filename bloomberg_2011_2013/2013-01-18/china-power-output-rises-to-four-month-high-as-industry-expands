China’s power output rose to the
highest in four months in December as industrial production in
the world’s largest energy user grew more than forecast.  Electricity  production  increased to 432.7 billion kilowatt-
hours, the most since August, data from the National Bureau of
Statistics showed today. That’s up 7.6 percent from the same
period last year. Power generation climbed 4.7 percent over the
year to 4.82 trillion kilowatt-hours, down from 12 percent
growth in 2011 as the nation’s economy slowed.  Industrial  output  expanded by a more-than-expected 10.3
percent in December, accelerating for a fourth month. The
increase compared with the 10.2 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 44 analysts and was the fastest pace since
March. Gross domestic product rose 7.9 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier and 7.8 percent for the full year.  China ’s growth in power use will accelerate this year to
more than 9 percent, the State Electricity Regulatory Commission
said yesterday. Electricity consumption rose 5.5% to 4.96
trillion kilowatt-hours last year, the commission said.  The nation has set a 2013 industrial-output growth target
of 10 percent, equivalent to the nation’s real industrial
production rate for 2012, China News Service reported Dec.27,
citing the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  To contact the reporters on this story:
