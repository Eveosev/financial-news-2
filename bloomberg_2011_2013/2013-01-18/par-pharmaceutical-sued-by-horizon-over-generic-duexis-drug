Par Pharmaceutical Cos. was sued for
patent infringement by  Horizon Pharma Inc. (HNP)  over a generic
version of the drug Duexis, used to treat arthritis.  Horizon, based in Northbrook, Illinois, contends Par plans
to market a copy of the drug before two U.S. patents expire in
2026, according to a complaint filed yesterday in federal court
in Wilmington, Delaware.  Unless a judge stops the alleged infringement, “Horizon
will be irreparably harmed,” the company said in court papers.  Gross sales for  Duexis  in the third quarter of 2012 were
$3 million, Horizon said in a Nov. 13 statement.  Stephen Mock, a spokesman for  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-
based Par, didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Horizon Pharma v. Par Pharmaceutical, U.S.
District Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patents in the lawsuit, click: 8,309,127 and
