South Korea’s won rose for a second
day and government bonds declined after a U.S. homebuilding
report added to signs of a recovery in the world’s biggest
economy, brightening the outlook for Asian exports.  U.S. housing starts climbed 12.1 percent last month to a
954,000 annual rate, exceeding all 84 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey, data showed yesterday. Economic growth in  China , South
Korea’s biggest export market, accelerated for the first time in
two years in the fourth quarter, with industrial output picking
up, a report showed today. The won reached a 17-month high this
week, before retreating as policy makers warned of possible
intervention to stem gains.  The won rose 0.1 percent to 1,057.08 per dollar in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,054.49 on
Jan. 15, the strongest level since August 2011, after rallying
8.3 percent in 2012, the best performance among the 11 most-
traded Asian currencies. The Kospi Index of shares climbed 0.7
percent following a rally in U.S. equities.  “Stock markets rose on U.S. economic data and prospects
for China data, prompting the won to gain as well,” said Jeon
Seung Ji, analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “Concerns
that South Korean authorities are monitoring the currency moves
and may take action are keeping the won from rising more.”  ‘Smoothing Operations’  South Korea is studying various measures to reduce
volatility in capital flows and currency movements, Vice Finance
Minister Shin Je Yoon said earlier this week. Central bank
Governor Kim Choong Soo said Jan. 14 the nation will take an
“active” response on the won if needed. Measures to slow
appreciation could include “smoothing operations,” Kim said,
adding authorities should act to normalize the exchange rate.  China’s  gross domestic product  rose 7.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said in Beijing today. That compared with the 7.8
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey and a 7.4
percent gain in the previous period. Industrial output in
December rose a more-than-expected 10.3 percent and fixed-asset
investment for the year gained 20.6 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.85
percent, Korea Exchange prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
