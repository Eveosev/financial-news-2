Treasuries rose, with 10-year yields
falling from the highest level in a week, as speculation U.S.
lawmakers will fail to reach agreement on raising the nation’s
debt ceiling revived demand for the safest securities.  Benchmark notes  briefly pared gains on a report the House
will pass a three-month debt-limit increase next month, only to
extend them once more after Speaker John Boehner said a budget
that cuts spending must be passed before any long-term deal is
reached. The Federal Reserve purchased $1.565 billion of bonds
maturing from February 2036 to November 2042 amid its struggle
to restore growth in the world’s largest economy.  “We have to wait to see what happens with the debt ceiling
before the market goes anywhere,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief
global strategist at the broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York.
“At 1.8 to 1.85 percent, we are roughly unchanged on the
year.”  The 10-year note  yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.84 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader pricing. The 1.625 percent
security due in November 2022 gained 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000
face amount, to 98 2/32. The yield earlier increased to 1.89
percent, the highest level since Jan. 11.  The Treasuries market will be closed Monday in observation
of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.  Futures Bets  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in  10-year note futures  in the week
ending Jan. 15 to the least since August, when they were net
short, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 27,298 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Net-long positions this week fell by 17,508
contracts, or 39 percent, from a week earlier, the Washington-
based commission said in its Commitments of Traders report.  Large speculators decreased their net-short bets on 30-year
bonds, with speculative short positions, or bets prices will
fall, outnumbering long positions by 5,373 contracts. Net-short
positions fell by 2,076 contracts, or 28 percent, from a week
earlier.  On the  two-year note , long positions outnumbered short
positions by 123,850 contracts, falling by 5,770 contracts, or 4
percent, from a week earlier.  Debt Ceiling  The House will “obligate” the Senate to cut spending,
Boehner said today as House Republicans set a vote for next week
on a three-month extension of U.S. borrowing authority.  “The Democratic-controlled Senate has failed to pass a
budget for four years,” said Boehner, an Ohio Republican.
“That is a shameful run that needs to end this year.”  The nation reached its $16.4 trillion debt ceiling in
December and has since been paying its bills through
“extraordinary” measures. next month. It will lack sufficient
funds to pay all its bills as early as Feb. 15, according to the
Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center.  Since 1960, Congress has raised or revised the limit 79
times, including 49 times under Republican presidents, according
to the Treasury Department, which noted the U.S. has never
defaulted on its obligations.  “They still want to fight it out,” said David Ader, head
of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “A series of temporary measures may
continue. This is going to continue for a while and it will keep
us in a range -- 1.8 to 1.9 percent.”  Sentiment Falls  U.S. government debt remained higher as the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan  consumer sentiment  index dropped
to 71.3 in January, the lowest since December 2011, from a five-
month low of 72.9 the prior month. Analysts forecast the measure
of U.S.  consumer confidence  would advance to 75 this month,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for interest rates, growth and inflation, yesterday
touched minus 0.71 percent, the least costly since Jan. 10. It
was negative 0.74 percent today after reaching negative 0.77
percent on Jan. 16, the most costly since Jan. 1. A negative
reading indicates investors are willing to accept yields below
what’s considered fair value.  Treasuries handed investors a 0.4 loss in the month ended
yesterday, while bonds in an index of sovereign debt around the
world declined 0.1 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data.  The Fed  purchased  Treasuries today as part of its monthly
$85 billion in government and mortgage-debt purchases designed
to stimulate the economy.  The Federal Open Market Committee has pushed the main
interest rate close to zero and expanded Fed  assets  to a record
$2.97 trillion to fuel growth and reduce 7.8 percent
unemployment. Policy makers debating whether to continue
stimulus this year will next meet Jan. 29-30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
