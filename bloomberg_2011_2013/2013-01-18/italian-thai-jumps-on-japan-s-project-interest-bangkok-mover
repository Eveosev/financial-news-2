Italian-Thai Development Pcl (ITD) ,
Thailand’s biggest construction company by sales, rose to the
highest level in more than two years after  Japan  expressed
interest in partnering the company in a Myanmar port project.  The shares  climbed  3 percent to 5.20 baht as of 12:11 p.m.
in Bangkok trading, on course for the highest close since
November 2010. The stock earlier jumped as much as 5 percent.
Thailand’s benchmark  SET Index (SET)  added 0.8 percent.  Japan’s government may invest and become the strategic
partner in the development of a deepsea port and industrial
estate at Dawei in Myanmar, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck
Shinawatra said yesterday after meeting Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe in Bangkok. The move will ease concerns about the
project’s funding and boost its viability, according UOB Kay
Hian Securities ( Thailand ) Pcl.  “Bringing in a partner raises optimism over the project,
which has been stalled for some time,” Kowit Pongwinyoo, an
analyst at UOB Kay Hian in Bangkok, said by phone today. “The
project’s feasibility has been in doubt because of the large
amount of investment.”  Italian-Thai won a concession from Myanmar’s government in
November 2010 to develop the $8.6 billion project. A joint
Thailand-Myanmar committee will draw up fund-raising and
investment regulations for the project in February, Yingluck
said on Dec. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
