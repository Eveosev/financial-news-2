Total SA (FP)  Chief Executive Officer
Christophe  de Margerie  will appear in Paris court on Jan. 21 to
fight charges he participated in the scandal stemming from the
United Nations oil-for-food relief program.  The trial is scheduled to run through Feb. 20. Total, Vitol
SA and 18 individuals, including de Margerie, are listed as
defendants in the trial over claims the program, meant to ease
conditions in Iraq after sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, was abused by Iraqi officials to evade the controls.  The investigation began in 2002. France is alone in
prosecuting corruption claims, misinterpreting as bribes
payments made by traders to Iraqi government accounts
unauthorized under the UN program, said Emmanuel Rosenfeld, de
Margerie’s lawyer. The company, accused of  influence peddling ,
and CEO, charged with enabling the misuse of corporate assets,
deny the allegations.  Total’s segment of the trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 4,
according to a provisional calendar from the Paris prosecutors’
office. De Margerie, 61, is set to testify on Feb. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
