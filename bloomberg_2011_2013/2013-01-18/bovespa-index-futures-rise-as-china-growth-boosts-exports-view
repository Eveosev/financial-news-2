The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index fell for the first
time in three days, paring a weekly gain, as  Banco do Brasil SA 
sank after saying it may increase its stake in Banco Votorantim
SA.  The state-controlled lender was poised for its biggest drop
in a month after saying in a regulatory filing it may inject
capital in Votorantim, which reported five straight quarterly
losses through September. Homebuilder MRV Engenharia &
Participacoes SA tumbled after saying it started half as many
new projects in the fourth quarter as it did a year earlier and
2012 sales trailed projections.  The Bovespa fell 0.4 percent to 61,975.30 at 3:05 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. Forty-two stocks retreated on the gauge while 27
rose. The measure is up 0.8 percent this week. The real weakened
0.3 percent to 2.0440 per dollar today.  “From what we’ve seen so far, Banco do Brasil’s investment
in Votorantim was a terrible decision,” Rodolfo Amstalden, an
analyst at consulting firm Empiricus Research, said by phone
from  Sao Paulo . “Now it’s saying it may inject even more money
there. The market is reacting to that.”  Banco do Brasil lost 2.4 percent to 26.18 reais. The
lender, which bought a 50 percent interest in Votorantim in
January 2009, is studying the possibility of increasing its
stake, according to a regulatory filing today.  MRV sank 2.4 percent to 11.22 reais. The  Belo Horizonte ,
Brazil-based homebuilder said in a regulatory filing that it
started 666 million reais of new projects in the fourth quarter,
down from 1.39 billion reais a year earlier. Sales totaled 3.43
billion reais for all of last year. The company had projected
2012 sales of  4.5 billion reais.  Brazilian Meatpackers  The Bovespa earlier gained as much as 0.3 percent after a
report showing  China’s economy  accelerated for the first time in
two years boosted commodities producers.  Meatpackers advanced after Cargill Inc., the largest U.S.
beef processor, said it will halt operations in a Texas
processing plant.  JBS SA, the world’s biggest beef producer, rose 2.2 percent
to 6.98 reais. Smaller competitor Marfrig Alimentos SA climbed
2.7 percent to 9.90 reais.  The Bovespa entered a  bull market  on Jan. 3 after rising 21
percent from last year’s low on June 5 as stimulus from central
banks around the world eased concern that economic growth might
miss expectations while borrowing costs at a record low in
Brazil boosted equity demand. The index has since pared its gain
to 18 percent.  Brazil ’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.9 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 6.69 billion reais in stocks in Sao
Paulo yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.25
billion reais in 2012, according to data compiled by the
 exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
