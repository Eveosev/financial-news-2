Cattle dropped for the fourth
straight day, heading for the longest losing streak since July,
on speculation that animal demand is going to fall after Cargill
Inc. said it will idle a beef plant. Hogs were steady.  The beef-processing plant in Plainview,  Texas , will stop
operations at the close of business on Feb. 1 as the U.S. herd
shrank and feed costs climbed, Minneapolis-based Cargill said
yesterday in a statement.  “The initial reaction from the industry is always there’s
less demand for fat cattle because this packer shut down, and
therefore that’s bearish for prices,” David Kruse, a commodity
trading advisor at Commstock Investments Inc. in Royal,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1.303 a pound at 9:52 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Yesterday, futures tumbled by as much as the 3-cent exchange
limit to $1.297, the lowest for the most-active contract since
Nov. 16.  The plant closing will “ultimately be friendly to the
market,” because it means less beef production, Kruse said.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slid 0.3 percent
to $1.45425 a pound on the CME. A close at that price would be
the 10th straight drop, the longest consecutive decline since
November 2004.  Hog futures for April settlement rose 0.2 percent to 88.275
cents a pound in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
