Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
operator of  Colombia ’s largest oil field, is poised to gain
because the country might speed up the process of granting
permits, Banco BTG Pactual SA analysts said.  “We might see the hardship for getting licenses in
Colombia greatly diminishing,” analysts Gustavo Gattass and
Natalia Agudelo wrote in the report today. Bogota-based Rubiales
has “production being held back by lack of licenses, either for
water injection, drilling or production.”  Shares (PREC)  fell 0.4 percent to 39,860 pesos at the close in
Bogota. The Canadian-traded shares fell 0.4 percent to C$22.20.  The Canadian-traded shares could gain about 76 percent to a
C$39 target price, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
