A former Georgian prison official
whose leaked videos contributed to the defeat of President
Mikheil Saakashvili’s party in October elections was detained on
arrival at Tbilisi International Airport early today.  Vladimer Bedukadze, who admitted to making public the
graphic footage of inmate abuse, was arrested after landing on a
flight from Istanbul, Nino Giorgobiani, a spokeswoman for the
 Interior Ministry , said by phone.  Charged with mistreating detainees, Bedukadze fled the
country last year, his lawyer, Elza Jmukhadze, told reporters
today in the Georgian capital. The date for his first court
hearing hasn’t been set, she said.  Graphic videos released weeks before Oct. 1 parliamentary
elections helped Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s
opposition coalition to a surprising win after it ran more than
20 percentage points behind Saakashvili’s party in August.
Footage of prison guards beating and raping male inmates with a
broom handle and truncheon sparked mass protests in the country
ruled for the past nine years by Saakashvili.  To contact the reporter on this story:
