OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) ,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, gained in New York to trade at the smallest
discount to peers in four months on prospects the company will
cut spending after breaching last year’s expenditure target.  American depositary receipts  of Gazprom added 1.6 percent
yesterday and the stock’s 10-day volatility dropped to the
lowest since Dec. 28. The shares’ gain reduced Gazprom’s
discount versus the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Energy Index to 58
percent, the least since Sept. 27. The  Bloomberg Russia-US
Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of U.S.-listed stock climbed to a four-month high,
while  futures  on the RTS Index added 0.5 percent to 159,190.  Gazprom said yesterday that  capital spending  exceeded last
year’s $40 billion target after the Moscow-based company reduced
the  cash flow  by investing in undersea pipelines projects in
 Europe . The producer approved a plan on Dec. 20 to cut
expenditures by almost half in 2013. Revenue will probably
increase 3.6 percent this year, after falling an estimated 1.1
percent to $156.4 billion 2012, according to the mean estimate
of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Gazprom is at a turning point,” Ildar Davletshin, an
analyst at Renaissance Capital Ltd. in Moscow, said by phone
yesterday. “Third-quarter results have shown that their
investment strategy has to change and this time, for real, and
right now.”  Gazprom ADRs advanced to $9.75 in New York yesterday while
the  stock  increased 0.8 percent to 147.51 rubles, or the
equivalent of $4.88, in Moscow.  ‘Very Attractive’  Gazprom’s 10-day volatility fell to 20.38 in New York
yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 28, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The advance in the ADRs sent Gazprom’s valuations to 3.1
times estimated earnings, compared with an average multiple of
7.4 for companies on the MSCI Emerging Markets Energy gauge,
which includes  producers  such as  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and
PetroChina Co., data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “They have to keep capex at lower levels,” Ivan Manaenko,
the head of research at Veles Capital LLC in Moscow, said by
phone yesterday. “Some of their investments make no sense and
raise concerns.”  In 2011, Gazprom spent $53 billion on capital projects,
more than PetroChina Co.’s $46 billion and $36.8 billion at
Exxon Mobil Corp. Gazprom typically revises its annual
investment program after evaluating first-half performance.  Undersea Pipelines  Gazprom’s ADRs lost 8.9 percent last year, dropping for a
second consecutive year for the first time since its listing in
1999, on concerns the concern the company is spending on
projects including an export terminal in the  Far East  and
undersea pipelines to Europe, where demand is dwindling.  The producer and its partners  Eni SpA (ENI) , Wintershall AG and
 Electricite de France SA , started work last month on the South
Stream pipeline, which will run from Russia under the  Black Sea 
to eastern and southern Europe, even as Russia’s existing
connections run at about 70 percent of their capacity.  European exports dropped about 8 percent in the full year
to 138 billion cubic meters, Gazprom Chief Executive Officer
Alexey Miller said Jan. 15. Europe accounts for about half of
the company’s total sales of gas, oil, condensate and refined
products.  Gazprom probably overshot its plan for capital spending by
$4 billion in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Andrey Kruglov said
on a conference call in Moscow yesterday.  Oil Rallies  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 0.8 percent to $30.12,
gaining for the first time in three days. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock futures ,
declined 3 percent to 20.87.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index rose 1.1 percent to
102.87 yesterday, the highest level since Sept. 14.  Crude oil for February delivery advanced 1.3 percent to
$95.49 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, a
four-month high. Brent oil for February settlement also rose 1.3
percent to $111.10 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange, while  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export blend,
added 0.9 percent to $110.17.  The ruble gained 0.4 percent to 30.1945 yesterday, the
highest level since Jan. 10. Ruble futures showed the currency
strengthening 0.3 percent to 30.484 per dollar.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 1 percent to HK$4.90 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:03
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
