Romania’s bailout repayments this
year will probably prompt the central bank to beef up its
foreign-exchange reserves, limiting the leu’s gains, according
to ING Bank Romania SA. The currency retreated from a year high.  The central bank is due to repay about 3.8 billion euros
($5 billion) to the  International Monetary Fund .  The leu depreciated 0.4 percent to 4.3398 per euro by 5
p.m. in Bucharest, after gaining 2.5 percent this month, the
best performance among emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. It climbed to the highest level in a year after
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said on Jan. 15 the country’s domestic
bonds are eligible for its emerging-market government bond
index.  The central bank is “probably trying to reduce market
volatility while finding the opportunity of replenishing its
reserves at the current levels,” Mihai Tantaru, a Bucharest-
based economist at ING Bank Romania SA, wrote in a note today.  Romania, which secured a 20 billion-euro bailout from the
IMF and the European Union in 2009, is scheduled to repay a
total of about 5 billion euros this year to the Washington-based
lender.  The central bank’s foreign-exchange reserves stood at 31.2
billion euros at the end of December, little changed from 31.17
billion a month earlier.  “In light of the above and also considering the commercial
net demand for hard currency, we see the leu swinging inside the
4.32-4.34 per euro range for today,” Tantaru said.  Yields on  Romania ’s June 2019 euro-denominated bonds rose
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
