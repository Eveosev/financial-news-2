The International Monetary Fund is
waiting for the Egyptian authorities to update an economic
program attached to a loan agreement that has been put on hold
before sending a team to Cairo, an IMF official said.  “The work that is now under way in Cairo is to update
their own program in light of the fact that with this passage of
time the economic situation has changed a bit,” Masood Ahmed,
head of the IMF Middle East and Central Asia Department, told
reporters in  Washington  today.  It’s also “to ensure that the measures that they’re
putting forward are both adequate to respond to the economic and
financial challenges and are consistent and compatible with
their political imperatives.”  Once that is advanced, the IMF will send a technical team
to Cairo, Ahmed said, adding he hopes it to be in coming weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
