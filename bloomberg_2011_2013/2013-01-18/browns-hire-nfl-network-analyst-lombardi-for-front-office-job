Michael Lombardi was named vice
president of player personnel for the Cleveland Browns, a return
to the front office after five years as a National Football
League television analyst.  Lombardi has 22 years of NFL front office experience, the
team said today in an announcement on its website. He has spent
the past five seasons working for the NFL Network and NFL.com.  Prior to his move to television, Lombardi spent eight
seasons in the personnel department of the Oakland Raiders,
according to the website. He has also worked with the San
Francisco 49ers, the Philadelphia Eagles and Browns.  Last week Cleveland named former Carolina Panthers
offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski as its new head coach. The
Browns fired coach Pat Shurmur and general manager Tom Heckert
last month after the team finished 5-11, its fifth consecutive
season with at least 11 losses.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
