The rand fell to its weakest level
in almost seven weeks, extending its third straight weekly
decline, amid concern labor protests in mining and agriculture
will curb exports and slow growth in  Africa ’s largest economy.  South Africa ’s currency tumbled as much as 1.3 percent to
8.8981 per dollar, its worst level since Dec. 3. It was trading
at 8.8850 at 4:10 p.m. in Johannesburg, the worst performer of
16 major currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The rand fell 1.8
percent this week, the biggest five-day slide since October.
Yields on 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 jumped four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.23 percent. The yield has
climbed 12 basis points from a record low reached Jan. 10.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ’s platinum unit, the world’s largest
miner of the metal, said Jan. 15 it may fire as many as 14,000
workers as it idles four shafts. Production cutbacks may curb
South Africa’s exports, preventing the rand from gaining even as
commodity prices rise, said Mohammed Nalla, head of strategic
research at  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  Economic growth in  China , the
biggest buyer of South African raw materials, accelerated for
the first time in two years in the fourth quarter.  “We are likely to see the rand remain on the back foot,”
Nalla said by phone from Johannesburg. Lower mining output and
labor unrest are “weighing on what we are actually able to put
out into the market and that may compromise our ability to take
advantage of a turnaround” in commodity prices, he said.  ‘Well Entrenched’  Metals and other minerals accounted for 61 percent of South
Africa’s exports in the first 11 months of 2012, according to
government data. The trade deficit in the same period was 112.7
billion rand ($13 billion), more than six times bigger than a
year earlier, undermining the rand.  “Pressures on the trade and current accounts will remain
well entrenched for a while to come,” Quinten Bertenshaw, a
Johannesburg-based analyst at ETM Analytics, said in e-mailed
comments. “There are very few reasons to turn overly optimistic
on the prospects for the rand.”  Foreign investors sold a net 1.2 billion rand of South
African  stocks  and  bonds  yesterday, according to data from JSE
Ltd., operator of the nation’s stock and bond exchanges. The
nation’s purchasing managers’ index unexpectedly fell in
December top 47.4 from 49.5 amid concern about rising
unemployment.  More than 40 people died last year at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana
platinum mine, the worst mining violence since the end of
apartheid in 1994. Work stoppages in the platinum and gold
industries cost the  economy  more than 10 billion rand in 2012
and will shave about 0.5 percentage point off gross domestic
product, according to the Treasury. The economy probably
expanded 2.5 percent last year, the slowest pace since a 2009
recession.  The rand’s three-month implied volatility against the
dollar climbed 35 basis points today to 12.90 percent,
indicating that options traders see wider swings in the currency
in coming months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
