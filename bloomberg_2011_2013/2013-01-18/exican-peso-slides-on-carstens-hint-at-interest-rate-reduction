Mexico’s peso fell the most in four
weeks after central bankers signaled that a further slowdown in
inflation could prompt them to lower  interest rates .  The currency dropped 0.5 percent to 12.6516 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:26 a.m. in Mexico City. It would be the peso’s biggest
decline on a closing basis since Dec. 21. Yields on peso bonds
due in 2022 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
5.26 percent, dropping 14 basis points this week.  “I would expect the knee-jerk to be Mexico peso negative
on the lower-rates expectation,”  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin
American currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a
telephone interview from Toronto. While the peso will likely
rebound, it’s declining today on “the possibility of lower
yields.”  The central bank’s board, led by Governor Agustin Carstens,
left the overnight lending rate at 4.5 percent for the 32nd
consecutive meeting, as forecast by all 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. In a statement accompanying the decision policy
makers said that if a “downward trend in general and core
inflation” is confirmed, “a reduction in the one-day interbank
interest rate may be advisable.”  Annual inflation last month slowed to 3.57 percent, within
the central bank’s target range of 2 percent to 4 percent for
the first time since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
