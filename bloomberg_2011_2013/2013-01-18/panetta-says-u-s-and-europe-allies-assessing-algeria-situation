U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
said that the U.S. is working with the U.K. and other allies to
gather more information on the hostage taking and rescue
operation in  Algeria .  “We are working very closely with the British government
and other nations to assess precisely what’s happening on the
ground” in Algeria “even as we continue to try and gather
better information about what’s happening,” Panetta
said in remarks at  King’s College London  today. He is in the
British capital to meet with his U.K. counterparts.  Panetta did not offer more information on the number of
hostages including Americans who were taken in Algeria and
details of the rescue attempt by Algerian forces.  Calling the hostage taking an act of terror, Panetta said
those responsible had no justification for the “kidnapping and
murder of innocent people.” The U.S. will deny sanctuary to
terrorists in any part of the world, Panetta said.  “Those who would wantonly attack our country and our
people will have no place to hide,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
