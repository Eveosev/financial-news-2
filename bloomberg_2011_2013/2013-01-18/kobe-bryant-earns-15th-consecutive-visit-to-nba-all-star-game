Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles
Lakers earned his 15th straight spot in the National Basketball
Association’s All-Star Game, topping LeBron James of the Miami
Heat in fan voting.  Bryant surpassed Jerry West, Karl Malone and Shaquille O’Neal for the most consecutive NBA All-Star selections.  The 62nd NBA All-Star Game will be played at the Toyota
Center in Houston on Feb. 17.  In addition to Bryant, the Western Conference starting
lineup includes the Lakers’ Dwight Howard; Chris Paul and Blake Griffin of the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Oklahoma City
Thunder’s Kevin Durant.  James is joined on the Eastern Conference team by his Miami
teammate Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony of the  New York  Knicks and
Boston Celtics Kevin Garnett and Rajon Rondo.  Garnett’s 15th selection ties him with Bryant and O’Neal
for the second-most All-Star selections behind Kareem Abdul- Jabbar, who was elected to 19 games.  Reserves, who will be selected by the 30 NBA coaches, will
be announced Jan. 24. The coaches will be determined by the best
record in each conference through games played Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
