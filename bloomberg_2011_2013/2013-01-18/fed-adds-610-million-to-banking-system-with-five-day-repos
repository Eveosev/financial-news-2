The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
temporarily added $610 million of  reserves  to the banking system
with  repurchase agreements  as part of a program to test the
central bank’s operational readiness.  The transaction, part of a series of open-market operations
began in 2009, doesn’t represent any change in monetary policy,
according to a  statement  on the New York Fed’s website.
Treasuries were the only collateral in the agreement.  In repos, the Fed buys  U.S. Treasury , mortgage-backed and
so-called agency debt from dealers for a set period, temporarily
raising the amount of money available in the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the dealers, and the
cash to the Fed.  The Fed has historically used repos and reverse repos to
help maintain the proper level of money in the banking system to
keep overnight  interest rates  close to the central bank’s
target. The Fed has held its target rate for overnight loans
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
