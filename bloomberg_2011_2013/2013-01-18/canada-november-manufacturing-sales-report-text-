The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s manufacturing shipments report for November released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales increased 1.7% in November to $49.9
billion, the highest level since May 2012. The largest gains
were in the transportation equipment, primary metal and chemical
industries.  Sales rose in 12 of 21 industries, representing about two-
thirds of the manufacturing sector. Durable goods sales
increased 2.7% to $25.5 billion while non-durable goods sales
gained 0.8% to $24.4 billion.  Constant dollar sales rose 1.6%, indicating that most of
the gain in manufactured goods sold was a result of higher
volumes.  Sales rise in several key industries  The gain in the transportation equipment industry accounted
for more than a third of the total increase in Canadian
manufacturing sales. Sales in the industry were up 3.8% to $8.7
billion. The advance in transportation equipment partly
reflected a 4.1% increase in the motor vehicle industry and a
6.5% rise in the aerospace product and parts industry.  In the primary metal industry, sales rose 5.9% to $4.0
billion, the highest level since April 2012. The gain was the
largest since July 2011.  Sales in the  chemical industry  increased 3.9% to $4.1
billion. The advance partly reflected higher production at
several plants following slowdowns for maintenance and repair
work.  Miscellaneous manufacturing sales rose 11.9% to $961
million, the highest level since December 2011. This gain
followed two months of declines.  Sales gains led by Ontario  Manufacturing sales were up in five provinces, led by
Ontario.  Sales rose 3.8% to $23.0 billion in Ontario, reflecting
advances in 14 of 21 industries. A 5.2% increase in the
transportation equipment industry accounted for the largest
portion of the provincial advance. Gains in the industry were
reported by both motor vehicle and aerospace product and parts
manufacturers. Sales also rose in the primary metal (+15.8%),
and the petroleum and coal product (+7.0%) industries.  Sales in  New Brunswick  rose 11.7% to $1.8 billion, mostly
reflecting an advance in the non-durable goods industries.  Manufacturing sales were down 1.8% in  Alberta  and 0.9% in
 Quebec . For Alberta, the decrease reflected a drop in petroleum
and coal product sales (-6.7%) while in Quebec, lower non-
durable goods sales were behind most of the decline.  Inventories decrease  Inventories declined 0.8% to $65.5 billion in November,
largely reflecting drops in the petroleum and coal product, and
computer and electronic product industries.  In the petroleum and coal product industry, total
inventories were down 4.5% to $5.1 billion. The decrease was
caused by lower inventories in all three stages of fabrication.  Inventories of computer and electronic products declined
6.9% to $2.8 billion. The inventory level in November was the
lowest since August 2011.  The inventory-to-sales ratio decreased from 1.35 in October
to 1.31 in November. The ratio is a measure of the time, in
months, that would be required to exhaust inventories if sales
were to remain at their current level.  Manufacturing at a glance: Inventories  From time to time, this release analyzes longer trends in
Canadian manufacturing data. This month, the focus is on
inventories. Despite the decrease in November, inventories have
been on a gradual rise for the past two years. For the first 11
months of 2012, the monthly average value for total inventories
was $65.2 billion, the highest level for this period since 2008.
Each stage of fabrication (raw materials, goods-in-process, and
finished products) posted higher levels in 2012.  Inventories of raw materials increased in both 2011 and
2012, reaching a monthly average of $26.0 billion for the
January to November 2012 period. This level was $2.4 billion
higher than the same period in 2010, when the monthly average
value for raw material inventories had reached its most recent
low.  The monthly average goods-in-process inventories posted the
largest dollar increase of the three inventory categories in
2012. Compared with the same period in 2011, goods-in-process
inventories rose $1.0 billion to a monthly average of $17.5
billion for the period January to November 2012.  Finished product inventories rose to a monthly average of
$21.7 billion for the January to November 2012 period. This
represents a 2.8% increase compared with the same period in 2011.
Finished product inventory levels in 2012 were at their highest
level since 2008.  The share of the three stages of fabrication relative to
total inventories has evolved over the past decade. In 2012, raw
materials accounted for 39.8% of total inventories, compared
with 44.5% in 2004, their greatest proportion for the past 10
years. Although goods-in-process inventories continued to
account for the smallest share of total inventories, the share
has been on the rise since 2004. For 2012, goods-in-process
inventories accounted for 26.9% of total inventories, the
highest since 2002. Despite the increase in finished product
inventories in 2012, their share of total inventories decreased
to 33.3%, the lowest point since 2002.  In 2012, four of the six largest manufacturing industries
by value of inventories posted increases compared with 2011. The
largest industry by inventory value, transportation equipment,
held a monthly average of $9.3 billion in inventories. For the
period January to November 2012, transportation equipment
inventories rose $802 million compared with the same period in
2011. Inventories of machinery, food, and fabricated metal
products also advanced compared with 2011. On the other hand,
inventories of primary metals and chemical products decreased.  Substantial advance in unfilled orders in November  Unfilled orders advanced 3.6% to $64.1 billion in November,
reaching the highest level since March 2009. The increase
reflected higher orders in the transportation equipment industry.  In the aerospace product and parts industry, unfilled
orders rose 7.8% to $34.2 billion, also the highest level since
March 2009.  New orders rose 6.2% in November, the largest gain since
March 2011. The increase was the result of more orders placed in
the transportation equipment industry.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and are

month. Revised data, based on late responses, are updated for
the three previous months.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and
tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing,
leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support
activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics
and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation
equipment, furniture and related products and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the  aerospace industry  and shipbuilding industries, the
value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly
sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories
of goods in process and finished products manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute
to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the current
month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for
the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the
previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
