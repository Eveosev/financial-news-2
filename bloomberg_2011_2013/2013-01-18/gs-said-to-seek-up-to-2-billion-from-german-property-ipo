LEG Immobilien AG, the German
residential landlord owned by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , may
raise as much as 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) in an initial
public offering, according to three people with knowledge of the
plan. It would be the largest IPO by a German property company.  LEG, based in Dusseldorf, will probably list about 50
percent of the company, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. LEG is valued at
about 2.1 billion euros to 3 billion euros, the people said.  Goldman Sachs and LEG co-owner Perry Capital, which bought
the company for about 3.5 billion euros in 2008, are seeking to
profit from a boom in German residential real estate. The FTSE
EPRA/Nareit index of  German property stocks  has gained 38
percent in the past 12 months.  LEG’s share sale will probably take place on Feb. 1 and the
final amount raised will depend on investor demand, the people
said. LEG is due to announce details of the IPO at a press
conference on Jan. 21.  LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine Westphalia,
 Germany ’s most populous state. Goldman Sachs’ Whitehall Street
Real Estate fund holds about 95 percent of the company.  Goldman Sachs and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  will be lead managers
and book runners for the IPO.  Officials at LEG, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank declined
to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
