and call elections to be held within 30 days if President Hugo Chavez dies or steps down before he is sworn into his new term.  Maduro, in an interview with the Spanish newswire EFE, said

head of the assembly, would take power temporarily while
elections are organized, Maduro told EFE in a report published
yesterday.  Chavez, who won re-election to a third-six year term last
October, missed his swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 10 because
he remains in Cuba recovering from cancer surgery. The Supreme
Court ruled that the ceremony was a formality and that Chavez
can take the oath of office at a later date.  The 58-year-old Chavez hasn’t been seen publicly since he
stepped off a plane in  Havana  on Dec. 10. The former paratrooper
is calm and conscious, Maduro told EFE. Information Minister
Ernesto Villegas Jan. 13 that Chavez’s condition was
“favorable” after suffering a respiratory infection that
followed his surgery. The government hasn’t said what kind of
cancer Chavez is suffering from.  Before departing for Cuba last month, Chavez called on
Venezuelans to support Maduro in elections if he couldn’t finish
out his term. The 50-year-old former bus driver gave the annual
 state of the union  speech on Jan. 15, announced the designation
of a new foreign minister and has called for the military to
remain loyal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
