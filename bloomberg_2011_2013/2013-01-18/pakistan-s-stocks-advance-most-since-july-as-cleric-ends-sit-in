Pakistan’s (KSE100)  stocks rose the most
since July as a Muslim cleric ended a protest in the capital
after signing a deal with the government on electoral changes
ahead of voting planned for May.  The Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index gained 1.7 percent to
16,560.42 at 11:24 a.m. local time.  Lucky Cement Ltd. (LUCK) , the
biggest exporter of the building material, rallied 2.4 percent.  Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, who heads an Islamic group with 90
branches worldwide, announced the accord yesterday after about
five hours of talks with government officials in his bullet-
proof bunker in Islamabad. The scholar had earlier delivered
passionate speeches demanding that the government dissolve the
legislature and implement changes he said would thwart corrupt
politicians seeking election.  “Investors are feeling confident now after the deal was
reached,” Khalil Usmani, vice president equity sales at JS
Global Ltd., said on the phone from Karachi.  Under the accord, the election commission committed to
making certain candidates aren’t corrupt and meet all legal
requirements. The government will propose names of two impartial
candidates for the caretaker prime minister to oversee polls
after consulting Qadri’s party.  The benchmark  stock index  tumbled 3.2 percent on Jan. 15
after the nation’s  Supreme Court  ordered the arrest of Prime
Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf. The chairman of the anti-corruption
agency told the chief justice yesterday there isn’t enough
evidence to arrest the prime minister and others accused of
graft in awarding power contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
