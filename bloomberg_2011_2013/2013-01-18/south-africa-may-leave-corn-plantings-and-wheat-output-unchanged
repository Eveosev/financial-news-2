South Africa  will probably leave its
estimates for corn plantings and wheat output unchanged,
according to a survey.  Farmers may sow 2.74 million hectares (6.77 million acres)
with corn, according to the median prediction in a survey of six
traders, matching the Pretoria-based Crop Estimates Committee’s
October forecast. Growers will probably reap 1.9 million metric
tons of wheat this season, according to the median estimate in
the survey, equal to the committee’s Dec. 20 forecast. The
committee releases its forecasts at 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 24.  White corn is a staple food in South Africa and yellow corn
is mainly used as  animal feed . The Free State province produces
40 percent of the country’s corn and Mpumalanga grows 21
percent. The nation is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain.  South  Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia . The
nation is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and Sudan,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Farmers this
season planted the smallest area with wheat in more than eight
decades as prices declined, the committee said on July 24.  Estimates for wheat output ranged from 1.9 million tons and
1.906 million tons, while those for the corn-planting area were
from 2.71 million hectares to 2.8 million hectares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
