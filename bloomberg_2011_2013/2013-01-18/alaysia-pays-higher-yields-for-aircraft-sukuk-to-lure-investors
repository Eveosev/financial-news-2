Malaysia’s government paid higher
yields for its second offering of state-backed Islamic bonds on
behalf of the national airline to entice investors, as total
issuance of the notes rose to 4.6 billion ringgit ($1.5 billion).  The  finance ministry  sold 1.2 billion ringgit of the debt
yesterday, with orders amounting to 1.5 billion ringgit, said
two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named
because the details are private. That compares with 3.6 billion
ringgit in bids for a 2 billion ringgit sale of Shariah-
compliant debt by rail operator Syarikat Prasarana Negara Bhd.
on Aug. 28, which were also government guaranteed.  The finance ministry paid 3.77 percent for the 10-year
portion on behalf of  Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS)  and 4.16
percent for the 15-year notes, compared with 3.74 percent and
4.12 percent in November. Sales of state-backed Islamic
securities rose 10-fold to about 20 billion ringgit in 2012 from
a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The company had to price the debt at higher yields
because demand wasn’t hot,” Fariza Taib, a fixed-income manager
overseeing 1 billion ringgit at Kuala Lumpur-based Asian Islamic
Investment Management Bhd., said in an interview today. “A lot
of funds already have holdings of the sukuk as they sold a
bigger portion in November.”  The offering is part of a 5.3 billion ringgit 20-year
program via Turus Pesawat Sdn., a special-purpose company set up
to sell the securities on behalf of MAS, which is using the
funds to purchase aircraft as it seeks to compete with budget
airline AirAsia Bhd.  DanaInfra Offering  Turus Pesawat sold 370 million ringgit of 2028 notes
yesterday at a yield of 4.16 percent, or 45 basis points more
than similar-maturity sovereign debt.  Malaysian Airline System, based in Subang near  Kuala Lumpur ,
sold 1 billion ringgit of Islamic bonds with no fixed maturity
in June via a private placement at a yield of 6.9 percent. It
also issued 500 million ringgit in September at the same rate.  MAS announced in May it planned to lease six Airbus A380s
and two A330s from the government for 5.3 billion ringgit. The
 airline  returned to profit in the third quarter for the first
time since the three-month period ended December 2010.  DanaInfra, a state-owned entity formed to finance projects
such as roads and railways, plans to sell 1.5 billion ringgit of
government-guaranteed sukuk this month, Kamal Mohd Ali, chief
operating officer, told reporters on Jan. 8. The company drew
orders of 12.9 billion ringgit for a 2.4 billion ringgit
offering of Islamic debt in July, which were also state backed.  Sales of local-currency Islamic bonds, which pay returns on
assets to comply with the Koran’s ban on interest, rose to a
record 95.8 billion ringgit last year, more than doubled 2011’s
45 billion ringgit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
