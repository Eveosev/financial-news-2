Crude options volatility fell below
20 percent for the first time in at least six years as the
underlying futures settled above $95.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 19.27 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 4:02 p.m., compared with 20.87 percent yesterday.
It was the first time that volatility for the front-month
options contract has dipped below 20 percent since at least
March 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil futures for March delivery rose 10 cents to settle at
$96.04 a barrel on the Nymex. February-delivery crude futures,
which expire Jan. 22, advanced 7 cents to $95.56 a barrel, the
highest settlement since Sept. 17.  “Crude has consolidated up at this level in a tight
range,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options
Inc. in New York.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
March $120 calls, which were unchanged at 3 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,118 contracts at 4:09 p.m. in  New York . March $90
puts were the second-most active with 1,742 lots. They fell 14
cents to 49 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 61
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 55 percent of
the 175,385 contracts traded.  March $110 calls were the most active options traded, with
10,632 contracts changing hands. They rose 1 cent to 8 cents a
barrel. March $75 puts fell 2 cents to 3 cents on 10,459 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $110 calls with 41,214
contracts. Next were March $85 puts at 30,354 and March $70 puts
at 26,919.  To contact the reporter on this story:
