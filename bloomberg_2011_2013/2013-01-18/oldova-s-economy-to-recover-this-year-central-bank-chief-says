Moldova’s economy will return to
growth in 2013 as last year’s “transitory shocks” won’t be
repeated, central bank Dorin Dragutanu said.  The eastern European nation’s economy will probably grow 3
percent this year and 4 percent to 5 percent in 2014 and 2015,
Dragutanu said today in an interview in Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital. The $6.9 billion economy probably shrank in 2012, he
said.  Last year “was an extremely difficult year for our country
because we had shocks beyond the control of the government or
the national bank,” he said. “The deterioration of the
economic situation in the region decreased significantly the
external demand for our products. In addition, we had one of the
most severe droughts in the last 50 years, so agriculture
dropped by almost 20 percent.”  Russia and  Romania  are the main exports partners of
Moldova, with shares of about 20 percent and 15 percent,  U.S.
data  show. The country of 3.7 million has the lowest per capita
gross domestic product in  Europe , according data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
