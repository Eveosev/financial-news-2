The  New York  Yankees and Joba Chamberlain avoided salary arbitration after the right-handed
relief pitcher agreed to a one-year contract.  Financial details werenâ€™t revealed by the team in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. The deal is worth $1.88 million,
according to the  Associated Press .  Chamberlain, 27, had a 4.35 earned-run average last season
in 22 appearances after missing the first part of the year
because he dislocated his ankle while playing on a trampoline
with his son.  A first-round draft pick by the Yankees in 2006,
Chamberlain has battled injury in his six-year Major League
Baseball career. He spent parts of the past two seasons on the
disabled list and the new contract contains performance bonuses
for games finished, the AP said.  New York relievers  David Robertson  and Boone Logan are the
only Yankees who remain in arbitration.  To contact the reporters on this story:
