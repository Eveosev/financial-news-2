Shipments of liquid crystal displays
for use in cars will almost double by 2016 from 2012 levels, as
an expected mandate in the U.S. for rear-view cameras in autos
boosts demand, researcher IHS forecast.  Deliveries of full-color LCDs used in autos will reach
almost 117 million units by 2016, up 89 percent from 2012, El
Segundo, California-based IHS said in a report dated Jan. 17.
Each year sales will grow between 15 percent and 23 percent,
with shipments crossing the hundred-million-unit mark in 2015,
according to the report.  “The major driver of growth will be a U.S. government
mandate requiring all cars to incorporate rear-view cameras by
2014,” Vinita Jakhanwal, director for small and medium displays
at IHS said in the report. Rear-view cameras allow drivers to
see directly behind a vehicle, making it easier to back up
safely.  The U.S. delayed a planned rule requiring backup cameras in
new cars for a third time, with National Highway Traffic Safety
Administrator missing a Dec. 31 deadline to issue it. It’s under
discussion at the White House’s Office of Management and Budget
as one of the most expensive pending U.S. rules, with a stated
cost of $2.7 billion. The rule remains “very much” on the
table, National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator  David Strickland  said on Jan. 16.  Sharp Corp. (6753) , a Japanese display maker, was among the main
suppliers of automotive LCDs last year, the report said.
Hsinchu, Taiwan-based  AU Optronics Corp. (2409)  and  LG Display Co. (034220)  in
 South Korea  are also increasing production of automotive
displays, as they aim to expand presence in the automotive
market and benefit from the 10 year supply chain lifetime of
auto parts.  Competition within the automotive display market is
predicted to intensify during the next five years, according to
the IHS report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
