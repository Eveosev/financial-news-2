Gas and oil rigs in the U.S. dropped
for the eighth straight week to the lowest level since March
2011 as energy producers’ demand for new equipment weakened.  Oil rigs  declined by seven to 1,316 this week, the lowest
level in almost 10 months, data posted on  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s
website show. The  gas count  dropped by five to 429, the field-
services company based in Houston said. Total energy rigs fell
by 12 to 1,749.  The U.S. oil rig count has fallen every month since August
as  crude supplies  climbed and more efficient drilling technology
lessened energy producers’ demand for new rigs. The gas count
has shrunk to almost a fourth of its peak in August 2008 as
energy companies moved equipment away from dry-gas plays to
target more lucrative liquids.  “A number of operators such as Whiting are replacing rigs
with more efficient pad-capable drilling rigs,” John Kelso, a
spokesman for Denver, Colorado-based  Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL) ,
the third-largest leaseholder in the Bakken play, said by e-mail
Jan. 14. “An operator can drill just as many wells with fewer
rigs.”  Crude for February delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange was unchanged today at $95.49 a barrel, down 5.1
percent from a year ago.  U.S. oil output  rose  39,000 barrels a day to 7.04 million
last week, the highest level since January 1993, according to
data compiled by the Energy Information Administration, a
division of the Energy Department. Stockpiles slipped 0.3
percent to 360.3 million barrels in that same period. Supplies
reached a 22-year high of 387.3 million barrels in June.  Natural gas for February delivery gained 7.1 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.565 per million British thermal units on the
Nymex yesterday. Futures are up 44 percent from a year ago.  Gas stockpiles  fell 148 billion cubic feet last week to
3.168 trillion, the EIA said yesterday. Supplies were 4.4
percent below year-earlier levels, the widest deficit in 17
months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
