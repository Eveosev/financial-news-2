Progressive Corp. (PGR) , the fourth-
largest U.S. automobile insurer, said profit declined 2.9
percent as the company faced claims from Superstorm Sandy.  Fourth-quarter net income fell to $249.1 million, or 41
cents a share, from $256.7 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier,
the Mayfield Village, Ohio-based company said today in a
statement.  The October storm flooded streets and parking lots,
damaging  230,000 vehicles , mostly in New York and New Jersey,
according to an estimate last month from the National Insurance
Crime Bureau. Natural disasters add pressure to car insurers
that have already faced increased costs for some medical
treatments.  “PGR’s recent results have been challenged by rising loss
severity,” said  Jay Gelb , an analyst at Barclays Plc, in a Jan.
3 note using Progressive’s ticker symbol. Gelb rates the company
overweight and expects it to benefit from rising prices.  The insurer, which reports results monthly, gained 15
percent in the past year through yesterday, compared with the 17
percent gain of the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index. (KIX)   The insurer has increased Internet sales as it competes
with larger rivals including State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co. and  Allstate Corp. (ALL) , which rely more on walk-in
agencies.  Miles traveled in October on U.S. roads rose by 0.3
percent, or 900 million miles, from a year earlier, according to
the most recent monthly  report  from the  Federal Highway
Administration . More miles driven may result in a higher
frequency of collision claims for auto insurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
