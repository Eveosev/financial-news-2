Stocks in Switzerland  were little
changed near a 4 1/2-year high as  China ’s economic growth
accelerated for the first time in two years.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank,
advanced 0.6 percent. Transocean Ltd., the world’s largest
offshore-rig contractor, added 0.8 percent.  Von Roll Holding AG (ROL) 
slid 6.4 percent after forecasting a “significant loss.”  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  fell 0.2 percent to 7,413.54 at
10:34 a.m. in Zurich. The benchmark gauge has still rallied 8.6 
percent  in 2013. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
declined 0.2 percent today.  The  volume of shares  changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was three times higher than the average of the last 30 days,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  China’s gross domestic product advanced 7.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said in Beijing. That compared with the median
economist estimate of 7.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey and
growth of 7.4 percent in the third quarter.  In the U.S., the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
index of  consumer confidence  climbed to 75 this month from 72.9
in December, economists forecast before the report due at 9:55
a.m.  New York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
