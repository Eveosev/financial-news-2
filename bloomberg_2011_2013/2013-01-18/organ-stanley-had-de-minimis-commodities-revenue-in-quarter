Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
biggest brokerage, had “de minimis” commodities revenue in the
fourth quarter.  Fourth-quarter revenue from fixed-income and commodities
sales and trading was $811 million, compared with a $493 million
loss a year earlier, the New York-based company said today.
Commodities revenue was “de minimis,” it said on a conference
call with Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  and Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat.  “Commodities experienced meaningfully lower revenue in a
difficult market,” Porat said on the call.  Commodities value-at-risk, a measure of how much the bank
estimates it might lose in a single day, was $22 million, the
same as in the third quarter, and down from $26 million a year
earlier, Morgan Stanley said on its website.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said on Jan. 16 its net revenue in
commodities were “significantly lower” in the fourth quarter.
Its commodities value at risk was $20 million, down from $26
million a year earlier, it said on its website.  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which previously
dominated commodities trading among Wall Street banks, have lost
ground to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, according to a
Greenwich Associates survey published in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
