China , which produces almost half
the world’s steel, boosted  production  by 3.1 percent last year
as economic expansion spurred demand for roads and railways.  Steel output increased to 716.5 million metric tons in
2012, the National Bureau of Statistics said today. Production
in December climbed 7.7 percent from a year earlier to 57.66
million tons, the bureau said.  It’s the  31st annual increase  in steel production and came
as the world’s second-largest economy expanded 7.8 percent in
2012, according to statistics bureau data released today. China
will spend 650 billion yuan ($105 billion) this year on railway
construction, more than the 631 billion spent last year, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday.  “Steel production this year may grow at a similar pace to
last year,” Hu Yanping, Beijing-based chief analyst with
Custeel.com, said in an e-mailed note today. “The government-
led investments in infrastructure will continue playing a big
role in steel demand.”  Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose for a second day on
expectations the government’s increased investment in railways
will stoke demand for steel. Rebar for delivery in May rose 1.4
percent to 4,002  yuan  a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange. The alloy gained 2 percent this week, the sixth weekly
gain in the last seven weeks.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
