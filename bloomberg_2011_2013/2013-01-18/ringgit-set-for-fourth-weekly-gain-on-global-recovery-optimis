Malaysia’s ringgit headed for a
fourth weekly advance as U.S. economic data that topped
estimates boosted optimism a global recovery is on track.  Housing starts in the world’s largest economy climbed 12.1
percent last month to a 954,000 annual rate, exceeding all
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, while
applications for jobless benefits decreased to 335,000, less
than the 369,000 claims predicted, reports showed yesterday.
Malaysian  inflation  quickened to 1.4 percent in December from
1.3 percent in November, according to a separate poll of
analysts before official figures due on Jan. 23.  “There’s a lot of risk-on sentiment after U.S. data came
in stronger than expected,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-
based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. A pickup in
 China’s economy  “is also helping Asian currencies,” he said.  The ringgit strengthened 0.2 percent today to 3.0098 per
dollar as of 4:05 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 3.0068 earlier, approaching a
Jan. 15 level of 3.0032 that was the strongest since March. The
currency climbed 0.4 percent for the week.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, retreated two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, today to 5 percent.  Gross domestic product  in China expanded 7.9 percent in the
fourth quarter, faster than 7.4 percent in the three months
ended September, according to an official report today.  Malaysian  government bonds  were little changed. The yield
on the 3.418 percent notes maturing in August 2022 was at 3.47
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate decreased two
basis points from a week ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
