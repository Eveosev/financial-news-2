The Chinese government donated $1.3
million in medical equipment to  Costa Rica ’s security ministry,
the Central American country’s government said in a statement.  China, which established diplomatic ties with Costa Rica in
2007, donated medical equipment including ultrasounds, X-rays
and defibrillators, according to today’s statement.  Since diplomatic relations were established between the
countries, China has funded and built a $100 million soccer
stadium in Costa Rica, donated more than 200 police vehicles to
the security ministry and partially financed the construction of
a police academy in eastern Limon province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
