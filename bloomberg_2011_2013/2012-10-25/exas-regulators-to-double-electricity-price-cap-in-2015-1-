The Public Utility Commission of
 Texas  voted to double the price cap for wholesale electricity in
2015 to spur investment in new generation.  The commission approved the increase 3-0 in a meeting today
in Austin, Texas. Prices on the state’s main electricity grid,
operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, are
currently limited at $4,500 per megawatt-hour, according to the
commission.  The cap, which is typically reached during the hottest days
or a sudden shortage of supplies, will be raised to $5,000 a
megawatt-hour on June 1, 2013, $7,000 a megawatt-hour on June 1,
2014, and $9,000 a megawatt-hour on June 1, 2015, according to
the approved  proposal .  Generation reserves may fall below the amount needed to
prevent blackouts in three years, according to an Oct. 22  report 
by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, whose grid serves
85 percent of the state’s electricity demand.  “We are behind the eight ball,” Chairman Donna Nelson
said at today’s meeting “We need to do something to send the
right signal to the market.”  State regulators are considering redesigning the Texas
market, where generators are only paid for the electricity they
produce. A slump in gas and power prices have reduced
investments in new generation projects, the commission has said  Nelson said the cap increase was an “interim” step and
she supports setting a required generation reserve target to
prevent blackouts.  Generator owners including Energy Future Holdings Corp.,
 NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  and  Calpine Corp. (CPN)  supported lifting the price
cap. Lawmakers, cities and industrial and consumer groups said
the increase may lead to rate increases for customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
