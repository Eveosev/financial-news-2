Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  Chief
Executive Officer  Brady Dougan  said the bank’s target of
reaching a return on equity of 15 percent still was reachable.  “So we think as we continue to reduce costs, continue to
optimize our capital and we continue to have momentum on the
client side we think we will be able to improve our return on
equity towards that 15 percent target, so we still do believe
that’s something that’s achievable,” Dougan said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in Zurich today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
