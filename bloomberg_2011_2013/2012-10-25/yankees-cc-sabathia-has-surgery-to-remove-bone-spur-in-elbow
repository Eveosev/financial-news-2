CC Sabathia is expected to be ready
for the start of the 2013 Major League Baseball season after
undergoing arthroscopic surgery to remove a small bone spur from
his pitching elbow, the New York Yankees said.  The 32-year-old left-hander met with specialist James Andrews yesterday in Birmingham,  Alabama , after experiencing
pain in his elbow between starts.  Sabathia had a 15-6 record with a 3.38 earned run average
in 28 starts this season. He lost the Yankeesâ€™ postseason finale
against the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship
Series on Oct. 18, allowing five earned runs and 11 hits over 3
2/3 innings.  Sabathia was on the disabled list with elbow swelling from
Aug. 9-23. The New York Daily News reported this week that
Sabathia has pitched with a bone spur in his elbow since he was
with the Cleveland Indians, the team he played for from 2001-08
before being traded to  Milwaukee . Sabathia joined the Yankees in
2009 and is 74-29 with a 3.22 ERA in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
