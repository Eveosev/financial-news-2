Benso Oil Palm Plantation Ltd. (BOPP) , a
Ghanaian processor of  palm oil , gained the most in more than
eight months after saying profit increased in the nine months
through Sept. 30.  The stock rose 10.3 percent to 1.6 cedis as of 1:37 p.m. in
the capital, Accra, the biggest increase since Feb. 1.  “It was in reaction to the third-quarter results released
by the company yesterday,” Hilary Lomotey, a trader at NewWorld
Securities Ltd. in Accra, said by phone. “We still expect
demand for the shares in coming days on this performance.”  The company, also known as BOPP, said net income climbed by
half to 10.9 million cedis ($5.8 million). Revenue increased to
34.7 million cedis from 29.7 million cedis a year earlier, the
company, based in Ghana’s port city of Takoradi, said yesterday.  Singapore-based  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  acquired 88
percent of BOPP in March last year after buying the 58 percent
stake of  Unilever Ghana Ltd. and shares from other
institutional investors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
