quarter increase, much better than expectations,” Ishaq Siddiqi, a market strategist at ETX Capital in London, wrote in

week, according to separate data.  Unilever gained 2 percent to 2,310 pence, the largest

company reported third-quarter revenue growth that beat
estimates, led by demand for personal-care products in  emerging
markets .  So-called underlying sales increased 5.9 percent from a
year earlier, the London- and Rotterdam-based maker of Axe body

quarter results from industry peer  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) 
beat estimates.  WPP dropped 2.3 percent to 789.5 pence, falling for a fifth
day. The advertising company cut its full-year sales growth
target for the second time in two months as clients in  North
America  and Europe reduced spending.  Revenue growth  for the year
will be 2.5 percent to 3 percent, down from an earlier forecast

falling 6 percent to 235.4 pence.  Asos Plc (ASC) , the U.K.’s largest online-only fashion retailer,

its  recommendation  to add from buy, citing “an exceptional
run” by the shares, which had more than doubled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
