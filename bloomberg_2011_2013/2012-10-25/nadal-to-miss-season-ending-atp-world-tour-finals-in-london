Rafael Nadal  withdrew from next
month’s season-ending ATP World Tour Finals as he continues to
recovery from a knee injury.  World No. 4 Nadal, 26, has not played since June, when he
lost to Lukas Rosol in the second round at Wimbledon. The 11-
time Grand Slam singles champion will also miss next week’s
Paris Masters.  “It doesn’t come as a surprise,” Nadal, who won his
record seventh French Open title in June, said on the ATP World
Tour’s  website . “I will hopefully resume my tennis practice
soon since I am making good progress with my recovery from
injury.”  The Spaniard is scheduled to play in an exhibition tournament
in  Abu Dhabi  in December. The event is a warm-up for the Australian
Open, which starts Jan. 14 in Melbourne.  The top eight men’s players after the Paris Masters qualify
for the ATP World Tour Finals, which will be played Nov. 5-12 in
London.  Nadal’s withdrawal will open a place for the ninth-ranked
player, currently Serbia’s Janko Tipsarevic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
