Norway ’s energy and water
directorate NVE will increase monitoring of Nordic electricity
trading on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo, it said.  The regulator will set up a new department to oversee
electricity trading starting Jan. 1 in a bid to comply with
regulations laid out in the EU’s so-called third energy package,
it said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  The bloc, of which Norway is not a member, adopted a
legislative package to open up internal gas and electricity
markets in 2009 to promote free trading across the union. It
also stipulated that each country should have an independent
energy market watchdog.  NVE’s measure, carried out at its own initiative, comes
ahead of proposed amendments from the country’s ministry of
petroleum and energy to laws governing how the EU legislation
should be implemented, it said.  NVE monitors  Nord Pool Spot , the world’s largest
multinational power exchange, where 370 buyers and sellers from
20 countries match supply and demand and price electricity for
the following 24 hours in Norway,  Sweden ,  Finland  and  Denmark ,
as well as Estonia and  Lithuania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
