Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the Canadian
crude producer planning to more than triple output in the next
decade, said quarterly profit slumped 43 percent on a risk-
management loss as it spent more to expand oil-sands operations.  Net income fell to C$289 million ($292 million), or 38
cents a share, from C$510 million, or 67 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement distributed by
Business Wire today. Excluding one-time items, per-share profit
was 57 cents, matching the average of 17  analysts’ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings fell due to an unrealized after-tax risk-
management loss of C$218 million, compared with a gain of C$283
million a year earlier. Capital investment at its producing oil
sands properties rose 52 percent to C$346 million.  Cenovus is expanding bitumen extraction at its Foster Creek
and Christina Lake operations, while drilling test wells at the
Telephone Lake and Grand Rapids sites. Cenovus said in an
 October investor presentation  it’s planning to reach production
of about 500,000 barrels a day by 2021, more than three times
current output. Total oil production rose 28 percent to 171,350
barrels a day in the latest quarter.  Cenovus owns stakes in two refineries with Phillips 66 in
the U.S. and benefits from expanding profit margins for refined
products such as diesel and jet fuel. The company recently
revamped its Wood River refinery in  Illinois  to be able to
process more heavy oil.  By pairing production with refining, Cenovus is able to
hedge itself against some of the risk of crude-price
fluctuations, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ferguson has said.  Oil futures averaged $92.20 a barrel in the quarter, up 3
percent from a year earlier in trading on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange.  Cenovus gained 0.5 percent to C$34 yesterday in Toronto.
