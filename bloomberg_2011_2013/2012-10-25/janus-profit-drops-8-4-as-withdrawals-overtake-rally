  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , owner of
the Janus, Perkins and Intech fund families, said third-quarter
profit fell 8.4 percent as a 13th consecutive quarter of
investor withdrawals offset gains from rising global stocks.  Net income decreased to $25.1 million, or 14 cents a share,
from $27.4 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier, the Denver-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts had expected
earnings of 15 cents a share, according to the average of seven
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil has worked to
diversify the firm’s offerings away from traditional stock funds
to reverse client withdrawals. He hired former Bear Stearns Cos.
executive Richard R. Lindsey in September to create absolute-
return products, and struck a deal in August with Tokyo-based
Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co., which agreed to buy as much as 20
percent of Janus shares, invest $2 billion in the firm’s bond
funds and help distribute Janus funds in  Japan .  “While headwinds persist in the equity franchise, outflows
decelerated,” as investors put money into bond funds
quantitative strategies, Daniel Fannon, a San Francisco-based
analyst with Jefferies & Co., wrote today in a note to clients.  Fixed-income assets increased to $25.6 billion, or 16
percent of total assets, up from 13 percent a year ago.  Client Withdrawals  Investors withdrew $2 billion from Janus in the three
months ended Sept. 30. Assets increased 3.8 percent to $158.2
billion, helped by an 6.2 percent increase in the MSCI ACWI
Index of global stocks in the three months ended Sept. 30.  Revenue declined 12 percent to $209 million compared with a
year earlier. The lower revenue reflects Janus’s policy of
adjusting fund fees lower or higher based on performance over
trailing periods of 12 to 36 months. Expenses declined 1 percent
to $161.1 million.  Janus fell 2.5 percent to $8.19 at 11:31 a.m. in  New York 
trading. The shares had risen 33 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with the 18 percent gain by the Standard &
Poor’s 20-company index of asset managers and custody banks.  Janus funds that beat the majority of their peers over the
past year, as measured by research firm Lipper, held 41 percent
of assets, up from 16 percent a year ago. Funds that beat their
peers over three years held 32 percent of assets, compared with
67 percent a year ago.  “We’ve seen a substantial improvement this year” in
 investment performance , Weil said today in a conference call
with analysts.  Net income was reduced 6 cents per share in the quarter by
mark-to-market losses on investments, and 1 cent by an
intangible asset impairment related to the redemption of a sub-
advised account.  Janus repurchased 773,300 shares of common stock in the
third quarter at an average price of $8.12 a share and a total
cost of $6.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
