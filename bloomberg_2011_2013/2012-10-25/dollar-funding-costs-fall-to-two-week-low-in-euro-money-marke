The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for the second day to the lowest in more
than two weeks, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 23 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:25 a.m. in
 London , from minus 24 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The measure is the lowest since Oct. 5.  The one-year basis swap was 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 25.5 yesterday.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held near the lowest since August 2007. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as
the Euribor-OIS spread, was 11.3 basis points.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was little changed
at 0.089 percent yesterday. The Eonia swap, an estimate of
average overnight borrowing costs over the next three months,
held at nine basis points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday to 245 billion euros ($318 billion) from 247 billion
euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
