Drax Group Plc (DRX)  raised 190 million
pounds ($306 million) in a share placement and is seeking 500
million pounds of new financing deals to change Western Europe’s
largest coal-fired power station into one fueled by biomass.  The company placed 9.99 percent of its existing share
capital at 520 pence a share today in a sale managed by Deutsche
Bank AG and UBS AG, according to a statement. Drax exceeded the
amount it targeted to raise by 10 million pounds.  Drax plans to spend 650 million pounds to 700 million
pounds to fund the plant conversion, aided by a new 100 million-
pound loan and a larger credit line from banks, the Selby,
England-based company said in an earlier statement. It signed a
100 million-pound term loan with Prudential M&G UK Companies
Financing Fund in July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Drax is converting the power station to take advantage of
higher margins on biomass fuel compared with coal, the company
said.  “The path is now clear for transformation of Drax from the
largest coal generator in the U.K. into one of the largest
renewable power plants in  Europe ,” according to the statement.  The shares will be listed on the London Stock Exchange by
Oct. 30 pending the Financial Services Authority’s approval,
Drax said. Invesco Asset Management Ltd. and Schroder Investment
Management Ltd. are among investors supporting the share
placement, the company said earlier today. The new shares will
rank equally with the existing stock and are eligible for
dividends.  Drax  surged  as much as 28 pence, or 5.4 percent, to 548
pence in London at 4:24 p.m., the biggest intraday gain since
July 26. The company has a market value of 2 billion pounds.  Raising Loans  Drax is seeking to increase its revolving credit facility
to about 400 million pounds from 310 million pounds and push its
maturity to 2016 from 2014. The outstanding revolving credit
facility pays interest of 200 basis points more than the  London 
interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show. Under a revolver,
money can be borrowed again once it’s repaid. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The company raised 108 million pounds in 2009 to help
maintain its investment-grade credit rating as a downgrade to
junk would have increased costs. Drax has since restructured its
business and trading arrangements to allow it to operate with
either an investment grade or sub-investment grade rating,
according to today’s earlier statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
