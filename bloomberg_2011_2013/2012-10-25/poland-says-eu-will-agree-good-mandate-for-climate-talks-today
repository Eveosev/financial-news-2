The European Union has almost
completed discussions on its negotiating position for the United
Nations climate talks in Doha, Qatar, next month and should
reach a “good mandate” today, Poland said.  “The mandate is 99 percent completed, we still need to
discuss a couple of points including Assigned Amount Units,”
Polish Environment Minister Marcin Korolec told reporters in
Luxembourg today. “The presidency is aware of what  member
states  need and what language would be acceptable for
everyone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
