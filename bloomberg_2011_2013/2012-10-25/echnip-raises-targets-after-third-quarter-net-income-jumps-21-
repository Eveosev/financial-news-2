Technip SA (TEC) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, reported a 21 percent increase in
third-quarter profit and raised targets for the full year after
oil companies pushed ahead with projects.  Net income  rose to 146.3 million euros ($190 million), in
line with analyst expectations, from 121 million euros a year
earlier, the Paris-based company said today in a statement.
Sales gained 23 percent to 2.08 billion euros.  Order intake was better than expected for the quarter at
2.85 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer Thierry Pilenko said “growth in
subsea was particularly strong.” The business had the most
momentum in the offshore areas of the North Sea,  Brazil  and the
Gulf of Mexico, he said.  Technip raised full-year financial targets published in
February. It’s seeking revenue “towards” 8 billion euros
compared with a previous range of of 7.65 billion to 8 billion
euros. The company expects a subsea operating margin of around
15 percent and a margin for onshore-offshore of 6.5 percent to 7
percent.  The subsea operating margin was 15.1 percent in the third
quarter, compared with 16.9 percent a year earlier. The combined
onshore/offshore margin was 7.1 percent, steady from a year
earlier.  Technip had an order backlog of 13.5 billion euros at the
end of the last quarter, compared with 12.7 billion euros at the
end of the previous one.  Europe’s largest oilfield-services provider is  Italy ’s
