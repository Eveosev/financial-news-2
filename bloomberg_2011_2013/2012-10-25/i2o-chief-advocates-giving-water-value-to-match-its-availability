Governments and regulators should
give water a price that correlates more realistically to its
availability, said the chief executive officer of I20 Water
Ltd., whose clients include  Veolia Water (VIE)  and United Utilities.  “We need governments and regulators to give water a real
economic value and ensure that the true cost of water is passed
on to consumers and customers, with safeguards for the poorest
rather than subsidizing it through the tax system and ignoring
the environmental costs,” Adam Kingdon said in Green Futures
magazine.  An added benefit to giving water an economic value “is
that its price correlates to its availability, varying
significantly from one water resource zone to another,” the I2O
co-founder said. “This ensures that incentives are greatest in
areas where water is most scarce.”  The Southampton, U.K.-based company helps develop solutions
for pressure management in water networks including utilities to
reduce leakage and operational expenses. To solve “the massive
challenges faced by the water sector, we need regulation that
encourages innovation,” Kingdon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
