Ethanol futures fell for a fourth
day in Chicago on lower demand for the biofuel to be blended
into gasoline.  Prices extended the longest streak of losses in six weeks
after an Energy Department report showed  consumption  of
gasoline, with which ethanol is mixed, slid 2.7 percent last
week to the lowest level since March 16. Gasoline today
rebounded from the longest decline since futures began trading
in 1986.  “We’re stuck,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL
FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “Gasoline demand has capped
things. It keeps ethanol under control.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery dropped 2.2 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $2.38 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Oct. 16 and the longest string of losses
since Sept. 12. Futures have gained 8 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf decreased
2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.435 a gallon and in New York the
additive sank 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.45, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago fell 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.385 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 0.5
cent to $2.545.  Gasoline for November delivery jumped 7.34 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $2.6764 a gallon in  New York . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Discount Widens  Ethanol’s  discount  to the motor fuel expanded to 29.64
cents from 20.1 cents yesterday. Gasoline traded at a premium of
99.8 cents to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, the Energy Department said
in yesterday’s report, up from 90 percent in the week ended Oct.
12 and down from a 2012 high of 95 percent the previous week.  Corn for December delivery dropped 12.5 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $7.42 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 33 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, fell 3.9 percent to 3.75 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
