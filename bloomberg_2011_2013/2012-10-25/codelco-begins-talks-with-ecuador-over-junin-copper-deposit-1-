Chile ’s Codelco, the world’s biggest
copper producer, is in talks with  Ecuador  to jointly develop the
Junin copper deposit, Chairman Gerardo Jofre said today.  “We are at the beginning of talks with them,” Jofre said
during a visit with Ecuador’s President  Rafael Correa  to
Codelco’s Gaby copper mine in northern Chile. Codelco has spent
$4 million on exploration targets in Ecuador and plans to invest
between $10 million and $30 million in exploration over the next
four years, the company said in a statement today.  Jofre and Chile’s Mining Minister Hernan de Solminihac gave
Correa a tour of the Gaby mine as the Ecuadorean leader seeks to
build support at home for his country’s nascent mining industry.
The Junin deposit in northern Ecuador contains enough copper and
molybdenum to rival the biggest mines in Chile and Peru,
according to Ecuador’s Mining Chamber.  Ecuador seeks “socially and environmentally responsible”
mining investment, Correa said in a speech at the mine today.
The Andean country has “lost too much time” tapping its
mineral resources and can use profits from the sale of metals to
alleviate poverty, he said.  A deal with Ecuador’s state mining company  Enami  would give
Codelco access to its first large-scale copper deposit outside
Chile. Codelco spent about a decade exploring in northern  Brazil 
and  Mexico .  To contact the reporters on this story:
