China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to its lowest level in a week, after a leading
gauge for the nation’s economy rose at a slower pace.  Guizhou Panjiang Refined Coal Co. and  Yangquan Coal
Industry Group Co. (600348)  paced losses by energy producers.  Jiangsu
Yueda Investment Co. (600805) , which makes cars with Kia Motors Corp.,
dropped 4.9 percent after profit declined. Chongqing Iron &
Steel Co. jumped 10 percent after buying assets from its parent.  “The major concern is about earnings,” said Wei Wei, an
analyst at West  China  Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “The market
will be range-bound before earnings improve.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.7 percent to 2,101.58
at the close, the lowest level since Oct. 16. About three stocks
retreated for each that rose on the measure. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
fell 0.7 percent to 2,291.24. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong dropped 0.5
percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 0.3 percent in
 New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite has rebounded 4.9 percent since
reaching a three-year low on Sept. 26 on expectations regulators
will introduce measures to stabilize the market ahead of a once-
in-a-decade power transition of the Communist Party. The
Shanghai gauge is down 4.5 percent this year and trades at 9.9
times estimated earnings for this year, compared with the 17.8
average since Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data  in 2006.  Leading Indicator  The Conference Board’s leading index increased 0.3 percent
from August to 241.2, the New York-based research group said in
a statement today, citing a preliminary reading. That compared
with a 1.7 percent gain in the previous month.  “The near-term outlook continues to be uncertain,” Andrew
Polk, an economist with the Conference Board in Beijing, said in
the statement today. The gauge’s “very modest pickup in
September, due in large part to a heavy drag from real estate,
points to an economy that is unlikely to pick up rapidly in the
near term,” he said.  A measure of 25 energy stocks sank 1.4 percent today, the
biggest loss among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups.  Guizhou Panjiang slumped 9.3 percent to 15.46  yuan , its
biggest decline in a year. Net income fell 10 percent from a
year earlier in the first nine months, the coal producer said in
an exchange statement.  Coal Earnings  Yangquan Coal fell 2.7 percent to 13.95 yuan after saying
profit for the first nine months dropped 27 percent.  Jiangsu Yueda retreated 4.9 percent to 9.26 yuan after
saying profit for the first nine months decreased 13 percent.  Out of 935 companies in the Shanghai Composite, 161 have
reported third-quarter earnings with profits falling an average
4.5 percent from a year earlier, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. That compared with a 0.6 percent profit growth in the
second quarter, the data showed. Listed companies are required
to release third-quarter results by the end of the month.  China’s industrial-production growth will pick up this
quarter,  Zhu Hongren , chief engineer at the Ministry of Industry
and  Information Technology , said at a briefing today.  A preliminary reading of a purchasing managers’ index
released yesterday by HSBC Holdings Plc and  Markit Economics 
indicated fewer Chinese manufacturers are seeing deteriorating
conditions in the sector than in the past two months. The
measure follows government reports last week showing industrial
production rebounded in September and retail sales surged.  Steelmakers Rally  Chongqing Steel jumped by the maximum 10 percent to 2.71
yuan. The steelmaker plans to acquire assets from parent for
16.9 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) by issuing shares, cash and
assuming liabilities, according to an exchange statement.  Angang Steel Co. rose 2.3 percent to 3.61 yuan even after
the steelmaker said yesterday it posted a third-quarter loss.
Hebei Iron & Steel Co. added 1.7 percent to 2.47 yuan. Wuhan
Iron & Steel Co. gained 2 percent to 2.55 yuan.  “Fourth-quarter profit at steelmakers may improve under
current steel prices and raw-material costs,” said Shirley Zhao, an analyst with Mirae Securities Co. in  Hong Kong .
“Investors are also picking up bargain stocks as steelmakers
are very cheap given their price-to-book ratios.”  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 16.6
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.2. About 8.5
billion shares changed hands in the gauge yesterday, 10 percent
higher than the daily average in 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
