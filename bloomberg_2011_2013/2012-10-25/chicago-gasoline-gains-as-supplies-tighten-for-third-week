Chicago gasoline strengthened after
motor  fuel supplies  tightened in the area for a third week and a
unit at BP’s Whiting refinery remained shut.  Stockpiles of gasoline in the region declined 193,000
barrels to 47.4 million, the lowest level since June 8, the
Energy Department reported yesterday. The smallest of three
crude-processing units at Whiting has been shut since Oct. 18.
With a capacity of 420,000 barrels, the refinery is the largest
in the Midwestern region, known as PADD 2.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in Chicago rose 3.5 cents to trade at a  discount  of 16 cents a
gallon below futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:24
p.m. That’s the first advance in three days.  Prompt delivery 
gained 6.43 cents to $2.4723 a gallon.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. is still undertaking maintenance
activities at its 114,000-barrel-a-day Detroit refinery. The
plant shut Sept. 7 for a planned maintenance turnaround that
will integrate the upgrader to process heavy oil. Units are
starting from Oct. 11 to Nov. 5 as part of the turnaround
process, a regulatory filings shows.  Ultra-low sulfur  diesel fuel in the Group 3, or
midcontinent area, spanning from the Dakotas to  Ohio , weakened 2
cents to 3 cents a barrel over heating oil futures, the
narrowest gap since May. The same product strengthened by 0.5
cent to a 5-cent premium in  Chicago .  Demand for  distillate fuels , which include diesel and
heating oil, dropped by 353,000 barrels to 3.53 million in the
week ended Oct. 19, the Energy Deparment reported.  New York  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor gained 0.5 cent to 1.75 cents over futures at
3:39 p.m., the first rise in three days. Prompt delivery rose
7.84 cents to $2.6939.  Fuel shipments across the Atlantic Ocean to the U.S. are
poised to remain unchanged for the two weeks to Nov. 7,
according to the median estimate in a survey of six shipbrokers
and traders who specialize in transporting gasoline.  Traders and oil companies booked 19 tankers along the route
and 17 more will probably be hired, according to the survey.
That’s the same as in last week’s survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
