Oil was little changed after rising
for the first time in six days in New York, ending the longest
losing streak since May, on signs U.S. growth is accelerating.  Futures fluctuated after rising 0.4 percent yesterday
following reports showing U.S. jobless claims dropped last week
and durable goods orders gained. The Commerce Department will
probably report economic growth accelerated 1.8 percent in the
third quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “Let’s see if we get a little bit of an uptick in the
number-one user” of crude, said  Jonathan Barratt , the chief
executive officer of Barratt’s Bulletin, a commodity newsletter
in Sydney. “Anything more than 2 percent growth might launch a
bit of a rally.”  Crude for December delivery was at $86.01 a barrel, down 4
cents in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 10:44 a.m. in Tokyo. It rose 32 cents yesterday to settle at
$86.05. Prices are down 13 percent this year. Prices have
declined 4.3 percent this week, set for a second weekly drop.  Brent oil for December settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was at $108.53 a barrel, up 4 cents. The
European benchmark crude increased 64 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
end the session at $108.49 yesterday. It was the first gain in
eight days, ending the longest losing streak since July 2010.  Brent was at a premium of $22.52 to New York-traded West
Texas Intermediate grade, up from $22.44 yesterday.  Hurricane Sandy  Unemployment claims decreased by 23,000 to 369,000 in the
week ended Oct. 20 from a revised 392,000 the prior period, the
Labor Department reported yesterday in  Washington . The median
forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
drop in claims to 370,000.  Demand for durable goods climbed 9.9 percent last month, a
Commerce Department report showed. The median forecast of 77
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 7.5 percent gain
in orders.  The U.S. economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
third quarter after expanding at a 1.3 percent pace the prior
three months, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hurricane Sandy, a Category 2 storm, is on a path that may
threaten anywhere from the mid-Atlantic states starting Oct. 28
to southern New England later in the week, depending on the
track it takes, said Gary Best, a meteorologist for Hometown
Forecast Services Inc. in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Refiners in the region, which includes the New York Harbor,
the delivery point for Nymex futures, can process 1.29 million
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  As of 8 p.m. New York time, Sandy was located 35 miles (55
kilometers) southeast of Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas, with
top winds of 100 miles per hour, a Category 2 hurricane on the
five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the hurricane
center in Miami. It was moving north-northwest at 17 mph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
