Ghana ’s three-year bond yields may
rise at an auction of 500 million cedis ($267 million) of the
notes as the currency is expected to weaken at the end of the
year, Barclays Plc said.  The securities may yield 21 percent, Jacob Brobbey, a bond
trader at the Accra-based unit of Barclays, said by phone
yesterday. Foreign investors may take up more than 80 percent of
the sale, he said. The  Bank of Ghana  will hold the auction at
2:30 p.m. local time.  The rates on 534 million cedis of bonds Ghana sold on May
23 have dropped to 19 percent from 24 percent at the auction,
according to prices from Standard Chartered Plc’s Ghana unit. In
February, 219.7 million cedis of the notes were sold at a yield
of 14.99 percent. The cedi has weakened 12.6 percent this year
to 1.8750 per dollar as of 10:10 a.m. in Accra.  “Foreign investors will be calculating the cedi’s
performance into their bids,” Barclays’s Brobbey said. “I
expect the cedi to gain during the offer period and then weaken
thereafter to 1.90 per dollar by the end of the year on dollar
demand by traders to meet year-end sales.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
