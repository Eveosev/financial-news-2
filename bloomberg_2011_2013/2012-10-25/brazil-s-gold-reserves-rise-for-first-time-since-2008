Brazil  increased its gold reserves
for the first time since December 2008 at a time when investors
raised holdings in exchange-traded products to a record.  Brazil’s holdings expanded 1.7 tons last month to 35.3
tons, data on the International Monetary Fund’s website showed.
Turkey’s holdings increased 6.8 tons and Ukraine added 0.3 ton.
Brazil’s central bank doesn’t comment on the policy of its
reserve composition, it said in an e-mail.  Central banks have been expanding reserves after the metal
climbed the past 11 years and investors held a record tons in
bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  this month, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Nations bought 254.2 tons in the
first half of 2012 and may add close to 500 tons for the year,
the London-based World Gold Council said in August.  “We expect strong buying by central banks to continue,”
said Dan Smith, a commodities analyst at Standard Chartered Plc
in London. “They will be encouraged by lower prices and
continued worries about inflation and currency risks.”  Turkey ’s bullion holdings have increased due to it
accepting gold in its reserve requirements from commercial
banks.  Russia ’s reserves fell by 2.2 tons, Belarus by 1.5 tons,
Czech Republic by 0.3 ton and Kazakhstan by 0.4 ton, the IMF
data show.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.5 percent to $1,710.70
an ounce by 6:15 p.m. in London and has gained 9.4 percent this
year. It’s averaged $1,751.03 so far this month, the third-
highest ever.  “If a central bank like Brazil decides to enter the gold
market, it will keep buying for a longer time horizon until an
optimal share of gold holdings to total asset is reached,” said
Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management in
Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. “This constant demand is price
supportive.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
