Team Sky, led by  Tour de France 
champion Bradley Wiggins, said race coach Bobby Julich left
after admitting doping as a professional rider in the late
1990s.  The American joined the British team at the start of the
2011 season and worked with riders including Chris Froome, who
finished second to Wiggins at this year’s Tour.  Julich, 40, left Sky after the team reiterated its position
last week that it wouldn’t work with “those with an involvement
in doping, whether past or present.” The Texan, riding for
Cofidis, finished third in the Tour in 1998, the year that the
Festina team was kicked out because of a doping scandal. Julich
never finished in the top 10 after that year.  “Bobby has shown courage in admitting to the errors he
made long before his time with Team Sky,” team principal Dave
Brailsford said today in a statement on the squad’s website.
“It’s important to emphasize that there have been no doubts
about his work with us or his approach as a coach. He has done a
good job and been a good colleague.”  The sport is still dealing with the fallout from the
decision by its governing body, the International Cycling Union,
not to appeal the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency’s ruling to strip
 Lance Armstrong  of his record seven Tour de France titles and
ban him from competition in sanctioned events after he declined
to contest doping allegations. Armstrong, 41, has denied
performance-enhancing drug use and said he never failed a drug
test.  To contact the reporter on this story:
