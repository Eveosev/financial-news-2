Heavy rain in  Argentina ’s main
agricultural area known as the Pampas is delaying soy and corn
planting, the Buenos Aires Cereal Exchange said today.  Corn planting is 18 percent less than it was a year
earlier, the exchange said. Corn farmers in Argentina, the
world’s second-largest exporter of the grain, have planted 37
percent of the 2012-2013 crop’s estimated area of 3.4 million
hectares, the exchange said today in its weekly report published
on its website. The U.S. is the world’s largest corn exporter.  Soy planting is 4 percent less than it was a year ago. Soy
farmers have planted 2 percent of the estimated planting area.
Producers will plant 19.7 million hectares of soybeans in the
2012/2013 season that started this month, up from about 18.9
million in the prior season, the exchange said.  Planting delays in both grains stem from rain in the main
area of the country known as the Pampas. In the Pampas, average
accumulated water peaked at 300 millimeters (11.81 inches) and
“excess soil moisture hinders fieldwork,” the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
