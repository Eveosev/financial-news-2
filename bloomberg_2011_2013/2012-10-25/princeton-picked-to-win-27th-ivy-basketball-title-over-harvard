Princeton University  is the near-
unanimous pick to win its record 27th  Ivy League  men’s
basketball title this season in a poll of media representatives
who regularly cover the eight-team conference.  Harvard University , the defending champion whose sports
program has been hit by a cheating investigation, was second, a
year after its first berth in 66 years in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association championship tournament.  Princeton received 16 of the 17 first-place votes and 134
points in the balloting, released today on the league’s website.
Harvard, in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , was second with 109 points
and the other first-place vote, followed by  Columbia University 
in New York City, with 90 points.  The Tigers (20-12, 10-4 Ivy League) from Princeton,  New
Jersey , finished third last season behind Harvard and the
 University of Pennsylvania . They are led by an all-senior front
court -- forward Ian Hummer, who had a team-high 16.1 points and
7.3 rebounds per game last season, and Mack Darrow and center
Brendan Connolly.  Harvard (26-5, 12-2 Ivy League) had the school’s first Top
25 ranking last season and lost to Vanderbilt University 79-70
in the first full round of the NCAA tournament.  Crimson co-captains  Kyle Casey  and Brandyn Curry were part
of a school investigation into 125 students suspected of
academic misconduct on a take-home final exam this year,
according to  Sports Illustrated . Neither player is on the
current roster on the team’s website.  Poll Results  Cornell University  in Ithaca, New York, finished fourth in
the poll with 80 points, followed by Penn of Philadelphia (74),
Yale University of New Haven, Connecticut (55),  Brown University 
of Providence, Rhode Island (50) and Dartmouth College of
Hanover, New Hampshire (20).  The only conference in college basketball’s top level
without a year-end playoff, the Ivy League has won two NCAA
tournament games since 1999. Athletic directors rejected a plan
this year to create a two-round playoff that would determine
which team fills its automatic bid to the NCAA’s 68-team
tournament.  Princeton has won at least a share of the Ivy title a
league-record 26 times since 1957, according to the Princeton-
based league’s media guide. Penn is next with 25, followed by
Yale and Cornell with four apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
