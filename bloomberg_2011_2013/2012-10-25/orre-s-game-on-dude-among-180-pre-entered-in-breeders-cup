Major League Baseball executive  Joe Torre ’s Game on Dude is among the 180 thoroughbred race horses
pre-entered in the 29th Breeders’ Cup Championships.  The 5-year-old gelding, trained by  Bob Baffert , finished
second last year in the $5 million  Breeders’ Cup Classic , the
richest horse race in North America. Game on Dude has won nine
of 20 starts and has earned nearly $3 million.  Game on Dude is the early favorite at 5-2, with Royal Delta,
trained by Bill Mott, at 6-1, according to Mike Watchmaker, the
national handicapper for the Daily Racing Form.  The 15-race championship series will be run over Nov. 2-3
at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia,  California , with more than $25
million paid out in purses.  Besides Game on Dude and Royal Delta, 12 other horses have
been pre-entered in the Classic for a full field, including
Dullahan, Flat Out, Handsome Mike, Nonios, Ron the Greek, To
Honor and Serve, Alpha, Brilliant Speed, Fort Larned, Mucho
Macho Man, Pool Play and Richard’s Kid.  Royal Delta, the winner of last year’s Ladies Classic, is
returning to defend her title, although the filly may enter the
Classic to race against male competitors on Nov. 3.  For the first time, all 2-year-olds will be racing without
the use of Lasix, a medication used to control bleeding in the
lungs.  Santa Anita is hosting the Breeders’ Cup for the sixth time.
Six races will be run on the first day, highlighted by the
Ladies’ Classic, and nine, including the Classic, on the
following day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
