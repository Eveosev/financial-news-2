CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures market, said third-quarter profit fell 31 percent as
trading in interest-rate contracts, its largest asset class,
declined the same amount.  Net income dropped to $218 million, or 66 cents a share,
from $316 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier, Chicago-
based CME said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.
Excluding a $16 million income tax provision related to the
company’s joint-venture with S&P Dow Jones Indices, profit was
70 cents per share, exceeding the average estimate of 69 cents
in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Average daily volume and the amount of active trades, known
as open interest, declined at CME Group in the quarter compared
with a year ago,  Richard Repetto , an analyst at Sandler O’Neill
& Partners LP, said in a note to clients earlier this month. He
expected revenue to decline 13.9 percent on the lower volume and
because the joint-venture shifts some operating revenue into
non-operating income.  Revenue fell 22 percent to $683 million last quarter, from
$874 million a year ago, the company said.  CME Group  shares  have risen 5.2 percent over the past year
through yesterday, when  they  gained 0.1 percent to $56.55 in New
York.  (CME Group will hold a conference call for analysts and
investors at 8:30 a.m. New York time. To listen, access the
