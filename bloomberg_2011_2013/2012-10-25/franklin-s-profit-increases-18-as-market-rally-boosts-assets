Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , manager of
the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, reported declines in
fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and operating income as
redemptions from stock mutual funds hurt fees.  Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 decreased 1.1
percent to $1.8 billion and operating income declined 9.5
percent to $622.7 million, the  San Mateo , California-based
company said today in a statement. The shares fell as much as
2.8 percent.  Fees for managing investments decreased 4.2 percent to $1.1
billion as investors pulled $2.3 billion from Franklin’s
international and domestic stock funds. Chief Executive Officer
Gregory Johnson has urged investors to put more money into stock
funds, arguing that in the coming years equities are likely to
deliver better returns than they did in the past decade.  Revenue was “below expectations mostly due to modest
performance fees,” Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies &
Co., said in a research note. “With the exception of hybrid
funds, flows were weaker than expected across the board.”  Shares Fall  Franklin fell 1.8 percent to $126.15 at 11:18 a.m. in  New
York . The  shares  advanced 34 percent this year through
yesterday’s close, compared with an increase of 18 percent for
the 20-member  Standard & Poor’s  index of custody banks and asset
managers.  Firmwide, clients added $2.9 billion as bond funds added
new money.  Net income  increased 18 percent to $492.1 million, or
$2.31 a share, from $416 million, or $1.88, a year earlier.
Franklin’s non-operating income for the quarter included a gain
of $64.1 million related to investments in its funds compared
with a loss of $116.5 million a year earlier.  “Although the flow environment remains challenging, when I
look across the company, I’m encouraged by the fact that we
continue to have success attracting flows in asset classes that
are in favor,” Johnson said in recorded remarks posted on the
firm’s website.  Investors withdrew $82.6 billion from U.S. mutual funds
that buy domestic stocks this year through September, while
adding $18.6 billion to  international equity funds , according to
data compiled by Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)   BlackRock’s Earnings   BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest asset manager, said
clients redeemed a net $55 billion in the third quarter, even
with deposits of $20.5 billion into equity exchange-traded
funds. BlackRock said an institutional investor pulled more than
$72 billion from a fixed-income portfolio after the firm
declined to rebid for the business at lower fees. Assets rose
3.2 percent during the three months to $3.67 trillion, the
company said last week, fueled by market gains of $134 billion.  T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW)  said yesterday third-quarter
earnings rose 33 percent as global stock markets rallied and
investors made net deposits of $4.3 billion. Assets rose 6
percent to $574.4 billion during the quarter as market
appreciation added $28.4 billion.  At Franklin, assets under management increased 6.1 percent
to $749.9 billion as a result of market appreciation. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, a benchmark for U.S. stocks, gained
5.8 percent last quarter and global stocks, as measured by the
MSCI AC World Index, rose 6.2 percent. More than 70 percent of
Franklin’s equity money is in global and international funds.  The company’s flagship fund, the $63 billion  Templeton
Global Bond Fund (TPINX) , bounced back this year after it trailed 91
percent of rivals in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The fund, managed by  Michael Hasenstab , gained 13
percent this year through Oct. 23, better than 88 percent of
peers. Over five years, the fund topped 94 percent of rivals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
