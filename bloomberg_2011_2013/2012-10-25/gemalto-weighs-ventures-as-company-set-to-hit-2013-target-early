Gemalto NV (GTO) , the smart-chip maker
that will reach its 2013 target early thanks to mobile payments,
may enter new businesses and countries as it drafts a strategic
plan to be unveiled in the second half of next year.  Chief Executive Officer Olivier Piou, who has run the
Amsterdam-based company since it was created in 2006 through the
merger of Gemplus and Axalto, said he is in the early stages of
evaluating possible partnerships and acquisitions.  “We’ve identified business opportunities adjacent to what
we do today,” Piou said. “We’re working on picking a few and
deciding how we’ll invest in them.”  Under Piou, Gemalto has been shifting revenue from older
commoditized smart chips to new security technology, predicting
that the company will benefit from an increase in contactless
mobile payment and machine-to-machine transmissions. It has
boosted sales and margins from selling security packages based
on chips and software to carriers and banks, as well as
targeting new clients such as social networks.  The company’s third-quarter revenue got a lift as  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 went on sale in September, along with other
mobiles made for faster 4G wireless technology, prompting the
need for new SIM cards. Gemalto’s sales grew 18 percent to 575
million euros ($748 million). The company confirmed it would
reach its target for profit from operations of 300 million euros
this year, instead of 2013.  Shares of Gemalto, which has a market value of 6.1 billion
euros, jumped as much as 6.1 percent today in Paris trading. The
stock, which has gained 85 percent so far this year and is the
 fourth-best  performer on the  SBF 120 index (SBF120) , was up 3.8 percent
at 69.45 euros as of 12:55 p.m.  “A few years ago we made a bet on new technologies, like
mobile payments,” Piou said. “It has paid off and the positive
trend from that will continue into 2013, and probably even until
2015. Now we want to take our time to discuss and evaluate new
opportunities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
