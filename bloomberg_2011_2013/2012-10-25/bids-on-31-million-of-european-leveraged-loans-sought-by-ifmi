who asked not to be identified as the sale is private. The loans
are being distributed by Cohen & Co., a unit of brokerage
Institutional Financial Markets, Inc., the person said.  The loans are a 10.7 million-euro portion for roofing
supplier Monier Group Sarl, a 3.8 million-euro term loan B and 4
million-euro term loan C for building materials company Materis
SA, two 1.7 million-euro term loans for  Spain ’s Telepizza SA,
and 1.7 million euros of term loans B and C for mobile operator
One  Austria , the person said.  IFMI is selling the loans in a so-called bids-wanted-in-
competition, or BWIC, process where the highest offer above the
reserve price wins. Calls and e-mails to IFMI spokeswoman Megan
Livewell in Philadelphia seeking comment weren’t immediately
returned.  Leveraged loans are high-yield secured debt rated below
