Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  said
the U.S. military lacked intelligence needed to respond during
the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi,  Libya ,
during which Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans
were killed.  “The basic principle is don’t deploy into harm’s way
without knowing what’s going on,” Panetta said today at a
Pentagon news conference. He said he and top generals “felt
very strongly” that deploying forces sooner wasn’t the right
option.  The Pentagon did send a Fleet Anti-Terrorism Support Team,
or FAST, to the region and had ships off the coast of Libya
“prepared to respond to any contingency,” Panetta said.  The attack on the compound “happened within a few hours
and it was really over before, you know, we had the opportunity
to really know what was happening,” Panetta said  Panetta said “there’s a lot of Monday morning
quarterbacking going on here.”  Republicans, led by presidential nominee  Mitt Romney , have
questioned whether there was adequate diplomatic security in
Libya and criticized the Obama administration’s early accounts
describing the attack as having grown out of a “spontaneous”
demonstration against a video ridiculing the  Prophet Muhammad .
Administration officials and the spokesman for the office of the
Director of National Intelligence have said that account was
based on early intelligence reports that were revised as more
information was received.  To contact the reporter on this story:
