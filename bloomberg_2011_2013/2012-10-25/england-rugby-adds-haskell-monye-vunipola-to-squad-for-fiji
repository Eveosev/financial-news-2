England rugby coach  Stuart Lancaster 
added flanker  James Haskell , wing Ugo Monye, prop Mako Vunipola
and hooker Tom Youngs to the 32-man squad preparing to play Fiji
at Twickenham Nov. 10.  The four were promoted from England’s Saxons Elite Player
Squad as replacements for the injured  Tom Croft ,  Ben Foden , Alex
Corbisiero and Rob Webber. Tom Wood and Courtney Lawes will
return from injury in time for the fall international matches,
Lancaster said today in a statement on the Rugby Football Union
website.  “As a coaching team we can’t wait to go into camp and get
the guys focused on what will be a massive challenge,”
Lancaster said. England will play Fiji, and then takes on
Australia on Nov. 17, South Africa on Nov. 24 and finally  New
Zealand  on Dec. 1. All the games are at London’s Twickenham.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
