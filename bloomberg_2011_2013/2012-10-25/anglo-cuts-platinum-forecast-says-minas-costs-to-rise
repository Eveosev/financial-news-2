Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the year’s
fourth-worst performing FTSE 100 Index stock, cut its platinum
output forecast after strikes in South Africa and said its $5.8
billion Minas-Rio iron-ore project will see more cost overruns.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  targets production of 2.2
million to 2.4 million ounces for 2012, it said in a statement
today, compared with a July figure of 2.4 million to 2.5 million
ounces. Pay strikes in South Africa also cut output at Anglo’s
 Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  unit by 2.2 million metric tons.  The Minas-Rio cost increases, at least the fifth that Anglo
is preparing to announce, may hurt Chief Executive Officer
 Cynthia Carroll ’s ability to stem a share slump. Anglo has
dropped 21 percent this year in  London , compared with a 6
percent gain by rival  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , while  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  is
little changed. Seven of  31 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg
recommend buying the stock, with 18 hold and six sell calls.  Anglo said shipments should start from Minas-Rio, bought in
2008 and the company’s largest project, in the second half of
2014. That’s provided “all current impediments” are cleared by
year-end and there are no “major unexpected interventions,” it
said today.  Platinum strikes in the third quarter cut production by
42,000 ounces and pushed cash operating costs up by 8 percent,
the company said.  Workers Fired  Anglo American Platinum fired 12,000 workers on Oct. 5
after wildcat strikes at  South Africa ’s Rustenburg. Walkouts
starting in platinum mines spread to gold, coal and iron ore as
workers demand higher pay. While refined platinum output edged
up 0.3 percent to 649,000 ounces from a year earlier, equivalent
refined platinum, including other metals, slid 6 percent to
626,000 ounces.  The drop was “better than we expected, but the full impact
of the strike is yet to be felt,” Bank of America Corp.
analysts said.  The average daily loss to platinum production is 4,500
ounces, including 3,800 ounces from the company’s own mines,
Anglo American said in a separate statement. It cut planned
 capital spending  on the metal to 6.5 billion rand ($750 million)
this year, while unit costs are seen reaching 15,500 rand to
16,000 rand for each equivalent refined ounce.  Anglo is also losing nickel production at Loma de Niquel in
 Venezuela , where the 13 of the operation’s concessions have been
canceled. The remaining three are due to expire Nov. 10 and,
“if there is no development in this situation in the coming
weeks, then there will be no further production contribution
from this operation,” the company said.  Kolomela Boost  Loma de Niquel was halted last month, the company said,
without giving details. The operation accounted for 13,400
metric tons of Anglo’s 29,100 tons of nickel production last
year.  Anglo American’s iron-ore output increased 14 percent to
12.5 million metric tons on growth at Kumba’s Kolomela mine. The
site’s production of 2.5 million tons was a 44 percent gain on
the prior quarter and reflected the mine reaching designed
capacity earlier than scheduled in July. Kumba expects Kolomela
to produce at least 7 million tons in 2012, with full output of
9 million tons in 2013.  Copper output expanded 12 percent to 157,300 tons in the
quarter on increased volumes at Los Bronces mine. The project
increased output 84 percent, contributing 48,900 tons of copper
in the quarter even as metal grades declined, Anglo said.  Lower Grades  Platinum production at the Union North and South mines fell
23 percent and 26 percent respectively because of lower grades.
Output at Mogalakwena was reduced by the breakdown of the
primary crusher at the North concentrator and lower “head
grade,” the company said, referring to the ore leaving the mine
and entering the processing plant.  Anglo, owner of 85 percent of  De Beers , the biggest diamond
producer by value, cut output of the stones 31 percent to 6.4
million carats in the third quarter, “largely in response to
market conditions and the Jwaneng slope failure in June 2012
which temporarily prevented access to the main ore body,” it
said in the statement.  “De Beers was a small ‘miss,’ but within the usual margin
of error,”  Peter Davey , head of metals and mining research at
Standard Bank Group Ltd. in London, said in a note to investors.
“But today’s release does now point toward the low end of its
guidance for full-year 2012” of 28 million carats, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
