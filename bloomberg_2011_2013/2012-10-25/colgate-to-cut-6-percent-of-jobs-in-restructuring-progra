Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) , the world’s
largest toothpaste maker, will cut its global workforce by 6
percent, or about 2,300 jobs, in a four-year restructuring
program aimed at cutting costs amid slowing economies.  By 2016, the plan will result in charges of $1.1 billion to
$1.25 billion before taxes, the New York-based company said
today in a statement. The company currently has 38,600
employees.  Chief Executive Officer Ian Cook is working to boost profit
by reducing structural costs, improving the supply chain and
increasing the use of global data and analytic capabilities.
North American companies, from Ford Motor Co. to Dow Chemical
Co., have announced plans to cut 62,600 jobs at home and abroad
since Sept. 1, the biggest two-month drop since the start of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are living in a fast-changing world with many
challenges including slowing economies in many countries,” Cook
said today in the statement.  Colgate  fell  1.8 percent to $104.60 at the close in  New
York . The shares have  gained  13 percent this year.  The restructuring is expected to save $365 million to $435
million annually by the fourth year, Colgate said.  The company said the plan will involve moving single-
country subsidiaries into regional divisions and will focus on
manufacturing and global warehouse networks to reduce costs.  European Sales  Last year, 18 percent of Colgate’s  revenue  came from North
America, with 29 percent from  Latin America  and 21 percent from
its  Europe  and South Pacific region.  Third-quarter sales fell 11 percent in Europe and the South
Pacific and rose 2.5 percent in  North America , Colgate said
today.  Net income in the third quarter rose 1.7 percent to $654
million, or $1.36 a share, from $643 million, or $1.31, a year
earlier, Colgate said. Excluding some items, profit was $1.38 a
share, matching the average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Revenue fell 1.2 percent to $4.33 billion, trailing the
$4.38 billion average of analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
