Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
 Roger Altman , gained the most in almost a year after third-
quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Evercore rose 6.2 percent to $27.24 at 10:36 a.m. in New
York after advancing as much as 8.2 percent, the most intraday
since Nov. 30. The shares fell 3.7 percent this year through
yesterday.  Net income was $5.3 million, or 17 cents a share, up from
$1.96 million, or 6 cents, in the year-earlier period, the New
York-based firm said in a statement today. Earnings excluding
certain items fell 13 percent to $17.3 million, or 40 cents a
share, exceeding the 34-cent  average estimate  of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Proforma revenue declined 8 percent to
$149.2 million in the quarter, the company said.  Evercore, led by Chief Executive Officer Ralph Schlosstein,
61, is among firms advising  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  on its
$32.8 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc. from  Deutsche
Telekom AG. (DTE)  Evercore ranks 15th for financial advisers on global
mergers and acquisitions this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Altman, 66, said in July that Evercore has a
“strong” backlog of deals.  “We remain confident that Evercore’s backlog compares
favorably to its peers,” Devin Ryan, an analyst at Sandler
O’Neill & Partners LP, said today in a  note . “We continue to
believe 2012 will represent a record year for advisory revenues
and potentially earnings.”  ‘Brain Drain’  Investment-banking adjusted revenue declined 7.3 percent to
$128.2 million in the third quarter from the same period last
year. Investment-management adjusted revenue fell 15 percent to
$21 million.  The firm hasn’t booked a fee of more than $20 million this
year and doesn’t expect to in the fourth quarter, Schlosstein
said today on a conference call. That’s due to a lack of “giant
deals,” Altman said. Full-year revenue is expected to exceed
last year’s, Schlosstein said.  Evercore’s adjusted compensation expense in the third
quarter was $89.3 million, or 60 percent of revenue, compared
with $100.8 million, or 62 percent, a year earlier.  The firm added four senior managing directors in the
quarter and will continue to hire “selectively, but steadily,”
Altman said on the call.  “There continues to be a brain drain from the giant
institutions to independent firms and we’re the particular
beneficiary,” he said.  Evercore boosted its quarterly  dividend  10 percent to 22
cents a share, payable on Dec. 14 to common shareholders of
record as of Nov. 30, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
