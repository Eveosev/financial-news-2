Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL)  rose the most in
almost six weeks after Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s
Internet company boosted revenue and sold a portion of its
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  shares.  The depositary receipts rallied as much as 7.6 percent and
traded up 3.3 percent at $33.25 by 9:51 a.m. in London.  Sales surged 37 percent to 4.97 billion rubles ($159
million) in third-quarter as users bought more games and virtual
gifts, the company said in a regulatory filing. Mail.ru now owns
a 0.75 percent stake in Facebook versus 1.34 percent reported in
September, according to the filing.  The sale of the Facebook shares may have supported the
stock, said  Anna Lepetukhina , an analyst at Sberbank CIB.
Investors may be “hoping that the company will share proceeds
with shareholders and pay dividends,” she said.  Mail.ru sold about 16 million Facebook shares in October,
spokeswoman Ksenia Chabanenko said by telephone. Based on an
average price per share of $20.41 this month, Mail.ru may have
earned $320 million from the sale, calculations by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
