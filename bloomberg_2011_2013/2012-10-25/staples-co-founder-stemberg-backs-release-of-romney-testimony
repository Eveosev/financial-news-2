Staples Inc.’s co-founder Tom
Stemberg doesn’t oppose release of testimony by  Mitt Romney  from
Stemberg’s divorce case.  “We have no concerns about the testimony,” Stemberg’s
attorney, Brian Leary, told a Massachusetts judge today. Leary
called Romney’s testimony “a primer” on the early development
of Staples.  To contact the reporter on this story:
