Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s biggest oil
and natural gas producer, may consider a liquified natural gas
exporting business for its Canadian operations.  “If there is a business opportunity and it is the right
timing then I think we’ll go for it,” Stale Tungesvik,
president of Canadian operations, said in an interview in
Calgary yesterday. “We have a rather active M&A group looking
at things. Timing is the key word. We are looking for things
continuously.”  Statoil would be up against larger competitors like  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Exxon Mobil Corp. that have proposed LNG
operations in Western  Canada . Companies in Canada, the third-
largest gas producer, are seeking to export to new markets as
North American output climbs and prices trade near 10-year lows.  “These huge resources need to reach a market that’s
willing to pay for it,” said Tungesvik.  Statoil’s Canadian division produces bitumen from its oil-
sands operations in  Alberta  as well as crude in Newfoundland
from offshore platforms. The company, based in Stavanger,
Norway, already has LNG production from the Snohvit gas field in
the Norwegian Sea, north of the Arctic Circle.  Statoil plans to “optimize” its existing assets in
Canada, said Tungesvik, who was appointed to lead the Canadian
division two months ago. Production at Statoil’s oil-sands
operations in Alberta is about 20,000 barrels a day and the
company plans to double that figure, he said without providing a
time frame.  To contact the reporter on this story:
