Oil revenues earned by  Ghana , West
 Africa ’s second-biggest economy, increased 29 percent as crude
production at the offshore Jubilee field climbed to an average
of 85,000 barrel a day.  Accrued income to the state in the year through September
was $434 million from $338 million in the same period a year
earlier, Linda Tamakloe, corporate affairs director of state oil
company, Ghana National Petroleum Corp., also known as GNPC,
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Total output was 18.6 million barrels, up from 17.6 million
barrels last year. Ghana exported 3.94 million barrels in the
first nine months compared with 2.98 million in the same period
a year earlier, she said.  The start of the Jubilee oil field in December 2010 helped
propel Ghana’s economic growth to 14.4 percent last year, the
fastest pace in Africa. The economy may expand 9 percent this
year on the increased oil output beating a provisional outlook
of 7.1 percent from the government after production fell to
63,000 barrels a day in the first half of the year, Finance
Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said Oct. 12.  Production currently average 85,000 barrels a day and “we
expect to maintain this volume till December, and this is
projected to rise to about 90,000 barrels in the first quarter
of 2013,” Tamakloe said.  Ghana is the world’s biggest producer of cocoa after  Ivory
Coast  and trails  South Africa  as the continent’s top gold miner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
