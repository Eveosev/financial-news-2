Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW)  shut the
1,335-megawatt Palo Verde 3 reactor in Arizona to make unplanned
repairs to a valve in a containment building.  “We’ve had this valve under surveillance and knew we would
have to bring the unit down to make repairs at some point,”
Betty Dayyo, a plant spokeswoman based in Phoenix, said by
phone. “The problem is a steam leak.”  Palo Verde, located about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of
Phoenix, went offline early today after operating at full power
yesterday. The drop sent the region’s  nuclear-power production 
lower by 8.7 percent to 13,961 megawatts, the lowest level since
Nov. 9, 2009, according to filings with the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nine nuclear reactors are shut in the region, including
 Edison International (EIX) ’s two-unit San Onofre plant, which has been
closed since January after the company found unusual wear on
tubes that carry radioactive water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
