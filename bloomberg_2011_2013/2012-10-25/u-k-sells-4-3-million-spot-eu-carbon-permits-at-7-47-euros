The U.K.,  Europe ’s second-biggest
greenhouse-gas emitter, sold 4.3 million spot carbon allowances
at 7.47 euros ($9.71) a metric ton in an auction, its 30th such
sale since November 2008.  The nation received bids for a total of 17.2 million tons,
3.99 times more than the number of allowances on offer,
according to information from the Debt Management Office, the
government body that oversees the sale.  The sale is the country’s final auction of permits in the
second phase of the EU’s carbon market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
