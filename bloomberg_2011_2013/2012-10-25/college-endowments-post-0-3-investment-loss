U.S. college endowments lost an
average of 0.3 percent on their investments in the year ended in
June, compared with a gain of 19.2 percent in fiscal 2011, as
the  European debt crisis  and slower global economic growth
undermined returns.  The results come from preliminary data gathered from 463
institutions in the U.S., according to a statement today from
the National Association of College and University Business
Officers-Commonfund Study of Endowments. More than 800 schools
are expected to participate in the final report that will be
released in January, the groups said.  Harvard University , the worldâ€™s richest school with $30.7
billion of assets under management, said last month it lost 0.05
percent for the year, largely as a result of investments in
publicly traded non-U.S. and emerging-market shares, which fell
11 percent and 17 percent for the year, respectively.  The  University of Pennsylvania , which has a $6.8 billion
endowment, reported a 1.6 percent return after gaining 19
percent a year earlier, blaming the weak performance on the
credit crunch in Europe that hurt equity markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
