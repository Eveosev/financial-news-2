LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the second-largest
maker of wafers for photovoltaic cells, agreed to sell three
solar plants at its manufacturing sites to Henan Xindaxin
Materials Co. for 140 million  yuan  ($22.4 million) as part of an
effort to improve its balance sheet.  LDK will lease the plants back from Xindaxin for 9.9
million yuan a year for six years, starting Nov. 1, and has the
option to repurchase them, the Kaifeng, China-based chemicals
company said in a  statement  on its website today.  The solar company had $3.6 billion in  debt  at the end of
the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and
analysts expect it to  lose  $440 million this year. The Xinyu,
China-based company is seeking to improve its cash and liquidity
position as the solar industry contends with falling panel
 prices , Chief Executive Officer Peng Xiaofeng said during a
conference call Sept. 17.  LDKâ€™s American depositary receipts, each worth one ordinary
share, fell 3.6 percent to 86 cents at the close in New York.
The ADRs have gained 21 percent since the company agreed Oct. 22
to issue new shares and sell a 19.9 percent stake to Heng Rui
Xin Energy Co.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  was the largest wafer
supplier by production capacity last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
