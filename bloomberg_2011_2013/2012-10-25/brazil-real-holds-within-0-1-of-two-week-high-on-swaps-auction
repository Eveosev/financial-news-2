Brazil ’s real held within 0.1
percent of a two-week high after the central bank sold reverse
currency swaps for a second time this week to support exporters
by preventing appreciation.  The central bank sold 28,300 of 30,000 reverse currency
swaps offered at an auction, including $1.1 billion worth of
contracts due in December and $300 million worth of contracts
due in January, according to a statement by the bank.  The real closed unchanged at 2.0259 per dollar. The
currency reached a two-week high of 2.0242 per dollar on Oct.
22.  “The tendency for the real is positive with less  risk
aversion  and a net foreign currency inflow,” said  Newton Rosa ,
economist at Sulamerica Investimentos, in a phone interview from
 Sao Paulo . “But the central bank only lets the real fluctuate
within tight limits.”  Brazilian swap rates fell as unemployment rose 0.1
percentage point to 5.4 percent, exceeding the median estimate
of 5.3 percent by 35 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014 fell two
basis point, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.34 percent, after
earlier rising one basis point.  The central bank said Oct. 23 it auctioned 33,000 reverse
currency swaps contracts out of 60,000 offered, including those
due on Dec. 3 for $849 million and contracts due on Jan. 2 for
$799 million.  The bank sold $1.3 billion in reverse currency swaps on
Oct. 5, $5.7 billion of contracts Sept. 12 through Sept. 17 and
$350 million on Aug. 21 to weaken the real. The August reverse
swaps were the first since March.  Defend Competitiveness  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told the daily Valor
Economico yesterday that the government’s “dirty float”
currency policy will last as long as necessary to defend the
country’s competitiveness. A Finance Ministry official didn’t
respond to e-mail and phone messages.  The real has dropped 7.8 percent this year, the biggest
decline among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Brazil had a net foreign currency inflow of $1.6 billion
this month as of Oct. 19, according to data released by the
central bank yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
