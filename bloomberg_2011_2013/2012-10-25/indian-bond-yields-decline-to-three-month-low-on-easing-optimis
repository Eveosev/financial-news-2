India ’s 10-year  bonds  rose, pushing
the yield to a three-month low, on optimism the central bank
will ease monetary policy next week to support the government’s
efforts to counter an  economic  slowdown.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao will cut
 reserve  requirements for banks from an eight-year low of 4.5
percent at an Oct. 30 review, according to 20 of 28 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. Eight predict no change. He will also
lower the repurchase  rate  from 8 percent, according to 12 of the
analysts, while the rest expect the benchmark to be left
unchanged. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  has cut fuel subsidies
and eased foreign-investment rules since mid-September.  “Some easing in monetary policy can’t be ruled out
following recent steps by the government to revive growth,”
said Srinivasa Raghavan, an executive vice president at
 Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK)  in Mumbai.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today in Mumbai,
matching the lowest level since July 27 reached last week,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The market will
be closed tomorrow for a holiday.  The RBI has reduced the  cash reserve ratio  by 150 basis
points and lowered the repo rate by 50 basis points this year.
Quarterly expansion in  Asia ’s third-largest  economy  averaged 5.4
percent in the first half of 2012, compared with 7.5 percent in
the whole of 2011.  The one-year interest-rate swap, derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.60 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
