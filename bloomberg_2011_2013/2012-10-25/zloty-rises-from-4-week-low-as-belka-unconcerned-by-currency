The zloty advanced from the the
lowest level in four weeks after Polish central bank Governor
Marek Belka was reported as saying the current  exchange rate 
“certainly” isn’t hurting exports.  The zloty appreciated 0.5 percent to 4.1397 per euro as of
10:24 a.m. in Warsaw, snapping four-day losing streak. It has
the second-steepest gain among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on two-year notes
increased two basis points to 3.91 percent.  It isn’t clear if a weaker zloty would boost economic
growth as greater profits for exporters would be offset by
weaker domestic consumption, Belka was reported as saying in
 Gazeta Wyborcza . He also said a cut in  interest rates  now would
be a “natural” consequence of the slowdown, although the
economy remains in “good shape” and may recover faster than
its western European counterparts, according to the newspaper.  “The currency may come under pressure in the next two-
three months as the easing cycle is set to begin,” Janusz Dancewicz, chief economist at DZ Bank Polska SA in Warsaw, wrote
in an e-mailed note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
