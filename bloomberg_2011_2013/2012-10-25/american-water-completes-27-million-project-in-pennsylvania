American Water Works Co. (AWK)  completed
an 18-month, $27 million project in  Pennsylvania ’s Lackawanna
County, including a reservoir that’s the source of drinking
water for 75,000 people served by the company’s water treatment
plant in Pittston township.  The design and related work on Nesbitt reservoir,
originally built in 1901, improves the dam’s drainage system and
creates additional spillway capacity, allowing it to better
handle severe weather events, Pennsylvania American Water said
today in a statement.  American Water’s Pennsylvania unit is the largest water
utility in the state. American Water, based in Voorhees, N.J.,
is the biggest publicly traded water and wastewater company in
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
