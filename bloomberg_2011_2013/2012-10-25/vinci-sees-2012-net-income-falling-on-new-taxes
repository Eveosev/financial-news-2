Vinci SA (DG) ,  Europe ’s biggest builder,
said 2012 net income may fall by as much as 4 percent as the
French government introduces new taxes to reduce the country’s
budget deficit.  “Ongoing discussions surrounding the proposed 2013 French
Finance Law imply that these new charges could negatively impact
Vinci’s 2012 net income, which could be down by 3 percent to 4
percent,” the company, based in the Paris suburb of Rueil-
Malmaison, said in a statement today.  In July, Vinci targeted 2012 operating income and net
income “close to their 2011 levels,” before taking into
account the new increase in tax and social charges planned in
 France .  Chief Executive Officer Xavier Huillard has warned that
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and the collapse of municipal
lender  Dexia SA (DEXB)  may undermine public works in the region and
erode traffic on the group’s French toll roads.  Full-year sales will climb by about 4 percent, the company
said. In July, it predicted a “slight” increase in 2012
revenue. Sales climbed 7.3 percent to 10.3 billion euros ($13.3
billion) in the third quarter, helped by exchange rates and
acquisitions, Vinci said.  Vinci’s backlog stood at a 32.8 billion euros as of Sept.
30, down from 33.2 billion euros at the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
