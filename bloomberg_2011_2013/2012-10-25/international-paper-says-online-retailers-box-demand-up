International Paper Co. (IP) , the world’s
largest maker of cardboard shipping containers, said
“noticeably” improved third-quarter sales of boxes to U.S.
online retailers point to rising expectations for holiday
spending.  “Sales to our online retail customers are up and that’s a
pretty good indicator of their optimism going into the holiday
season,” John Faraci, chairman and chief executive officer of
the Memphis, Tennessee-based company, said today in a phone
interview.  “Those retailers are looking at  consumer spending  and
thinking it’s going to be up relative to last year and putting
inventory in the pipeline,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
