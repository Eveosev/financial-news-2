Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the
largest U.S. shopping-mall owner, raised its quarterly dividend
and its forecast for full-year funds from operations as its
tenants benefit from an increase in  consumer spending .  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, climbed in the third quarter to $720.1 million, or $1.99 a
share, from $606.2 million, or $1.71, a year earlier, the real
estate investment trust said today in a statement. The  average 
estimate of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was $1.92 a share.  Demand for space at regional malls is rising, helping to
boost revenue for Indianapolis-based Simon. U.S. retail sales
advanced 1.1 percent in September following a revised 1.2
percent increase in August, according to data from the Commerce
Department. The company also is benefiting from its outlet
centers, said Craig Guttenplan, a REIT analyst at CreditSights
Inc. in  London . Those properties are a top area of expansion.  “Outlet malls continue to do well,” Guttenplan said in a
telephone interview before Simon announced its earnings.
“Regional malls are slightly positive and outlets are more
positive.”  The company boosted its quarterly  dividend  to $1.10 a share
from $1.05. It estimates FFO for the full year of $7.80 to $7.85
a share, up from its previous  forecast  of $7.60 to $7.70.  Simon also said it sold its investment this week in U.K.
property companies Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc and
 Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC)  for proceeds of $327 million.  Revenue for the third quarter increased 14 percent to $1.23
billion. U.S. occupancy climbed to 94.6 percent from 93.8
percent. The base minimum rent in the quarter was $40.33 a
square foot, up from $38.84 a year earlier. Tenant sales per
square foot rose 9.3 percent to $562.  The results were released before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Simon rose 0.1 percent to $151.17 yesterday. Its shares
have advanced 17 percent this year, compared with a 12 percent
gain in the Bloomberg  REIT (BBREIT)  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
