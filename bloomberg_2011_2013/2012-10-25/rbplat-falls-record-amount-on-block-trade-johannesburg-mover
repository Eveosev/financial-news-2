Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd. (RBP)  slumped
by the most ever in Johannesburg trading, reversing yesterday’s
record gain, with traders saying an institutional investor was
probably behind the sale of more than two million shares in the
platinum producer.  Royal Bafokeng  fell 13 percent, the steepest drop since it
listed in 2010, by the close in Johannesburg. The stock advanced
18 percent yesterday.  The stock’s 30-day  historical volatility , a measure of
stock swings, jumped to 67.16 from 53.14 the previous day. The
FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s  30-day volatility  measure was
at 12.45 versus 12.47. A higher reading means the price of an
asset can move dramatically in a short period. About 2.3 million
RBPlat shares traded, about 30 times the average daily volume in
the past three months.  “That type of volume would suggest an institutional
trade,” Mohil Bandulal, head trader at Sasfin Securities, said
by phone from Durban. “What we are seeing, with the labor
unrest we have had, some managers are focusing on their mining
holdings, and certainly their platinum holdings, and
rationalizing these holdings.”  Production at RBPlat’s mines was hampered by labor unrest
in the three months through September, the company said in a
statement on Oct. 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
