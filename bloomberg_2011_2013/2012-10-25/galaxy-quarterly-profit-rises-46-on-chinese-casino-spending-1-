Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) , the
casino operator founded by billionaire Lui Che-Woo, posted a 46
percent gain in third-quarter profit as Chinese gamblers spent
more at the resort it set up last year. The stock rose.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, increased to HK$2.6 billion ($335
million), Hong Kong-based Galaxy said in a statement today. It
didn’t provide net income figures or a year-earlier comparison.  Galaxy  shares  climbed 3.6 percent to close at HK$25.95
after the results. Macau casino operators have benefited from
increased spending by middle-class Chinese tourists, with
Deutsche Bank AG estimating third-quarter revenue from the so-
called mass market rose 27 percent industrywide in the world’s
largest gambling hub.  “We still expect to see significant growth in the future”
for the mass market, Galaxy Chief Financial Officer  Robert Drake 
said in a telephone interview today. The completion of the
Guangzhou-Zhuhai railway line in China will bring in more
mainland Chinese tourists to Macau when it’s completed next
year, he said.  Galaxy’s third-quarter revenue rose 6 percent from a year
earlier to HK$14 billion.  Galaxy Macau  Construction of phase two of the Galaxy Macau resort,
opened in May 2011 on the city’s Cotai strip, is on schedule to
be completed in 2015, it said today. The casino operator is
investing about HK$16 billion to almost double the size of that
gambling center as it competes with companies including  Sands
China Ltd. (1928) ,  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)   The planned expansion of Galaxy Macau will add as many as
500 gaming tables, luxury stores and 1,300 rooms from the JW
Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton hotels.  Galaxy Macau’s VIP gaming revenue fell 7.1 percent from the
second quarter to HK$173.3 billion, while that for the mass
market increased 4.2 percent to HK$6.3 billion, according to
today’s statement.  “In today’s global macroeconomic environment, it’s only
natural for them to pause,” Drake said, referring to the VIP
market revenue. “It will resume growth in the near future.”  Wynn Macau , the Hong Kong-listed unit of  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) ,
reported yesterday that adjusted Macau property earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell 1.3 percent
to $292.2 million in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
