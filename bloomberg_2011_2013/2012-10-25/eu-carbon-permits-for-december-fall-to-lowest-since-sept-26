European Union carbon permits fell
to their lowest since Sept. 26 as the U.K. was scheduled to hold
its final auction of permits for the second phase of the bloc’s
carbon market.  The contract for December declined as much as 2.7 percent
to 7.46 euros a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, and was at 7.53 euros as of 8:03 a.m. The U.K. will
sell a final tranche of 4.3 million permits for Phase 2 today,
before  Germany  holds the first auction of Phase 3 permits
tomorrow. The third phase of the EU market begins in 2013 and
runs through 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
