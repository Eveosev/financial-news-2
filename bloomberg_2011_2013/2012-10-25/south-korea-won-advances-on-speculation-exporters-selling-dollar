South Korea ’s won approached a 13-
month high on speculation exporters are selling dollars to
convert overseas earnings near the end of the month.  Government
bonds  declined.  The nation’s industrial output probably grew 1 percent in
September, a three-month high, a Bloomberg News survey showed
before data due next week. The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday
the  U.S. economy  is still growing modestly and unemployment
remains elevated. A government report tomorrow may show South
Korea’s economy expanded 1.7 percent in the third quarter, the
slowest pace in three years, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “It looks like the won is strengthening after some
exporters sold the greenback,” said Kim Dong Young, a Seoul-
based currency dealer for  Industrial Bank of Korea. (024110)  “The
appreciation trend for the won is valid as investors keep a
positive view on Asia.”  The won advanced 0.2 percent to 1,101.59 per dollar as of
9:39 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,100.03 on Oct. 23, the strongest level since
September 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 5.89 percent.  The cost of processed foods in South Korea is prompting
concerns about price instability and inflation, Finance Minister
Bahk Jae Wan said at a government meeting today. Bahk Jae Wan
said in a Bloomberg News interview on Oct. 9 that economic
growth reached a “bottom” in the third quarter.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 rose one basis point to 2.82 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap was little changed
at 2.78 percent.  “Investors are waiting for the government’s outlook
tomorrow for fourth quarter growth, which will help gauge
whether South Korea’s economy will rebound,” said Lee Hak Seoung, a fixed-income analyst at Tong Yang Securities Inc. in
Seoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
