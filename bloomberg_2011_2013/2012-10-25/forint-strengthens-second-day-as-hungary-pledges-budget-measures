The forint strengthened for a second
day against the euro and the cost of insuring Hungarian bonds
with credit-default swaps fell after the government pledged to
take further steps to meet its budget-deficit target.  The currency of the European Unionâ€™s most-indebted eastern
member appreciated 0.4 percent to 279.75 per euro by 11:47 a.m.
in Budapest. Improving perceptions of creditworthiness sent
Hungarian default swaps falling 11 basis points to 256,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hungary will implement additional fiscal measures should
the European Commission forecast a shortfall of more than the EU
limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product, Peter Beno Banai,
deputy state secretary at the  Economy Ministry , said in an
online briefing yesterday.  European stocks and most emerging-market currencies gained
today as results from companies including  BASF SE (BAS)  and  Unilever
NV (UNA)  beat estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
