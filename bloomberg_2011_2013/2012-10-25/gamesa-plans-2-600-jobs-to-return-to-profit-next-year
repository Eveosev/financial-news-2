Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) , Spain’s
biggest maker of wind turbines, said it will cut 20 percent of
its workforce in a strategy aimed at reducing its size through
2015 and returning it to profit next year.  It will cut 1,800 jobs by March after having eliminated 800
positions since December, according to a statement from the
company today. Gamesa expects turbine sales totaling 1.8
gigawatts to 2 gigawatts, compared with an estimate for 2
gigawatts this year.  Turbine makers led by  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  are
struggling with subsidy cuts across the U.S. and  Europe , which
have eroded margins and demand along with turbine prices. Gamesa
reduced its 2012 sales forecast in July and said it would scale
back after posting its first half-year loss since 2000. Vestas
already fired 2,335 workers in January and reduced manufacturing
to contain widening losses.  “We need to reduce costs and debt” Gamesa Chairman
Ignacio Martin, who joined in May, said on a conference call
from  Madrid . “Utilities are going through a deleveraging stage
and are reducing investment, which is affecting us.”  The company, which sold 44 percent of its turbines to
utilities last year, expects a 12 percent drop in global
installations to about 42 gigawatts next year. It forecast a
shift in demand toward  emerging markets  and expects to sell more
in the region, particularly in Latin America.  Gamesa shares closed 4.2 percent higher in Madrid trading
at 1.60 euros. The stock has dropped 50 percent this year. Based
in Zamudio, Spain, Gamesa is due to report third-quarter results
on Nov. 8.  Surplus Capacity  The company, which also develops wind farms, plans to
reduce fixed costs by 100 million euros from 2011 to 2013 as it
focuses in two new turbine models with 2.5 and 5.5 megawatts. It
said that it is maintaining its commitment to offshore wind.  Gamesa sees the current oversupply of wind turbines
increasing next year due to the more than 77 gigawatts in global
manufacturing capacity. In response, it will close five
manufacturing plants during 2012 and sees more closures by 2015.  “There is a surplus in industrial capacity of 50 percent,
so sales prices are going to be affected,” Martin said today.
He doesn’t expect turbine prices to rise next year.  Aided by a leaner and more flexible structure, Gamesa sees
margins improving in the next few years. The company forecast
earnings before interest and tax margin of 3 percent to 5
percent next year and an increase to 8 percent to 10 percent in
2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
