MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Africa ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, raised its forecast for subscriber growth
this year as it added customers in  South Africa  and Nigeria, two
of its biggest markets.  The company increased subscriber numbers 3.8 percent to
182.7 million in the three months through September and expects
to add 23.7 million this year, compared with a forecast of 21.3
million previously, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today.  MTN, which operates in 22 African and Middle Eastern
markets, said South African growth of 4.1 percent was boosted by
the addition of pre-paid customers. Nigerian customers increased
5.7 percent, although growth in data customers was affected by
network congestion, it said. The company is upgrading networks
to handle more data traffic as consumers seek Internet
connections on their mobile devices.  “It seems like they maintained or slightly increased
market share in their major markets,” Mia Kruger, a
Johannesburg-based portfolio manager at Kruger International,
said by phone. “Generally, the third quarter isn’t their best
quarter so I think it’s satisfactory, given what they have been
facing.”  MTN shares declined 0.2 percent to 150.80 rand at the close
of trading in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
