The dollar may strengthen to a six-
month high against the yen should it break through a level of
so-called resistance, Credit Suisse Group AG said, citing
trading patterns.  The U.S. currency may extend this month’s advance past the
level of about 80.65 yen, which represents the 50 percent
retracement of its decline from March to September, technical
strategists including Cilline Bain in  London  wrote in a note to
clients, referring to Fibonacci analysis.  If the dollar rises beyond those levels, “we would expect
the market to target the 61.8 percent retracement hurdle at
81.49 yen,” the Credit Suisse analysts wrote.  The dollar gained 0.5 percent to 80.20 yen at 4:15 p.m.
London time, extending this month’s advance to 2.9 percent. The
U.S. currency last traded at 81.49 yen was on April 25.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Resistance refers to an area where sell orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a security, currency
or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
