Farmers in  South Africa , the
continent’s largest corn producer, are expected to plant 1.3
percent more of the grain this season, the nation’s  Crop
Estimates Committee  announced.  The country will sow 2.74 million hectares (6.77 million
acres) with corn, including 1.6 million with white and 1.14
million hectares with the yellow variety, compared with 2.69
million hectares planted in the previous season, Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said by phone from
 Pretoria  today. That compares with a 2.6 million-hectare median
estimate of five traders surveyed by Bloomberg News Oct 18.  “This is because of better prices and crop-rotation
practices by farmers,” Scheepers said.  White corn is one of the nation’s staple foods, while the
yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  The committee kept its forecast for wheat output unchanged
at 1.76 million metric tons. South Africa is a net importer of
the cereal.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract,
declined 1.2 percent to 2,513.80 rand ($289) a ton by the close
in Johannesburg. Yellow corn for delivery in the same month fell
0.7 percent to 2,548.80 rand a ton. Wheat climbed 0.2 percent to
3,649 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
