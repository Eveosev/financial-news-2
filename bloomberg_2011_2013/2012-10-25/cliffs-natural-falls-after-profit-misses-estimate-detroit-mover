Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the
largest U.S. iron-ore producer, fell the most in three months
after reporting third-quarter results that missed analysts’
estimates as prices declined and costs rose.  Cliffs decreased 8.7 percent to $38.99 at 11:01 a.m. in  New
York . Earlier the shares slumped 10 percent, the most intraday
since July 26.  Net income  slid 86 percent to $85.1 million, or 59 cents a
share, from $601.2 million, or $4.15, a year earlier, the
Cleveland-based company said yesterday in a statement. Profit
from continuing operations was 61 cents a share, missing the
$1.02 average of 21  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
dropped 30 percent to $1.45 billion.  Cash costs in Cliffs’ Canadian division rose 21 percent to
$106.06 a ton. Costs at the Bloom Lake Mine, which Cliffs
acquired with its 2011 purchase of Consolidated Thompson  Iron
Ore  Mines Ltd., increased 18 percent from a year earlier driven
by higher fuel, labor, maintenance and supply expenses, the
company said in the statement.  The price of seaborne  iron ore  fell 36 percent to an
average of $112 a metric ton in the quarter, compared with $176
a year earlier, according to Steel Business Briefing data
compiled by Bloomberg. Cliffs decreased its  outlook  for the spot
price of iron ore this year by 12 percent to $128 a ton from a
July forecast of $145 a ton.  The lower prices reflect “a significant mix shift to
lower-grade ore in Asia Pacific and changes in customer mix in
the U.S.,” Curt Woodworth, a New York-based analyst at Nomura
Securities International Inc., wrote in a note today.  U.S. steelmakers used 75 percent of their  capacity  on
average in the third quarter, compared with 76 percent a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the
 American Iron and Steel Institute . Capacity utilization has
tumbled from 81 percent in April to 70 percent on Oct. 22.  Cliffs calculates cash costs based on the cost per ton of
operating expenses and goods sold excluding depreciation,
depletion and amortization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
