The Norwegian power regulator’s
proposed changes to the Nordic electricity market are not
warranted, and would have a negative impact on trading, the
Oslo-based  Nord Pool Spot AS  exchange said.  “We raise a question mark over the proposal,” Stina
Johansen, a spokeswoman at Nord Pool Spot, said by e-mail from
Oslo today. “The Norwegian and Nordic markets work well, using
a model that has been set up and adjusted over several years,
and which offers a liquid and robust market.”  The Nordic region should consider having smaller price
zones, potentially with separate values for each power plant or
river system, in a move to so-called nodal pricing, Norway’s
energy and water directorate NVE  said  in a report on Oct. 18.  The Nordic setup for power trading is used “as a basis for
developing European power markets, and is central to the ongoing
integration of electricity trading,” Johansen said.  The exchange was the first liberalized power market to
develop in  Europe .  The regulator’s proposal has also drawn criticism from the
Nordic derivatives market. It is “a step in completely the
wrong direction,” Sara Aadnesen, spokeswoman for the  Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. (NDAQ) , which operates an Oslo-based energy exchange, said
on Oct. 23 by e-mail.  Nord Pool Spot  is the world’s largest multinational power
exchange, where 370 buyers and sellers from 20 countries match
supply and demand and price electricity for the following 24
hours in Norway, Sweden,  Finland  and  Denmark , as well as Estonia
and Lithuania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
