China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, had third-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates as a push to add users
with low-cost phones boosted costs faster than sales.  Net income  rose 27 percent to 2.02 billion  yuan  ($324
million), from a restated 1.59 billion yuan a year earlier,
based on figures derived from nine-month earnings the Beijing-
based company reported yesterday. That compares with the 2.21
billion-yuan median of seven analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Chairman Chang Xiaobing turned to low-cost smartphones
priced at 1,000 yuan or less, like the V889M from  ZTE Corp. (000063) ,
after the company in March lost the advantage of being the only
Chinese carrier to offer  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone with a service
plan. Subscribers with cheaper phones make less use of data.
Also campaigns to lure price-conscious users such as students
can be costly, according to Anand Ramachandran, a Hong Kong-
based analyst at Barclays Plc.  “It appears the miss was driven by higher selling,
marketing” and administrative expenses, Lisa Soh, a Hong Kong-
based analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd., said in an e-mail. The
expenses, which increased faster than revenue, “disappointed,”
she said.  Revenue rose 16 percent to 63.5 billion yuan in the third
quarter, compared with the median estimate of 63 billion yuan in
the Bloomberg News survey.  Unicom’s American depositary receipts fell 2.7 percent to
$16.82 in  New York  trading yesterday, bringing their decline
this year to 20 percent. Each ADR represents 10 underlying
shares of common stock.  Costs Jump  Unicom (UNCK)  faced “keen market competition” to speed user
growth in the period, the company said in the statement. As a
result, selling and marketing expenses surged 23 percent to 25.4
billion yuan in the first nine months, it said. Its cost of
telecommunications products sold jumped 48 percent to 33.8
billion yuan for the nine months, the carrier said.  Unicom had 66.9 million 3G subscribers at the end of the
third quarter, lagging behind the 75.6 million for market leader
China Mobile Ltd., according to data the companies released this
month. The smaller operator, which also offers fixed-line
broadband Internet services, had a mobile customer base of 229.5
million, or about a third of China Mobile’s 698.5 million.  China Mobile’s third-quarter  net income  climbed 1.3 percent
to 31.1 billion yuan, based on figures derived from nine-month
earnings the company reported on Oct. 22.  Profit (941)  was projected
at 30.8 billion yuan, according to the median of seven analysts’
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  China Telecom Corp., which began selling the iPhone on
March 9, is scheduled to report earnings on Oct. 29.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
