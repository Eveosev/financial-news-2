Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
commercial property and high-end homes, said third-quarter
profit rose 79 percent on lower catastrophe costs.  Net income increased to $533 million, or $1.98 a share,
from $298 million, or $1.04, a year earlier, the Warren, New
Jersey-based company said today in a statement. Operating
profit, which excludes some investment results, was $1.98 a
share, beating the $1.50  average estimate  of 22 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hurricane Isaac, which made landfall in August, contributed
to catastrophe costs in the period. Losses declined from a year
earlier when  Hurricane Irene  boosted disaster costs and Chubb
posted its  lowest  quarterly net income since 2008. Hurricanes
most commonly occur in the third quarter.  “We have had Hurricane Isaac, but we haven’t had any other
large losses beyond that,”  Amit Kumar , an analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd., said in a phone interview before earnings were
released.  The insurer climbed 2.2 percent to $81.13 in extended
trading at 4:19 p.m. in New York after raising its forecast for
full-year operating earnings per share. The company now expects
a range of $6.70 to $6.80, up from a forecast of $5.70 to $5.95
in July.  Chubb had  advanced  15 percent this year on the New York
Stock Exchange, matching the gain in the 24-company KBW
Insurance Index. Results were released after the close of
regular trading.  Premium Revenue  Premium revenue rose to $3 billion from  $2.9 billion  a year
earlier. Travelers Cos. and Evan Greenberg’s Ace Ltd., which
compete against Chubb selling commercial insurance, reported
improved third-quarter results this month as the companies
charged clients more for coverage. Chubb, Ace and Travelers, the
only insurer in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , all climbed to
record highs in the past month of New York trading.  “Chubb is the gold standard in the property-casualty
insurance space and goes from strength to strength with
every report,” Kumar said. “Similar to other companies
which have reported earlier, we expect Chubb to be at the
leading edge of raising pricing.”  Chubb earned an underwriting profit of 13.7 cents on every
dollar it collected in premiums for the quarter, compared with a
loss of 2.6 cents a year earlier. Catastrophe costs declined to
$17 million from $420 million.  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
$60.99 a share from  $58.54  at the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
