Portugal  sold 50 million euros
($64.8 million) of notes due in January 2018, giving investors
the option of redeeming the securities at an earlier date,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The securities were sold with an initial coupon of 3.75
percent and from Jan. 29, 2015, they will yield 250 basis points
more than the six-month euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
the data show.  The notes were sold through a private placement to domestic
investors and Banco BPI SA was the bookrunner, said an official
at that bank, who asked not to be identified because they
weren’t authorized to talk to the media.  Portugal is looking for opportunities to do private
placements as it tries to regain access to longer-term debt
markets, Joao Moreira Rato, chairman of government debt agency
IGCP, said on Oct. 4. While the nation has continued selling
bills, it hasn’t sold bonds since requesting an international
bailout in April 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
