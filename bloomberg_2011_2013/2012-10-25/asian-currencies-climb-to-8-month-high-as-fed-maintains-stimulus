Asian currencies  rose to an eight-
month high as regional stocks snapped a four-day slump after the
Federal Reserve said it will maintain pro-growth policies to
support a recovery in the world’s largest economy.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active Asian currencies outside of  Japan ,
reached the highest level since February. The Fed yesterday
repeated interest rates may stay near zero at least through
mid-2015 and kept unchanged a bond-purchase plan unveiled last
month. China’s yuan hit a 19-year high and  Malaysia ’s ringgit
climbed the most in six weeks on optimism the U.S. central
bank’s policies will support demand for higher-yielding assets.  “We expect Asian currencies to continue to show moderate
strength,” said Roy Teo, a foreign-exchange strategist in
Singapore at ABN Amro Bank NV. “The Fed will keep buying bonds,
maybe add Treasuries to its purchases, to support growth.”  The ringgit rallied 0.7 percent to 3.0390 per dollar as of
4:37 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Taiwan ’s dollar appreciated 0.2 percent to NT$29.280
and South Korea’s won advanced 0.5 percent to a one-year high of
1,098.05.  India ’s rupee rose 0.4 percent to 53.53.  The Fed called U.S. growth “moderate” and maintained its
open-ended program to buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed bonds a
month, after a two-day policy meeting in  Washington  yesterday.
Foreign investors have plowed almost $8 billion into the stock
markets of India, South Korea and  Indonesia  since the program
was announced on Sept. 13, exchange data show.  U.S. Recovery  The Asia Dollar Index rose 0.34 percent, the most since
Sept. 14, while its 60-day historical volatility fell to 2.26
percent from 2.30 percent. New home sales in America rose 5.7
percent last month, the most since April 2010, a report showed
yesterday.  “Expectations that the U.S. will continue to grow have
helped improve risk appetite,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of
foreign-exchange research at  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  in Singapore.
“The better home sales data in the U.S. also helped.”  China’s  yuan  gained 0.1 percent to 6.2417 per dollar, the
strongest level since the government unified the official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. The central bank set
its daily yuan reference rate stronger for the first time in
five days.  ‘Support the Yuan’  “We are seeing more bets on a rebound in China’s growth in
the coming quarters,” said Daniel Chan, executive vice
president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The
weakness in the dollar will also support the yuan as the Fed
continues with quantitative easing.”  The Philippine peso climbed 0.4 percent to 41.208 per
dollar. The central bank today cut its overnight rate to 3.5
percent from 3.75 percent, a move predicted by 14 of 21
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Seven had expected no change.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht rose 0.2 percent to 30.67 per
dollar. Indonesia’s rupiah was steady at 9,611 and Vietnam’s
dong was little changed at 20,848. Financial markets in
Malaysia, Indonesia,  Philippines  and  Singapore  will be closed
tomorrow for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
