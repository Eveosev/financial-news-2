Dominion Resources Inc. (D)  said it and
an unnamed shipping company terminated an agreement for
liquefied natural gas to be processed and shipped from the
company’s planned Cove Point export facility.  Dominion is in talks with other potential customers and
expects to complete agreements for the terminal’s planned
capacity by the end of the year, Dan Donovan, a spokesman for
Dominion Energy, said in a telephone interview today.  The contract with the company, which Dominion declined to
name, was terminated “by mutual consent” this month, Donovan
said.  Sumitomo Corp. (8053) ,  Japan ’s third-largest trading house, said
April 27 that it and  Tokyo Gas Co. (9531)  had agreed to buy 2.3 million
metric tons of liquefied natural gas annually for 20 years from
Cove Point. Dominion, which still needs U.S. approval to sell to
Japan, plans to start exports at the Maryland terminal in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
