Argentina ’s benchmark deposit rate
plunged to the lowest level in a month, according to data
compiled by the central bank.  The average rate on 30-day deposits of at least 1 million
pesos ($210,600), known as the badlar, fell to 14.0625 percent
yesterday from 15 percent on Oct. 22. the central bank said.  The rate, which serves as a benchmark for loans, is the
lowest since Sept. 19, when it was 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
