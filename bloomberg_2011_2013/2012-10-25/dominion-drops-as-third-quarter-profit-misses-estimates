Dominion Resources Inc. (D) , owner of
 Virginia ’s largest electric utility, fell to the lowest in four
months after third-quarter earnings lagged analysts’ estimates.  Dominion, based in Richmond, Virginia,  declined  1 percent
to $51.95 at the close in  New York , the lowest price since June
5. The shares have dropped 2.1 percent this year.  Net income decreased to $209 million, or 36 cents a share,
from $392 million, or 69 cents, a year earlier, the company said
in a statement today. Excluding costs from shuttering plants
like the Kewaunee nuclear reactor, profit was 92 cents a share,
5 cents less than the average of 14 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Dominion was hurt by lower-than-normal humidity that caused
customers to run air conditioners less in the July-to-September
period, Chief Financial Officer Mark McGettrick said during an
earnings conference call today.  The quarter was “tough” for all of the company’s units,
Julien Dumoulin-Smith, a New York-based analyst with UBS
Securities LLC, wrote in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
