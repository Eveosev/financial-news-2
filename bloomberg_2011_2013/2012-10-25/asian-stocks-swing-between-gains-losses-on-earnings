Asian  stocks  gained, with the

that counts the U.S. as its biggest market, rose 1.1 percent in

slowdown and  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “The economy is recovering in the U.S., allowing investors
to have a certain amount of confidence,” said  Mitsushige Akino ,
who helps oversees about $626 million in assets at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. in Tokyo. “To a certain extent,
weaker corporate earnings have already been priced in, so
earnings shouldn’t drive down the overall market any further,
but individual shares will react.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  advanced 1.1 percent as the
yen touched a four-month low againstr the dollar.  Australia ’s

percent today. The gauge lost 0.3 percent yesterday in New York
as the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy is still growing

more than two years.  Exporters advanced. James Hardie rose 1.1 percent to

maker, climbed 1.7 percent to 1.322 million won in  Seoul . Toyota

lowest level versus the U.S. dollar in four months as investors
speculated that the Bank of Japan will expand monetary stimulus

companies when repatriated.  Chinese electricity producers advanced. The nation’s
industrial output will rise in the fourth quarter,  Zhu Hongren ,
chief engineering at the Ministry of Industry and Information

2.17 trillion won ($2 billion). That beat the 2.05 trillion won
average of 27 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 3.6 percent, in line with estimates.  Among stocks that dropped, Sharp Corp. sank 4.2 percent to
160 yen in Tokyo after the Nikkei newspaper reported that the

billion yen.  Of the 102 companies on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  that
