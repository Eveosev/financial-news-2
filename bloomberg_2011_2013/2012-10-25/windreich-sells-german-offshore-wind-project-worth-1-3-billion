Windreich AG, a German offshore wind
developer, agreed to sell a project planned for the North Sea
that requires more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of
investment to an unspecified private-equity firm.  Windreich was retained by the buyer to build and operate
the 210-megawatt Deutsche Bucht venture, the Wolfschlugen-based
company said today in a statement. The buyer is an “Anglo-Saxon
financial investor,” it added, without elaborating.  The cost of the 42-turbine project 94 kilometers (58 miles)
north of the island of Borkum includes foundations, cabling and
substations, according to Windreich. The facility has a grid
connection agreement and will use turbines made by  Areva SA. (AREVA)   To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
