The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index increased 2 basis points to
211 basis points as of 10:01 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The measure, which has ranged from 168.5 basis
points to 229.5 basis points since June, is set for its highest
close since Oct. 17, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1.5 to 123 as of 8:03 a.m. in
Hong Kong,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show. The gauge, which has
ranged from 112.6 to 175.3 in the second half, is set for its
fifth-consecutive day of increases, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 1 to 143 as of
11:02 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The
benchmark is on course for its highest close since Oct. 16,
according to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
