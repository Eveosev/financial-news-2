Felix Magath left his post as
Wolfsburg coach today as the club lies at the bottom of German
soccer’s Bundesliga.  “The supervisory board of VfL Wolfsburg and Felix Magath
have agreed to end their cooperation,” the team said in a
statement on its website. It said he’d volunteered to step down
in the interests of the club.  Magath led Wolfsburg to its first league title in 2009. He
then had a spell at Schalke before returning to the Wolves, who
have picked up only five points in eight games this season.  Reserve team coach Lorenz-Guenther Koestner has taken over
the first team on an interim basis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
