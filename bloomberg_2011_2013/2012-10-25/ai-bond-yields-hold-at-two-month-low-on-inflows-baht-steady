The yield on  Thailand ’s five-year
government bonds held at a two-month low after foreign funds
pumped money into the nation’s debt. The baht was little changed.  Overseas investors bought $338 million more Thai sovereign
notes than they sold this week through yesterday, according to
 data  from the Thai Bond Market Association. The  Federal Reserve 
said yesterday it will maintain stimulus after last month
committing to a third round of debt purchases, a policy that
boosts the supply of dollars which can be invested in emerging-
market assets. The  Bank of Japan  also expanded its asset-buying
program in September.  “There’s plenty of liquidity provided by central banks in
advanced nations,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-
ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “Fiscal problems
for developed nations remain a concern and therefore, investors
are willing to put more money into emerging-market bonds than
stocks.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent securities due June 2017 was
steady at 3.09 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 13,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield has dropped
22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, this month.  The baht traded at 30.71 per dollar, compared with 30.72
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, held at 4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
