Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) , the high-speed
Internet partner of  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , reported a narrower
third-quarter loss than estimated after adding subscribers and
cutting expenses.  The loss from continuing operations was 7 cents a share,
the Bellevue, Washington-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts had predicted a loss of 28 cents on average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales slipped 5.5
percent to $313.9 million, topping the estimate of $311.9
million.  Even as Clearwire improves its finances, investors are
speculating that its long-term future is tied to joint-venture
partner Sprint. Tokyo-based  Softbank Corp. (9984)  agreed last week to
pay $20 billion for a 70 percent stake in Sprint, giving the
company cash for acquisitions. Sprint, the third-largest U.S.
wireless carrier, already owns 50.3 percent of Clearwire.  Clearwire cut its 2012 capital spending forecast by more
than half to about $125 million to $175 million. The savings
arise from its decision to delay construction of its long-term
evolution network as the company aligns with Sprint’s own LTE
schedule, Clearwire Chief Executive Officer Erik Prusch said on
a call with analysts today.  Spending Cut  The spending cut will help reduce a projected 2012 adjusted
loss in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization by about $25 million, according to the company’s
statement. Clearwire now expects to post an adjusted Ebitda loss
of about $150 million to $200 million.  Clearwire’s third-quarter loss was $41.3 million, compared
with a loss of $83.5 million, or 34 cents a share, a year
earlier. Including discontinued operations, the loss was $213.8
million, due primarily to  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  and Comcast
Corp. converting their shares during the period.  Clearwire  shares  were little changed in after-hours trading
following the report. The stock had fallen 3.7 percent to $1.80
at the close in New York.  The company’s subscribers rose 10 percent to about 10.5
million last quarter. Clearwire also spent less on retail
marketing. The retail cost of adding subscribers was $191
apiece, compared with $288 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
