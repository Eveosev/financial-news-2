Ex-England rugby forward Andy 
Hazell has been banned for 14 weeks for striking an opponent in
an Amlin Challenge Cup game on Oct. 11.  The Gloucester player was red-carded for the incident
involving Sebastien Ormaechea during the 11-6 win over Mont-de-
Marsan in  France .  The independent judicial officer, Roger Morris, ruled that
Hazell had “intentionally struck Ormaechea with both the fist
and the knee,” tournament organizer European Rugby Cup said on
its website. Hazell pleaded guilty to striking Ormaechea.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
