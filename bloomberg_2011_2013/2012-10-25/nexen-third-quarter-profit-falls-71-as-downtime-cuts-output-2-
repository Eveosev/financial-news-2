Nexen Inc. (NXY) , the oil and natural gas
producer that agreed to be acquired by  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  for $15.1
billion, said third-quarter profit declined 71 percent as
maintenance lowered output.  Net income fell to C$59 million ($59.4 million), or 11
cents a share, from C$200 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said today in a statement on its
website. Revenue declined 1 percent to C$1.51 billion, exceeding
the C$1.43 billion average of two analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Cnooc,  China ’s largest offshore oil producer, is awaiting
 Canada ’s decision on its July 23 bid for Nexen. The government
this month rejected Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd.’s offer
for  Progress Energy Resources Corp. (PRQ)  Nexen expects the
transaction to close in the fourth quarter, according to the
statement.  The takeover has “over a 50 percent chance” of closing,
Phil Skolnick, a New York-based analyst at Canaccord Genuity
Corp., said in a note to clients today. The $27.50-a-share offer
price may change as Canada will “more than likely” place
conditions on any approval of the deal, he said. Skolnick rates
the stock a sell.  Cnooc said yesterday it expects the Nexen deal, China’s
biggest foreign takeover, to be completed this year. Foreign
takeovers valued at more than C$330 million require the
government to determine a “net benefit” to Canada.  Output Declines  Average daily output declined 15 percent to 181,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day due to maintenance at the Buzzard field
in the  North Sea  and the Long Lake oil-sands project in  Alberta ,
according to the statement. Nexen lowered its fourth-quarter
production forecast to 180,000 to 200,000 barrels a day because
of a delay ramping up Buzzard field. Its annual output target
remains 185,000 to 220,000 barrels a day.  Maintenance work at the Long Lake project was completed
without “significant issues,” Nexen said. Bitumen production
is back to about 34,000 barrels a day, it said in the statement.  Nexen rose 0.3 percent to C$23.70 at the close in Toronto.
