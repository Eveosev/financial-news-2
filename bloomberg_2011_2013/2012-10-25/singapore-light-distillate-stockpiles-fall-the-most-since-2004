Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
21 percent last week, the most since April 2004, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate dropped 2.38 million barrels to 8.99 million in the
seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest percentage
decline since the week ended April 28, 2004.  Middle-distillate inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene rose 173,000 barrels, or 1.6 percent, to 11
million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies increased a third
week to the highest level since March 21.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels  including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen climbed 2.68 million
barrels, or 14 percent, to 22 million, according to the data.
That’s the largest gain since July 4.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
