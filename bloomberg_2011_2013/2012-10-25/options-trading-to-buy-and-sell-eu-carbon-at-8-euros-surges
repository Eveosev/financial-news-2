Trading in the options to buy and
sell December European Union carbon permits at 8 euros ($10.41)
a metric ton surged today.  The volume of the option to buy at that level surged to
2.85 million tons from 350,000 tons yesterday, according to data
from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . The option’s
price dropped 13 percent yesterday to 53 cents a ton, the lowest
since Sept. 24, the data show. Options to buy at 9 and 10 euros
a ton also traded this week.  The strike of 8 euros is above today’s futures contract
price of 7.56 euros a ton. EU lawmakers are considering plans to
fix a glut of supply in the region’s carbon market, where prices
have dropped 30 percent in the past year.  The volume of options to sell at 8 euros surged to 2.6
million tons today from nothing yesterday, the ICE data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
