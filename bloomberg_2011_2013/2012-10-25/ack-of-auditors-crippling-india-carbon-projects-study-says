A shortage of auditors is making it
harder for Indian companies to register emission-reduction
projects with a United Nations program to earn carbon credits,
according to a study released today.  More than 70 percent of respondents in a survey conducted
by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry
said costs are rising and projects in the country are stalling
because there arenâ€™t enough auditors to check for compliance
with 1997 Kyoto Protocol rules.  India  is the second-biggest host after  China  of projects
earning Certified Emission Reduction credits, which are bought
by governments and companies in rich nations to compensate for
emissions. A collapse in carbon prices and uncertainty about the
future of the UN Clean Development Mechanism program is causing
major European auditors like  SGS SA (SGSN) , Det Norske Veritas Ltd.,
Tuev Sued and  Bureau Veritas SA (BVI)  to shift out of such work to
other businesses, according to the survey.  A political logjam over pollution limits in the second
Kyoto commitment period starting 2013 has caused prices in the
offset market to plunge. CERs for December delivery have plunged
89 percent in the past year and are trading at a record-low of
80 euro cents ($1.04), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  That may lead to audit firms not accepting jobs from Jan. 1
because of the risks associated with their work, the Designated
Operational Entities and Independent Entities Association in
Geneva, a lobby group representing auditors, said in a report
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
