Heavy Canadian oil weakened to the
widest discount to West Texas Intermediate since July after
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said this week demand to ship crude on four lines
exceeded available space.  The Calgary-based company said Oct. 23 November shipments
on its 491,200 barrel-a-day Line 5 will be apportioned by 17
percent. Demand also surpassed capacity on Lines 6A, 62, 6B and
14. Canadian shipments of oil to the U.S. were lower than normal
after TransCanada Corp. shut its Keystone pipeline Oct. 17 for
repairs on a section of pipe crossing the border between
Missouri and  Illinois . The line was restarted Oct. 22.  The discount for Western Canada Select, a heavy crude grade
from  Alberta , versus WTI, the U.S. benchmark, widened $2.50 to
$25 a barrel at 2:05 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Its the cheapest the blend has traded at
since July 6.  The premium of Syncrude, a synthetic light blend, to WTI
was unchanged at 75 cents a barrel. Bakken’s discount increased
50 cents to $1.25.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast grades strengthened.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 50 cents to
$21.60. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened 70 cents to
$22.80.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 75 cents to $13.75
a barrel. The premium for  Thunder Horse  was steady at $18.50 a
barrel. The Gulf crudes compete with seaborne imports.  Mars Blend gained 35 cents to $15.35 a barrel over WTI and
Poseidon’s premium increased 25 cents to $15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
