Stateâ€™s tax collections rose for the
10th straight quarter in the second quarter of 2012, according
to the most recent report from the  Rockefeller Institute  of
Government.  State tax revenues were up 3.2 percent in the April-June
quarter compared to the same period in 2011, the report said.
Total state tax collections were still below the peak levels
reported in 2008 and the growth in state tax collections has
been softening and may weaken further in the coming months, the
report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
