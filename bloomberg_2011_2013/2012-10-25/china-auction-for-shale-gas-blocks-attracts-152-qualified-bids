China ’s second round of shale-gas
auctions attracted 152 bids from 83 companies, as the nation
allowed non-state entities to participate in the sale for the
first time.  Nineteen of the 20 blocks offered in today’s auction
received at least three bids, the minimum required for a block’s
auction to proceed, according to a statement posted to the
website of the Ministry of Land and Resources today. A block,
which received two bids, was removed from the auction.  China, holder of the world’s biggest shale reserves, has
yet to produce the unconventional fuel commercially, while
output in the U.S. quadrupled in 2010 from 2007. The ministry
allowed China’s private companies to join the bidding to boost
the pace of China’s shale-gas exploration.  “Private companies can bring passion and innovation to an
industry that has not seen much innovation in the past,” said
Laban Yu, head of Asia oil and gas equity research at Jefferies
 Hong Kong  Ltd. “Small energy companies are the ones that
triggered the U.S. shale-gas boom and the same thing could
happen in China.”  The blocks provided in the auction cover 20,002 square
kilometers (7,722 square miles) across eight provinces in China.
A qualified bidder must have at least 300 million  yuan  ($48
million) of registered capital and hold relevant licenses.
Foreign companies are allowed to join the auction only through
ventures with local companies.  China Reserves  China aims to produce 6.5 billion cubic meters (230.37
billion cubic feet) of shale gas annually by 2015 and 60 billion
to 100 billion cubic meters by the end of the decade, the
National Development and Reform Commission said in March. The
country holds 25.08 trillion cubic meters of exploitable
reserves of the fuel, according to the land and resources
ministry.  The U.S. has an estimated 482 trillion cubic feet (13.6
trillion cubic meters) of technically recoverable shale gas,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration website.  China’s natural-gas consumption will increase fourfold by
2030 to 600 billion cubic meters a year, accounting for 30
percent of the global growth in gas demand, Wood Mackenzie Ltd.
said June 6. The nation’s “ambitious” target for 2020 may be
delayed by the need for better understanding of its shale
formations and insufficient technical know-how, supply-chain
services and infrastructure, according to the Edinburgh,
Scotland-based consultant.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , the nation’s second-
largest oil company, and Henan Provincial Coal Seam Gas
Development and Utilization Co. won the exploration rights in
the nation’s first shale-gas auction in June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
