A European Union audit of eastern
Europe slaughterhouses found weaknesses in the application of
hygiene standard rules, the European Cpurt of Auditors said.  The audit included visits to slaughterhouses in the  Czech
Republic , Hungary,  Poland , Romania and Slovenia, the court said
today in an online  statement . Those countries received payments
through a 117 million euro ($152 million) program started in
2004 to bring processing facilities in new member countries up
to standards required for the rest of the bloc, it said.  “These weaknesses do not call into question the overall
design of the systems, but demonstrate the need for increased
rigor in the application of checks at all levels to mitigate
risks and avoid potentially serious problems to  food safety ,”
the EU said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
