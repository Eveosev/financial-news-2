Some winter grain crops in southern
regions of Russia, world’s third-biggest  wheat exporter  last
season, are suffering due to a lack of moisture, the Federal
Hydrometeorological Center said.  About 35 percent to 40 percent of sown areas in “certain
districts” in the southeast and center of Stavropol, southeast
of Rostov, and south of the Volgograd regions lack water, Anna
Strashnaya, head of agricultural forecasts department at the
weather center, said by phone in Moscow today. Fields in
Krasnodar region have enough moisture, she said.  “There is a problem of moisture insufficiency but there is
no catastrophe,” Strashnaya said. Rains are forecast in the
south for Oct. 29 and Oct. 30, which could help growth, she
said.  Crops are expected to complete the first growing stage by
about Nov. 25, when the center will be able to give preliminary
estimates of potential winter-grain losses, she said.  Russia ’s southern federal district, the country’s main
exporting area, accounted for 22.6 million metric tons of
grains, or 24 percent of the national crop, last season,
according to state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
