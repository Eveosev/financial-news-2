South Korean  consumer confidence 
fell to a nine-month low, a sign that domestic spending may be
weakening as  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing growth in  emerging
markets  weigh on exports.  The  sentiment index  was at 98 in October from 99 in
September, the Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed statement
today. A reading below 100 indicates pessimists outnumber
optimists.  South Korea may report today that the nation’s  economy
 expanded 1.7 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier,
the slowest pace in three years, according to a Bloomberg
survey. Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said in a Bloomberg News
interview on Oct. 9 that economic growth reached a “bottom” in
the third quarter.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 1,999 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between Oct. 12 and Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
