German 10-year bunds stayed lower
after a report showed euro-area M3 money supply growth
unexpectedly slowed last month.  The  10-year yield  climbed five basis points to 1.60 percent
at 9:07 a.m. London time. Two-year note yields rose two basis
points to 0.10 percent.  Annual M3 growth was 2.7 percent in September, down from a
revised 2.8 percent a month earlier, according to European
Central Bank data today. A Bloomberg survey called for a 3
percent acceleration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
