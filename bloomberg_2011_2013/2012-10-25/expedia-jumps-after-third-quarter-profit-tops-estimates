Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  surged the most in
three months after the second-most valuable online travel agency
reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  Excluding some items, profit rose 4.2 percent to $188
million, or $1.32 a share, from $180.5 million, or $1.28, a year
earlier, the Bellevue, Washington-based company said yesterday
in a  statement . Analysts on average expected profit to decline
to $1.26 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Expedia, which gets more than 40 percent of its business
outside the U.S., expanded even as the European sovereign-debt
crisis entered its third year. International revenue rose 22
percent in the period, surpassing domestic growth of 14 percent.
Hotel reservations accounted for 77 percent of worldwide sales,
while 7 percent came from airlines.  Expedia, which has more than doubled this year,  rose  15
percent to $59.06 at the close in  New York , the biggest gain
since July 27.  Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , Expedia’s larger rival, has yet to
report quarterly results. The Norwalk, Connecticut-based company
generated 60 percent of sales last year outside of the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
