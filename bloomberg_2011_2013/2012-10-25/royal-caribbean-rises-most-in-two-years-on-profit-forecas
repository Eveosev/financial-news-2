Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) , the
world’s second-largest cruise operator, rose the most in two
years after posting third-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates and raising its forecast for the year.  Royal Caribbean, based in Miami, gained 11 percent to
$34.53 at 11:07 a.m. in  New York  and rose as much as 12 percent
to mark the biggest  intraday advance  since October 2010. The
stock had added 26 percent this year as of yesterday.  For the quarter, typically the biggest of the year, profit
of $1.68 a share beat the $1.46 average of 26 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income fell 7.8 percent to
$367.8 million from $399 million, or $1.82 a share, a year
earlier as revenue shrank 9 percent, the company said today in a
 statement . Sales met analysts’ projections of about $2.22
billion.  The company also said it’s “encouraged by the trends so
far” for 2013, citing higher booked load factors, a measure of
capacity use.  For the year, Royal Caribbean  forecasts  profit of $1.85 to
$1.95 a share, an increase from the previous projection of $1.70
to $1.80 a share. Analysts were estimating $1.79.  To contact the reporter on this story:
