BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s Laurence D. Fink
said if the euro currency region falls apart it’s more likely to
be caused by a lack of competitiveness in  France  than by
economic troubles in Italy or Spain.  “France’s competitiveness has continued to be worse versus
Germany,” Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of the
world’s largest asset manager, said today at the Economist’s
Buttonwood Gathering in New York. He called France
“structurally uncompetitive.”  Fink said it’s better to have Greece as part of the euro
area because a separation would be costly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
