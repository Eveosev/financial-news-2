Angie’s List, the consumer-review
website, posted a record surge after reporting sales that beat
estimates as more members paid to use the service.  The shares climbed 27 percent to $11.56 at the close of
regular trading in New York, for the biggest gain since the
stock began trading on Nov. 17, 2011. The stock has lost 28
percent this year.  Founded in 1995 by Angie Hicks, the company charges
membership fees to access reviews of plumbers, electricians and
other service providers. Vendors can also pay to advertise on
the site. Third-quarter revenue increased 75 percent to $42
million, compared with the same period a year earlier, the
company said in a statement yesterday. Analysts on average had
estimated sales of $41.33 million. Total paid membership rose 68
percent to 1.66 million.  “Another top line beat solidifies growth prospects at
Angie’s List,” wrote Andre Sequin, an analyst at RBC Capital
Markets, in a note to clients today. “Angie’s List has
continued to achieve milestones on its way to profitability.”  The Indianapolis-based company forecast fourth-quarter
sales of $45 million to $46 million, compared with an average
estimate of $45.7 million.  In the third quarter, Angie’s List had a net loss of $18.5
million, or 32 cents a share, compared with a loss of $17.4
million, or 66 cents, a year earlier.  Angie’s List also announced a new pay structure for sales
staff, that will add a base salary to compensation that had
previously been commission-only.  That change “should free up additional working capital
which can be used to drive further growth,” Sequin wrote.  Angie’s List raised $114 million in an IPO last November
after pricing shares at $13 apiece, the top of the proposed
range, and held a secondary offering May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
