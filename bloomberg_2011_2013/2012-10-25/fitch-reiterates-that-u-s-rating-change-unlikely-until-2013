Fitch Ratings  said its negative
outlook on the U.S.’s AAA credit ranking is still unlikely to
change before late 2013 as it waits to assess any deficit-
reduction plans following this year’s elections.  Brian Bertsch, a Fitch spokesman in New York, said in an e-
mail today to  Bloomberg News , that anyone who has questions
about the status of the rating should review the statement put
out by the company in July.  While the U.S.’s top grade is “underpinned” by factors
including the nation’s diversified and productive economy and
financial flexibility from the dollar’s status as the reserve
currency, the outlook “reflects the risks associated with the
lack of broad public and political agreement on how to secure
 deficit reduction ,” Fitch said July 10 in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
