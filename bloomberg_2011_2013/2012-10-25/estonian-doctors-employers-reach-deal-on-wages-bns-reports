Estonian medical workers reached an
agreement with their employers on wage increases and lower
workloads that may end a 3 1/2-week nationwide strike,  Baltic
News Service  reported, citing the doctorsâ€™ union.  Minimum wages for hospice workers will rise 23 percent from
March, with pay increases of 17.5 percent and 11 percent for
nurses and doctors, respectively, BNS reported today. Workloads
will be reduced by 20 percent in out-patient care and by 16
percent in in-patient care, it added.  The employers, financed by the Health Insurance Fund, last
month offered a pay increase of 6.6 percent starting next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
