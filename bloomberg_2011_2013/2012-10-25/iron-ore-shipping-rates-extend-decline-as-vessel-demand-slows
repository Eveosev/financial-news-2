Iron-ore shipping rates slid for a
second day amid speculation producers of the raw material are
seeking fewer vessels after rates more than doubled this month.  Day rates for Capesize vessels, which haul about 160,000
metric tons of the cargo as well as raw materials including
coal, fell 6 percent to $16,769 a day, according to data from
the Baltic Exchange in  London . The Baltic Dry Index, a wider
measure of commodity transportation costs, fell 3.4 percent.  Strengthening iron-ore demand from Chinese  steel mills 
helped drive freight costs to the highest since January on Oct.
23. Miners may be temporarily curbing bookings following that
rally, causing costs to fall, said Philippe Van Den Abeele, the
London-based managing director of Castalia Fund Management
(U.K.) Ltd., an adviser to a hedge fund trading freight
derivatives.  “It is a pause for breath,” he said by phone today. “We
are in a fairly strong market with strong restocking going on in
 China  until the end of the year.”  Iron-ore prices at the Chinese port of Tianjin rose 1.1
percent to $120 a dry metric ton, according to data from the
Steel Index. They gained 38 percent since Sept. 5.  The three other vessel categories tracked by the  Baltic
Exchange  also declined. Rates for Panamaxes, which are about
half the size of Capesizes, fell 1.7 percent to $6,480, the
bourse’s data show. Supramaxes declined 0.8 percent to $7,386.
Handysizes slid 0.8 percent to $6,430.  To contact the reporter on this story:
