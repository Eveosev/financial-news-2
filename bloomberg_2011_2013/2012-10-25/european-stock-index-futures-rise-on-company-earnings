European stocks climbed for a second
day as companies including Unilever and  Sanofi (SAN)  posted results
that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Unilever gained 2.6 percent, its biggest advance in almost
three months, after quarterly sales grew faster than analysts
had projected. Sanofi rose 1.4 percent after  France ’s largest
drugmaker reported third-quarter profit that retreated less than
analysts had predicted.  Daimler AG (DAI)  slid 2.7 percent after the
world’s third-largest luxury carmaker abandoned its profit-
margin target for 2013.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index increased 0.3 percent to 270.23
at the close in London as a report showed the U.K. moved out of
recession in the third quarter. The gauge has still declined 1.4
percent so far this week as company earnings missed estimates.
The equity benchmark has  risen 16 percent  from a June 4 low as
the  European Central Bank  and the  Federal Reserve  announced
open-ended bond-buying programs.  “With Europe still in recession, expectations of earnings
have been moderate, so many companies beat estimates,” said
 Manish Singh , who helps oversee $2 billion of assets as head of
investment at Crossbridge Capital in London. “Perhaps investors
are ready to wait for things to get better. On the U.K. gross
domestic product, the initial cheer may be short lived. We won’t
have an Olympics every quarter and we need more confirmation to
feel the U.K. is out of recession.”  Earnings Season  Thirty-four companies in the Stoxx 600 post earnings today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 89 companies
that have reported  profit  so far this season, 47 have beaten
estimates, while 41 have missed them.  The U.K.’s economy expanded in the third quarter more than
predicted, rebounding from a recession.  Gross domestic product 
climbed 1 percent from the second quarter, when it dropped 0.4
percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said. Economists in
a Bloomberg survey had predicted a 0.6 percent increase.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department release showed orders
for  durable goods  rose 9.9 percent in September. They dropped a
revised 13.1 percent in August.  Economists had forecast  a 7.5
percent increase.  A Labor Department report showed that  jobless claims 
declined to 369,000 in the week ended Oct. 20, following a
revised 392,000 a week earlier. The  median estimate  of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for 370,000.  National benchmark indexes declined in 10 of the 18
western- European (SXXP)  markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was unchanged,
while France’s CAC 40 retreated 0.4 percent.  Germany ’s DAX
advanced 0.1 percent.  Unilever, BASF  Unilever gained 2.6 percent to 28.45 euros, its largest
rally since July, after the world’s second-biggest consumer-
goods company said third-quarter revenue grew 5.9 percent. That
beat the 5.3 percent increase estimated by analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Sanofi climbed 1.4 percent to 67.04 euros after the company
reported a 7.4 percent decline in business net income,  which
excludes some costs, to 2.22 billion euros ($2.9 billion). That
exceeded the 2.01 billion-euro estimate of 14 analysts compiled
by Bloomberg. The drugmaker also said earnings will drop this
year less than it had forecast.  Debenhams Plc (DEB)  jumped 9.2 percent to 119 pence, the highest
price in five years, after saying it will continue to buy back
shares next year. The U.K. department-store retailer raised its
target for online sales to 600 million pounds ($967 million)
from 500 million pounds and said it plans to have a total of 150
franchise stores within the next five years.  Daimler, WPP  Daimler slipped 2.7 percent to 36.79 euros after the German
carmaker lowered its 2012 forecast and said it will no longer
reach its 2013 operating-margin targets because of tougher
market conditions. Daimler said late yesterday that  full-year
Ebit  will decrease 11 percent to 8 billion euros. The owner of
the Mercedes-Benz brand had said it would match last year’s 9
billion euros.  WPP Plc (WPP)  fell 2.3 percent to 789.5 pence after cutting its
full-year  sales growth target  for the second time in two months.
The world’s largest advertising company said revenue, excluding
currency fluctuations and acquisitions, will grow 2.5 percent to
3 percent, compared with a previous forecast of about 3.5
percent.  France Telecom SA (FTE)  slid 5.2 percent to 8.83 euros after
saying it will pay a dividend of 80 cents in both 2012 and 2013.
The former telecommunications monopoly made a payout of 1.40
euros in 2011.  Logitech International SA (LOGN)  plunged 16 percent to 6.92
francs, its biggest tumble in nine years, after the world’s
largest maker of computer mice forecast lower sales and
operating profit in the second half of the current fiscal year
than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
