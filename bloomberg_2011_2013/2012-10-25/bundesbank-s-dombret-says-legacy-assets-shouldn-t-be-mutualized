Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said bad debts held by banks before the arrival of a new
supervisory mechanism shouldn’t be assumed by  Europe ’s joint
bailout fund.  “Legacy assets are those risks which evolved under the
responsibility of national supervisors,” Dombret said during a
speech in Dublin today. “It follows that these assets have to
be dealt with by the respective member states. Anything else
would amount to a fiscal transfer.”  Irish optimism that the country would be able to receive
funds from the European Stability Mechanism to help reduce the
burden of its 64 billion-euro ($83 billion) bank rescue was
dented last month when the finance ministers of  Germany , the
Netherlands and  Finland  said so-called legacy assets would be
excluded from the bailout facility. While German Chancellor
Angela Merkel conceded Oct. 21 that Ireland is a “special
case,” the Bundesbank remains against permitting such a move.  Dombret said allowing countries to repair their banking
sectors using ESM funds would rapidly overburden the facility. A
joint supervisor based at the ECB to oversee financial risks, as
part of a wider banking union in the euro area, may also take
time to materialize, he said.  “No doubt, the banking union is an important building
block for a more stable monetary union,” Dombret said. “But,
as such, it is meant to mitigate future risks and not to cover
past sins.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
