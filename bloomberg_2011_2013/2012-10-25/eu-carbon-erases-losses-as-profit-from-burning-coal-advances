European Union emission permits
erased losses as profits from burning coal advanced.  EU allowances for December rose 2 cents to 7.69 euros
($9.97) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London  as of 5:15 p.m. They fell as much as 2.7 percent earlier
today to 7.46 euros, the lowest intraday price since Sept. 26.  The profit from burning coal for power in  Germany  in 2013
increased 2.3 percent to 10.78 euros a megawatt-hour, according
to a so-called dark-spread calculator on Bloomberg.  United Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December were unchanged at 84 euros cents a ton. Emission
Reduction Units for December were at yesterdayâ€™s record-low
closing level, 57 cents a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
