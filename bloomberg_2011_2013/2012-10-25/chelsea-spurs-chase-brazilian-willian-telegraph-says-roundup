The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Chelsea Chase  Chelsea may try to sign Shakhtar Donetsk’s Brazilian
midfielder Willian after he helped defeat the Blues in the
 Champions League , the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Tottenham could also try to sign Willian, who wants to
leave Shakhtar for the Premier League and would cost as much as
25 million pounds ($40.2 million), the Telegraph said.  Moutinho Move  Tottenham will miss out on signing Porto midfielder Joao
Moutinho, who appears headed to Paris Saint-Germain, the  Daily
Mail  reported.  Spurs coach Andre Villas-Boas’s attempt to lure Moutinho
collapsed on transfer deadline day over the player’s wage
demands and because of administrative errors, the Mail reported.  Adebayor Stays  Tottenham coach Villas-Boas won’t allow striker Emmanuel Adebayor to leave even though he isn’t commanding a regular
first-team berth, the  Evening Standard  reported.  Adebayor is currently acting as backup to  Jermain Defoe ,
with Spurs only employing a single striker, the Standard said.  Globe-Trotter  Landon Donovan  may reject a third loan stint at Everton and
go traveling around the world on his own instead, the  Daily Mail 
reported.  The 30-year-old  Los Angeles Galaxy  forward said he needs
time to think over what to do next, according to the Mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
