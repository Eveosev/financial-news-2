A district court in St Petersburg,
 Russia ’s second-largest city, postponed for the second time a
hearing on a lawsuit against pop star Madonna.  Nine city residents filed a 333 million-ruble ($10.6
million) suit against Louise Veronica Ciccone, also known as
Madonna, for allegedly violating cultural traditions and
promulgating homosexuality during her Aug. 9 concert. They also
sued concert organizer PMI Corp. and the Peterburgsky Sports and
Concert complex, where the event took place. The court
rescheduled the hearing to Nov. 7.  The court ordered that ZAO Musical Industry, a unit of PMI
Corp., replace PMI Corp. as a defendant because it organized the
concert, Daria Dedova, one of the claimants, told reporters.
Olga Lototskaya, a spokeswoman for PMI Corp., called the suit
“stretched.” Madonna’s lawyers didn’t attend the hearings and
haven’t commented on the lawsuit so far.  Madonna is accused of breaking a law that was signed on
March 7 by  St. Petersburg  Governor Georgy Poltavchenko banning
lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-gender “propaganda.”The anti-
homosexual law bans comment or actions that give minors “the
false perception” that traditional and nontraditional
relationships are socially equal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
