Former  Morgan Stanley (MS)  investment
banker David Barrett is joining hedge fund Gotham Asset
Management LLC as head of  investor relations .  Barrett, 53, will start next week and oversee sales,
investor relations, marketing and business development, Co-Chief
Investment Officer Robert Goldstein said in an interview. New
York-based Gotham, headed by Gotham Capital Founder Joel
Greenblatt and Goldstein, had $1.45 billion of regulatory assets
under management as of Feb. 29, according to a  brochure  on the
firm’s website.  The firm uses a “proprietary analytical framework” to
identify company securities that are undervalued or overvalued,
according to the brochure. Greenblatt, 54, is the author of
“The Little Book That Beats the Market,” which was published
in 2005 and lays out a strategy that claims to “beat the market
and professional managers by a wide margin,” according to
Amazon.com.  Barrett was a 22-year veteran of Morgan Stanley before
leaving to seek a job outside banking, people with knowledge of
the matter said in August. He oversaw the firm’s private capital
markets unit, which raises money for  hedge funds  and private
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
