Vietnam ’s five-year bonds advanced,
pushing the yield to a two-week low, on speculation banks bought
debt amid a slowdown in lending. The dong was steady.  The amount of outstanding loans increased 2 percent this
year through September, Dau Tu newspaper reported yesterday
citing Tran Van Tan, head of the credit division at the central
bank’s credit department. Lending rose 14.4 percent last year,
the government said in May. Non-performing loans may have
accounted for as much as 8.8 percent of outstanding credit at
the end of June, Nguyen Van Giau, head of the National
Assembly’s Economic Committee, said Oct. 22.  “Banks cannot lend easily right now,” said Nguyen Tan Thang, fixed-income investment director at Ho Chi Minh City
Securities Joint-Stock Co. “There’s no demand and they are
still risk averse. They are more interested in bonds.”  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds fell seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 10.23 percent, the lowest
level since Oct. 10, according to a daily fixing rate from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  Vietnam’s economy needs to expand by 6.5 percent in the
fourth quarter to meet a 2012 growth target of 5.2 percent,
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said Oct. 22. That would be the
slowest full-year growth since 1999. The economy expanded 4.7
percent in the first nine months of 2012, official data show.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar as of 3:05 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,851 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
