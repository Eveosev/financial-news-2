South Korea ’s economy grew at the
slowest pace in three years as  Europe ’s debt crisis and a
slowdown in  emerging markets  reduced corporate investment and
capped demand for exports.  Gross domestic product  expanded 1.6 percent in the three
months through September from a year earlier, the slowest pace
since 2009,  Bank of Korea  data showed today. That compares with
the median 1.7 percent estimate of 13 economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . Asia’s fourth-largest economy grew 0.2 percent
from a quarter ago.  Samsung Electronics Co., whose annual sales are the
equivalent of 13 percent of gross domestic product, today
reported higher-than-estimated earnings, bolstering the view
that the worst of the slowdown has passed. The gains by the
world’s biggest maker of mobile phones may also support the
government’s wait-and-see stance on any further stimulus for the
economy.  “This confirms that the Korean economy is at the bottom,”
said Sun Yoo, an economist at Woori Investment & Securities Co.
in  Seoul . “Growth is weak but it is there, with slight upturns
in exports and domestic consumption.”  South  Korea ’s won strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,096.95 per
dollar at 9:10 a.m. in Seoul, the strongest level since
September last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The benchmark Kospi Index fell 0.4 percent.  Less Confidence  Consumer confidence  in South Korea fell to a nine-month low
in October, according to a separate BOK statement today.  The BOK lowered its forecast for the nation’s 2012 growth
on Oct. 11 to 2.4 percent from a July estimate of 3 percent. The
economy will expand 3.2 percent next year, and the inflation
rate this year will be 2.3 percent, it said, below an earlier
prediction of 2.7 percent.  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said in an Oct. 9 interview
that the nation’s economy may see a “weak”  rebound  this
quarter after hitting bottom in the previous three months. The
BOK has cut rates twice this year and the government has
unveiled 14.4 trillion won ($13.1 billion) of economic support
measures.  The world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, the
slowest since the 2009 recession, and 3.6 percent next year,
compared with July predictions of 3.5 percent in 2012 and 3.9
percent in 2013, the  International Monetary Fund  said on Oct. 9.
It also reduced its forecasts for South Korea, now projecting
2.7 percent growth for 2012 and 3.6 percent for 2013.  Economy ‘Doldrums’  A global economy that “remains in the doldrums” has
delayed a recovery in South Korea’s steel industry,  Posco (005490)  Chief
Financial Officer Park Ki Hong told investors on Oct. 23.  Posco, Asia’s third-biggest steelmaker by output, cut its
2012 sales forecast for the third time this year after quarterly
profit missed analyst estimates.  South Korea’s exports fell for a third straight month in
September from a year earlier. Sales at major South Korean
department stores declined for the fourth straight month in
September as slowing economic growth weighed on confidence,
according to a government report on Oct. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
