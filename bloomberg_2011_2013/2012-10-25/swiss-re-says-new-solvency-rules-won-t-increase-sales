Swiss Re AG (SREN) , the world’s second-
largest reinsurer, said the introduction of new risk-based rules
for European insurers such as  Allianz SE (ALV)  and  Axa SA (CS)  won’t boost
its sales.  “Insurers will buy reinsurance coverage based on Solvency
II, but that will mean less business in some areas and more in
others,” Frank Reichelt, head of the Zurich-based reinsurer’s
German and Nordics business, said in an interview in Baden-
Baden,  Germany  on Oct. 22. “So all in all I expect the effect
to be neutral.”  The introduction of the European Union’s new rules for
insurers and reinsurers, dubbed Solvency II, has seen a number
of postponements and may be further delayed until 2016 as it
still needs approval from the European Parliament. The rules are
being developed by the Frankfurt-based European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Authority, or  Eiopa , and national
regulators.  Munich Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer,  has said  it
expects “that demand for reinsurance will continue to rise as a
consequence of the financial crisis and the introduction of
Solvency II.” Reinsurers help primary insurers shoulder risks
for clients. Buying reinsurance can help insurers reduce capital
requirements under the new solvency rules.  “Our customers are still waiting for the final
specifications on Solvency II,” Reichelt said. “While it’s
good to use some more time for some necessary adjustments, I
fear a further postponement will hurt the reputation of our
industry as we all need clear rules.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
