Citic Telecom International Holdings
Ltd. (1883)  may pay as much as $750 million for  Cable & Wireless
Communications Plc (CWC) ’s stake in a Macau phone operator, two people
familiar with the matter said.  The unit of  Citic Pacific Ltd. (267)  is negotiating with  Cable &
Wireless  on the price of its 51 percent stake in  Companhia de
Telecomunicacoes de Macau, S.A.R.L.  and the sale may fetch $700
million to $750 million, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private.  Citic Pacific said last week that Citic Telecom plans to
boost its holding in the Macau phone company to 71 percent,
without providing financial details. The unit bought 20 percent
of the company, also known as CTM, from Citic Pacific in
February 2011 for HK$1.4 billion ($180 million).  Citic Telecom fell 2.2 percent in  Hong Kong  trading, the
steepest intraday decline since Aug. 16. The stock has advanced
10 percent this year.  A deal may be reached in the next few weeks, one of the
people said. An external spokeswoman for Citic Pacific who asked
that her name not be published declined to comment. CTM
officials didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.  Citic Telecom expects to fund the proposed acquisition with
internal resources, debt or equity financing, according to last
week’s statement.  Citic Pacific is a steelmaker and property developer that
is building an $8 billion iron ore mine in  Western Australia .
The Hong Kong-based company is considering selling part of its
controlling stake in Citic Telecom to its parent to focus on its
core business, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
