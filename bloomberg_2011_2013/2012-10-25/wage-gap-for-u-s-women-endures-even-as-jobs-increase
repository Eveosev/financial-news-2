The number of U.S. women employed
full-time grew after the worst recession in seven decades even
as the male workforce shrank. The number of dollars in their
paychecks relative to men’s hardly rose at all.  Women earned about 79 cents for every $1 made by men,
according to the 2009-11 American Community Survey, a poll of 9
million households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. That was
up from 78 cents in the 2007-09 survey. The data, released
today, showed 680,300 more women and 1.9 million fewer men were
working than during the previous three-year period.  The report underscores the persistent gender pay gap,
independent of occupation, experience and education, an issue
highlighted in the race for the White House. President  Barack Obama  has touted his support for pay-equity laws, and Republican
 Mitt Romney  has tried to cut into Obama’s lead among female 
voters by blaming his policies for rising poverty among women.  “Assumptions about women’s roles and men’s roles are
stubborn and pernicious,” Lisa Maatz, director of public policy
and government relations for the Washington-based  American
Association  of University Women, said in a telephone interview.
“There is still absolutely a sense that women are the
caretakers and so they are less-valuable employees.”  At the current rate of change, the average year-round,
full-time female employee would reach pay parity with the
typical male worker in about 2063.  Fair Pay  The latest numbers only partially reflect the impact of the
first piece of legislation Obama signed upon taking office in
January 2009. Before passage of the law, the Lilly Ledbetter
Fair Pay Act, workers alleging pay discrimination had to file
complaints within 180 days of the employers’ initial decision to
pay them less.  The new law lets workers file a complaint within 180 days
of receiving each paycheck that they consider discriminatory.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  reported  on the
one-year anniversary of the legislation that it had received
4,800 wage-discrimination complaints, with about 1,900 alleging
sex discrimination.  Women made more than men in only one of 247 major, full-
time occupations tracked by the Census Bureau in the last two
American Community Surveys: Females who were transportation,
storage and distribution managers reported 2009-11 median
earnings of $52,435, about $1.02 for every $1 earned by a man
doing the same job.  On the other end of the scale, women working as financial
specialists earned 55 cents for every dollar earned by a man,
followed by securities and commodities sales agents, who earned
60 percent of the wages reported by their male counterparts.  Knocking on Doors  Some women narrowed the pay gap with men by knocking on
doors -- literally. Among the nation’s 58,200 door-to-door sales
workers, women closed the gap from 74 cents per male dollar in
2007-09 to 83 cents in 2009-11, earning a median of $23,164. Men
working as door-to-door salesmen fared poorly; their median
annual incomes fell $2,218 to $27,977.  The difference also shrank among sewing machine operators
and social service specialists, with women gaining 8 cents on
every $1 of male pay. Across the 247 occupations with more than
10,000 male and female employees, women made progress in 129
jobs.  Still, almost all of the 680,300 jobs gained by women
during the three-year period were reported in traditionally
female-oriented occupations, especially public-sector jobs that
were subsidized by an economic-stimulus package enacted in
February 2009, now valued at $831 billion.  Teachers, Nurses  The number of female elementary and middle school teachers
grew 246,000 to 1.7 million, accounting for more than one-third
of the increase. Those positions also were the largest refuge
for men. There were 479,000 male teachers in 2009-2011, an
increase of 48,100 from 2007-09.  The greatest salary gains reported by women occurred in
professional categories. Women physicians’ assistants saw their
median pay increase by $9,922 to $68,160, or 73 cents of the
median paid to a male physician’s assistant. Female engineering
managers reported a $9,579 median boost in salary to $113,825,
or 98 cents of male earnings for the same job.  Male physicians and surgeons reported the greatest income
boost, with median pay rising $15,518 to $202,571. The increase
widened the gap slightly with females, who now earn 62 cents for
every $1 made by a male physician, down from 64 cents during the
2007-09 survey. Male financial specialists registered a $9,242
median raise to $82,918.  ‘Occupational Segregation’  The gender wage gap is reinforced by “occupational
segregation” that forces women into traditional roles in the
 labor force  such as teaching, nursing or secretarial work, said
Ariane Hegewisch, a study director at the Washington-based
Institute for Women’s Policy Research.  Hegewisch also said the new census figures may not reflect
the more-recent difficulties of women in making up lost ground.
An institute analysis found that the majority of new jobs since
the end of 2011 have gone to men, though women and men gained an
equal number in September, the last month data was available.  Men lost jobs in traditionally male-oriented occupations.
The number of truck drivers fell 171,800 over the three-year
period to 2.1 million. The ranks of construction managers
declined 168,500 to 516,300, and the number of laborers dropped
by 155,600 to 817,600.  The collapse of the nation’s real estate market was hard on
both genders. Male real estate brokers and dealers had their
median pay drop $2,920 to $51,106, the steepest decline of any
occupation for men. Women in the same job lost a median $3,037
to fall to $38,006, the second-sharpest drop for females. The
wage gap widened slightly for women in the industry from 74
cents in 2007-09 to 76 cents for every male dollar in 2009-11.  Closing the Gap  For women, a rapid decrease in the wage gap “isn’t going
to happen on its own,” said Fatima Goss Graves, vice president
for education and employment at the National Women’s Law Center
in  Washington . “We need to make some improvements to the law to
put the right incentives in place.”  Legislation that would require employers to prove that pay
differences between men and women doing the same job aren’t
related to gender failed in the Senate in 2010 and 2012.  “We’ve taken care of the easier stuff,” said Linda Barrington, an economist and managing director at Cornell
University’s Institute for Compensation Studies. “There’s not
going to be another birth-control revolution. What really needs
to be changed now are all those really tough societal
questions.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
