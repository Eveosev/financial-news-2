Pharmaxis Ltd.’s (PXS)  Bronchitol won the
backing of the U.K.’s health-cost regulator for use in some
patients with cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic illness.  The drug may be used for adults who can’t use other
treatments and whose lung function is rapidly declining, the
London-based  National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence , known as NICE, said in a statement on the final
draft recommendations. The agency reversed a decision from June,
in which the agency said it couldn’t back the drug because of
“gaps and uncertainties in the evidence on its effectiveness.”  The agency advises the  National Health Service  on which
treatments represent value for money. Final guidance on
Bronchitol, also known as mannitol, is expected to be published
in November, NICE said.  “Following the helpful responses received during
consultation on the draft guidance, the committee concluded that
mannitol was a good use of NHS resources when treatment was
offered to those who cannot use hypertonic saline or rhDNase and
whose lung function is rapidly declining,” the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
