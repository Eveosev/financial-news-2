Brazil ’s plan to boost to 25 percent
its required mix of ethanol with gasoline may not spur
investments in production capacity, according to Arnaldo Correa,
executive director of the Sao Paulo-based research company
Archer Consulting.  The higher blend, due to take effect by June, will increase
demand for anhydrous ethanol by 1.7 billion liters (449 million
gallons) a year, Correa said today in a telephone interview.  Sugar-cane processors are reluctant to build new mills
because the government sets the price of gasoline, Correa said.
The state-controlled oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  hasn’t
increased gasoline prices since 2005, and costs of ethanol
production have risen by about 7 percent a year since 2007, he
said.  Investments in ethanol production have plummeted since the
2008 credit crisis, Correa said. “We are basically stagnating
at the same volume of production.”  Brazil’s ethanol blend will be increased in May or June,
Allan Kardec, director of the national fuel regulator Agencia
Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis, said Oct.
23 at an event in  Rio de Janeiro . It was cut to 20 percent in
October 2011 after cane shortages pushed up prices for the
biofuel, Correa said.  Brazilian mills will be ready to meet the higher blend
rate, Antonio de Padua Rodrigues, technical director of Sao
Paulo-based cane industry association Uniao da Industria de
Cana-de-Acucar, told reporters in Brasilia today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
