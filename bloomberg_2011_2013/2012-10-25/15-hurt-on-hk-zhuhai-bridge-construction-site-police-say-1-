At least 15 people were injured, two
seriously, in an industrial accident at the construction site of
the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge at about 10:30 a.m. today, Ng
Tze-yuen, an acting commander at the Hong Kong Fire Services
Department, said.  The incident took place at an artificial island near the
Hong Kong international airport, according to a release from the
fire services department.  A representative at China Communications Construction Co.
who would only provide her surname, Yu, couldn’t immediately
comment. The Beijing-based company’s unit is named on the
Highways Department website as the main contractor of the island
project.  The bridge will link Zhuhai and Macau to Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
