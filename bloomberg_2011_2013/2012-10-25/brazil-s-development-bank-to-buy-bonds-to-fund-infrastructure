Brazil’s national development bank
will start buying local infrastructure bonds from companies next
year as the government steps up efforts to improve the transport
system, said  Luciano Coutinho , head of the bank.  Brazilian companies may sell as much as 50 billion reais
($24.7 billion) in such tax-exempt bonds next year, Coutinho
told reporters in Brasilia. The Rio de Janeiro-based BNDES may
fund as much as two-thirds of all the planned investment in
roads, railways, ports, and airports, he said.  Brazil wants to renovate its aging infrastructure to reduce
transportation costs and prepare for hosting the 2014  World Cup 
and the 2016 summer  Olympic Games . President  Dilma Rousseff 
announced in August the government would sell licenses to build
and operate roads and railways, with investment expected to
reach 133 billion reais, and will do the same for airports and
ports. The government grants tax breaks for investors who buy
bonds sold to fund infrastructure projects.  “Treasury bonds now offer lower returns and both
investment funds and pension funds need higher investment
goals,” Coutinho said. “Nothing is better than infrastructure
investment that can offer long-term returns with relatively low
risk.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
