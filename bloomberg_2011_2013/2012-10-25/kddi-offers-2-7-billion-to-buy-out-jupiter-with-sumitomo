KDDI Corp. (9433) , Japan’s second-biggest
mobile-phone company, climbed the most in 19 months in  Tokyo 
trading after announcing a buyout plan of  Jupiter
Telecommunications Co. (4817) , or JCOM, with  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)   The carrier  surged  5.5 percent, the biggest gain since
March 16, 2011, to 6,370 yen at the close of trading in Tokyo.
KDDI and Sumitomo, which already own a combined 71 percent JCOM
stake, offered 216 billion yen ($2.7 billion) for the remaining
shares, they said in a statement yesterday.  The deal values JCOM at 759 billion yen and will also fold
KDDI’s Japan Cablenet Ltd., which controls 12 percent of the
country’s cable TV market, into JCOM, giving the merged operator
a 53 percent share, according to the companies’ joint
presentation yesterday. Consolidating JCOM will add about 60
billion yen to KDDI’s operating profit, Hitoshi Hayakawa, an
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in Tokyo, wrote in a note to
clients yesterday.  Buying out JCOM is “a super deal that should resolve all
uncertainty over business strategy,” the  analyst  wrote.  KDDI yesterday kept its annual earnings  forecasts 
unchanged. The company projects operating profit of 500 billion
yen for the 12 months ending March 31, 2013, compared with 477.6
billion last fiscal year. The carrier reported yesterday that
first-half operating profit fell 13 percent from a year earlier
to 231 billion yen.  Seeking Control  The mobile phone services provider paid about 363 billion
yen in 2010 to buy 38 percent of Jupiter from billionaire  John Malone ’s Liberty Global Inc. The purchase spurred Sumitomo to
raise its stake in the cable-television operator two months
later to 40 percent from 27 percent through an offer to minority
investors as it vied with KDDI for control.  In that deal, Sumitomo offered investors 139,500 yen per
Jupiter share, setting an enterprise value of 6.5 times earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization based on
2012 earnings estimates, said Justin Tang, a Singapore-based
analyst at Churchill Capital.  The current 110,000 yen per share offer implies enterprise
value of 5.4 times ebitda based on earnings forecast for two
years from now, Tang said. The multiple is in line with the
valuations across the industry, which have slumped, he said.  “The offer price is not without merit to valuation,” Tang
said. “It falls within the valuation of Jupiter’s advisers and
the domestic peers have shrunk since Sumitomo’s partial offer in
2010.”  Staying In  KDDI spokesman Yosuke Fukuma said his company and Sumitomo
relied on the valuations by Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities for the offer pricing.  “The most important thing is that you’re not seeing the
companies cashing out,” Fukuma said.  Under the offer for JCOM, KDDI will invest 70.9 billion
yen, and a venture being set up by the Tokyo-based phone company
and Sumitomo will pay about 145 billion yen, bringing each
company’s stake to 50 percent, according to the statement.  KDDI will finance the acquisition with cash and  borrowing ,
according to the statement. The carrier had about 100 billion
yen in cash, near cash and short-term investments as of June 30,
while Sumitomo had about 833 billion yen.  JCOM  dropped  2.2 percent, the most in two months, on the
Jasdaq Securities Exchange, to 108,800 yen. Sumitomo gained 1.4
percent to 1,090 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
