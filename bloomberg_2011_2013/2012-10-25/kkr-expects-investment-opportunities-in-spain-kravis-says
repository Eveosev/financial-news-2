KKR & Co. (KKR) , the New York-based
private-equity firm run by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts ,
expects a “real opportunity” in Spain and plans to invest in
countries or regions where most investors avoid.  All but two or three large banks in Spain face
difficulties, Kravis told reporters Singapore, and companies
can’t get capital. Spain’s economy contracted for a fifth
quarter, adding pressure on Premier  Mariano Rajoy  to seek more
European aid even as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy met
a bill-sales target.  “That creates a real opportunity for us because we will go
in and say look we’re perfectly happy, willing to buy the asset
off your bank or because a company can’t get financing, be it
equity or debt financing,” he said. “We see that as an
opportunity because we’ll be there.”  The country’s bonds have declined since European Union
leaders last week failed to discuss further aid for the nation
at a Brussels summit. Rajoy has struggled to trim a 2011  budget
deficit  that was more than three times the EU limit, after the
country’s deepening recession pushed the jobless rate over 25
percent, sapping demand and  tax revenue .  KKR may also seek investments in China, a market that’s
“highly fragmented,” according to Joe Bae, managing partner of
KKR Asia. The firm has made 14 investments in China in the past
seven years, he said.  “What people don’t appreciate sometimes is that there’s
been a dramatic decline in valuation multiples in that
marketplace,” Bae said. “As long-term investors, that’s a
very, very positive trade-off. We are actually quite bullish on
China right now.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
