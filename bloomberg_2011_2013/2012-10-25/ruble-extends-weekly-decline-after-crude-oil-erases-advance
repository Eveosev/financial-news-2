The ruble fell against the dollar
for the third day this week, extending a 1.6 percent decline
this week as crude, Russia’s biggest revenue-earner, dropped in
 New York .  The ruble lost 0.1 percent to 31.3625 per dollar by the 7
p.m. close in Moscow. The currency weakened less than 0.1
percent to 35.5385 against the central bank’s euro-dollar basket
and was little changed against the euro at 40.6425.  Oil fluctuated as traders awaited data that may signal that
economic growth is accelerating in the U.S., the world’s biggest
crude consuming country. After closing at its lowest since July
10 yesterday, crude dropped 2 cents to $85.71 a barrel by the
close of ruble trading in Moscow.  “Markets stay nervous,” Dmitry Polevoy, a Moscow-based
economist at ING Groep NV, said by e-mail. “This morning we saw
massive non-resident flows into the ruble on overall optimism,
but they started closing their positions again when oil moved
down.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.8625 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell one basis point to 180,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields added five basis points to
7.09 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
