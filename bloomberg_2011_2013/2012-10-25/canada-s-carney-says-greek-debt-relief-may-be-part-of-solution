Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
said additional debt relief for Greece may be part of a way to
help ease economic adjustment for the Mediterranean country.  In an interview with Sun News Network to be broadcast at 6
p.m. Ottawa time, Carney said the  International Monetary Fund 
and the European Union are trying to “smooth that path and
lessen the adjustment as much as possible.”  “It is the current view that there is a way, through a
combination of money through the IMF and European authorities,
additional measures by the Greeks, maybe some additional debt
relief, that that is the best path for Greece,” said Carney,
according to a transcript provided by Sun News.  Carney, who is also the chairman of the Financial Stability
Board charged by Group of 20 leaders to coordinate global
financial reforms, said  Europe  is the biggest risk to the global
economy in the “medium-term” because of the challenges
associated with “re-creating” the region’s monetary union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
