Japanese  stocks  gained, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rising to a month high, as the yen
touched its lowest since June on expectations the Bank of  Japan 
will add stimulus next week.  Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that counts North America as
its biggest market, climbed 1.9 percent.  KDDI Corp. (9433)  surged 5.5
percent after the mobile-phone provider offered as much as $2.7
billion to buy out Jupiter Telecommunications Co. Kansai
Electric Power Co. led a rebound among utilities after saying it
may restart nuclear power plants.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.1 percent to 9,055.20 at 3 p.m. in
Tokyo, the highest close since Sept. 25. Volume was about 8.1
percent below the 30-day average before a central bank policy
meeting starting Oct. 30. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index gained 1.1
percent to 751.42, with more than four shares rising for each
that fell.  “The biggest catalyst boosting the market today is strong
expectations the  Bank of Japan  will add stimulus,” said Ichiro Takamatsu, a Tokyo-based  fund manager  at Bayview Asset
Management Co., which oversees 150 billion yen ($1.9 billion).
“The BOJ is being pressured by massive stimulus from the
 Federal Reserve  and the  European Central Bank . If the BOJ is the
only one that doesn’t act, the yen will surge.”  The Topix has risen 4.5 percent since Sept. 6 after the
European Central Bank started a global wave of easing to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan
following suit. Shares on the stock gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  U.S. Economy  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.4 percent today. The gauge
lost 0.3 percent yesterday in New York after the U.S. central
bank said the economy is still growing modestly even as it buys
$40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month until the U.S.
labor market recovers. Shares rose earlier on a report that new
home sales climbed 5.7 percent to a 389,000 annual pace in
September, the most since April 2010.  Japan’s government is asking the central bank to increase
its asset-purchase program by 20 trillion yen, the Sankei
newspaper reported on Oct. 23, citing an unnamed official. The
Bank of Japan on Sept. 19 increased the program to 55 trillion
yen from 45 trillion yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 80.14 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, the weakest since June 25, compared with 79.82
at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. Japan’s currency
weakened to 104.15 against the euro from 103.60. A weaker yen
boosts overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Nissan climbed 1.9 percent to 703 yen. Funai Electric Co.,
a maker of audio-visual equipment that relies on  North America 
for half its revenue, jumped 2.3 percent to 1,129 yen.  KDDI Jumps  KDDI, Japan’s second-biggest mobile-phone company, jumped
5.5 percent to 6,370 yen after offering as much as 216 billion
yen ($2.7 billion) with Sumitomo Corp. to buy out Jupiter
Telecommunications and create a cable TV provider with more than
half the country’s subscribers.  The Topix utilities gauge, which plunged 11 percent the
past three days, rebounded after Kansai Electric said it was
weighing restarting nuclear reactors to secure a stable power
supply. A report from a government panel yesterday showed that
fuel costs for power utilities may double from two years ago
because most of the nation’s nuclear reactors remain shut after
the Fukushima meltdown.  Kansai Electric  rallied 5.5 percent to 614 yen. Tohoku
Electric Power Co. climbed 3.7 percent to 590 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 0.1 percent
to 19.56, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.6 percent
on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
