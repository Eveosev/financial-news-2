New Zealand’s currency gained to the
strongest level since April against the yen and reached an
almost three-week high versus the  U.S. dollar  after the  Reserve
Bank  of New Zealand left  interest rates  unchanged and said
market sentiment has improved.  The kiwi, as New Zealand’s dollar is nicknamed,
strengthened after bank Governor Graeme Wheeler said inflation
is expected to accelerate. The Australian dollar reached the
highest in two months versus the yen as swaps traders reduced
bets that Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  will
cut the nation’s benchmark rate next month. The currencies
reversed gains versus the dollar as risk appetite ebbed.  “The RBNZ didn’t change anything, and may have
disappointed some dovish traders in the process,” Neal Gilbert,
a market strategist at GFT Markets, wrote yesterday in a note to
clients. “Since they made no dovish insinuations at all, the
 New Zealand dollar  has rallied in response.”  The kiwi climbed to 66.19 yen yesterday in  New York , its
highest level since April 30, before trading at 65.69 yen, up
0.3 percent. It fell 0.3 percent to 81.80 U.S. cents after
earlier gaining as much as 0.5 percent to 82.43 cents, the
strongest since Oct. 5.  The Aussie dollar reached 83.48 yen, the highest since Aug.
21, before trading at 83.08 yen, up 0.5 percent. It rose as much
as 0.4 percent to $1.0397 before ending the day little changed
at $1.0347.  ‘More Balanced’  The RBNZ expects annual inflation to head back to the
middle of its 1 percent to 3 percent target range from 0.8
percent in the third quarter, Wheeler said in a statement.
Improved  market sentiment  suggests that risks to the global
outlook are “more balanced,” he said.  Wheeler left the official cash rate unchanged at 2.5
percent, the highest among major developed economies after
Australia’s 3.25 percent. The RBA meets Nov. 5.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 3.7 percent this
year, the biggest increase among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie
has fallen 0.4 percent, and the greenback is down 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
