U.S.  mortgage rates  rose, increasing
borrowing costs as home values extend a rebound from their worst
crash since the 1930s.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to
3.41 percent in the week ended today from 3.37 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate rose to 2.72 percent, from 2.66 percent.  Mortgage rates fell to record lows this month, spurring
demand for real estate and helping support prices as buyers
compete for a shrinking supply of listings. Home values jumped
1.3 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months,
the biggest gain since 2006, Zillow Inc., a Seattle-based
property-data company, said this week.  “Now that people have confidence that a bottom was reached
and is in the rear-view mirror, now there’s a willingness to
take advantage of those historically low  interest rates ,”
 Russell Price , a Detroit-based senior economist for  Ameriprise
Financial Inc. (AMP) , said in a telephone interview yesterday. “Now
they’re much more effective in facilitating an ongoing
recovery.”  Contracts to buy previously owned homes climbed 0.3 percent
in September from the previous month and almost 15 percent from
a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said today.  Purchases of  new homes  jumped 5.7 percent in September to a
389,000 annual pace, the most since April 2010, figures from the
Commerce Department showed yesterday.  The 30-year average reached 3.36 percent earlier this
month, an all-time low, according to Freddie Mac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
