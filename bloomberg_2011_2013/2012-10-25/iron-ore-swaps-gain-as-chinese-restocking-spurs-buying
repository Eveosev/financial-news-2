Iron-ore swaps for November gained
as Chinese traders bought the contracts to protect themselves
against price increases in the cost of the commodity used to
make steel.  The derivatives traded at about $117.75 a dry metric ton as
of 10:41 a.m. in  London  compared with $117.5 a ton yesterday,
according to data from SSY Futures Ltd., a broker of the
contracts. Prices are gaining as Chinese mills restock and
because of a lack of immediate, or prompt cargoes, Mark Richardson, head SSY Futures, said by e-mail.  The physical price of iron ore at the Chinese port of
Tianjin has gained 37 percent to $118.70 a ton since Sept. 5,
according to data from The Steel Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
