Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) , the
world’s largest standalone baby formula maker, plunged the most
in 10 months after the company reduced its earnings forecast for
the year.  Mead Johnson fell 8.6 percent to $63.53 at the close of
trading in  New York , its largest decline since December and
lowest level since April 2011. The shares of the Glenview,
Illinois-based company have declined 7.6 percent this year.  Full-year earnings are expected to be $2.91 to $2.96 a
share, Mead Johnson said in a statement today. It had earlier
forecast earnings of $2.95 to $3.05. Fewer births in the U.S.
this year and reduced consumption of its product contributed to
the lower earnings forecast, Mead Johnson said. The company also
said “unfounded media reports” in December linking its formula
to contamination led to a market share decline that the company
is still recovering from.  Last year retailers including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  pulled
Mead Johnson’s Enfamil nutrition formula from shelves after
regulators said a Missouri infant who had been infected with the
bacterium Cronobacter and died had used the product. Regulators
later said they didn’t find any evidence of contamination
occurring during manufacturing or shipping of the formula.  To contact the reporter on this story:
