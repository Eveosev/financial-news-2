Executive Officer Donald Gogel said dealmaking in the U.S. is
being suppressed by hesitancy among corporate executives to put
their money toward mergers and acquisitions.  The U.S. is in a “period of extreme caution on the part of
most CEOs,” Gogel said today at the Bloomberg  Dealmakers Summit 
in New York. “It’s a slower than usual dealmaking period, with
private-equity dealmaking probably 50 percent below its peak.”  The so-called fiscal cliff of $607 billion in spending cuts
and tax increases, set to start in January unless Congress
intervenes, has provided a “cover” for executives to hold
their cash until the uncertainty lifts, said Gogel. If Congress
doesn’t act, taxes will go up and spending will be cut in
January, probably leading to a recession, according to the
 Congressional Budget Office .  Global mergers and acquisitions slumped in the third
quarter to a level not seen since the aftermath of the financial
crisis, with companies announcing $466 billion of takeovers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buyout firms had in
aggregate more than $1 trillion of “dry powder,” or committed
capital yet to be invested, at the end of 2011, according to
research firm Preqin Ltd.  “There’s still activity, but it’s just not the same
frenetic” drive to get deals done or to get them done this
year, Gogel said of private-equity managers. “As a result,
firms are having a little more trouble deploying some of that
capital.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
