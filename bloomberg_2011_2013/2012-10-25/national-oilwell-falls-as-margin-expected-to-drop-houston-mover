National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV) , the
largest U.S. maker of oilfield equipment, fell the most in four
months after forecasting a drop in margin at its second-largest
unit.  National Oilwell Varco, based in Houston, fell 4.3 percent
to $73.51 at 1:22 p.m. in  New York , after earlier declining 4.5
percent, the biggest intraday drop  since  June 25.  The petroleum services and supplies  unit , which makes
consumable gear for the oilfield such as drilling fluids, pipes
and bits used to carve a well, is “likely” to report an
operating profit margin as low as 20 percent in the fourth
quarter, Chief Financial Officer Clay Williams told analysts and
investors today on an earnings conference call.  “That is the major issue as that segment was the upside
driver” for next year,  Brian Uhlmer , an analyst at Global
Hunter Securities in Houston, wrote today in an e-mail.  The unit, which is the company’s second-largest in terms of
sales and profit, reported a third-quarter margin of 22.3
percent, the company said today in a statement before regular
trading.  The expectations for a decline in margin are the result of
pressure from customers for lower prices, Williams said. About
60 percent of the unit’s third-quarter revenue came from  North
America , he said.  Service and equipment providers are seeing decreased
business in the U.S. and  Canada  due to an oversupply of
hydraulic-fracturing equipment and a concern from producers over
spending levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
