President  Barack Obama  has an answer
for why real estate developer  Donald Trump  keeps questioning his
background.  “This all dates back to when we were growing up in
Kenya,” Obama said dryly to laughter from the audience at a
taping last night of NBC’s “Tonight Show With Jay Leno.”  Trump, who has previously questioned whether the president
was born in the U.S. and is eligible to hold the office,
released a video on his Twitter account yesterday offering to
donate $5 million to the charity of Obama’s choice if he
will release his college records and passport application.  Trump is backing Republican  Mitt Romney  in the presidential
race.  Obama stopped in Burbank, California, to tape Leno’s
program on the first day of a two day campaign trip to rally
supporters before the Nov. 6 election. The host asked Obama why
Trump seems to have a vendetta against him. Obama answered
without missing a beat.  “We had constant run-ins on the soccer field,” Obama, who
was born in Hawaii, joked. “He wasn’t very good and resented
it. When we finally moved to America, I thought it would be
over.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
