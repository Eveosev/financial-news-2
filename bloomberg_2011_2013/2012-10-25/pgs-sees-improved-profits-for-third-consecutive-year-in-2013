Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (PGS) , the
world’s third-largest oil and gas fields seismic surveyor,
expects to improve profits for a third straight year in 2013 as
 oil companies  increase exploration.  The Lysaker, Norway-based company expects a “strong”
summer season in the  North Sea  thanks to larger demand and fewer
vessels in the north Atlantic, Chief Executive Officer Jon Erik Reinhardsen said today.  “The finds that have been made the last 12 to 15 months
have ensured that the North Sea market probably will remain the
biggest market in the world, despite being a very mature area,”
he said in an interview after presenting the company’s third-
quarter results, which beat analyst estimates.  PGS raised its guidance for earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2012 to about $800
million. Reinhardsen said Ebitda and operating and net income
would all increase next year, following gains in 2012 and 2011.  Seismic surveyors are benefiting from record investments in
 Norway , spurred by finds in the North Sea and expanding
exploration in Arctic areas off the country’s northern tip.
Investment in the country’s oil and gas industry is expected to
rise by 10 percent to a record 204 billion kroner ($35.6
billion) next year, according to a quarterly survey of oil
companies by  Statistics Norway .  Fully Booked  PGS’ capacity is fully booked for the fourth quarter of
this year, 90 percent booked for the first quarter of 2013 and
75 percent booked for the second quarter, Reinhardsen said.
These surveys will mainly take place in other parts of the world
than the North Sea, he said.  The operating income margin should increase by 10
percentage points in the first half of next year compared to the
“high end” of a range of 15 percent to 20 percent this year,
Reinhardsen said.  PGS said net income rose to $87 million in the third
quarter from $13 million a year earlier, beating an average
analyst estimate of $64 million. Sales rose to $388 million from
$340 million a year earlier, while Ebitda rose to $222 million
from $153 million.  The  shares  rose as much as 4.2 percent, the most in more
than three weeks, and traded 1.4 percent higher at 95.3 kroner
as of 1:13 p.m. in Oslo.  The company will announce its guidance for next year at its
capital markets day Dec. 18. A Bloomberg survey of 26 analysts
shows Ebitda is expected at an average of $977 million, up from
$830 million this year, while net income is expected to reach
$332 million, up from $184 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
