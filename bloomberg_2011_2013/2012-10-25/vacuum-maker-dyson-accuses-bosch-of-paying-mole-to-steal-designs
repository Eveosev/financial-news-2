Dyson Ltd., the bagless vacuum-
cleaner maker, accused  Robert Bosch GmbH  of paying one of its
engineers to steal motor designs in a U.K. lawsuit.  Bosch paid the “mole” to pass on technology, which was
also given to Bosch’s Chinese motor manufacturer, Malmesbury,
England-based Dyson said in a statement yesterday.  “Bosch’s vice president for engineering employed a Dyson
engineer and benefited from our confidential know-how and
expertise,”  Mark Taylor , Dyson’s research director, said in the
statement. “We are demanding the immediate return of our
intellectual property.”  Dyson has previously accused French and Chinese companies
of copying its products. Intellectual property rights for its
air multiplier fan have been infringed about 500 times in 30
countries during the past two years, Dyson said in its
statement.  Bosch had a consulting arrangement with the engineer, who
worked on garden products, the Gerlingen, Germany-based company
said in a statement. Bosch is looking into Dyson’s claim and
declined to comment further on the allegations.  The case is: Dyson Technology Limited v. Robert Bosch
Limited & Ors,  High Court  of Justice,  Chancery Division ,
HC12E04131.  To contact the reporters on this story:
