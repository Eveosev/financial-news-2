Swedenâ€™s krona weakened against the
euro and pared gains against the dollar after the Riksbank left
the key interest rate unchanged at 1.25 percent and said it may
ease policy further. The move was expected by 16 out of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.   The krona weakened 0.17 percent against the euro to 8.686
and pared a gain against the dollar to 0.11 percent at 6.6765 as
of 9:48 a.m. in  Stockholm .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
