Altria Group Inc. (MO) , the largest
seller of tobacco in the U.S., reported third-quarter profit
that met analysts’ estimates, helped by higher cigarette prices.  Net income declined 44 percent to $657 million, or 32 cents
a share, from $1.17 billion, or 57 cents, a year earlier, the
Richmond, Virginia-based maker of Marlboro cigarettes said today
in a statement. Excluding items, primarily a loss on the early
extinguishment of debt, profit totaled 58 cents, matching the
average of 12  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Altria’s Philip Morris USA business raised prices on all
cigarette brands by 6 cents a pack in June while relying on
promotions and last year’s introduction of a new variety,
Marlboro Black, to spur market share gains for its top-selling
cigarette brand. Marlboro’s share of U.S. smokers rose to 42.7
percent from 41.7 percent in the third quarter, while total
cigarette shipments advanced 1.2 percent.  “The company’s aggressive new product and promotional
plans for the brand are propelling the current market share
gain,”  Christopher Growe , an analyst for Stifel Financial Corp.
in  St. Louis , said today in a note. He rates Altria neutral,
equivalent of a hold.  Altria fell 0.1 percent to $32.10 at the close in  New York .
The shares have risen 8.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
