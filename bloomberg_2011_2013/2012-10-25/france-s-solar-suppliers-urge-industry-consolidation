Schneider Electric SA (SU) ,  Mersen (MRN)  and
 Air Liquide SA (AI) , which sell electrical equipment, graphite and
gases to solar-panel makers, said the photovoltaic industry must
consolidate to rebound from a price war.  “We are going through a cleaning up of the market,”
Schneider Chief Financial Officer Emmanuel Babeau said on a
conference call today as he commented on declining sales to the
solar industry. “There are too many players,” and the market
will rebound as PV power prices become competitive “quicker
than some could expect.”  “Chinese cell-producers have financial difficulties, they
are restructuring,” and waiting for European anti-dumping
measures following U.S. measures, Thomas Baumgartner, chief
financial officer of Mersen, said yesterday. “Chinese cell
makers should maybe consolidate to enable a quick pickup.”  About 180 solar manufacturers will probably fail or get
bought by 2015 as overcapacity and low prices drive a wave of
consolidation, GTM Research said this month. Almost half of
those companies are based in the U.S.,  Europe  and  Canada , where
manufacturing costs are high and producers can’t compete with
lower-cost panels from  China , the Boston-based researcher said.  “Our top tier Chinese customers should continue to do
well” as they face “very fast” growing demand for panels, Air
Liquide Senior Executive Vice-President Pierre Dufour said on a
conference call today. “In every zone of the world, the lower
tier customers will be struggling and a lot of them will
probably be consolidated out or fade away.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
