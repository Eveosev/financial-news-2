Indian stocks advanced for a second
time in three days after companies including  Sterlite Industries
(India) Ltd. (STLT)  and  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  announced better-than-
estimated earnings.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.3 percent
to 18,758.63 at the close. Sterlite, the biggest copper maker,
climbed the most in a month after reporting a 74 percent jump in
profit. Mahindra, India’s largest tractor producer, had that
sharpest gain in a month, the  best  performance on the gauge.  Earnings have trailed analyst forecasts at only one of the
11 Sensex companies that have reported results for the quarter
ended September, compared with 40 percent in the three months
through June, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Sensex has
surged 21 percent this year as  foreigners  bought a net $18.2
billion of shares, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, excluding China.  “Earnings are not too disappointing, with most companies
reporting earnings in line with, or exceeding, expectations,”
Harsha Upadhyaya, head of equities at Kotak Mahindra Mutual
Fund, said in an interview to Bloomberg TV  India  today. “If
interest-rate cuts are sharp over the next year or so, there is
a case for earnings to be upgraded probably in the second half
of fiscal year 2014” that starts on April 1, 2013, he said.  Mahindra reported second-quarter profit rose 22 percent to
9.02 billion rupees ($168 million) in the September quarter.
That exceeded the 8.45 billion-rupee median of 33 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The stock gained 3.5 percent to
857.9 rupees, the steepest gain since Sept. 24.  Beating Forecasts  Sterlite increased 2.1 percent to 100.55 rupees, the most
since Sept. 28. Profit jumped better-than-estimated 74 percent,
the company said after trading ended Oct. 23. Indian markets
were closed yesterday for a public holiday.  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) , the nation’s biggest motorcycle maker,
increased 2 percent to 1,832.30 rupees after reporting profit
declined 27 percent from a year earlier to 4.41 billion rupees,
matching the 4.4 billion-rupee median estimate of 40 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Infosys Ltd. (INFY) , the second-largest software exporter, fell
0.4 percent to 2,344.75 rupees.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index added 0.2 percent to 5,705.30 at
the expiry of the October derivatives series today. Its futures
for November delivery settled at 5,751.45. India VIX, which
measures the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty
index, held near its record low of 13.04 set on Oct. 22.  The Sensex last month had its biggest gain since January as
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  opened retailing and airlines to
foreigners, cut fuel subsidies and pared a tax on companies’
overseas debt to revive an economy growing at the slowest pace
in three years.  Monetary Easing  Interest rates  need to come down to revive growth, Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters in  Tokyo  Oct.
12, saying the reforms drive may create room to lower funding
costs. The  Reserve Bank of India  will reduce the  cash reserve
ratio  by 25 basis points on Oct. 30, according to 11 of 18
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The authority has held
its benchmark rate at 8 percent since April.  “We would like to see further monetary easing by the RBI,
and progress on reforms and disinvestments,”  John Praveen , the
chief investment strategist at Prudential International
Investments Advisers, a unit of  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , which
manages about $960 billion, said by e-mail. “If these
materialize, that combined with a favorable global backdrop are
likely to push Indian stocks higher in next 3 to 6 months.”
Praveen said the Sensex and Nifty may surpass record highs of
21,004 and 6,312 by March next year.  The 30-stock Indian gauge trades at 14.9 times  estimated
earnings , compared with the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) ’s 11.5
times, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Sensex still trades
below the 18.7 times multiple at the end of 2010, Praveen said.  The Sensex may finish 2012 at 19,000-20,000 and the  Nifty (NIFTY) 
at 6,000-6,050, he said.  The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. and the BSE Ltd.
traded 801 million shares on Oct. 23, compared with a 12-month
daily average of 912 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
