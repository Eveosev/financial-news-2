     Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Georgian lawmakers approved
billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s Cabinet after his Georgian
Dream coalition defeated President Mikheil Saakashvili’s ruling
party in parliamentary elections last month.  Eighty-eight deputies in the 150-seat parliament in
Kutaisi, the Black Sea nation’s second-largest city, voted in
favor of the candidate, while 54 were against.  The vote confirmed Nodar Khaduri as finance minister,
Giorgi Kvirikashvili as economy minister and Maya Fanjikidze as
Foreign Minister. Former AC Milan soccer player Kakha Kaladze
becomes energy minister.  Saakashvili, who came to power after the so-called Rose
Revolution in 2003, steps down next year, when most powers will
be transferred to the prime minister’ office, which will be held
by Ivanishvili. The president’s United National Movement has 65
seats members in parliament, while Georgian Dream has 85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
