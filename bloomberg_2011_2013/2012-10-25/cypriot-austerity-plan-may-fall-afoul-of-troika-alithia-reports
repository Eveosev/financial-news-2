The Cypriot governmentâ€™s proposed
austerity plan, prepared for international bailout talks, may be
rejected by the so-called troika because it relies too heavily
on new tax revenue, Alithia reported.  The Cypriot plan would rely on new income to generate 60
percent of about 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) to help the
country meet its obligations, the newspaper reported today
without saying where it got the information. Spending cuts would
account for the remainder, Alithia said.  The troika that oversees euro-area bailouts, comprised of
officials from the European Commission, European Central Bank
and International Monetary Fund, seeks a ratio of 70 percent
spending cuts and 30 percent new revenue, Alithia said.  Cyprus wants to spread the fiscal-adjustment program over
four years, compared with three years sought by the troika,
Alithia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
