Tenneco Inc. (TEN)  rose the most in more
than three years after the maker of diesel-exhaust filters and
mufflers reported quarterly profit exceeding analysts’
estimates.  Tenneco advanced 16 percent to $30.97 at 11:15 a.m. in New
York, after reaching $31.23, for the biggest intraday gain since
July 2009. The shares dropped 10 percent this year through
yesterday after a 28 percent slide in 2011.  The company, based in  Lake Forest , Illinois, reported
third-quarter net income of $125 million, or $2.05 a share,
compared with $30 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, including a tax allowance of $74
million, or $1.22 a share, profit was $52 million or 85 cents.
On that basis, the average estimate of 14 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for a per-share profit of 75 cents.  Tenneco, whose customers include  General Motors Co. (GM)  and
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said it benefited from higher light-vehicle
production in North American and China and “effective
operational cost control,” which helped earnings before
interest, taxes and non-controlling interests widen to 6.2
percent of sales from 4.7 percent. Sales rose 0.3 percent to
$1.78 billion, compared with $1.81 billion, the average estimate
of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
