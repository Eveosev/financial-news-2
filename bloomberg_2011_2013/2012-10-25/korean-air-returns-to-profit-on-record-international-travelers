Korean Air  Lines Co. returned to a
profit in the third quarter after the nation’s  largest carrier 
boosted international passenger traffic to a record.  Net income  was 340 billion won ($310 million), compared
with a loss of 536.3 billion won a year earlier, Seoul-based
Korean Air said in a statement today. That was in line with the
340.1 billion-won average of 15  analysts’ estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 2.6 percent to 3.4 trillion won.  The carrier plans to add 55 new aircraft, including five
Airbus SAS A380s, by 2018 as it challenges  Singapore Airlines
Ltd. (SIA)  and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. for business fliers. Korean
Air is also bidding for a 42 percent stake in the nation’s only
planemaker as it seeks to expand its aerospace operations.  Korean Air  rose  0.8 percent to 50,400 won at the close of
trading in  Seoul . The stock has climbed 16 percent this year
compared with a 5.4 percent gain in the benchmark Kospi index.  The carrier said it expects sales from premium seats to
rise 15 percent this year to 1.62 trillion won after boosting
business-and first-class seats with the addition of its five
A380 superjumbos.  Operating  profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, jumped 31 percent to 313 billion won,
the company said.  Standalone operating profit, which excludes income from
units, may rise to 507.8 billion won this year from 394.1
billion won in 2011, the carrier said. It didn’t provide a
forecast for consolidated operating profit.  Cargo Decline  The airline’s international passenger traffic in the
quarter, measured by revenue passenger kilometers, climbed 4.3
percent from a year earlier to a record. That helped offset a
decline of 8.2 percent in cargo traffic.  Revenue from its European routes rose about 21 percent in
the January-September period while the contribution from U.S.
routes increased 9 percent, vice president Lee Sang Kyoon said
at a press conference in Seoul today.  Korean Air is vying with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. to
buy the 42 percent stake in  Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. (047810)  The
carrier’s aerospace division already makes parts for  Boeing (BA)  and
Airbus planes. The stake sale may be completed by year-end.  “We’re confident that our purchase of Korea Aerospace will
create positive synergy as we’re already in that business,” Lee
said. “We want to tap the highly-skilled and experienced
technicians at Korea Aerospace, too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
