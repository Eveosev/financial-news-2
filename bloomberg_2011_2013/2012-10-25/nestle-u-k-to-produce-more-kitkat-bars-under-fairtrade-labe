Nestle SA (NESN)  in the U.K. and Ireland
will make two-finger KitKat chocolate bars next year from cocoa
certified by Fairtrade, doubling the quantity of sweets it makes
there with certification for sustainably-grown ingredients.  The unit will make an additional 800 million bars of KitKat
a year using cocoa grown in the Ivory Coast that carries
certification, starting in January, the Vevey, Switzerland-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Nestle began using
Fairtrade cocoa in its four-finger KitKat in the U.K. and
Ireland in 2010.  The unit will buy an extra 5,300 tons of cocoa from
Fairtrade cooperatives as a result of the extension. Under the
program, nine more cooperatives in the  Ivory Coast  will be paid
an amount to cover the cost of sustainable production, as well
as a premium to invest in community projects, according to the
statement. Nestle buys about a 10th of the global cocoa
production and more than a third of that comes from the Ivory
Coast, the world’s biggest producer.  A  Fair Labor Association  study requested by Nestle found
this year that the world’s biggest food company needs to step up
measures to combat child labor in the Ivory Coast cocoa
industry. About one fifth of the cocoa the chocolate maker gets
from that country can be traced because it comes from Nestle’s
sustainable-farming program, while the rest comes from the
“standard” supply chain, which isn’t transparent, the report
found.  To contact the reporters on this story:
