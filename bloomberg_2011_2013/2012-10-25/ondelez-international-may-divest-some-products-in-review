Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) , the
snacks and coffee business spun off from Kraft Foods Inc., may
divest some products as it seeks to streamline its range.  “We do continuously review our portfolio,” Tim Cofer,
head of  Europe  at Mondelez, said today at a press briefing in
Zurich, without providing details.  Mondelez has too many products and the company will pursue
a “simplification agenda,” which also includes the sourcing of
raw materials, according to Cofer. The company may also look for
“external opportunities,” he said, without elaborating.  Mondelez this month agreed to buy Italy’s Vitasnella snack
unit from Paris-based Danone SA. The original Kraft Foods Inc.,
founded in 1909, has become two companies -- Mondelez
International and Kraft Foods Group, the North American grocery
enterprise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
