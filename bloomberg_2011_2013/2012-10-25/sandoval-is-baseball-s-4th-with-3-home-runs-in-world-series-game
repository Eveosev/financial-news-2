Pablo Sandoval of the San Francisco
Giants became the fourth player in Major League Baseball history
to hit three home runs in a  World Series  game.  Sandoval, 26, hit a solo homer off Detroit Tigers starter
 Justin Verlander  in the first inning tonight and a two-run shot
off him in the third. In the fifth inning, he hit a solo home
run off reliever Al Alburquerque.  Sandoval had four runs batted in as the Giants took a 6-0
lead after five innings in the opening game of the best-of-seven
World Series at San Francisco’s AT&T Park.  The 5-foot-11, 240-pound Sandoval, who is nicknamed “Kung
Fu Panda,” is assured of getting up at least once more in the
game. No player has hit four home runs in a World Series game.  He joins  Babe Ruth  and  Reggie Jackson  of the New York
Yankees and  Albert Pujols  of the St. Louis Cardinals as the only
players to hit three homers.  Ruth did it twice -- in 1926 and 1928 -- and Jackson
achieved the feat in a game in 1977. Pujols, who now plays for
the Los Angeles Angels, did it last year.  Sandoval’s first home run went an estimated 411 feet to
right-center field. His second, to left field, was estimated at
360 feet. The third went over the center-field wall.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
