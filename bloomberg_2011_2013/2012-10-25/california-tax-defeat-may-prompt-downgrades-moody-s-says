As many as 150 of the almost 1,000
school districts in California may face credit downgrades if
voters reject two tax measures on the Nov. 6 ballot, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a report yesterday.  School districts would lose as much as 7 percent of their
funding if voters turn down a sales- and income-tax increase
backed by Governor  Jerry Brown  and a competing boost in income
levies proposed by  Los Angeles  attorney  Molly Munger , Moody’s
said. Revenue from both is earmarked for public education.  “We would immediately place the weakest of these on review
for downgrade if the proposals are defeated,” said the report
by Julian Metcalf, a Moody’s analyst in  San Francisco . “The
weakest would principally be those with very low or negative
general fund reserves or net cash balances.”  Brown, a 74-year-old Democrat, is campaigning for
 Proposition 30 , which would temporarily boost the  state sales
tax  to 7.5 percent from 7.25 percent and raise the levy on
income starting at $250,000. A rejection by voters would trigger
$5.5 billion in education cuts, enough for three weeks of
classes.  Munger, the daughter Charles Munger, the vice chairman of
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , is pressing for  Proposition 38 , which
would boost taxes for 12 years on income of more than $7,316,
from a 0.4 percentage point increase for the lowest earners to
2.2 percent for those making more than $2.5 million a year. It
would raise $10 billion annually.  $43 Billion Debt  Moody’s rates 327 California school districts for general
debt and seven more for leases or certificates of participation.
The districts have about $43 billion in total debt, Moody’s
said. The largest share, 118, are rated Aa2, Moody’s third-
highest grade. The most-populous state had 963 school districts
in 2010, according to a  report  by the California School Boards
Association.  Twelve California school districts were at risk of
bankruptcy in May, state Superintendent of Public Instruction
Tom Torlakson said in a  report  at the time. None has sought
 bankruptcy protection . In September, Brown  signed  a bill
allowing a state takeover and emergency loan to the Inglewood
Unified School District near Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
