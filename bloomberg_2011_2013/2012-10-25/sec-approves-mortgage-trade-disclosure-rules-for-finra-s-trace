The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission approved rules intended to increase transparency in a
corner of the market for mortgage- and asset-backed bonds.  The SEC agreed to a plan by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority to create public reporting for trades of
so-called specified government-backed mortgage bonds and
securities tied to Small Business Administration loans,
according to an Oct. 23 notice posted on its website.  The protocols for disclosures through Finra’s Trace system
will allow for the unique identifiers of bonds called CUSIPs to
be hidden, in favor of generic information about the securities.  Finra has been expanding Trace to securitized debt after
the opacity of trading in securities including  mortgage bonds 
without government backing contributed to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression in 2008, by fueling doubt
about the health of banks and funds. The non-governmental
regulator oversees more than 4,000 brokerage firms.  The Trace system started in 2002, providing the first real-
time data on most corporate bond trading to anyone with  Internet
access . Finra, which operates from  Washington  and  New York ,
began last year  disclosing  daily market-level information culled
from data on individual securitized-debt trades it had started
collecting earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
