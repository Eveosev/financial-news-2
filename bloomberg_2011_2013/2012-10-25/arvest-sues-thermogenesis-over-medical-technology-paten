Harvest Technologies Corp., a maker
of  laboratory equipment  used in cell therapy, sued  ThermoGenesis
Corp. (KOOL) , claiming its competitor violated patents for separating
blood into its components.  ThermoGenesis used technology protected by two patents,
titled Blood Components Separator Disk, Harvest claimed in court
papers filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  “ThermoGenesis’s actions have, at a minimum, shown willful
blindness or indifference” to the patents, Harvest said in its
complaint.  Both companies provide technologies used to help separate
blood and bone marrow into components, a key part of the process
for therapies related to stem cells.  Harvest, based in Plymouth, Massachusetts, is a unit of
Tokyo-based  Terumo Corp. (4543) , a medical-device maker.  In October 2008 a distributor, who was not sued as part of
the patent case, gave ThermoGenesis confidential information
about Harvest’s technology, Harvest claimed in the complaint.  Officials at ThermoGenesis did not immediately return a
call left at the company’s headquarters in Rancho Cordova,
California.  The case is Harvest Technologies Corp. v. ThermoGenesis
Corp., 12-cv-01354, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
