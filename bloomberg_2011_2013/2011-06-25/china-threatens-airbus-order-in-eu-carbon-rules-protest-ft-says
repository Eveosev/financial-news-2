China  may block the purchase of 10
Airbus SAS superjumbo planes in protest against the European
Union to make international airlines pay for an emissions
trading system, the Financial Times newspaper said.  Hong Kong Airlines had been expected to announce orders
worth as much as $3.8 billion for 10 Airbus planes at the  Paris
Air Show  this week, the report said, citing unidentified
executives.  Airbus, the planemaking unit of European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co., heard last weekend that the agreement was
delayed because of Chinaâ€™s opposition to the emissions rules,
according to the newspaper. Airbus and EADS declined to comment,
the FT said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
