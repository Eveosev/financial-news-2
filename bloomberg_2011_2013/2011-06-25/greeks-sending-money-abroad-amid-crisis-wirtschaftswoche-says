Greece  is experiencing a flight of
capital, with the amount of money being transferred out of the
country doubling to about 4 billion euros ($5.7 billion) in May
from April,  Wirtschaftswoche  said, citing industry estimates.  Money is being transferred from Greece to Germany, Austria,
Australia and elsewhere, and Greeks are now showing more
interest in buying luxury homes in areas of London including
Chelsea, Kensington and Knightsbridge, the magazine said, citing
real estate agents and bankers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
