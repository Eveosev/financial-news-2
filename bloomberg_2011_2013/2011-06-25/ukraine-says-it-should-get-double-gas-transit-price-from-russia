Ukraine’s government said it should
be getting twice what it’s currently paid to allow  Russia  to
pipe natural gas across its territory to Europe.  A fair transit fee would be $5.85 per 100-meter distance,
the cabinet of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said in a statement
on its  website  today. Ukraine gets $2.84 now.  Ukraine is dependent on Russia for more than half of its
energy needs. The government is in talks with Russian
politicians and gas-export monopoly OAO Gazprom to reduce the
price of natural gas deliveries.  The eastern European nation needs to balance the finances
of state-managed energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy to keep its
 budget deficit  within limits set by the International Monetary
Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
