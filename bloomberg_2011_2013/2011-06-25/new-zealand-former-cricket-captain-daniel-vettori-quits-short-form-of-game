New Zealand ’s Daniel Vettori, the
world’s  top-ranked bowler  in limited-overs cricket, will take an
indefinite break from international short games to extend his
Test career.  The 32-year-old former New Zealand captain, who has played
272 one-day international matches, may return to the discipline
in the time for the 2015  World Cup , he said in an e-mailed
 statement  from Christchurch-based New Zealand Cricket today.  Vettori made his New Zealand debut aged 18, the youngest
player to represent the nation, and is one of eight cricketers
to have more than 300 Test wickets and 3,000 runs, according to
the statement. He will continue to play for the Bangalore Royal
Challengers in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition.  “My reason for taking a break from the shorter forms of
the game is primarily so that I can preserve my body and
continue to represent” New Zealand in Test cricket, Vettori
said in the statement.  Test cricket matches are played over five days, while so-
called one-day games involve each side facing one 50-over
innings.  To contact the reporter for this story:
