Hungaryâ€™s government will likely
reach a decision by July 31 to consolidate the debt of state-
owned railway company MAV Zrt., state news service  MTI  said,
citing an executive.  The company, which has about 300 billion forint ($1.58
billion) in accumulated debt and pays 15 billion forint in
interest each year, would be able to use market financing if its
debt were consolidated, MTI cited MAV Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Ferenc Szarvas as saying.
