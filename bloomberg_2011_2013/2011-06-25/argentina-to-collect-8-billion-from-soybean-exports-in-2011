Argentina  will collect about $8
billion of soybean export duties this year, compared with $6.3
billion last year, according to an Agriculture Ministry
statement posted on the presidential  website .  Higher prices for soybeans increased revenue even as
Argentinaâ€™s harvest is estimated to be as much as 50.4 million
tons this year, compared with 55 million tons last year,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
