The  Washington Nationals  will name
Davey Johnson as their manager, ESPN reported on its website.  Johnson managed the  New York Mets  to the World Series title
in 1986. He’ll replace Jim Riggleman, who quit two days ago in a
contract dispute.  The 68-year-old Johnson has agreed to a contract through
the 2012 Major League Baseball season, with a club option for
2013, ESPN said, citing a person familiar with the situation. An
announcement on his hiring is expected later today, ESPN said. A
telephone call to the Nationals’ communications department went
unanswered.  Johnson last managed the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2000. He
also was manager in Cincinnati and Baltimore and has a record of
1,148-888 over 14 seasons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
