Private investors will be offered
the chance to lease the U.K.’s high-speed rail line linking
London, Manchester and Leeds as part of plans to recover
taxpayer money used to fund the project, the  Financial Times 
reported.  A 30-year concession will be offered to infrastructure
funds in an effort to recoup some of the 33 billion pounds
($52.7 billion) of taxpayer’s money, the London-based newspaper
said, citing Transport Secretary Philip Hammond.  Hammond declined to say how much money could be raised
through the lease, the Financial Times said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
