Brazil â€™s government may delay the
awarding of a license to build and operate a bullet train
linking Rio de Janeiro and  Sao Paulo  for a third time because of
a possible lack of interest, Folha de S. Paulo newspaper said,
without saying how it obtained the information.  Companies planning to bid on the project may get an
additional month to submit their proposals, Folha reported. They
were scheduled to deliver their bids in July, Folha reported.  The government previously postponed the auction in November
and April, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
