The U.K. Ministry of Defence is
about 10 billion pounds ($16 billion) short of what it needs in
the next few years and this may result in job cuts among air-
force and naval personnel, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  The estimated funding gap follows a review of the
ministry’s financial liabilities over the next ten years, the
London-based newspaper said, citing an unidentified defense
official. While the ministry’s budget, of 33.8 billion pounds
this year, is being cut by 8 percent over four years, this won’t
be enough to balance the budget, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
