China faces inflationary pressure
and the government’s top priority is to tackle price increases,
Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  said in Beijing today.  The global economic recovery faces many uncertainties, with
some nations experiencing sovereign debt problems and others
facing the risk of a downturn, Li said in a speech at the Second
Global Think Tank Summit held by the China Center for
International Economic Exchanges. Emerging economies need to
have more representation on global issues, he said.   Countries should coordinate to cope with the financial
crisis and need to work together to tackle inflation, he added.  Li is one of nine current members of the standing committee
of the ruling Communist Party and is the front-runner to succeed
Wen Jiabao as premier in 2013, according to  Joseph Cheng , a
political science professor at the City University of  Hong Kong ,
and Li Cheng, director of research at the Brookings
Institution’s John L. Thornton China Center in Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
