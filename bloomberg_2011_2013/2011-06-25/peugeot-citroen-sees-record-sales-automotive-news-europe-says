PSA Peugeot Citroen aims for record
unit sales this year and plans to add capacity in  China , Jean- Marc Gales, Peugeot’s head of sales, told  Automotive News
Europe .  The French automaker seeks to sell “significantly” more
cars in 2011 than the 3.6 million units sold in 2010, Gales is
cited as saying. The company may increase annual production
capacity at the company’s joint venture factory with Dongfeng
Motor Corp. in China to 800,000 units in the next five years,
Gales is cited as saying, and may add as many as 15,000 new jobs
in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
