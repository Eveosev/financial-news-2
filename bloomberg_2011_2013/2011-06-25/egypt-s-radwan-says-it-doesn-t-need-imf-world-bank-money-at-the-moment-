Egypt doesn’t need to borrow from
the  International Monetary Fund  and World Bank “at the moment”
after it cut its budget-deficit goal for the fiscal year
starting July 1, Finance Minister  Samir Radwan  said.  “We don’t need to borrow from the bank and the fund at the
moment,” Radwan said in a phone interview today. “We had a
budget deficit of 11 percent; we now have a budget deficit of
8.6 percent” of gross domestic product, he said.  A delegation from the IMF announced on June 5 that it
agreed to a $3 billion loan for Egypt. The 12-month loan was
part of a broader international support package for the country
after the uprising that resulted in the ouster of President
 Hosni Mubarak  hurt revenue from tourism and industry.  The IMF cut its 2011 economic growth forecast for Egypt in
April to 1 percent, from 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
