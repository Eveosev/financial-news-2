U.S. stocks fell this week, giving
the Standard & Poor 500 Index its seventh loss in eight weeks,
amid concern the European debt crisis isn’t contained.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  fell at
least 1.5 percent after European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said June 22 the turmoil threatens to infect
banks.  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  sank 7.9 percent, the most in the
S&P 500, after reporting revenue and profit that missed
analysts’ projections.  Red Hat Inc. (RHT) , the largest seller of the
Linux operating system, jumped 9.3 percent after beating
estimates with its earnings forecast.  The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,268.45, and dropped three
straight days to end the week. The measure has slumped 7 percent
since April 29. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 69.78
points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,934.58 this week.  “Everybody is trying to digest how the European debt
situation is going to shake out,” said Jason Pride, director of
investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia, which manages
about $20 billion. “They’re playing an expensive game of
chicken with  Greece  because the downside of not passing a
bailout for that country is effectively a financial system
meltdown.”  Equities fell after Moody’s Investors Service said on June
23 it may downgrade 13 Italian lenders because they would be
vulnerable to a cut in the government’s credit rating. Bond
yields rose in Spain and Italy. Trichet said risk signals for
financial stability in the euro area are flashing “red” as the
debt crisis in nations such as Greece threatens to infect banks
around the region.  ‘It Is Red’  “On a personal basis I would say ‘yes, it is red’,”
Trichet said June 22 in Frankfurt after a meeting of the
European Systemic Risk Board, referring to the group’s planned
“dashboard” to monitor risks. “The message of the board is
that” the link between debt problems and banks “is the most
serious threat to financial stability in the European Union.”  The  S&P 500  has dropped since climbing to an almost three-
year high on April 29 amid concern about  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis and weaker-than-estimated economic data. The benchmark
gauge for U.S. stocks has risen 0.9 percent this year.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, fell 3.4 percent to 21.10, paring three
consecutive weeks of gains.  U.S. equities rose the most since April on June 21 amid
investor optimism that a vote of confidence in Greek Prime
Minister George Papandreou is likely to determine how soon the
nation can win international aid to shore up its finances.
Yesterday, European Union leaders pledged to support Greece if
the nation approves austerity measures.  U.S. Data  Federal Reserve officials lowered their forecasts on June
22 for growth and employment in 2011 and 2012, projecting the
economy will expand 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent this year, down
from the projection of 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent in April. U.S.
central bankers said inflation, excluding food and energy, will
be somewhat higher than previously forecast. They said the pace
of recovery is likely to “pick up over coming quarters.”  Purchases of new U.S. houses fell in May for the first time
in three months, showing the industry is struggling to gain
momentum. Sales dropped 2.1 percent to a 319,000 annual pace
last month, figures from the Commerce Department showed June 23.  Banks Decline  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX) , which tracks 24 companies, declined 2.4
percent this week. JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, fell 3.2 percent to $39.49. Bank of America, the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, dropped 1.5 percent to $10.52.  Micron tumbled 7.9 percent to $7.21 as the biggest U.S.
maker of computer-memory chips reported revenue and profit that
fell short of analysts’ projections.  The price of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, for
personal computers dropped as supplies increased and demand from
makers of consumer laptops and desktop PCs remained sluggish,
the company said. Orders are also slowing for chips used in
inexpensive mobile phones, pushing down prices, Micron Chief
Executive Officer Steve Appleton said.  Walgreen Co. (WAG)  slumped 7.3 percent to $41.39, helping send
the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index down 1.7 percent, the most
among 10 groups. The largest U.S. drugstore chain said it failed
to renew a contract worth more than $5 billion in annual sales
with drug-benefits manager Express Scripts Inc. after
negotiations fell apart. The agreement will end as of Jan. 1.  P&G Retreats  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the world’s largest consumer-products
company, fell 3.3 percent to $62.59 for the second-biggest
retreat in the Dow average.  Boeing Co. (BA)  dropped the most in the Dow, slipping 3.9
percent to $71.26. AMR Corp.’s American Airlines is in talks
with Airbus SAS about buying at least 100 narrow-body planes, a
possible break from its longtime reliance on Boeing jets, two
people familiar with the matter said.  Energy companies in the S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent as a
group, the second-biggest weekly loss, as crude oil for August
delivery fell to $91.16 a barrel in  New York  after the
 International Energy Agency  on June 23 announced the release of
60 million barrels.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s largest
energy company by market value, retreated 2.8 percent to $76.78.
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. oil company, declined 1.3
percent to $97.90.  Red Hat jumped 9.3 percent to $45.03, the most in the S&P
500, after it said profit for fiscal year 2012 will be as much
as $1 a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 96 cents
a share from a Bloomberg survey.  CarMax Climbs  CarMax Inc. (KMX) , the largest U.S. seller of used cars, climbed
9.2 percent to $31.93 after saying first-quarter sales of used
cars increased 7.5 percent to 108,511 from the same period a
year earlier. Net income rose 25 percent to 55 cents a share,
compared with the average profit forecast of 47 cents a share in
a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts.  The  S&P 500 Materials Index (S5MATR) , which tracks 30 companies,
rose 2.4 percent, the most among 10 groups. Chemical maker
DuPont Co. jumped 4.8 percent to $51.96, while  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) ,
the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, increased
4.2 percent to $100.01, and  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, added 3.5 percent to $15.23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
