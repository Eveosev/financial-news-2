The volume of luxury items sold to
pawnbrokers in the U.K. has doubled since 2008 as the wealthy
sought alternative ways of tapping short-term credit, the
Financial Times newspaper said.  Suttons & Robertsons opened a new store this week in Fleet
Street in  London  this week, and online pawnbroker Borro more
than doubled the number of loans it made for 20,000 pounds
($31,918) or more in the first six months of 2011, the report
said. It comes amid tighter lending criteria by British banks,
the paper said.
