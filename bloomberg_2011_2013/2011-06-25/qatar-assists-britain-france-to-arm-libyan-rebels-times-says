Qatar is arming Libyan rebels with
weapons purchased from Britain and  France , the Times reported,
citing a western diplomat.  Britain and France rely on Doha to help the rebels, who are
fighting to topple Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi , to avoid
breaching their United Nations mandate by arming them, according
to the newspaper. Qatar is supplying the rebels with money, fuel
and arms, including French-made anti-tank missiles, the Times
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
