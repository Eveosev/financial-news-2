The government of Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi , fighting a rebellion backed by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, ordered food supplies worth 3.6
billion dinars ($3 billion) to cover the market’s needs for more
than six months, the JANA state-news agency reported.  The government signed contracts to import 600,000 metric
tons of wheat as well as baby milk, pasta and tomato sauce, the
agency said, citing Economy Minister Mohammed al-Huwaij. The
value of the food to be imported amounts to 1.8 billion dinars,
he said.  Qaddafi has been battling a pro-democracy insurgency
supported by NATO since February and his regime is also under
 United Nations , U.S. and European Union sanctions to starve him
of cash and fuel for his army. Libyan rebels are centered in the
city of Misrata, which is under bombardment by the central
government’s forces.  Al-Huwaij said he expects  Libya  to produce 200,000 metric
tons of wheat this year, according to JANA. The North African
nation’s government already subsidizes some basic commodities
like wheat and pasta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
