Mahela Jayawardene’s unbeaten 72 led
 Sri Lanka  to a nine-wicket win over England in their Twenty20
cricket match in Bristol.  Kumar Sangakkara was 43 not out as Sri Lanka reached its
target of 137 with 16 balls remaining from its 20 overs. He
teamed with Jayawardene for 97 after Sanath Jayasuriya was
caught by  Kevin Pietersen  from Jade Dernbach.  Eoin Morgan scored 47 for England, which reached 136-9
after losing the toss and being put in to bat. It was Stuart
Broad’s first game as England Twenty20 captain after he replaced
Paul Collingwood last month.  The teams begin a five-game one-day series June 28 at the
Oval in London. England won the Test series 2-0.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
