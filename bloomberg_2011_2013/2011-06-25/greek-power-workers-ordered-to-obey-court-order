Greece ’s Energy Ministry called on
the union at  Public Power Corp SA (PPC)  to abide by a court order
directing the striking workers to bring a number of power units
back online.  The defiance of the order to the GENOP-DEH union to bring
capacity back to June 23 levels is “creating a shortfall which
places the stability of the system in a critical situation”,
the Athens-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement. The
shortage led to extended power cuts today and yesterday, when
 Public Power  sought to have the strike declared illegal,
according to the statement.  “The government is determined to protect society from
practices which show disregard not just for court decisions but
for citizens and companies which are being harmed,” the
statement said.  GENOP began 48-hour rolling strikes on June 20 to protest
government plans to reduce its stake in the company to 34
percent from 51 percent. The divestment is part of a state asset
sale program that aims to raise 50 billion euros ($72 billion)
through 2015. Parliament is expected to vote on the asset sale
program next week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
