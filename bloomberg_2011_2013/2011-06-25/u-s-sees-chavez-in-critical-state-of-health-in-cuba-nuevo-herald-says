Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  is
in a critical state of health after undergoing surgery in Cuba,
 El Nuevo Herald  reported, citing unnamed U.S. intelligence
sources.  The intelligence sources told the Spanish-language sister
newspaper of the Miami Herald that, while Chavez isn’t in any
immediate risk of dying, his situation is complicated. His
daughter, Rosines Chavez, and ex-wife Marisabel Rodriguez were
flown in a military aircraft to  Havana  in the last 72 hours to
be by the president’s bedside, the newspaper reported.  The intelligence sources said they could not confirm that
Chavez, who was last seen in public June 9, is suffering from
prostate cancer as has been rumored in Caracas, El Nuevo Herald
said.  Venezuela ’s Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said yesterday
Chavez needs the support of his compatriots in “this big battle
for his health.” A lack of information surrounding Chavez’s
surgery for what he said was a pelvic absceess has raised
questions about the true state of his health and triggered
debates about whether he should be running  South America ’s
largest oil producer from Cuba.  To contact the reporter on this story:
