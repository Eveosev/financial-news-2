Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL)  may bid for
Brazilian airports as part of its plans to boost its concessions
business,  Cinco Dias  reported, citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the matter.  OHL, as the company is known, may be seeking a local
partner in  Brazil  to bid for the airports concessions in
Brasilia and Sao Paulo, the newspaper said.  Madrid-based OHL will also consider its options to manage
Spainâ€™s Barajas and El Prat airports, while it will focus on the
Brazilian airports, which may be open to tender in December,
Cinco Dias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
