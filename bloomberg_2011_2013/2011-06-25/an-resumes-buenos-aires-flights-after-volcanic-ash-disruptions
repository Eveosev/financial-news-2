Lan Airlines SA (LAN) , Latin America’s
biggest airline by market value, resumed flights to and from
Buenos Aires after conditions surrounding an ash cloud from a
volcanic eruption in Chile improved.  Lan added flights to Buenos Aires to carry those passengers
who were unable to travel yesterday after the company halted
operations to Argentina, the Santiago-based carrier said in an
e-mail statement.  Some other airlines resumed flights and began to reschedule
operations as the ash cloud moved toward Uruguay, said an
official at the terminal operator Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 SA
who asked not to be identified citing internal policy.  AMR Corp. (AMR)  American Airlines’ flights from Miami,  New York 
and Dallas that were scheduled to arrive this morning at  Buenos
Aires  international airport were canceled, according to
Aeropuertos Argentina 2000  website . Arrivals from Lima, Rio de
Janeiro and Miami by Aerolineas Argentinas SA were canceled
while departures to Madrid and Rome scheduled for last night
were delayed until this afternoon.  Most of Aerolineas domestic flights remained canceled,
according to the Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 information center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
