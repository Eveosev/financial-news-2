Roche Holding AG (ROG)  and Sanofi limited
drug deliveries to some hospitals in  Greece  because of unpaid
bills in the debt-stricken country, the Times reported.  Roche halted deliveries to public hospitals that havenâ€™t
paid their bills since September, the London-based newspaper
said, citing the Swiss company. Roche will continue to supply
medicines it considers to be life-saving, including Konakian,
which prevents bleeding, the Times said.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  is in talks with the Greek government
about outstanding payments, the newspaper reported, citing an
unidentified company spokesman. Nycomed ASA may also suspend
deliveries if the situation worsens, the Times said, citing the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
