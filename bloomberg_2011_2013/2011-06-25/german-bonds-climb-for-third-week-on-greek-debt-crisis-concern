German  government bonds  rose for a
third consecutive week as concern that  Greece ’s government will
struggle to pass the austerity measures needed to secure a
bailout boosted demand for the region’s safest assets.  The decline pushed yields down the most since the five days
ending August 20. Spanish 10-year bonds fell for a third
consecutive week, the longest streak of declines since November,
on speculation a European Union pledge to stabilize the region’s
economy won’t stop the debt crisis from spreading. Italian 10-
year bonds sank for a third straight week, increasing the yield
difference over German bunds to a record 216 percentage points.  “There’s flight to quality as a result of the ongoing
concern around the periphery and specifically the Greek
situation,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds
Bank Corporate Markets in  London . “Spain is seeing yields
rising because the market is cautious that the Greek situation
won’t be solved, and that causes contagion to other countries.”  The 10-year bund yield declined 12 basis points over the
week to 2.84 percent as of 4:55 p.m. in London yesterday, and
reached 2.83 percent, the lowest since Dec. 6. The 3.25 percent
security due July 2021 rose 1.09, or 10.90 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,419) face amount, to 103.57. Yields on two-year notes fell
16 basis points to 1.36 percent, their biggest weekly drop since
the five days ending May 27.  Merkel Comments  “We have agreed that there will be a new program for
Greece,” German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  told reporters at an
EU summit in Brussels yesterday. “This is an important decision
that says once again we will do everything to stabilize the euro
overall.”  Greece’s next hurdle is to shepherd 78 billion euros of
austerity measures through parliament next week. The nation’s
two-year bonds rose for the first week in three as traders pared
back bets on a near-term default.  Spain’s 10-year bonds fell, pushing the yield up 11 basis
points to 5.68 percent, within four basis points of a record.
 Italy ’s 10-year bond yields rose 16 basis points to 4.98
percent, the most since March 10.  German bunds may fall next week as a report due June 30
shows European inflation accelerated in June, upping the chance
that the  European Central Bank  will boost borrowing costs in
July. Inflation in the 17-nation euro region accelerated to 2.8
percent from 2.7 percent in May, according to the median
estimate of 37 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “The macro data is of interest, but at the moment it’s
likely to be overlaid by the Greek situation and what’s going on
there,” Wand said.  The Greek Parliament is scheduled to hold the final session
of a debate on the government’s medium-term fiscal plan on June
29 at 10 a.m.  Greek government bonds have handed investors a loss of 19
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
German bunds have returned 0.9 percent.  Spain ’s debt has gained
1.5 percent and Italy’s has returned 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
