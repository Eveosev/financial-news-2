A suicide bomber in a car packed with
explosives blew up a hospital in eastern  Afghanistan , killing at
least 20 people and wounding 23 others, including patients and
medical staff.  The attack occurred at 10:30 a.m. local time today in the
Azra district of Logar province, the Afghanistan Interior
Ministry said in a statement. The blast at the 10-bed clinic
killed as many as 60 people and wounded 120 others, according to
the head of public hospitals in the region.  “Most of the dead bodies are women and children who had
come to get treatment and the others are men,” Mohammed Zarif
Nayedkhel, the head of public hospitals in Logar province, said
in a phone interview. “All the dead and wounded bodies are
civilians. Personnel of the clinic; ill people.”  It was the first time a “massive blast occurred” in the
in a mountainous Azra district, Nayedkhel said.  The clinic’s
entrance gate was not guarded.  “The clinic has never had guards because it’s a hospital,
not a military base,” he said.  Zabihullah Mujahed, a spokesman for the Taliban guerrilla
movement, said the group wasn’t responsible for the attack on a
civilian target.  Yesterday, a bicycle loaded with explosives blew up in
bazaar of Northern Kunduz province, leaving 10 people dead and
25 wounded.  To contact the reporters on this story:
