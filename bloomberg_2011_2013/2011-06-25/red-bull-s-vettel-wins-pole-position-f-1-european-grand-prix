Sebastian Vettel won pole position
for tomorrow’s European Grand Prix, the seventh time in eight
races this season the defending Formula One champion was fastest
in qualifying.  Vettel posted a time of 1 minute, 36.98 seconds on the
street circuit around the quayside in Valencia, Spain, 0.19
seconds faster than Red Bull teammate Mark Webber.  Lewis Hamilton  of McLaren was 0.22 seconds further back in
third and will be on the second row of the 24-driver starting-
grid with Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso .  “It’s a tricky circuit, with 25 corners so to get the
right line is quite tough,” Vettel told a news conference.
“It’s good to start from the front.”  Vettel leads the drivers’ championship with 161 points
through seven of 19 races, 60 more than second-place Jenson Button of McLaren, who will start sixth next to Ferrari’s Felipe Massa. Webber is third with 94 points, followed by Hamilton with
85 points and Alonso with 69 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
