The Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, known as the FARC, is seeking to participate in public
works contracts in a bid to raise funds, according to a posting
by President  Juan Manuel Santos  on his  website .  Government pressure on the group has reduced their ability
to raise money by trafficking in drugs, Santos said.  FARC is trying to intimidate mayors of different regions of
the Colombia to win the contracts, Santos said after reading e-
mails by the group, the website posting said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
