Egypt scrapped plans to request a $3
billion loan from the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank to boost public finances following the revolt that toppled
former President  Hosni Mubarak , the Financial Times  reported
today , citing Finance Minister Samir Radwan.  The decision to abandon the borrowing plan for now followed
a move by Egyptâ€™s interim government to reduce public spending
for the fiscal year that begins in July, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
