Rain from Tropical Storm Meari
battered the Philippine capital and nearby provinces during the
past two days, causing floods that prompted evacuations as dams
overflowed.  Wind damaged 15 houses in Quezon City yesterday, knocking
down trees and electric posts and wrecking three cars, the
 National Disaster  Risk Reduction and Management Council said in
its 6 a.m. report. One woman was injured as she fled her house,
the report said.  The home of San Miguel Corp. Chairman Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.
was one of those damaged, Chief Superintendent George Regis said
in a mobile phone message today. A gale also swept through
Iloilo province in the central  Philippines  yesterday, damaging
24 houses and destroying 25, National Disaster said.  Fifteen people are missing, including 10 fishermen from
eastern provinces, the disaster agency reported. Nonstop rain
caused La Mesa Dam, in Quezon City, and Ipo Dam, in Bulacan
province, to overflow. Of the 75,150 people affected by the
evacuation, more than 11,000 were from Marikina City in the
capital, an area that also suffered flooding during Storm
Ketsana almost two years ago.  Rain caused flooding and snarled traffic in the capital on
June 23, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported this week.  The Philippines is regularly battered by tropical storms
that form over the Pacific Ocean east of the island country. In
September 2009, Ketsana flooded  Manila  and parts of Luzon,
killing more than 400 people and affecting almost 5 million.  ‘Better Prepared’  “We are better prepared this time” than in 2009, Office
of Civil Defense Administrator Benito Ramos said yesterday.  Northern and central Luzon will continue to experience
monsoon rain that may cause flooding and landslides even as
Meari, with maximum winds of 105 kilometers (65 miles) per hour
and gusts up to 135 kilometers per hour, departs toward the
northwest, according to the 5 a.m. bulletin of the  Philippine
Atmospheric , Geophysical & Astronomical Services Administration.  Some areas in Quezon City and Marikina City were still
impassable to vehicles as of 6 a.m., police said in a report.  Editors:  Jim McDonald ,  John McCluskey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
