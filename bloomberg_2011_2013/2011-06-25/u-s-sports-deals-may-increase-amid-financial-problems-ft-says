U.S. sports teams may increasingly
be put up for sale as rising player costs and other financial
problems prompt owners to exit, the  Financial Times  reported.  Comcast-Spectacor, which owns the  Philadelphia 76ers , a
basketball team, is in talks with potential buyers while the LA
Dodgers could also be among the major league baseball teams to
be sold, the London-based newspaper said, citing Charles Baker,
a partner at DLA Piper LLP, a  law firm .  To contact the reporters on this story:
