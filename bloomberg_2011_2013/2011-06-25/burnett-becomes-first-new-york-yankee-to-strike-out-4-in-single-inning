A.J. Burnett  became the first New
York Yankees pitcher to strike out four batters in an inning
yesterday, in the team’s 4-2 loss to the  Colorado  Rockies.  Burnett struck out Chris Iannetta and  Carlos Gonzalez 
looking to start the sixth inning at Yankee Stadium. Chris Nelson then struck out swinging, and was safe at first base as
the pitch bounced in the dirt and ricocheted off catcher Russell Martin, rolling to the backstop. Todd Helton went down swinging
for the third out.  It was first 4-strikeout inning since Seattle’s Felix Hernandez accomplished the feat on June 3, 2010, and the second
time for Burnett. His first came in the first inning on July 5,
2002, when he was pitching for the  Florida Marlins  against the
 New York Mets .  Burnett (17-11) became the second pitcher in league history
to have four strikeouts in an inning in more than one game.
Chuck Finley did it three times: with Cleveland on April 15,
2000; and with Anaheim on Aug. 15, and on May 12, 1999.  Alex Rodriguez hit a one-run double in the first inning to
give the Yankees (38-37) a 1-0 lead. His sacrifice fly in the
third scored Curtis Granderson to tie the game at 2-2 after
 Jason Giambi  homered in the second and Helton hit a one-run
single in the third for Colorado.  Ty Wigginton grounded to third to score Giambi and Troy Tulowitzki homered in the fifth for the Rockies (43-31).  Ubaldo Jimenez (3-7) allowed four hits and two runs and
struck out seven in seven innings for the win.  Burnett (7-6) gave up seven hits and four runs and struck
out five in 6 1/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
