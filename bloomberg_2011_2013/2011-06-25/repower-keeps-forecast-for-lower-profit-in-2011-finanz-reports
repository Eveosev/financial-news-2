Repower AG (REPP)  is maintaining its
forecast that operating profit will be “slightly” lower in
2011 than last year,  Finanz und Wirtschaft  reported Chief
Executive Officer Kurt Bobst as saying.  The weakness of the euro against the Swiss franc is a “big
challenge” for the company as it reduces the value of
electricity exports, Bobst said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
