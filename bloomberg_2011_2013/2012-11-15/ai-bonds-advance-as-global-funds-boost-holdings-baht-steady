Thailand ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the two-year yield to the lowest level this week, after
foreign funds seeking higher returns pumped money into the
securities. The baht was steady.  International investors  purchased  $264 million more
sovereign notes than they sold in the first three days of this
week, according to Thai Bond Market Association data. Thailand’s
10-year bonds yield 3.47 percent, compared with 1.59 percent for
similar-maturity Treasuries and 0.76 percent for Japanese debt.
Overseas funds sold a net $201 million of Thai equities this
week through yesterday, exchange data show.  “Risk sentiment is not that strong to the point where
investors are aggressively taking risks, so bonds attract more
funds than stocks,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based
foreign-exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “Thai
bonds still offer higher yields relative to those from developed
nations.”  The yield on the 5.25 percent notes due May 2014 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.81 percent as of
8:31 a.m. in Bangkok, the lowest level since Nov. 9, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The baht traded at 30.70 per dollar, the same as
yesterday’s closing level, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, held at 4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
