Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB (COMERUBC) ,
a Mexican supermarket chain, rose the most in five months after
being included in the MSCI Mexico Index.  The Mexico City-based retailer climbed 5.3 percent, the
most since June 14, to 39.44 pesos. Steelmaker  Industrias CH
SAB (ICHB) , which will also be added to the index, gained 5 percent,
the most in three months, to 81.79 pesos.  Petrochemical company  Alpek SAB (ALPEKA) , a publicly-traded unit of
San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico-based  Alfa SAB (ALFAA) , increased 5.7
percent to 33.78 pesos after the announcement that it will be
included in the gauge, making it the  top  gainer on the benchmark
IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks. That was its largest one-day
increase since going public in April.  “The index is a sample portfolio and being included in it
should in principle make demand for these shares grow,”  Gerardo Copca , an analyst with research company Metanalisis SA, said in
a telephone interview from Mexico City.  The three companies will gain inclusion in the MSCI index
as of the Nov. 30 market close, MSCI Inc. said in a  statement  on
its website.  Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico SAB  will also be
added to MSCI’s Mexico index. The airport operator fell 0.8
percent to 62.54 pesos.  There were no deletions from MSCI’s Mexico index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
