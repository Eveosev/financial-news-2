Czech monetary policy may need to be
more relaxed next year to ensure that inflation develops as the
central bank forecasts, Governor Miroslav Singer said.  The foreign-exchange channel would be the next tool to use
should the central bank decide that further monetary easing is
needed, Singer said at a conference in Trutnov,  Czech Republic .  The Czech economy shrank for a fourth consecutive quarter
between July and September, data showed today, matching the
longest decline on record as the government’s budget-deficit
cuts constrained household spending. Weakening domestic demand
is taming inflation, which pushed the central bank to cut rates
to effectively zero and prompted talk of weakening the currency
should the economy require more policy easing.  “There may be a need, at around the middle of next year,
for monetary policy to be even more relaxed than now,” Singer
said, reiterating that the central bank’s goal is  price
stability .  The koruna weakened 0.5 percent to 25.563 per euro as of
2:36 p.m. in  Prague , its lowest in in fourth months.  The bank reduced the main two-week  repurchase  rate to a
record-low 0.05 percent on Nov. 1, almost three-quarters of a
point less than the euro-area benchmark. Most Czech central
bankers agree the main  interest rate  should be kept at
effectively zero until inflation risks rise significantly,
according to minutes from their last rate meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
