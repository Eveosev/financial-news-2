Bulgaria ’s economic recovery kept
its pace in the third quarter as rising domestic demand offset a
decline in exports to the European Union because of the euro-
area’s debt crisis.  Gross domestic product rose 0.5 percent from a year
earlier, the same increase as in the previous three months, the
Sofia-based Statistics Institute said today in a preliminary
estimate. Seasonally adjusted GDP advanced 0.1 percent from the
previous quarter.  Bulgaria’s stable domestic economic environment and solid
public finances are supporting  consumer confidence  and boosting
domestic demand and investment in public projects, the European
Commission said in a report on Nov. 7.  The commission, the EU’s executive arm in Brussels, raised
its economic growth forecast for Bulgaria on Nov. 7 to 0.8
percent this year from a May estimate of 0.5 percent citing
lower lending rates, which will support “a modest growth in
credit” and consumption.  The  International Monetary Fund  raised its 2012 economic
growth forecast to 1 percent on Oct. 2 from a 0.8 percent
estimate on April 17, citing stronger domestic demand boosted by
EU aid.  Bulgaria weathered the global financial crisis without an
international bail out. The government increased investment in
road and railway construction projects, which are con-financed
with the European Union.  Bulgaria’s economy grew 1.7 percent last year, after a
revised 0.4 percent in 2010, according to the institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
