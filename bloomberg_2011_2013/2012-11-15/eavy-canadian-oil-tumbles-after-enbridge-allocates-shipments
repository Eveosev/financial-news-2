Western Canada Select, a heavy oil
blend from  Alberta , tumbled to the widest discount in almost two
weeks after  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  allocated space on two pipelines that
help take Canadian supplies to U.S. refiners.  Enbridge Inc. is apportioning Lines 4 and 67 by 18 percent
in aggregate for the rest of this month,  Graham White , a
Calgary-based spokesman for Enbridge, said in an e-mail. The
apportionment is the result of unplanned outages and
maintenance, he said.  The lines, which have a combined capacity of 1.25 million
barrels a day, start in Edmonton and Hardisty, Alberta, and
terminate in Superior,  Wisconsin . An 18 percent cut is a
reduction of about 225,000 barrels a day or 14 percent of
Canadian imports into the U.S. Midwest Padd 2 region.  Western Canada Select weakened $2.10 to a $32 per barrel
discount to West Texas Intermediate at 3:26 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude declined $2.25 a barrel to a discount of $8
against the U.S. benchmark.  The grades also weakened after  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  said
yesterday it will declare force majeure for oil shipments on the
590,000-barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline because of power
restrictions caused by severe weather.  Gulf Crudes  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, domestic grades strengthened as the
margin between WTI and Brent widened to $25.53, the largest gap
since October 2011. Brent for December delivery expired today.  When Brent’s premium to WTI gains, it typically strengthens
the value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign oils priced
using the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1.10 to $23
a barrel, the most since March 23. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added
$1.35 to $22.65 a barrel over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium widened $1.60 to $19.75, the largest
margin above WTI since Oct. 24, 2011. Mars Blend increased $1.65
to $19.50 a barrel over WTI and Southern Green Canyon gained
$1.30 to a $19.65 premium.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened $2 to $22 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
