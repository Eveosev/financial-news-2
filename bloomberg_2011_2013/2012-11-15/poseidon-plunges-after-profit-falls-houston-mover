Poseidon Concepts Corp. (PSN) , a Canadian
supplier of  storage tanks  for hydraulic-fracturing fluids, fell
62 percent, the most in its history, after reporting results
below analysts’ estimates.  Poseidon fell to C$5 at the close in Toronto, the lowest
since the Calgary-based company began trading in November 2011.  Net income in the third quarter fell 45 percent to C$7.8
million ($7.8 million), or 10 cents a share, Poseidon said
yesterday in a statement. That’s 38 cents lower than the average
of seven analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company
said it suffered from a slowdown in oil and natural gas wells
being completed in the U.S.  Poseidon was previously known for underpromising and
overdelivering, Geoff Ready, an analyst at Haywood Securities in
Calgary, said in a telephone interview. He rates the shares at
outperform, which means investors should buy the stock, and owns
none. “They just blew that all up with yesterday’s release.”  The company reduced guidance for earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization this year to a range of
C$140 million to C$150 million. That’s lower than the C$165
million average of nine analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Poseidon also cut  capital spending  42 percent to C$35
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
