Sugar-cane output in  Brazil ’s center
south, the main growing region of the world’s biggest producer,
will rise 6.7 percent in the season that starts there in April,
according to Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty.  Cane production in the area will total 557 million metric
tons in 2013-14, the Brisbane, Australia-based researcher
estimates. That compares with 522 million tons in the 2012-13
marketing year under way. Production in Brazil’s center south
fell for the first time in a decade in 2011-12 to 493.3 million
tons, according to data from industry group Unica.  “The crop has been given some renovation in the last
year,” Tom McNeill, a director at the company who has worked in
sugar for more than 25 years, said in a phone interview today.  Sugar production in the area will rise to 35 million tons
from 32.4 million tons in 2012-13, the researcher estimates.
Ethanol output will climb to 23.1 billion liters (6.1 billion
gallons) in 2013-14 from 21.5 billion in the current season,
McNeill estimated. Both the sweetener and the biofuel are made
from raw material sugar cane in the South American nation.  “We don’t expect much change with respect to ethanol, so
we’ve given quite a high sugar number,” he said.  Millers in the center south will direct 48.1 percent of all
the cane processed to making sugar instead of ethanol, according
to Green Pool. That’s little changed from 48.44 percent in
2012-13. Green Pool’s estimates allow for an increase in ethanol
exports to the U.S. and assume that the Brazilian government
will keep its biofuel policy unchanged.  “The Brazilian government would have to hike the price of
gasoline for that to change and currently they are not showing
indications that they want to do that,” McNeill said, referring
to a possible higher allocation of cane to make the biofuel.
“If they do, we will revisit those assumptions.”  Sweetener Surpluses  The global sugar market may face a fourth year of surpluses
because of rising output in Brazil, according to Green Pool.
Prices have slipped 18 percent this year in  New York  as supplies
outpaced demand. The surplus in 2012-13 will be 5.9 million
tons, according to the  International Sugar Organization  in
 London .  “The difficulty for the world market is that we have the
potential for a fourth year of surplus,” McNeill said. “Unless
there are compensating production falls elsewhere it’s hard to
see that we will be balanced or in a deficit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
