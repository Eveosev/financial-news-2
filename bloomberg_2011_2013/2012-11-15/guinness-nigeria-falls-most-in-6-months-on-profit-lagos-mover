Guinness Nigeria Plc (GUINNESS) , the country’s
second-biggest brewer by market value, fell the most in almost
six months after first-quarter profit missed estimates, Vetiva
Capital Management Ltd. said.  Guinness fell 5 percent to 251.85 naira by the close in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, the biggest decline since
May 21. More than 264,000 shares, 84 percent of the three-month
daily average, changed hands, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Net income for the period through September fell 29 percent
to 1.8 billion naira ($11.4 million) the company said on Nov. 8.
Revenue fell to 25.71 billion naira from 25.8 billion naira, it
said. Vetiva had seen profit of 2.8 billion naira on sales of
28.2 billion.  “The result wasn’t good at all, it was very bad, and I
think that may be responsible for the price fall,” Pabina
Yinkere, head of research at Vetiva, said by phone from Lagos
today. Vetiva has maintained its sell recommendation on the
stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
