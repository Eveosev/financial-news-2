Gold futures fell to a one-week low
after a report showed that global demand ebbed in the third
quarter. Platinum dropped after a two-month strike at South
Africa’s top producer ended.  The World Gold Council said in a report today that global
demand declined 11 percent from a record a year earlier as
slowing growth in China, the world’s second-biggest consumer,
cut investment and jewelry purchases.  Anglo American Platinum
Ltd. (AMS) , based in Johannesburg, said an accord on pay ended labor
walkouts.  “The combination of the Anglo miners going back to work
and the World Gold Council report showing gold demand falling is
pressuring precious metals,”  David Meger , the director of metal
trading at Vision Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery retreated 0.9 percent to
settle at $1,713.80 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex, the
biggest drop since Nov. 2. Earlier, the price touched $1,704.50,
the lowest for a most-active contract since Nov. 7.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 1.1 percent to $1,573.30 an ounce, the
biggest decline since Nov. 7.  Silver futures for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$32.674 an ounce on the Comex.  Palladium futures for December delivery slumped 1.6 percent
to $631.20 an ounce on the Nymex, the largest drop since Nov. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
