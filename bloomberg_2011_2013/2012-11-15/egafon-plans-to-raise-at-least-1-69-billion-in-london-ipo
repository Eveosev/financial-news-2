OAO MegaFon (MFON) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, plans to raise as much as $2.1 billion in
the biggest initial public offering by a company from the
country since  United Co. Rusal (486) ’s sale almost three years ago.  MegaFon and investor  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  will sell a combined 15
percent stake for $20 to $25 per global depositary receipt,
Moscow-based MegaFon said today. The offer may raise $1.7
billion to $2.1 billion, according to a term sheet obtained by
Bloomberg. There will be a 10 percent so-called over-allotment
option to cover extra demand, and trading of the shares will
begin Nov. 28 in London and Moscow, the carrier said.  The IPO is a part of a shareholder agreement reached in
April with  Alisher Usmanov , the Russian billionaire who controls
MegaFon, to resolve disputes between Stockholm-based TeliaSonera
and the venture’s local owners. Usmanov will retain his 50
percent holding, while TeliaSonera will keep at least 25
percent, MegaFon said today.  “With this IPO, TeliaSonera is monetizing its investments
in Russia, where it has received barely any returns in the last
decade,” said Evgeny Golosnoy, an analyst at IFC Metropol in
Moscow. “When the Nordic company started developing MegaFon,
they could’ve hoped to gain control, while by now it has become
obvious that Russia won’t let foreigners control the country’s
major mobile operators.”  Shareholder Accord  TeliaSonera, Sweden’s largest phone company, helped set up
MegaFon in 2002 when the Nordic company was created in a
merger with  Finland ’s biggest fixed-line operator and they
combined their Russian assets. Governance and strategy disputes
with Russian partners have since plagued the venture.  As part of a shareholder settlement in April, when
billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Altimo cashed out of the operator
and Usmanov boosted his ownership, MegaFon agreed to pay the
higher of 50 percent of net income or 70 percent of cash flows
in dividends.  The IPO price implies a market value of $11.2 billion to
$14 billion, MegaFon said. That compares with so-called fair
value of $12 billion to $16 billion estimated in October by
analysts.  “Russian IPOs are often priced with a 10 percent to 20
percent discount to fair value,” said Mikhail Nesterov, who
helps manage $4.5 billion of assets at St. Petersburg-based TKB
BNP Paribas Investment Partners. “It’s positive that the
MegaFon’s  price range  implies a discount” to larger local
competitor  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , or MTS.  MTS Discount  MTS’s current price implies a multiple of enterprise value
to forecast 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of 4.4, according to IFC Metropol. The middle
of MegaFon’s price range reflects a multiple of 4.15, about a 6
percent discount to MTS, based on UralSib Capital estimates for
MegaFon’s 2013 Ebitda.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  are managing MegaFon’s
share sale, with help from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  and  VTB Capital. (VTBR)   MegaFon will start a roadshow with investor meetings in  New
York  today, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked
not to be identified because the plan isn’t public.  “MegaFon is the last out of Russia’s three major mobile
operators to go public and should attract some investor
interest, at least at the lower end of the price range,” said
Konstantin Belov, analyst at UralSib Capital in Moscow.  Russian IPOs  MTS, Russia’s largest mobile operator, has  traded  in New
York since 2000. Another rival, VimpelCom, sold shares in the
U.S. in 1996 and is now part of  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , which operates
in 18 countries including Russia.  MegaFon had 62.8 million users in Russia at the end of the
third quarter, versus MTS’s 70.7 million subscribers and 56.2
million customers using VimpelCom in Russia, according to
Moscow-based researcher  AC&M Consulting .  Russian companies are returning to stock offerings after
the central bank sold a $5.2 billion stake in Sberbank in
September in a secondary offering.  MD Medical Group Investments
Plc (MDMG) , Russia’s largest chain of maternity centers, raised $289
million in a London IPO last month.  Rusal, the biggest aluminum producer, has fallen 59 percent
on the Hong Kong exchange since its $2.2 billion IPO in January
2010.  Kcell’s Sale  TeliaSonera is selling another asset in an IPO at the same
time. Kcell, the company’s unit in  Kazakhstan , is seeking to
sell as much as 25 percent stake in an IPO in London and Almaty,
according to a Nov. 13 filing. Kcell, with 12.7 million users,
had $1.2 billion revenue last year.  TeliaSonera expects to receive proceeds of 9 billion kronor
($1.3 billion) to 11 billion kronor from MegaFon’s IPO, the
Swedish company said today. TeliaSonera rose 1.6 percent to
44.91 kronor at 2:18 p.m. in  Stockholm .  MegaFon’s third-quarter profit  rose  20 percent to 14.9
billion rubles ($470 million) as customer gains helped boost
revenue 12 percent to 71.2 billion rubles. Operating profit
before depreciation and amortization increased to 45 percent of
sales from 42 percent.  Data revenue accounted for 13 percent of MegaFon’s sales as
customers browsed the Web and sent e-mail on mobile devices.
Mobile broadband will remain the main driver for phone
companies’ revenue, according to UralSib Capital.  Usmanov also controls smaller mobile operator Scartel,
which uses the brand Yota and which  is working  with MegaFon in
developing a faster network.  MegaFon may use the IPO’s proceeds to reduce its 159
million rubles of debt or for investments such as network
improvements, CEO Ivan Tavrin said Oct. 9. MegaFon doesn’t need
the proceeds to fund acquisitions and doesn’t plan any takeovers
abroad, he said.  Tavrin, 36, agreed to buy 1.25 percent in MegaFon within a
month following the IPO and has an option to increase his stake
to as much as 5 percent by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
