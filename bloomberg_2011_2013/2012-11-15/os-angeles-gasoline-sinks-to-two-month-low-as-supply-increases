Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  dropped
to the lowest in more than two months after the Energy
Department said supplies of the fuel on the West Coast jumped
last week to a seven-month high.  Gasoline inventories in the Padd 5 region increased 4.2
percent to 29.9 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 9, the
highest since April 6, the Energy Department said.  California-grade gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
dropped for the seventh straight day, declining 3 cents to 6.5
cents a gallon over gasoline futures traded on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 4:04 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the fuel’s lowest premium
since Sept. 11.  San Francisco  Carbob slid for the fourth day, losing 2
cents to a discount of 4.5 cents against futures, its lowest
level since July 20.  California-grade, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco was
unchanged for a second day at 2.5 cents a gallon over Nymex

percent to 12.9 million barrels last week, a four-week high,
Energy Department data show.  Conventional 84 sub-octane gasoline to be blended with
ethanol in  Portland ,  Oregon , fell for the fourth day, dropping
1.25 cents to 14.25 cents a gallon under gasoline futures. Low-
sulfur diesel in Portland tumbled 5 cents to 12 cents a gallon

yesterday. The line was shut Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
