Croatian Construction Minister Ivan Vrdoljak will probably be the next economy minister,  state TV 
reported late yesterday, without saying how it got the
information.  Vrdoljak would be replacing Radimir Cacic, who resigned
yesterday after a Hungarian court sentenced him to 22 months in
jail for causing a fatal accident on a highway to Budapest.  Foreign Minister  Vesna Pusic  is in line to become deputy
prime minister, another post held by Cacic, the TV station said.
Like Cacic, Vrdoljak and Pusic are members of  Croatian Peopleâ€™s
Party , a partner in the 10-month-old coalition led by  Social
Democrats  and Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
