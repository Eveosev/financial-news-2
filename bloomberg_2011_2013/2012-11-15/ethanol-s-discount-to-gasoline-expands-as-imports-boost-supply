Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded on speculation that imports will exacerbate a glut of
the biofuel.  The additive’s discount to the motor fuel widened to 36.12
cents a gallon from 33.6 cents yesterday, based on December
futures prices, after an Energy Department report showed  imports 
in the week ended Nov. 9 were almost triple levels a year
earlier. Gasoline’s premium was 99.8 cents on Sept. 28.  Ethanol  stockpiles , at 17.9 million barrels, were 4.3
percent higher than a year earlier while  production  was down 10
percent, the report showed.  “You’ve got plenty of supply,” said Jerrod Kitt, analyst
at Linn Group in Chicago. “It’s just the fact that you have
 Brazil  in the market. If you get Brazil out of here, you’ll get
inventories down pretty quickly.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 0.8 cent, or
0.3 percent, to settle at $2.335 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The futures have risen 6 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery rose 1.72 cents or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.6962 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 90 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, down from 92 percent in the week ended
Nov. 2 and the lowest level in four weeks.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast was
unchanged at $2.485 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive
gained 0.5 cent to $2.425, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Spot Markets  Ethanol in  Chicago  decreased 0.5 cent to $2.35 a gallon and
in New York the biofuel lost 1 cent to $2.45.  The U.S. became a  net importer  of ethanol in August for the
first time since November 2010, according to the Energy
Department.  Brazil exported 56,000 barrels of ethanol a day to the U.S.
in August, Energy Department  data  show, the highest level in six
years.  Anhydrous ethanol in Sao Paulo, where the fuel is made from
sugar cane, fetched $2.19 a gallon in the week ended Nov. 9,
data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The fuel is made primarily
from corn in the U.S.  Corn for March delivery slipped 4.25 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $7.25 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
30 cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be made from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
