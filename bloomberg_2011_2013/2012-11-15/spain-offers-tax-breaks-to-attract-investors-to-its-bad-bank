Spain ’s government approved tax
incentives to attract investors to the bad bank it’s creating to
comply with the conditions of its 100 billion-euro ($128
billion) European bank bailout.  The  decree  allows the bad bank, known as Sareb, to transfer
assets to funds that will be set up according to asset type,
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said. The funds will target
institutional investors and will be taxed similarly to
collective investment vehicles, or Sicavs, which pay 1 percent.  “The obligation for the state to succeed in selling assets
has made it necessary to give funds a fiscal incentive,” de Guindos told reporters today after the weekly Cabinet meeting in
 Madrid .  Spain is trying to attract investors to buy the assets of
the bad bank while also seeking private shareholders for the
institution to limit the cost to tax payers. The bad bank, which
is set to come into effect on Dec. 1, plans to buy about 62
billion euros of assets from rescued lenders, including loans to
real-estate developers and foreclosed properties.  Transfers from the bad bank to the funds and operations by
both will be also exempt from transaction taxes, de Guindos
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
