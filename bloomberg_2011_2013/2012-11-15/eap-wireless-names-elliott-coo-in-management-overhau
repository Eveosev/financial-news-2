Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) ,
the San Diego-based pay-as-you-go wireless carrier, named Jerry Elliott as president and chief operating officer, six months
after he joined the company as finance chief.  Perley McBride, who has served as executive vice president
of finance at the Weather Co., will replace Elliott as chief
financial officer on Dec. 10, Leap said today in a statement.  The carrier has been struggling to hang on to customers as
its rivals upgrade to speedier networks that use a technology
called long-term evolution, or LTE. The company lost about
269,000 users in the third quarter.  The shares, down 36 percent this year, fell 1.4 percent to
$5.91 yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
