     Nov. 15 (Bloomberg)--  Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FLOURMIL) , the
country’s biggest miller by market value, will start production
at its 750,000-metric ton sugar refinery in December, Chief
Financial Officer Jacques Gauthier said.  “We are confident we will have our first production trials
in December,” Gauthier said on a conference call with analysts
today from Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, where the plant
is located.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation of more than 160
million, wants to cut food imports by raising domestic supplies.
The country, which produced enough food to feed its population
in the 1960s, is now the world’s largest importer of rice and
sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest importer of wheat and sugar.  Flour Mills has received approval “in principle” from the
Securities and Exchange Commission to acquire the minority
shareholding of Nigerian Bag Manufacturing Company Plc, Gauthier
said. The Flour Mills board will announce “shortly” the next
stage of its negotiation with shareholders in the bag producer,
he said.  Flour Mills shares have fallen 3 percent this year,
compared with a 27 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
