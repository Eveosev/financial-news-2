U.S. regulators should begin closing
some air-traffic facilities during slow periods late at night,
the chairman of the House aviation subcommittee said.  Representative Tom Petri, a Wisconsin Republican, said in
an interview yesterday that fellow members of Congress -- who
have at times blocked cost-saving efforts -- need to let the
Federal Aviation Administration shut underutilized air-control
towers and radar rooms.  More than 100 U.S. airport towers and regional radar rooms
don’t have enough late-night traffic to justify staying open
under FAA guidelines, according to government data compiled by
Bloomberg. Closing those towers during slow periods could save
an estimated $10 million a year.  “The numbers are not huge in the overall scheme of things,
but they are significant in the FAA budget and small things do
add up,” Petri said yesterday. He will lose the subcommittee
chairman’s post next year because of party term limits.  Attempts to reduce hours in towers are often blocked by
U.S. lawmakers, according to logs of correspondence obtained by
Bloomberg through the Freedom of Information Act. At least 26
times, lawmakers from both parties pressured FAA on controller
staffing levels or the location of air-traffic radar rooms, from
2010 through May 2012, according to the records.  Closure List  Petri said he hopes the FAA will act under a provision
passed earlier this year to help close facilities without having
to fight political battles over individual locations.  The measure authorizing the agency’s operations establishes
a budget-trimming process similar to the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission, which closed military bases. The law
ordered the FAA to come up with a list of air-traffic facilities
that could be consolidated into larger centers. The agency must
develop the list with unions and the aviation industry.  Once the public has been given a chance to comment and the
list is complete, the agency must enact the plan unless Congress
votes its disapproval within 30 days. The agency missed a June
13 deadline to present its plan.  The FAA is working on that plan, it said in a statement
yesterday.  “The FAA constantly monitors staffing levels at facilities
across the country in an effort to maintain a safe and efficient
air transportation system,” the agency said.  Quiet Nights  More than  one-third  of the 294 FAA-staffed towers and local
radar rooms don’t have enough air traffic to justify seven-day,
24-hour operations, the FAA found in an internal survey from
July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011.  Those statistics haven’t deterred lawmakers from pressuring
the FAA not to close air-traffic facilities across the country,
including West Palm Beach,  Florida , and Boise,  Idaho , according
to agency records.  When the FAA last year sought to close the tower at Willow
Run Airport outside  Detroit  from midnight to 6 a.m.,  Michigan ’s
two Democratic Senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, joined
forces with Democratic Representative John Dingell to crush the
proposal.  The staffing issue was exacerbated last year after
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood forbid controllers from
working alone overnight, to prevent them from falling asleep.
Out of 26 towers and one radar room where a second controller
was added, 23 didn’t have sufficient traffic at night to warrant
being open, according to an FAA traffic study last year.  ’It’s Scary’  Senator Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat who has
advocated more air-traffic staffing, said in an interview that
reducing hours in some FAA facilities might be a good idea.  “Look, if the traffic is falling off in those places, then
adjustments have to be made and people get shifted to higher-
volume airports,” Lautenberg said.  Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat who is chairman
of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee,
said he saw no need to reduce hours at air-traffic facilities.  “It’s scary,” Rockefeller said in an interview. “You
start cutting air-traffic controllers, you’re just asking for
accidents.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
