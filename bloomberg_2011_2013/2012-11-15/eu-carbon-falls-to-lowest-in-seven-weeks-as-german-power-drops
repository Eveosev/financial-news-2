to a seven-week low as German power for 2013 dropped to near its

7.42 euros a ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London ,
the lowest since Sept. 26, and were at 7.51 euros at 8:56 a.m.
German power for next year slipped 0.3 percent to 47.30 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
