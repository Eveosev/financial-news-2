New York  Harbor gasoline slumped for
a third day after the waiver of the Jones Act allowed cargoes to
be delivered from the  Gulf Coast  and as tanker shipments from
 Europe  were poised to increase.  The Jones Act regulates shipping between U.S. ports,
requiring requires ships transporting cargo to be U.S. flagged
and built. Under the waiver, which allowed foreign tankers to
load fuel from the Gulf Coast, about 1.75 million barrels of
gasoline and blending components were transported to the U.S.
Northeast, according to a Maritime Administration report. The
waiver expired Nov. 13.  Fourteen gasoline cargoes are booked to deliver supplies to
the U.S. for the two weeks to Nov. 28 and 15 more will probably
be hired, according to shipbrokers and traders who specialize in
transporting the fuel. The shipments will replenish regional
 inventories  that fell to 45.1 million barrels in the week ended
Nov. 9, a four-year low, Energy Department show.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or RBOB,
in the New York Harbor dropped 10 cents to a  15-cent premium 
versus futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:14 p.m.
Prompt delivery slipped 8.28 cents to $2.8462.  U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline  strengthened  as tankers loaded
fuel to the East Coast. The discount for RBOB narrowed 2.25
cents to 12.5 cents a gallon at 3:52 p.m. The  difference  between
prompt-delivery RBOB in the Gulf and any-month delivery in the
East Coast was 15.63 cents today, versus 24.62 cents Nov. 12.  Stockpiles of the fuel in Padd 3 rose 922,000 barrels to 76
million, department data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
