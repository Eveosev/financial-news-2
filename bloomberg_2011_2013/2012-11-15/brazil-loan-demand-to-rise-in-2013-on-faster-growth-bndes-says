Brazil ’s state development bank
expects demand for corporate loans to increase in 2013 as
economic growth accelerates from the slowest in three years.  “We see an important increase in demand in 2013, so
disbursements will move to a larger number,” bank President
 Luciano Coutinho  said today at an event in New York.  The bank is also working to promote investment from the
private sector so a greater portion of corporate funding will
come from non-government sources, he said. BNDES, as the bank is
known, will lend about 150 billion reais ($72.6 billion) this
year, Coutinho said, up from 139.7 billion reais in 2011.  “We see a lot of potential for the Brazilian corporate
 bond market  with longer durations, and we would be open to
supporting this market, but we wish to leverage the market, not
occupy it,” he said.  BNDES expects gross domestic product to rise 4 percent in
2013. The economy will grow 1.5 percent this year, according to
the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
