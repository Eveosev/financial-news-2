Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA (MHPC) , a
Ukrainian poultry producer and agriculture company, expects
better full-year results after chicken prices rose by 20 percent
in the third quarter and demand for poultry continues to
increase.  “Demand for poultry in Ukraine will be increasing,” said
Chief Financial Officer Viktoria Kapelyushnaya in a phone
interview in Kiev today. It is “driven by the fact that poultry
in Ukraine is the cheapest animal protein source.”  Mironovskiy, which started trading in  London  in May 2008,
posted a 40 percent increase in net income in the first nine
months of the year to $281 million, the company said in an e-
mailed report today. Poultry production rose by 4,000 tons to
295,000 tons in the nine-month period after the Vinnytsya
complex started trial production in the third quarter.  MHP shares rose for the second consecutive day and gained
0.79 percent today at 4:21 p.m. in Kiev.  The third quarter became “a foundation for good year-end
results,” Kapelyushnaya said.  Kiev-based MHP exports poultry to between 20 and 25
countries and also relies on sunflower oil exports for its
foreign currency revenues, she said. The company collected 33
percent of its revenue in foreign currency in the first nine
months, according to its report.  “We feel very comfortable, we are increasing foreign
currency earnings,” Kapelyushnaya said. “This absolutely
covers all our needs in servicing debt.”  Average chicken meat prices rose 9 percent in third quarter
to 17.57 hryvnia ($2.13) per kilogram. MHP sold 147,100 tons of
sunflower oil in the period at an average price of $1,100 a ton,
15 percent less than in the same period a year earlier,
according to its report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
