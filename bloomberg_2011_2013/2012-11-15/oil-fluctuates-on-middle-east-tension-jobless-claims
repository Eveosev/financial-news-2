Oil retreated for the third time in
four days as data showed weaker U.S. economic growth and crude
inventories rose to a three-month high.  Prices fell 1 percent as more Americans than forecast
submitted claims for  unemployment insurance  last week and
manufacturing contracted in the New York and Philadelphia
regions. Oil stockpiles increased to 375.9 million barrels last
week as  production  grew to an 18-year high.  “The jobless claims were very high and the economic news
was bearish,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis , which oversees
$1.4 billion. “Demand will remain soft given how the economy is
and production has been very high.”  Crude oil for December delivery slid 87 cents to settle at
$85.45 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
down 14 percent this year. The more active January contract
dropped 88 cents, or 1 percent, to $85.87.  Brent crude  for January settlement declined 47 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $108.01 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The December contract, which expires today, gained
$1.37, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $110.98.  U.S. jobless claims climbed to 439,000 in the week ended
Nov. 10, the most since April 2011, the Labor Department
reported. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the claims
to reach 375,000. Several states said the increase was due to
 Hurricane Sandy , which hit the northeastern part of the U.S. in
late October, according to the department.  ‘Weak Economy’  “Prices are reflecting the bad economic news,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester, Massachusetts. “The weak economy is the biggest
overall factor in the oil market.”  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
 index  was minus 5.2 this month after minus 6.2 in October.
Manufacturing contracted as Sandy knocked out electrical power
and limited activity. The Philadelphia Fed’s general economic
index decreased to minus 10.7.  “I still think economic uncertainty is the primary driver
of the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Crude inventories grew 1.09 million barrels in the week
ended Nov. 9, the Energy Department reported. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg had expected a gain of 2.65 million. U.S. oil
production rose for a 10th week to 6.71 million barrels a day,
the most since May 1994.  Gasoline, Distillates  Gasoline stockpiles slid 440,000 barrels to 201.9 million
and distillate fuels, which include heating oil and diesel,
dropped 2.54 million barrels to 115.5 million. Gasoline  demand 
averaged 8.64 million barrels a day in the four weeks ended Nov.
9, down from 9.16 million on Aug. 31.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest oil consumer, using 18.8
million barrels a day in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy.  Crude also declined with U.S. equities, which fell as  Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  forecast earnings that missed estimates. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent as of 3:09 p.m.  “The strong production and inventory numbers are
bearish,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and
founder of Iitrader.com in Chicago. “Oil followed the
equities.”  Oil rose earlier on concern that escalating Middle East
tension will disrupt supplies. Israel and Palestinian militants
in the  Gaza Strip  exchanged rocket fire and airstrikes a day
after Israel killed Hamas’s military leader. Defense Minister
 Ehud Barak  said Israel may carry out a ground operation in Gaza.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 518,158
contracts as of 3:03 p.m. Volume totaled 700,161 contracts
yesterday, 32 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.54 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
