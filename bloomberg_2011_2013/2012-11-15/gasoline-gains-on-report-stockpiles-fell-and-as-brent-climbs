Gasoline rose as the Energy
Department reported that East Coast stockpiles of the motor fuel
slid last week to a four-year low and U.S. demand increased.  Futures gained as the report showed the continuing impact
of  Hurricane Sandy , whose Oct. 29 landfall in  New Jersey  closed
refineries and pipelines, disrupting the supply of gasoline on
the East Coast. Inventories in the Padd 1 region fell 1.54
million barrels to 45.1 million. U.S.  demand  rose 7.2 percent to
8.91 million barrels a day.  “The numbers were bullish,” said  David Pursell , a
managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston.
“You had a gasoline draw and demand was up even given how
terrible demand must be in the Northeast.”  Gasoline for December delivery rose 1.72 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.6962 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Gulf Coast inventories rose 922,000 barrels to 76 million,
the most since September 2011. Total U.S.  supply  fell 440,000
barrels to 201.9 million.  December-delivery heating oil fell 1.47 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.9735 a gallon on the exchange.  Heating oil slid on concern President  Barack Obama  won’t
reach a budget agreement with a divided Congress and U.S.
economic growth will stall, curtailing industrial and trucking
fuel demand.  Wal-Mart Forecast  Futures fell along with equities as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,
the world’s largest retailer, forecast fourth-quarter profit
that trailed analysts’ estimates. Obama will meet with
Democratic and Republican congressional leaders tomorrow to try
to avert $607 billion in automatic tax increases and spending
cuts scheduled to take effect next year.  “The Wal-Mart news and the goings-on between Congress and
the government are weighing on the market,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “The concern
is they will be unable to make a big grand compromise.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell 0.2 percent at 2:23 p.m. in New York.  Heating oil touched $3.016 earlier as fighting between
Israel and Palestinian militants boosted Brent crude. Rising
Brent prices increase the cost of imported oil used by U.S.
refiners.  “You had geopolitical worries and now it’s the fiscal
cliff again,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at
Energy Aspects Ltd., a research consultant in London.  Distillate supplies , which include heating oil and diesel,
fell 2.54 million barrels to 115.5 million in the seven days
ended Nov. 9, the lowest level since June 2008.  “It is quite supportive and we’re still a month away from
winter,” said Lipow.  The average nationwide cost for  regular gasoline  slipped
0.5 cent to $3.438 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.  The
pump price reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
