Canadian  stocks  fell for a fourth
day after a report showed world gold demand dropped the most
since 2009 and U.S. jobless data disappointed investors.  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , which had its  credit rating  cut by
 Standard & Poor’s  yesterday, fell 6.3 percent after postponing
its $1 billion debt offering.  Poseidon Concepts Corp. (PSN) , a seller
of tanks to the oil and gas industry, plunged 62 percent after
it posted worse-than-estimated earnings.  Alacer Gold Corp. (ASR)  and
Nevsun Resources Ltd. fell at least 5.4 percent as gold slipped
to a one-week low.  Birchcliff Energy (BIR)  Ltd. rose 7.7 percent after
reporting record production in the third quarter.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 118.41
points, or 1 percent, to 11,811.38 in Toronto. The benchmark
Canadian equity gauge is down 1.2 percent this year. Trading
volume was 50 percent higher than the 30-day average.  “Gold and precious metals shares are down due to demand
slowing and also a drop in risk appetite,” said  Bob Decker , a
 money manager  at Aurion Capital in Toronto. His firm oversees
about C$5.5 billion ($5.5 billion). “The unlikely scenario of a
quick fix for the fiscal cliff is dawning on investors. The
complacency that prevailed before the election has now
evaporated, so it’s an abrupt change in sentiment we have
here.”  Gold demand dropped 11 percent in the third quarter, the
most since 2009, from a record a year earlier as slowing growth
in China cut investment and jewelry purchases, the World Gold
Council said in a report. Global demand slipped to 1,084.6
metric tons in the quarter compared with 1,223.5 tons a year
earlier.  Gold Mining  Gold mining companies contributed most to losses in the
S&P/TSX as eight of 10 industries retreated. The metal for
December delivery fell 0.9 percent to settle at $1,713.80 an
ounce in  New York , the biggest percentage loss since Nov. 2.  U.S. initial jobless claims surged by 78,000 to 439,000
last week, the most since April 2011, as superstorm Sandy
wreaked havoc on the job market.  The U.S., Canada’s largest trading partner, faces a so-
called fiscal cliff of $607 billion in automatic tax increases
and spending cuts in 2013 if policy makers do not come to a
compromise before then. The  Congressional Budget Office 
estimates the  U.S. economy  will go into recession in the first
half of the year if a solution is not found.  Poseidon Concepts tumbled 62 percent to C$5 after at least
six firms lowered their recommendations on the stock. The
company reported adjusted earnings of 10 Canadian cents a share,
compared with the average analyst forecast of 48 cents,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Poseidon Tumbles  Michael Mazar, analyst with BMO Capital Markets, cut the
stock to underperform from outperform and said the company may
cut its dividend. Poseidon has reduced its spending forecast and
added only 40 tanks in the quarter, well behind the estimated 60
to 84, he wrote in a note to clients.  “The lowered capex and slow ramp up in tank additions are
particularly troubling,” he said. “A reduction in the dividend
is likely over the next several quarters.”  Alacer Gold decreased 5.4 percent to C$4.75 and Nevsun
Resources lost 6.7 percent to C$4.05. Fortuna Silver Mines Inc.
fell 7.4 percent to C$4.54 as the S&P/TSX Materials index  fell 
2.2 percent.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , the Calgary-based oil and gas producer that
China’s Cnooc Ltd. has offered to acquire, rose 2.9 percent to
C$25.26. Paulson & Co., the hedge fund run by billionaire  John Paulson , bought a $153 million stake in Nexen during the third
quarter, according to U.S. filings.  Birchcliff Energy jumped 7.7 percent to C$7.94 after
reporting record current production of 27,500 barrels of oil
equivalent a day, compared with a forecast of 26,000.  Bombardier fell 6.3 percent to C$2.99 after delaying a bond
offering due to market conditions, according to Isabelle Rondeau, a spokeswoman with the company. In an interview with
Bloomberg, Rondeau declined to say when the commercial aircraft
maker planned to issue the debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
