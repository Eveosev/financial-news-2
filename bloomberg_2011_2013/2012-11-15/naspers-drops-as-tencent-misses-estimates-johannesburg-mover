Naspers Ltd. (NPN) , Africa’s biggest media
group, retreated the most in more than a week after Chinese
associate  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  missed analysts’ profit
estimates and said a slowing economy is affecting advertising.  Naspers fell 1.7 percent to 544.98 rand by the close in
Johannesburg, paring an earlier 3.7 percent decline. Shares in
Tencent, of which Naspers owns 34 percent, slumped 7 percent in
 Hong Kong , the most in more than a year.  Net income climbed to 3.22 billion  yuan  ($517 million) in
the third quarter from 2.45 billion yuan a year earlier, Tencent
said in a statement yesterday. That fell short of the 3.33
billion-yuan average of eight analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  China ’s decelerating economy “may slow revenue
growth rates for the online advertising industry as a whole,”
the games and social networks operator said.  Trading at 28 times estimated earnings, Tencent “is priced
for high growth,” Simon Fillmore, an analyst at Independent
Securities (Pty) Ltd., said by phone.  “When the growth isn’t quite what people expected, you’ll
see the stock comes off sharply,” Fillmore said. “It’s a
quarterly number so you can’t read too much into it. It’s a
great business.”  Naspers earns 42 percent of sales from its pay television
business and 20 percent from its investment in Tencent. Its
stake in Tencent is valued at $20 billion, 81 percent of its
market value of 221 billion rand ($24.8 billion) based on
today’s share prices.  Naspers’ 30-day historical volatility, a measure of stock
swings, increased to 19.23 from 18.64 yesterday. The FTSE/JSE
 Africa  All Share Index’s 30-day volatility measure was at 9.04
versus 9.17 previously. A higher reading means an asset’s price
can have bigger moves. About 1.6 million shares traded, almost
1.5 times the daily average over the past three months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
