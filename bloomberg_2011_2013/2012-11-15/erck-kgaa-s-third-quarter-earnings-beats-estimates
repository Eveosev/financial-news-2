Merck KGaA (MRK) , the German maker of the
cancer drug Erbitux, reported third-quarter profit that exceeded
analyst estimates and increased the full-year sales forecast on
higher demand for its medicines.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization excluding one-time items climbed 16 percent to
754.2 million euros ($960.8 million) from 652.5 million euros a
year earlier, the Darmstadt-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts had predicted 739.9 million euros, the
average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Merck, which isn’t related to U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co.,
is eliminating  jobs , closing facilities and reviewing its
pipeline amid setbacks for some key medicines and declining
sales of Erbitux. The company has a target to save 300 million
euros by 2014 as it expands outside  Europe , particularly in the
U.S.,  Japan  and  China .  “Even in these tough economic times and while in the midst
of our own business transformation, Merck is performing well
operationally,” Chief Executive Officer Karl-Ludwig Kley said
in a statement.  Ebitda excluding one-time items this year will be 2.9
billion euros to 2.95 billion euros, compared with an Aug. 14
forecast of 2.85 billion euros to 2.95 billion euros. The
company now expects sales of about 10.9 billion euros to 11
billion euros, compared with 10.7 billion euros previously.  Merck rose 1.3 percent to close at 99.30 euros at 5:30 p.m.
in Frankfurt, valuing the company at 21.6 billion euros.  Merck Serono  Net income fell 17 percent to 185.5 million euros, hurt by
98 million euros in one-time costs, mostly related to the
company’s restructuring.  Total revenue for the quarter rose 12 percent to 2.84
billion euros, beating the 2.71 billion-euro average estimate of
13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Core earnings, which exclude
costs such as writedowns and merger expenses, totaled 1.98 euros
a share, beating the 1.91-euro average estimate.  Revenue at Merck Serono, which represents 56 percent of
total sales, rose 10 percent to 1.62 billion euros. Sales of
multiple sclerosis therapy Rebif advanced 10 percent, excluding
effects such as currency shifts, to 499 million euros. Revenue
from Erbitux was little changed at 224 million euros.  Consumer health sales declined 7.7 percent to 122 million
euros because of lower demand in Europe, the division’s biggest
market. The company is reorganizing the unit and may close some
sites, according to the statement.  ‘Positive Surprise’  Sales at the Merck Millipore equipment, ingredient and
services division increased 9.5 percent to 643 million euros.  The performance-materials unit, the world’s biggest maker
of liquid crystals for flat-screen televisions and electronics,
reported a sales increase of 31 percent to 446 million euros,
benefiting from the stronger U.S. dollar.  The strong performance in liquid crystals is “unlikely to
be sustainable in the future” with the company expecting a
slowdown in the fourth quarter,  Martin Voegtli , an analyst at
Kepler Capital Markets, said in a note to investors today. The
increase in Rebif sales was a “positive surprise” because of
U.S. price increases and a stronger U.S. dollar while Erbitux
sales were a disappointment, he said.  “While we expect a positive market reaction to share
price, structural issues remain and will weigh on the
performance going forward,” he said.  Merck is closing the Geneva headquarters of its Merck
Serono drug unit and transferring 750 employees elsewhere after
halting work on its cladribine treatment and struggling with
regulatory and clinical-trial obstacles to broadening approved
uses for Erbitux. The company will also eliminate 1,100
positions in  Germany  by the end of 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
