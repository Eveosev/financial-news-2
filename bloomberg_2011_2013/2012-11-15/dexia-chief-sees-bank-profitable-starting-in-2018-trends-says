Dexia SA (DEXB)  will return to a profit
starting in 2018,  Trends  magazine reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Karel De Boeck.  Losses this year and next will be expressed in billions of
euros and thereafter in several hundreds of millions, Trends
cited De Boeck as saying.  Next year and 2014 “will also be difficult years” as the
sale of the DexMA and Dexia Asset Management activities weigh on
profitability and because the bank will need to refinance
expiring loans, De Boeck said.  Dexia will need to draw more on its state guarantees in the
coming two years, although the 85 billion-euro ($108 billion)
ceiling will suffice, De Boeck said. He estimates that the
situation “can stabilize” starting from 2015, according to the
business magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
