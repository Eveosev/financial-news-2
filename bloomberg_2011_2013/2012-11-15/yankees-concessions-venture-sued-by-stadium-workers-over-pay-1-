Legends Hospitality LLC, the
concessions, merchandising and management-services company
formed by the  New York Yankees ,  Dallas Cowboys  and  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) , was sued by a group of Yankee Stadium employees over
pay they claim they’re owed.  Three Yankee Stadium banquet servers sued Legends and New
York Yankees Partnership, which owns the baseball team, in
federal court in  Manhattan  today, claiming they were paid below
the minimum wage and are owed overtime pay and tips.  “The hourly rate defendants pay banquet servers is below
the full minimum wage rate,” the three employees said in their
complaint. “Defendants also fail to pay banquet servers the
appropriate overtime rates for hours worked in excess of 40 per
week, and deny banquet workers who work over 10 hours per day
spread-of-hours pay.”  The servers also claim Legends and the Yankees withheld
part of the mandatory service charge paid by customers hosting
private events at Yankee Stadium rather than giving it to them.  The employees, who seek to represent a class of at least 40
past and current Yankee Stadium banquet servers, are asking for
unpaid wages and other unspecified damages.  Messages left with Legends and the Yankees seeking comment
on the suit weren’t immediately returned.  The case is Pollock v. Legends Hospitality LLC, 12-CV-8334,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
