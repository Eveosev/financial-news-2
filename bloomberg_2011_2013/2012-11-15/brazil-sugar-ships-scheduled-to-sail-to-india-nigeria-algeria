About 31 percent of all the sugar
waiting to be loaded onto ships in  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer, is headed to  India , Nigeria and  Algeria , according to
shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Vessels scheduled to go to Nigeria will take 142,900 metric
tons of sugar and another 103,728 tons are headed to Algeria,
data from the Recife, Brazil-based agency known as Williams
Brasil, e-mailed yesterday showed. Ships carrying 152,303 tons
were scheduled to sail from Brazil’s main ports to India, the
world’s second-biggest producer and largest consumer.  Nigeria will import 1.45 million tons of sugar in 2012-13,
unchanged from a year earlier, according to the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture . Shipments into Algeria will total 2.15 million
tons, up from 1.8 million tons in 2011-12, the data showed. Both
countries have sugar refiners. India is among the countries that
are importing more sweetener than initially forecast, according
to Lausanne, Switzerland-based researcher Kingsman SA.  Global sugar shipments to the south Asian nation will total
400,000 tons in the fourth quarter,  Jonathan Kingsman , founder
of the researcher, said on Oct. 25. That’s 80 percent of the
imports forecast by the Foreign Agricultural Service unit of the
USDA for the whole of the 2012-13 season that started this
month. India’s sugar output will drop to 24 million tons in
2012-13 because of dry weather, according to the Indian Sugar
Mills Association. That compares with an estimate of 26.2
million tons in the past season.  The amount of sugar waiting to be loaded at Brazil’s main
ports dropped 11 percent in the past week, Williams Brasil data
showed. About 1.27 million tons of the sweetener awaited loading
at the ports of Recife, Maceio, Suape, Vitoria, Paranagua and
Santos, the country’s biggest, according to the data. That
compares with 1.4 million tons a week earlier.  Raw sugar for March delivery slid 0.5 percent to 19.14
cents a pound by 5:28 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
