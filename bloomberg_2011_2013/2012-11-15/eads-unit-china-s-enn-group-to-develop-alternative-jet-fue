ENN Group , a Chinese natural gas
supplier, will develop alternative fuels with a unit of European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. for the aviation industry.  The partnership between ENN and  EADS (EAD)  Innovation Works will
include technical qualification of aviation fuel made from algae
oil and the promotion of their use in  China , ENN said today in a
statement on its website.  ENN has a 5,000 metric-ton microalgae biodiesel
demonstration project in Inner Mongolia, according to the
statement. EADS is the parent of planemaker Airbus SAS.  A test flight with the biofuel is scheduled for next year
in China, once a Sino-U.S feasibility study is concluded, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
