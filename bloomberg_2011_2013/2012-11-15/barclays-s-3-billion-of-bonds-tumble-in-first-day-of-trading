Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s $3 billion of notes
that can be written off in a crisis tumbled in their first day
of trading, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The 7.625 percent subordinated 10-year notes sold yesterday
by the U.K.’s second-largest lender dropped 1.75 cents to 98.75
cents on the dollar to yield 7.81 percent as of 2:21 p.m. in New
York, Trace data show. Bonds of Barclays are the most actively
traded dollar-denominated corporate securities today, with 221
trades of $1 million or more.  Investors in the contingent capital notes will lose all
their money if Barclays incurs losses that reduce its so-
called core Tier 1 equity to 7 percent or lower, said two people
with knowledge of the sale who asked not to be identified
because they’re not authorized to speak about the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
