Turkey ’s  current-account deficit 
narrowed for an 11th straight month in September as a slowing
economy and tighter monetary policy curbed imports while gold
sales pushed exports up.  The deficit shrank to $2.7 billion from $6.4 billion a year
earlier, the central bank in Ankara said on its website today.
It was forecast at $3 billion, according to the  median estimate 
of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The 12-month gap fell to
$55.8 billion from $77 billion at the end of 2011.  Turkey’s central bank has sought to reduce the current-
account deficit from a record 10 percent of gross domestic
product last year by  tightening monetary policy  and bank lending
rules to curb a spending boom that pulled in imports. At the
same time, the country has worked to diversify its exports away
from crisis stricken Europe to Asia, the  Middle East  and  Africa .  The deficit has declined to 7 percent of GDP and “we
expect to see further improvement” next month due to “the
overall slowdown in economic activity, increasing gold exports
and relatively lower petroleum price,” said  Ozgur Altug , chief
economist at BGC Partners in Istanbul. The decline may slow or
end in November, he said in an e-mailed note.  Turkey’s economic growth slowed to 2.9 percent in the
second quarter, the lowest since 2009, leading central bank
Governor Erdem Basci to reverse course and begin loosening
monetary policy.  The lira rose 0.3 percent to 1.8015 at 12:25 p.m. in
Istanbul and the benchmark  ISE National 100 (XU100)  stock index gained
0.2 percent. Yields on  2-year lira bonds  declined 2 basis points
to 6.4 percent.  Fitch Ratings  cited the narrowing of the current-account
deficit when it raised Turkey to investment grade earlier this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
