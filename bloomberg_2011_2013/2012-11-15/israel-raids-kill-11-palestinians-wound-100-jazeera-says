Israeli air strikes on the  Gaza
Strip  killed 11 Palestinians and injured 100 others in the last
24 hours,  Al Jazeera  reported.  Israel conducted more than 70 air strikes on the Gaza Strip
since yesterday’s raid that killed Ahmed al-Jabari, the leader
of Hamas’ military wing, the Dubai-based network reported. The
Palestinians killed include three militants from Hamas’s
military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, who were struck
today in a strike on a motorcycle in Gaza, Agence France-Presse
reported.  Israel unleashed air and sea attacks on targets in Gaza in
response to Hamas rockets fired against Israeli civilians, has
also pledged to use ground troops for the first time since 2009.
The attacks prompted Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi to recall
of the country’s ambassador to Israel.  The UN Security Council held a closed meeting overnight on
the air strikes in New York and representatives from Israel and
the  Palestinian Authority  will speak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
