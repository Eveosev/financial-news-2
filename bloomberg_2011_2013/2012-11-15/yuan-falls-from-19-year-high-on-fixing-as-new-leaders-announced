The  yuan  fell, retreating from a 19-
year high, after the central bank cut its reference rate to a
level that required the currency to weaken to remain within
permitted trading limits.  The People’s Bank of  China  lowered its daily fixing by 0.04
percent to 6.2905 per dollar, 1.04 percent less than yesterday’s
closing level of 6.2252. The yuan, which is allowed to diverge
from the set rate by a maximum 1 percent, fell 0.13 percent, the
most since July 23, to 6.2334 in  Shanghai , according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  Xi Jinping, 59, replaced Hu Jintao as head of the Communist
Party and the nation’s military, the official Xinhua News Agency
announced today. He’s joined on the elite Politburo Standing
Committee by Li Keqiang, 57, who is expected to replace Premier
Wen Jiabao at a March meeting. Central bank Governor  Zhou
Xiaochuan  dropped off the Party’s central committee yesterday,
suggesting he could leave his role.  “With Zhou retiring, some might think there’ll be a change
in currency policy,” said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global
markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Hong Kong.
“I don’t think so. Demand for the yuan is rising, aided by
inflows on the back of the forecast economic recovery in 2013.”  The composition of China’s new leadership may determine the
pace of change on issues such as deregulating interest rates and
breaking up state monopolies. The make-up of the standing
committee will provide more evidence on policy direction as the
world’s second-biggest economy shows signs of rebounding from a
seven-quarter slowdown.  As well as Governor Zhou, Commerce Minister Chen Deming and
Finance Minister  Xie Xuren  were absent from the central
committee, suggesting they will probably exit those jobs.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards for the yuan fell
0.21 percent, the most since Aug. 15, to 6.3340 per dollar in
Hong Kong, a 1.6 percent discount to the spot rate in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the yuan weakened 0.25 percent to 6.2285.  To contact the reporters on this story:
