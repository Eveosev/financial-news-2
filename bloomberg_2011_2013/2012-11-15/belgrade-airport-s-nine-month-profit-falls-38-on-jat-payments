Aerodrom Nikola Tesla AD (AERO) , Serbia’s
main airport, said nine-month profit dropped 38 percent as JAT
Airways, its biggest client, delayed payments for its services.  Net income fell to 1.08 billion dinars ($12.3 million) from
1.74 billion dinars a year earlier, the state-controlled company
said in a regulatory filing today. Sales increased 4.3 percent
to 4.53 billion dinars as the number of passengers rose 8.3
percent to 2.64 million in the period. The number of flights was
little changed at almost 35,000, it said.  JAT, the unprofitable carrier the Serbian government is
seeking to sell to private investors, owed 3.1 billion dinars to
the airport at the end of September, the operator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
