The Green Climate Fund, being set up
to distribute emissions-cutting and adaptation money to
developing countries from richer nations, will tomorrow appoint
Ajay Mathur as director.  Mathur will start in a “bridging” role at least until a
permanent  executive director  is appointed around the middle of
next year, Richard Kinley, deputy executive secretary of the
United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change  in Bonn,
said today by phone. Mathur was previously director general of
the Indian Bureau of Energy Efficiency in New Delhi, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
