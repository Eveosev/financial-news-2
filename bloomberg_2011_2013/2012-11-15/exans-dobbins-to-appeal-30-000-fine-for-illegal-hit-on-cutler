Houston Texans linebacker Tim Dobbins said he was shocked by the $30,000 fine he received from
the National Football League for an illegal hit that left
Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler with a concussion.  Dobbins, a seven-year NFL veteran in his second season with
the Texans, said he’ll appeal the fine.  “There were a lot of zeroes on that paper,” Dobbins told
reporters. “My assessment is that it’s way too high and I felt
like I didn’t do anything wrong. I’m not a dirty player and I
really can’t do nothing but appeal it at this point.”  Cutler was knocked out of the Bears’ 13-6 loss to the
Texans on Nov. 11 when Dobbins struck him in the chin with his
helmet while making a first-half tackle. Cutler was scrambling
out of the pocket on the play and the helmet-to-helmet hit came
as he threw a pass before crossing the line of scrimmage.  “I’m definitely disappointed,” Dobbins said. “I didn’t
know if he was going to run the ball or he was going to pass the
ball. I felt like he was past the line and I just went and tried
to get a clean hit on him. It didn’t work out, I guess.”  Dobbins said that, while he saw some helmet-to-helmet
contact in watching replays, he believed it was a clean hit.  Cutler’s status for this week’s game against the San
Francisco 49ers hasn’t been determined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
