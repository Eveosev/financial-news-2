Serbia’s banking industry has
adjusted to the withdrawal of funds from lenders based outside
the country, the Balkan nation’s central bank said.  Serbian banks with parents based overseas made up 74
percent of the Balkan nation’s banking industry by assets, said
the bank. Parent banks withdrew 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion)
from their Serbian units over the past four years while local
saving deposits rose by 3 billion euros, Belgrade-based Narodna
Banka Srbije said today in an e-mailed statement.  “The gradual process did not bring into question the
stability of the domestic financial sector,” the central bank
said, without naming the banks. A report published by
international lenders gathered in Brussels this month noted a
retreat of Western banks from emerging  Europe .  “The dominant source of financing of the banking industry
is the domestic deposits,” the central bank said. “Serbia is
among rare countries in the region that during the crisis had a
slowdown, but not a decline, in credit activity.”  At the end of September, combined capital of banks exceeded
5 billion euros compared with between 4.1 billion euros and 4.7
billion euros from 2008 to 2010, the bank said.  “The decreased exposure of the European banking groups has
been accompanied by a positive change in the behavior” of the
local units that now rely less on borrowing from their owners
and more on international lenders, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
