India ’s bonds advanced the most in
two weeks on optimism the central bank has more room to ease
monetary policy after the inflation rate dropped to an eight-
month low.  The wholesale-price  index  rose 7.45 percent last month from
a year earlier after climbing 7.81 percent in September, the
Commerce Ministry said yesterday. That’s the slowest pace since
February and compares with the 7.9 percent median estimate of 28
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The  Reserve Bank  of India
has kept the  repurchase rate  unchanged at 8 percent in the last
four policy meetings.  “Slowing inflation has created more room for the RBI to
cut rates,” said R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer of
fixed-income and currencies at  State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur. (SBBJ) 
“We can expect some easing in the start of the new year.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent government bonds
due June 2022 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
points, to 8.19 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That’s the biggest decline since Nov. 1.  At the RBI’s last policy review on Oct. 30, Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao said he sees a “reasonable likelihood” of
monetary easing in the first quarter of 2013.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell five basis
points to 7.72 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
