The  International Monetary Fund  said
talks over Greece’s debt-reduction plans aren’t deadlocked, even
as the fund disagrees with its European partners over the
timetable.  IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  is cutting short a
trip to Southeast Asia to attend a meeting of euro-area finance
ministers on Greece on Nov. 20.  Finance officials from the 17 euro countries are seeking
agreement on how to cut Greece’s debt to sustainable levels, a
necessary step to disburse the next tranche under a bailout they
co-fund with the IMF. A disagreement on the speed of reaching
the debt-reduction targets broke out this week.  “We want a real fix, not a short-term fix,” IMF spokesman
 William Murray  told reporters in Washington today.  “Critical to us is Greece’s debt sustainability,” Murray
said. “That means that by 2020 we want to see Greece’s debt at
120 percent of its gross domestic product.”  The European finance ministers decided this week to
postpone that goal by two years to 2022.  The IMF has previously extended the maturity and lowered
the  interest rate  on Greek debt, Murray said. “That is what we
can do in the context of our framework,” he said.  In March, the IMF  approved  a four-year extended fund
facility for Greece, which carries a lower interest rate than a
three-year stand-by arrangement that the country had previously.  Separately, Murray said that potential global spillover
effects from the U.S. going over the so-called fiscal cliff of
$607 billion in tax increases and spending cuts could be “very
significant.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
