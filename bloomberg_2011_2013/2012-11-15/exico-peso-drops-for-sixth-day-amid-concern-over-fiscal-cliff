Mexico’s peso fell for a sixth day
amid mounting concern that politicians in  Washington  won’t be
able to reach a budget agreement, damping growth in the Latin
American country’s biggest trading partner.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 13.2773 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City. The depreciation reduced gains this year to
5 percent.  Investors are waiting to see if Congress will act to avoid
$607 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases
scheduled to take effect starting in January. While President
 Barack Obama  has signaled willingness to compromise, neither he
nor top congressional Republicans have publicly offered any
concessions.  “Markets continue with uncertainty,”  Mario Copca , a
currency strategist at Metanalisis SA, said by phone from Mexico
City. “Obama wasn’t able to stop it.”  The U.S. president said today it would be “very
difficult” to cut the deficit by curbing breaks in the tax code
without raising rates. Some Republicans have called instead for
closing tax loopholes and lowering rates. Failure to reach an
agreement to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff risks pushing the
U.S., the destination for about 80 percent of Mexican exports,
back into a recession.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2022 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.38 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.19 centavo to
108.34 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
