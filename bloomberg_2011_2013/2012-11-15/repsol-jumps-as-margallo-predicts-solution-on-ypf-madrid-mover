Repsol SA (REP)  jumped after Spanish
Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo predicted his
government will reach a deal with  Argentina  over  YPF SA (YPF) , the oil
producer’s Argentine unit which was expropriated in April.  Repsol shares rose as much as 4.3 percent to 15.88 euros in
Madrid, the most since Oct. 16. The stock traded 15.65 euros at
11:05 a.m. local time.  Spanish officials are holding daily talks with their
Argentine counterparts in the search for an agreement over YPF,
which President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner nationalized in
April. Repsol, which values its YPF stake at $10.5 billion, is
pursuing a claim against Argentina through the World Bank’s
investment dispute arbitrator.  “I hope that we have a solution relatively soon,” Garcia-
Margallo said in a television interview with Spain’s state
broadcaster RTVE. The talks are “on the right track.”  Under the  World Bank  process Repsol initiated in May,
Argentina has six months to negotiate a settlement. Spain last
month dropped trade sanctions against Argentina imposed in the
wake of the YPF seizure, El Pais reported on Oct. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
