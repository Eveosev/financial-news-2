Wheat gained, halting a four-day
slide, on signs supplies from the  Black Sea region  are drying
up, potentially boosting demand for U.S. grains.  Ukraine may decide to limit wheat exports temporarily at
the end of November, Unian  news agency  reported, citing
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk. Grain exports from
 Russia  are slowing, the country’s Grain Union said yesterday.  “The sentiment in the world market remains bullish, buoyed
by poor export supply prospects from the Black Sea region and
deteriorating prospects for Southern Hemisphere origins --
Australia and Argentina,”  Abah Ofon , an analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc, said in a report today.  Wheat for delivery in March climbed 0.5 percent to $8.685 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 3:15 p.m. Paris time,
after sliding for four days. Milling wheat for January delivery
traded in the French capital was little changed at 270 euros
($344) a metric ton.  Wheat shipments from Russia, last year’s third-largest
exporter after the U.S. and Australia, are slowing as high
domestic prices made exports unprofitable, said Arkady Zlochevsky, president of Russia’s Grain Union.  “The cereal balance sheets continue to be tight for the
main exporting countries,” Paris-based farm adviser Agritel
wrote in a comment today.  Corn for March delivery was little changed at $7.2875 a
bushel in  Chicago , while soybeans for January delivery fell 0.4
percent to $14.1375 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
