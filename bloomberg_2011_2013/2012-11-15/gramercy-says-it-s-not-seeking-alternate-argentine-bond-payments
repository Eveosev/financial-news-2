Gramercy Advisors LLC is not in
talks with the Argentine government to collect interest payments
on restructured debt outside the U.S. and avoid seizures from
holders of defaulted bonds, the hedge fund said.  Argentine newspapers La Nacion and Ambito Financiero each
reported, without saying where they got the information, that
 Argentina  may make payments overseas after a U.S. appeals court
ruled Oct. 26 that the country can’t discriminate against
holders of defaulted bonds in favor of those who own securities
it restructured following a record sovereign default in 2001.  “Gramercy categorically and forcefully denies having had
any discussions with the Republic of Argentina regarding
alternative payment methods,” the press office of the
Connecticut-based hedge fund wrote in an e-mailed response to
questions. “We can confirm that we have hired  David Boies  as
our legal counsel to represent us and other bondholders in this
case.”  Norma Madeo, an Argentine Economy Ministry spokeswoman,
declined to comment.  U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, who will decide how much
Argentina should pay the so-called holdouts when it makes
distributions due on the nation’s securities next month, will
receive filings from Argentina and the group of bondholders
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
