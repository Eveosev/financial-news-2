Asseco Poland SA (ACP) , central  Europe ’s
largest software maker, climbed to a one-month high in Warsaw
after reporting profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The shares gained 4.6 percent to 42.90 zloty at the close
in Warsaw, the highest since Oct. 9. Today’s volume was
equivalent to 372 percent of the three-month daily average. The
stock has slumped 12 percent this year, compared with an 11
percent gain on the benchmark WIG20 Index.  Third-quarter net income was 89.2 million zloty ($27
million), exceeding the 73.7 million-zloty mean estimate of five
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The Rzeszow, Poland-based
company had 5.3 billion zloty of orders as of Nov. 7, which was
14 percent more than a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer
Adam Goral said at a news conference in Warsaw today.  “Asseco has outpaced expectations,” Piotr Janik, a
Warsaw-based analyst at KBC Securities, said in a note today.
The stock’s decline this year “relates more to the recent lack
of success in the battle for large public contracts.”  The company, which this year failed to acquire domestic
competitor  Sygnity SA (SGN) , keeps searching for takeover targets
“especially smaller ones as these deals don’t require antitrust
approvals,” Goral said.  Asseco also plans to expand in  Russia , according to Goral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
