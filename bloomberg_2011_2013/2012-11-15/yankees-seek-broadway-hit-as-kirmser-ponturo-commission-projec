The  New York  Yankees are planning to
play Broadway.  A theater project about Major League Baseball’s 27-time
World Series champions has been commissioned by Broadway
producers Fran Kirmser and Tony Ponturo, who in recent years
produced the sports-inspired plays “Lombardi” and
“Magic/Bird.”  The still-untitled project about the Yankees, which will be
produced in collaboration with the team and MLB, “will shine a
spotlight on the personalities, triumphs and private moments
that have become the true accounts of legends,” Kirmser Ponturo
Group LLC said in an e-mailed statement. It’s projected to debut
in late 2013 or early 2014, according to an e-mail from the
organization.  “It is a thrill that two iconic American institutions, the
Yankees and the Broadway theater, are joining together,” Lonn Trost, the Yankees’ chief operating officer, said in a
statement. “Just as generations of fans have been captivated in
their seats at Yankee Stadium, theatergoers will be able to
experience the same drama and joy. We look forward to opening
our archives to the process and sharing our stories.”  “Lombardi,” developed in 2009, told the story of Vince Lombardi, the National Football League Hall of Fame coach. It
was the longest-running play of the 2011-12 Broadway season and
has been licensed to regional theaters nationwide, according to
the release.  “Magic/Bird,” inspired by the rivalry and later
friendship of National Basketball Association players Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, had a one-month run that ended in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
