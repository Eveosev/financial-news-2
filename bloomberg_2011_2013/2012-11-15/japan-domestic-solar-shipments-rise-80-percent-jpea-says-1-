Japan ’s domestic shipments of solar
cells and modules rose 80 percent in the July-September quarter
after the government started an incentive program for clean
energy in the first month of the period.  Domestic shipments increased to 627 megawatts from 348
megawatts in the same quarter last year, the Japan Photovoltaic
Energy Association said in a  statement  today.  Imports tripled to 203 megawatts while exports fell 57
percent to 153 megawatts, according to the association. The
figures show cells and modules produced outside Japan accounted
for 32 percent of all domestic shipments in the quarter.  Japan introduced so-called feed-in tariffs in July to spur
investment in renewable energy as the country diversifies its
energy sources after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The program requires utilities to buy clean energy at
above-market rates. The rate for solar power is 42 yen (52
cents) per kilowatt-hour for 20 years. That’s about three times
the rate of 14.59 yen per kilowatt-hour that industrial users
paid for electricity in the 12 months ended in March.  Even before the incentive program, solar imports were
increasing in Japan.  In fiscal 2008, imported solar products accounted for 0.1
percent of all domestic shipments before jumping to 11.3 percent
the following year. In fiscal 2010 and 2011, imports were 15.8
percent and 21.5 percent of shipments respectively. Japan’s
fiscal year starts in April.  The shipment data was compiled from information supplied by
34 companies including  Sharp Corp. (6753)  and Suntech Power Japan Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
