Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper company
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, said nine-month profit rose
13 percent due to increased production of the metal used in
cables and pipes.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization advanced to $2.83 billion from $2.51 billion a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
Sales gained 16 percent to $4.85 billion.  Antofagasta, which raised its copper output by 14 percent
in the first nine months of 2012 to 515,800 metric tons, is
seeking to increase annual production to about 700,000 tons this
year from 640,500 tons amid rising demand.  The company sold its copper at 374.1 cents per pound in the
period compared with 378 cents a year earlier, according to the
statement. The average cash cost of production in the first nine
months of the year increased to 146.4 cents per pound from 142.5
cents a year earlier, Antofagasta said.  Antofagasta declined 1.6 percent to 1,223 pence at 12:03
p.m. in London trading, vauing the company at 12.06 billion
pounds ($19.1 billion.)  The average price of molybdenum, used to harden steel, fell
to $13.3 a pound in the first nine months from $16.2 a year
earlier.  The company had cash of $3.51 billion as of Sept. 30
compared with $3.04 billion at the end of last year, according
to the statement. Antofagasta’s debt declined to $1.31 billion
from $1.46 billion at the end of December, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
