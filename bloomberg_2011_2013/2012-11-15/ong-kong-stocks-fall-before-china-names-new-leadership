Hong Kong  stocks  fell amid concern
that an impasse about cuts to the U.S. budget will crimp global
growth and as China announced new leaders.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) 
surged after the clothier’s former chairman more than doubled
his stake.  The Hang Seng Index fell 1 percent to 21,237.14 as of the
mid-day trading break in Hong Kong. Xi Jinping replaced  Hu
Jintao  as head of the Chinese Communist Party, ushering in the
fifth generation of leaders set to run the world’s second-
biggest economy over the next decade. He was also named chairman
of the party’s Central Military Commission.  All but nine stocks dropped on the 49-member gauge, which
retreated 2.3 percent through yesterday since U.S. President
Barack Obama was re-elected on Nov. 7. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong
declined 1.2 percent to 10,278.16.  Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., slid 2.5 percent.  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s
biggest Internet company, dropped 4.9 percent after its third-
quarter profit missed estimates. Esprit jumped 20 percent.  The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  advanced 18 percent from this
year’s low on June 4 through yesterday as economic data showed
China’s slowdown may be bottoming and central banks around the
globe added stimulus to spur growth. The index  traded  at 10.8
times estimated earnings compared with 13 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
