Virender Sehwag smashed 79 not out
as India reached 120 without loss at lunch on day one of the
series-opening cricket Test against England in Ahmedabad.  The right-hander struck 12 fours and a six in his unbeaten
66-ball innings and fellow opener Gautam Gambhir added 37 not
out as India racked up 4.29 runs an over after winning the toss.
Fast bowlers  James Anderson  and  Tim Bresnan  each allowed 6 runs
per over.  England handed a debut to opening batsman Nick Compton,
while Samit Patel will bat at No. 6 and bowl left-arm spin as
Bresnan was chosen as the third seamer.  Yuvraj Singh  returns
to India’s Test lineup for the first time in a year after
recovering from a rare germ cell cancer.  The match is the first of four between the teams. England,
which swept the best-of-four contest when the teams met last
year in the U.K., hasn’t won a Test series in India since
1984-85.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
