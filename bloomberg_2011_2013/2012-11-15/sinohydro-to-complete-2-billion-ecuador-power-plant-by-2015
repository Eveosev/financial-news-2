China â€™s Sinohydro Corp. will
complete a $2 billion, 1,500-megawatt hydroelectric plant in
Ecuador by mid-2015, a company official said.  Sinohydro will meet its 66-month construction timetable for
the Coca-Codo Sinclair plant in the Amazon jungle, Commercial
Manager Lin Shaoquan said today at an event in Lima. The company
has drilled 13 meters of a 25-meter tunnel and began pouring
concrete for an intake system last month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
