Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo ,  Brazil â€™s largest water utility, reported a 361.8
million-real ($175 million) profit, in the third quarter, a
fivefold increase from a year earlier.  The higher net income resulted from revenue increasing 120
million reais, or 4.6 percent, on increased water supply and
sewage collection combined with lower construction expenses, Sao
Paulo-based Sabesp said yesterday in a  statement .  The company has risen 69 percent in Brazil since the start
of the year, the second best return among 14 publicly traded
water utilities in the Americas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
