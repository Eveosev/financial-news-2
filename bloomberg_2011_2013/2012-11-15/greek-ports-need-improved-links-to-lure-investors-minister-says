Greek ports must cooperate with each
other and improve links with the rest of the country’s transport
network to attract investment, Shipping Minister Konstantinos Mousouroulis said.  “The European Commission thinks Greek ports have three
problems, deficiencies in administration, lack of cooperation
with each other, and low spending on investment and equipment,”
Mousouroulis told reporters in  Athens  today.  A deal between Hong Kong-based Cosco Pacific Ltd., which
runs Pier II at the country’s main harbor, Hewlett-Packard Co.
and Greek railway operator TRAINOSE “sets a first example of
successful connectivity among the country’s commercial
transportation grids,” Mousouroulis said.  Hewlett-Packard plans to use the Piraeus pier run by Cosco
to move goods manufactured in  Asia  into  Europe , according to a
statement by the Athens-based Development Ministry late
yesterday.  The agreement may boost local cargo business by 50 percent
and create hundreds of new jobs, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
