Belgium  plans to sell three new
benchmark bonds in 2013 as it seeks to maintain issuance at the
same level as this year, according to Anne Leclercq, director
for treasury and capital markets at the Belgian debt agency.  “Next year’s issuance will probably be around the same as
this year,” Leclercq said in an interview in Brussels last
week. “We will sell three new benchmark bonds. A new 10-year
bond, probably a new five-year and a new longer-maturity bond,
probably in the 15-year or 30-year sector.”  “We will keep the final auction of this year,” Leclercq
said in an interview on Nov. 9. “That will give us the
possibility of pre-financing for next year.”  Belgium is taking advantage of record-low borrowing costs
to sell more longer-maturity debt this year than it originally
planned. With one more regular auction scheduled for Nov. 26,
the country has already surpassed its issuance target of 38.25
billion euros ($48.9 billion) for 2012.  The Belgian  10-year yield  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.26 percent at 3:12 p.m. London time after
dropping to 2.232 percent on Nov. 13, the lowest since Bloomberg
began collecting data on the securities in 1993.  Citigroup Inc. strategists predict the nation will raise 3
billion euros at the November auction. The debt agency sold 1.26
billion euros of 10-year bonds on Oct. 29 at an average yield of
2.418 percent, the lowest since the euro was introduced in 1999.  Belgium will probably raise a total of 45.2 billion euros
this year through its financing programs including bonds and
other debt instruments, Jean Deboutte, director of strategy and
risk management at the Belgian debt agency, wrote by e-mail
today. The agency “remains flexible,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
