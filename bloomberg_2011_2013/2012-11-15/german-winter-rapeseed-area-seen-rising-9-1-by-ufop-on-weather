German farmers increased planting of
winter rapeseed for harvesting next year by 9.1 percent in
response to higher prices and favorable weather, according to
the country’s oilseed-industry association.  Winter rapeseed was sown on an estimated 1.42 million
hectares (3.5 million acres), against 1.3 million hectares
harvested in 2012, the Union zur Foerderung von Oel- und
Proteinpflanzen e.V., or UFOP, wrote in an online  statement .  Rapeseed climbed 11 percent in the past year in Paris
trading on NYSE Liffe after crop prospects deteriorated in
Australia and  Canada . Germany is the European Union’s second-
largest grower of the oilseed after  France .  “Across Germany, favorable weather and attractive rapeseed
prices led to an increase in rapeseed cultivation,” UFOP wrote.
“Especially in the north, farmers took advantage of the good
sowing conditions in August and September.”  UFOP’s estimate was based on a survey of 5,075 farmers in
September and October, according to the statement.  The biggest jump in sowing was in the state of Schleswig-
Holstein, with winter-rapeseed planting climbing 75 percent to
an estimated 107,000 hectares, according to UFOP.  Germany ’s
largest growing state is Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where
planting rose 21 percent to 241,000 hectares, the group wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
