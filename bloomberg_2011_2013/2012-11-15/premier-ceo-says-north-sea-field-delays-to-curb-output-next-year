Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , a U.K. energy
explorer operating from the U.K. to Southeast Asia, said delays
in starting North Sea fields will hold back production in 2013.  The EON SE-led Huntington and  Nexen Inc (NXY) .-operated Rochelle
fields will start in the first quarter rather than at the end of
this year as previously forecast, Premier said in a statement.
It expects to pump as much as 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day in 2013, down from an earlier 75,000-barrel-a-day target.  “Those are the two key events that cut production numbers
for next year,” Chief Executive Officer Simon Lockett said in a
phone interview, citing technical setbacks at the fields. “It’s
a timing issue rather than the reservoir performance.”  Premier is counting on new  oil deposits  to reach a
“medium-term” production target of 100,000 barrels a day. The
London-based company has secured exploration assets in  Kenya ,
Iraq and the Falkland Islands, and expects  cash flow  to reach
$2.5 billion in 2016 when the U.K. Catcher field comes on
stream, up from $1 billion next year.  The company raised production to 62,400 barrels a day in
November from an average 57,300 barrels a day in the first 10
months of the year, it said. Full-year output will average
58,000 barrels a day, according to estimates from  Oswald Clint ,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in London.  As production expands, net income will climb to more than
$30 a barrel in the “longer term” from $11.60 a barrel last
year, Clint wrote in an e-mailed report. “Premier is unduly
cheap as a multiple of future earnings,” he said.  Premier fell 0.9 percent to close at 331 pence in London
trading. The shares have dropped 8 percent since Nov. 6 when the
company said it plugged and abandoned the Spaniards East well in
the U.K. after failing to find oil or gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
