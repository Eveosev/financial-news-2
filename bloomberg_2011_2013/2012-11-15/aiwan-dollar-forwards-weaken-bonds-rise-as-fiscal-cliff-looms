Taiwan  dollar forwards fell the most
in more than five weeks as concern a failure to resolve the U.S.
budget deadlock will slow global growth damped demand for
emerging-market stocks.  Government bonds  were steady.  President  Barack Obama  said yesterday the world’s largest
economy faces the risk of a recession should the nation fail to
resolve the so-called fiscal cliff of $607 billion in automatic
spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect in January.
Global funds sold $354 million more Taiwanese shares than they
bought in the past four days, paring net purchases for the year
to $1.5 billion, according to exchange data.  “Although investors generally think the Democrats and
Republicans will cut a deal in the end, the uncertainties are
still there,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency
trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “Taiwan’s fundamentals aren’t
supporting currency appreciation.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.3 percent to
NT$28.970 versus the greenback as of 4:19 p.m. in Taipei,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest drop
since Oct. 8. The forwards were at a 0.6 percent premium to the
spot rate, which fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.142, based on Taipei
Forex Inc. prices. Tong predicts the currency will drop to
NT$29.3 by the end of the year.  Export orders declined 0.5 percent in October from a year
earlier, after a 1.9 percent rise the previous month, according
to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey
before official data due Nov. 20.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was 1.121 percent, compared with 1.120 percent
yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market. The overnight
 interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.391 percent, a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
