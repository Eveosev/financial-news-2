Natural gas futures fell from a one-
year high in New York after a government report showed a
stockpile drop that was short of analyst estimates.  Gas declined 1.5 percent, closing lower for the first time
this week. The Energy Department said  stockpiles  dropped 18
billion cubic feet last week to 3.911 trillion after rising to a
record the previous week.  Analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg showed an expected decline of 22 billion. Prices had
climbed 8.6 percent this week in anticipation of the report.  “We had a panic buying spree and the market overbought
this number,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group
Inc., a consulting group in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “It was a
decent delivery. Given the weather outlook I don’t think this
number is going to stand.”  Gas for December delivery slid 5.7 cents to settle at
$3.703 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  after rising to $3.83, the highest intraday
price since Nov. 4, 2011. The futures are up 8.8 percent from a
year ago.  December $4 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading today. They fell 1 cent to 1.2 cents on
volume of 1,387 lots at 3:11 p.m. Calls accounted for 59 percent
of options volume.  Last week’s supply decline was less than the five-year
average change for the period, which was a gain of 17 billion
cubic feet, according to Energy Department data. Inventories
rose 20 billion the same week last year.  Storage Surplus  A stockpile  surplus  to the five-year average fell to 5.6
percent for the week ended Nov. 9 from 6.6 percent the previous
week, making it the smallest gap since Oct. 28, 2011, department
data show.  “Last year we didn’t start drawing down storage till the
last week of November, so it’s a pretty interesting scenario,”
said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc. in  New York . “You are probably going to get
a pretty consistent drawdown on supply now as a function of
weather.”  Temperatures will be above normal in the western two-thirds
of the U.S. over the next six to 10 days and normal along the
East Coast, Eric Wertz, a meteorologist with MDA Earthsat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a note to clients
today. The eastern states will see seasonal or colder-than-
normal weather over the next 11 to 15 days, he said.  The low in  Detroit  will be 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5
Celsius), 7 above normal on Nov. 21, before dropping to 11 below
normal at 20 degrees on Nov. 27, according to AccuWeather Inc.
in  State College , Pennsylvania.  New York City ’s low will be 8
above the usual reading at 48 degrees on Nov. 22 before dropping
to 27 degrees a week later, 11 below normal.  Warm Winter  Gas prices fell to a 10-year low in April after mild winter
weather crimped demand for heating fuels while production rose
to a record.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
department data show.  Blackouts following  Hurricane Sandy  made it difficult to
predict how much demand destruction there was for gas last week,
as a nor’easter that brought snow to the East Coast boosted
heating needs, Schork said.  Sandy, which made landfall in southern  New Jersey  on Oct.
29, pounded the East Coast with high winds, rain and flooding.
About 8.5 million homes and businesses were without power at the
storm’s peak.  Gas production  U.S. gas output will average 68.84 billion cubic feet a day
in 2012, up 4 percent from last year, the department said in its
Nov. 6 Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The number of  rigs  drilling for natural gas fell by 11 to
413 last week, the least since June 1999, data from Baker Hughes
Inc. show.  Power plants  will burn a record 25.37 billion cubic feet a
day of gas this year, up 22 percent from 2011, the department
said. The rate will decline by 11 percent in 2013 as higher  gas
prices  spur a rise in coal use, the federal agency said.  Robust demand from electricity generators “served as a
corrective mechanism” to reduce the storage surplus, John Gerdes, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity in Houston, said in a
note to clients today.  Over the past four weeks, power plants consumed 2.2 billion
cubic feet a day more gas than a year earlier, he said. The
seven-day moving average as of today showed the year-over-year
gain fell to between 1.5 billion and 2 billion cubic feet a day,
according to Gerdes.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
332,013 as of 2:45 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 367,000. Volume was 409,902 yesterday. Open interest was 1.16
million contracts. The three-month average is 1.14 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
