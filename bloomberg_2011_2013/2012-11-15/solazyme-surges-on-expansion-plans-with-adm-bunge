Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) , which makes oil
products from sugar-consuming algae, surged the most in seven
months after agreeing to expand production capacity through
partnerships with  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)   Solazyme climbed 10 percent to $7.80 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain since April 3.  The company plans to open a plant in 2014 at an ADM
facility in Iowa and will triple planned output from an existing
venture with Bunge, according to a statement yesterday from
South San Francisco, California-based Solazyme.  “It’s a clear signal that Solazyme has some real value to
offer its partners,” said Weston Twigg, an analyst at Pacific
Crest Securities LLC in  Portland ,  Oregon , who recommends buying
the shares. “They’re basically quadrupling planned
production.”  The ADM plant will produce 20,000 metric tons of oil in
2014 and may eventually expand to 100,000 tons a year. Bunge and
Solazyme are building a plant in Brazil that will be able to
make 100,000 tons annually when completed in the fourth quarter
of 2013, and Bunge may introduce the technology at other
facilities and produce as much as 300,000 tons a year by 2016.  “The market has been hungry for this type of announcement
here as we’ve seen the stock fall a couple bucks over the past
couple weeks,” Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo said by
telephone. “This is really the third partner that they’re going
to build out capacity with.”  Solazyme has a venture with Roquette Freres SA that
produces 300 tons of oil a year in France, and is on schedule to
expand that to 5,000 tons by the second quarter, Solazyme Chief
Executive Officer Jonathan Wolfson said yesterday in a
conference call.  To contact the reporters on this story:
