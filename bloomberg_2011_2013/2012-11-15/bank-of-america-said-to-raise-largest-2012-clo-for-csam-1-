Bank of America Corp.  raised an $802
million collateralized loan obligation for Credit Suisse Asset
Management, the largest deal backed by widely syndicated loans
raised this year.  This is the fourth CLO the firm has issued in 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It most recently raised
a $516.3 million fund with  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  in September.  There have been $41 billion of CLOs backed by the widely
syndicated debt arranged this year in the U.S., according to
Bloomberg data. Sales are up from $11.7 billion during last year
and the most since the market peak of $91.1 billion in 2007,
according to Bloomberg and Morgan Stanley data. JPMorgan Chase &
Co. said there could be $60 billion to $70 billion of such funds
next year.  “U.S. CLO new issuance remained robust in October and the
first half of November,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by
Vishwanath Tirupattur wrote in a Nov. 13 report. “October
showed the highest monthly issuance amount since 2007.”  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Oak Hill Advisors LP previously held the record for the
largest CLO this year, a $770 million fund the firm raised with
Bank of America last month, according to Bloomberg data.  The CSAM CLO includes a $300 million slice rated AAA that
pays a rate of 137 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, according to people with knowledge of the fund,
who asked not to be identified because the terms are private.
Libor is the rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other.  Katherine Herring , a Credit Suisse spokeswoman, and Kerrie
McHugh, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
