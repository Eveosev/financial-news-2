Miguel Cabrera  of the Detroit Tigers
was selected as the American League’s Most Valuable Player after
becoming the first Major League Baseball player in 45 years to
win the Triple Crown.  Cabrera, 29, led the AL in batting average (.330), home
runs (44) and runs batted in (139), the first player to top a
league in all three categories since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.  He beat out Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout, who
earlier this week was chosen unanimously as the AL Rookie of the
Year.  Cabrera won the award in balloting by the Baseball Writers’
Association of America. The other finalists were second baseman
Robinson Cano of the New York Yankees, and outfielder Josh
Hamilton and third baseman  Adrian Beltre , both of the Texas
Rangers.  Earlier today, San Francisco Giants catcher  Buster Posey 
was announced as the National League MVP.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
