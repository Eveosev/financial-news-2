The incoming chairman of the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee said enacting a carbon
tax would require a “big lift politically” and he plans to
instead focus on hydroelectric power, geothermal and biomass to
cut carbon emissions.  Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, also said natural
gas offers a chance for both parties to seek a compromise on
energy policy. New reserves of natural gas are helping improve
the economy, he said today at an event in  Washington .  Wyden is scheduled to replace Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New
Mexico Democrat, as committee head in the next Congress.
Bingaman is retiring.  Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, also brushed
aside the idea that Congress would agree to impose a tax on
carbon emissions as a way to raise revenue to help resolve U.S.
fiscal problems.  “If we are just looking at this as a revenue raiser for
the Treasury, to me that’s bad policy,” Murkowski, top
Republican on the panel, said the an event sponsored by CQ-Roll
Call and the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
