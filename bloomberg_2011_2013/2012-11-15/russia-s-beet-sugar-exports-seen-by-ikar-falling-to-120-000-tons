Russia ’s beet-sugar exports are seen
declining to 120,000 metric tons or less in the season started
Aug. 1 because consumers are switching to lower-priced European
supplies, the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies said.  That compares with an export estimate of 150,000 tons or
less, which was made by the institute, known as Ikar, in
October. Last season, Russia shipped more than 300,000 tons for
the first time after a record crop and output, according to
Agriculture Ministry data.  Russia’s traditional consumers, which are Central Asian
states, are buying beet-sugar from Ukraine, Belarus and the
European Union,  Evgeny Ivanov , Ikar’s sugar analyst, said by
phone in Moscow today.  Ikar maintains its beet-sugar estimate at between 4.4
million and 4.7 million tons, Ivanov said, adding it may fall to
about 4.5 million tons. That led Ikar to raise its import
forecast for white sweetener to about 300,000 tons and for raw
sugar to about 500,000 tons for the season, Ivanov said.  The first vessel with more than 30,000 tons of imported raw
sugar will arrive in December, which is “surprisingly” earlier
than Ikar expected, he said. The lot will most probably be
refined for industrial consumers that need certain sweetener
specifications, which cannot be met from refining domestic
sugar-beets, Ivanov said. Most of the raw-sugar imports aren’t
expected before March, he said.  The seasonal import estimates were raised from October’s
280,000 tons of refined sweetener and at least 350,000 tons of
raw-sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
