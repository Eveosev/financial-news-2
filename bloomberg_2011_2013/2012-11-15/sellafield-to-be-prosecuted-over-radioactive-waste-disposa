Sellafield Ltd., the operator of a
nuclear reprocessing site in northern  England , faces prosecution
over claims it sent four bags of radioactive waste to landfill,
according to the U.K.’s nuclear and environmental regulators.  The company must answer charges it sent the bags from its
Sellafield site to the Lillyhall landfill facility in nearby
Workington in 2010, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency today.  The prosecution of the company, which is responsible for
nuclear waste management on behalf of the U.K.’s  Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority , follows a 2 1/2-year investigation by
regulators. It faces nine charges to be heard at Workington
Magistrates Court on Dec. 12, according to the statement.  As well as waste disposal at Lillyhall, the charges relate
to transporting dangerous goods, lacking adequate management and
resources to meet environmental obligations, and failing to use
the best tests and measurements to comply with its environmental
permit, the statement shows.  Sellafield will “take the time to consider the information
provided to us” by the Environment Agency and the Health and
Safety Executive, Karl Connor, a spokesman for the company, said
today in an e-mailed statement, declining to comment further
since the matter is subject to court proceedings.  The Sellafield site is home to the world’s first commercial
nuclear power station, Calder Hall, which generated electricity
from 1956 to 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
