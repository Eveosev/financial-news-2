An amendment to  Michigan ’s state
constitution that barred its public colleges from considering
race, gender or ethnicity in admissions is unconstitutional, a
federal appeals court said.  The voter-initiated amendment, known as Proposal 2, placed
special burdens on minority interests and violated equal
protection laws, a majority of a 15-judge panel of the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati said in a ruling today. A smaller
panel of the court reached the same conclusion in July 2011.  The Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and
Immigration Rights and Fight for Equality by Any Means
Necessary, a Detroit-based civil-rights organization, sued to
challenge Proposal 2 in that city’s federal courthouse in
November 2006.  The case is Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action,
Integration and Immigrant Rights v. Regents of the  University of
Michigan , 08-1387, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
(Cincinnati).  To contact the reporter on this story:
