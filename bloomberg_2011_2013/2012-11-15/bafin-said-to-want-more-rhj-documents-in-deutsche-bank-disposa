German regulators demanded more
information from  RHJ International (RHJI) , the company seeking approval
to buy  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s BHF-Bank wealth management unit,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The nation’s financial market regulator, BaFin, asked RHJ
for more documents after deeming the information the company
already submitted to be insufficient, said the people, who
requested to remain anonymous as the matter is private and
wouldn’t say what information was lacking.  Officials for Brussels-based RHJ, BaFin and Deutsche Bank,
the nation’s largest lender, all declined to comment. Deutsche
Bank had sought to sell the wealth manager to eliminate overlap
since it acquired the business in its purchase of Sal. Oppenheim
Group two years ago.  RHJ, a publicly traded investment firm whose holdings
include asset manager Kleinwort Benson Group, agreed to pay 384
million euros ($491 million) to acquire BHF in September after
more than a year of talks, aiming to complement its services in
the U.K., the  Channel Islands  and Ireland. RHJ was founded by
private-equity executive Timothy Collins.  Deutsche Bank’s previous plan to sell the unit to LGT
Group, owned by the family of the prince of  Liechtenstein , was
scuppered last year after the regulator voiced concern about the
deal. In 2010, LGT settled criminal proceedings by German
prosecutors over charges of abetting  tax evasion .  German newspaper Die Welt earlier reported BaFin’s request
for additional information from RHJ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
