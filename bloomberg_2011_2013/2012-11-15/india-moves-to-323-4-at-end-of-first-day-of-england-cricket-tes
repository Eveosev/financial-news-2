Virender Sehwag smashed 117 runs in
as many balls to lead India to 323-4 at the end of the first day
of the opening cricket Test with England in Ahmedabad.  Sehweg combined with fellow opener Guatam Gambhir for 134
runs before they were both bowled by  Graeme Swann , who took
4-85. India won the toss and elected to bat. Cheteshwar Pujara,
on 98, and  Yuvraj Singh , on 24, were batting at the end of the
day.  England handed a debut to opening batsman Nick Compton,
while Samit Patel will bat at No. 6 and bowled left-arm spin as
 Tim Bresnan  was chosen as the third seamer. Yuvraj Singh returns
to India’s Test lineup for the first time in a year after
recovering from a rare germ cell cancer.  The match is the first of four between the teams. England,
which swept the best-of-four contest when the teams met last
year in the U.K., hasn’t won a Test series in India since
1984-85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
