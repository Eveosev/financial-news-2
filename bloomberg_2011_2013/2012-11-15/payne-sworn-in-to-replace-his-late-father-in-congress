New Jersey Democrat Donald Payne Jr.
was sworn in this afternoon, replacing his late father Donald Payne, who held his Newark-based congressional seat for more
than 20 years before dying in office earlier this year.  Payne, a former Newark city councilman, won a special
election on Nov. 6 to complete the rest of his father’s term and
also was elected to a two-year term that begins in January.  He said his swearing-in was “bittersweet,” though he was
looking forward to continuing his father’s work.  Payne is the last of four special election winners to be
sworn in for the lame-duck session of Congress that will include
deliberations on averting a combination of sweeping tax
increases and spending cuts known as the “fiscal cliff.”  The others -- Suzan DelBene, a Washington state Democrat,
Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Michigan Democrat
David Curson -- were sworn in earlier this week. All but Curson
also were elected to full two-year terms.  The elder Payne, New Jersey’s first black congressman,
forged a reputation as an advocate for democracy in  Africa 
during a 23-year career in Congress. He died March 6 from colon
cancer. He was 77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
