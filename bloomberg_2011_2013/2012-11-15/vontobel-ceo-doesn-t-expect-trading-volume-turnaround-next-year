Vontobel Holding AG (VONN) , the Swiss bank
and brokerage specializing in derivatives products, said trading
volumes in equity markets will probably remain low next year.  “We assume going forward we will be stuck with 2012
volumes,” Vontobel Chief Executive Officer Zeno Staub said
today in an interview in Geneva. “We don’t expect a vast
turnaround in volumes and client activity. Clients remain very
cautious.”  Vontobel, which has businesses in  investment banking , asset
management and private banking, said that while trading volumes
briefly increased in September, income at the Zurich-based bank
is still affected by the “subdued trends that emerged in the
first half of the year.” Assets under management climbed to
almost 96 billion Swiss francs ($102 billion) at the end of
October from 90.5 billion francs four months earlier, the
company said today in a  statement .  Vontobel’s stock declined 2 percent to 24.95 francs at 2:11
p.m. in Zurich trading, valuing the company at 1.62 billion
francs. That pared this year’s gain to 19 percent.  Vontobel said it’s combining offshore and onshore private
banking services for German clients as customer requirements
converge. The firm won’t be adjusting fees, Staub said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
