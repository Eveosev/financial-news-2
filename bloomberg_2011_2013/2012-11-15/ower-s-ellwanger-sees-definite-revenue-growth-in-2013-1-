Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (TSEM) , the
Israeli maker of customized chips, will see a “definite” rise
in revenue next year as it starts production of recent design
orders, the company’s chief executive officer Russell Ellwanger
said.  “We will see a definite revenue increase versus 2012 as
the execution of design wins into prototypes enter into
production in 2013,” Ellwanger said in a telephone interview
with Bloomberg today.  The company reported a 12 percent drop in  third quarter 
revenue to $154.6 million and a loss of $18m compared with a
profit of 1.84 million in the same quarter a year earlier. The
mean estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $157
million. Tower forecast sales of $147 million to $157 million
for the fourth quarter. Shares closed 0.4 percent lower in Tel
Aviv and were trading 2.4 percent higher at 10 a.m. in  New York .  “The results were weak but in line with expectations. They
continue to be affected by the global economic situation,”
Sabina Podval, an analyst at  Leader Capital Markets (LDRC)  Ltd. in Tel
Aviv said today by phone.  As concern about Europe’s debt persists and growth in the
U.S. and China slows, companies from Intel Corp. to
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  have released guidance and
revenues that have fallen short of projections. Intel, the
world’s largest chipmaker, forecast on Oct. 16 fourth-quarter
gross margins that missed analysts’ estimates, while IBM, the
biggest computer-services provider, reported on the same day
third-quarter revenue that fell short of projections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
