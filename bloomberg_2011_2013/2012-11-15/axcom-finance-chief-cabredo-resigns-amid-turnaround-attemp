Maxcom (MAXCOMCP)  Telecomunicaciones SAB Chief
Financial Officer Miguel Cabredo resigned to take another job in
the midst of a turnaround attempt by the land-line phone company
partly owned by  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   Chief Executive Officer Salvador Alvarez will assume
Cabredo’s duties, the company said yesterday in a filing to
Mexico’s stock exchange. Mexico City-based Maxcom didn’t specify
the next career step for Cabredo, who has been with the company
for 12 years and was CFO for two years.  Maxcom is focusing on gaining residential and business
users as its pay-phone division loses customers to mobile-phone
companies and its wholesale unit cuts prices to compete with
America Movil SAB. The company is retaining the rest of its
financial staff, and its strategy is proceeding as planned, said
Manuel Perez, Maxcom’s investor relations director, in an
interview yesterday.  Maxcom dropped 0.8 percent to 3.53 pesos yesterday before
Cabredo’s departure was announced. The shares have slid 2.8
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
