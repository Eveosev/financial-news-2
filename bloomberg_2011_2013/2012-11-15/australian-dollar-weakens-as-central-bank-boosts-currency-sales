Australia ’s dollar declined against
all of its major peers except the yen after the nation’s  Reserve
Bank  said it increased sales of the currency last month to a
category of buyers that includes foreign central banks.  Demand was limited after an Israeli air strike on the Gaza
strip and signs of a global slowdown reduced demand for riskier
assets. The Australian and New Zealand dollars rallied versus
the yen after  Japan ’s opposition leader Shinzo Abe called for
unlimited central-bank easing until deflation is defeated in the
world’s third-largest economy.  Australia’s dollar  slid 0.4 percent to $1.0332 in New York
from the previous day, when it dropped 0.6 percent. The Aussie
gained 0.7 percent to 83.86 yen.  New Zealand’s currency fell 0.1 percent to 80.92 U.S.
cents. The so-called kiwi jumped 1 percent to 65.68 yen.  The RBA sold A$483 million ($499 million) more in local
currency than it bought in October through the so-called other
outright transactions category, the most since June 2009,
according to data released yesterday. It sold a net A$275
million in the spot foreign exchange market.  Australian bonds rose, sending the benchmark 10-year yield
to the lowest level in almost one month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
