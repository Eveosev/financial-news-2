PT Pertamina,  Indonesia â€™s state-
owned oil company, is producing 40,000 barrels of oil a day at
its Offshore Northwest Java block, the International Oil Daily
reported, citing a company statement.  The company has nearly doubled output since 2009, when it
assumed ownership of the block from  BP Plc. (BP/)  It is drilling more
development wells and improving production facilities and sub-
sea pipelines, IOD reported. Four more exploration wells are
planned by early next year, IOD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
