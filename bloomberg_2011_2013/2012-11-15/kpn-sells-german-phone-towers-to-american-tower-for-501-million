Royal KPN NV (KPN) , the Dutch phone
company partly owned by Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim , agreed
to sell part of its German mobile-phone towers to  American Tower
Corp. (AMT)  for 393 million euros ($501 million) in cash.  KPN will probably book a 100 million-euro gain on the sale,
The Hague-based company said in a statement today, adding its
outlook for 2012 remains unchanged following the transaction.
KPN earlier forecast full-year earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and restructuring costs to be as high
as 4.9 billion euros.  The phone company has been selling mobile towers since 2008
and announced an agreement to sell part of its Dutch mobile
towers to Protelindo on Oct. 31. KPN said it will use the cash
proceeds of the transaction with Boston-based American Tower to
continue to invest in the accelerated mobile network roll-out in
 Germany  and to improve its net debt position.  “We are very pleased with this transaction,” which is at
an attractive valuation, KPN Chief Financial Officer Eric
Hageman said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
