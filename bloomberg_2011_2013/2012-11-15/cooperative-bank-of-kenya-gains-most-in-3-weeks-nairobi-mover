Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
nation’s fourth-biggest lender by market value, gained the most
in three weeks after reporting that profit jumped by a third for
the nine months through September.  Shares climbed 1.2 percent to 12.55 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in the capital, Nairobi, the largest advance since Oct.
24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 1.41 million
shares traded, 156 percent of the three-month daily average
amount.  Net income advanced to 5.9 billion shillings ($68.9
million) from 4.5 billion shillings a year earlier, the lender
said today in a statement e-mailed by the Nairobi Securities
Exchange. Net interest income, the money lenders make from
loans, surged 33 percent to 11.7 billion shillings.  “There was quite a significant increase in loan
disbursement and net interest income was also good because most
loans are still carrying high  interest rates ,” Faith Atiti, an
analyst at Nairobi-based NIC Securities Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “The cost of funds eased in the third quarter
because interest on deposits slowed, so margins should also be
going up.”  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) , Kenya’s largest lender by market value,
reported a 14 percent jump in profit to 8.3 billion shillings on
Nov. 6 while  Kenya Commercial Bank (KNCB) , the biggest by assets, said
profit increased 35 percent to 8.69 billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
