Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 43 percent
to the lowest weekly level since August as wheat deliveries to
North Africa declined for a third week.  Shipments totaled 33,976 metric tons between Nov. 8 and
Nov. 14 and consisted entirely of soft wheat, the  Seine River
port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. Grain cargoes were the
lowest since the week ended Aug. 1. Exports came to 59,770 tons
of wheat and corn in the previous week.  Algeria was the biggest destination in the latest week,
with 23,750 tons of wheat, down from 47,500 tons a week earlier.
The country is the largest export market for French wheat.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, exceeding the 17 percent share for La Pallice on
the Bay of Biscay and Dunkirk on the  North Sea  with 11 percent
of the total, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
