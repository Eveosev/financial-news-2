The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 4 1/2 basis
points to 151 basis points as of 11:31 a.m. in Sydney, according
to  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The index is set for its highest close
since Oct. 11, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose three basis points to 126 as of
8:26 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The index has ranged between 175.3 and 112.6 in the second
half of the year, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed two basis points to
206 as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
index had risen 19.9 basis points this year as of yesterdayâ€™s
close after increasing 85.5 in 2011, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The indexes are benchmarks for protecting bonds against
default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A
drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness, while an
increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
