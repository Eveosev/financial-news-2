German power for next year fell the
most this month as carbon permits had their biggest three-day
drop since 2006. Benchmark European coal advanced.  Year-ahead power decreased as much as 0.6 percent to 47.15
euros ($60.35) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the steepest decline since Oct.
29. The contract traded at 47.20 euros a megawatt-hour at 3:20
p.m. in  London .  Thermal coal for delivery in 2013 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp added as much as 0.6 percent to $97.10 a metric ton,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 2013 German clean-dark spread, a measure of profit that
utilities can earn from selling electricity after accounting for
the cost of coal and emission permits, rose for a third day,
gaining 5.6 percent to 10.07 euros a megawatt-hour, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  EU allowances for December lost as much as 11 percent to
7.06 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London and were at 7.27 euros at 3:14 p.m. in London. That takes
their three-day decrease to 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
