Ghana ’s cedi will rise to the
highest in eight months by the end of the year as measures put
in place by the central bank to support the currency continue,
according to the Finance and Economic Planning Ministry.  The cedi’s depreciation for 2012 will be 11 percent, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. That will see the
currency trade at 1.8421 a dollar, based on calculations made
using data compiled by Bloomberg. The cedi last traded at this
level on April 23, according to the data.  “Our forecast is based on the measures implemented by the
central bank and the impact so far,” Abdul Hakim Ahmed, a
spokesman at the ministry, said by phone today. “The measures
will continue to the end of the year.”  The  Bank of Ghana  increased its  policy interest  rate by 2.5
percentage points this year to 15 percent and held it at that
level for a second straight time yesterday. The central bank
also asked lenders to keep more reserves in cedis and
reintroduced Treasury bills with maturities of 30, 60 and 270
days to get extra cedis off the local market. It also accepted
higher yields on 91- and 182-day offers.  The cedi, which fell 15 percent to the dollar in the first
half of the year, has since appreciated 3.2 percent. It gained
0.1 percent to 1.8788 a dollar by 12:10 p.m. in Accra.  The currency of the second-biggest economy in West Africa
will strengthen 1 percent in the last quarter of this year,
according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
