Latvia ’s credit grade may be raised
by Moody’s Investors Service after similar moves by the other
two major ratings companies,  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc  said.  Moody’s may increase Latvia’s Baa3 rating from its lowest
investment grade, Mohammed Kazmi, a London-based emerging-
markets strategist at RBS, wrote today in an e-mailed note.
Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings both rate the Baltic
nation one step higher after upgrades in the last week.  “The recent upgrades are likely to be followed by Moody’s,
which requires Latvia to continue on its path of fiscal
consolidation and progress toward single-currency membership,”
Kazmi said.  Latvia’s credit ratings have been upgraded after government
austerity measures in the wake of an economic crisis that erased
almost a quarter of economic output in 2008-2009. Gross domestic
product may advance by as much as 5 percent this year, Prime
Minister Valdis Dombrovskis told Parliament today. Inflation
slowed to a two-year low in October, bolstering plans to follow
 Estonia  into the euro area in 2014.  The yield on Latvia’s dollar bond due 2021 fell one basis
point to 3.39 percent as of 11:22 a.m. in Riga, the capital,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It fell to a low of 3.1911
percent on Oct. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
