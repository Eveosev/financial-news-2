GameStop Corp. (GME)  the world’s largest
video-game retailer, gave a profit forecast for the holiday-
season quarter that topped some analysts’ estimates in what it
called a “tough video-game market.”  For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company’s peak holiday
earnings period, profit is expected to be $2.07 to $2.27 a
share, Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop said today in a
 statement . The midpoint of $2.17 is 1 cent above the average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are weighing whether the release of Nintendo
Co.’s Wii U, the video-game industry’s first new home console in
six years, will spur purchases or confirm declining interest in
packaged games costing $60 each. The Wii U, which goes on sale
on Nov. 18 in the U.S., replaces an earlier device, released in
2006, that led industry sales.  For the third quarter ended Oct. 27, GameStop posted a net
loss of $624.3 million, or $5.08 a share, after impairment and
goodwill costs of $678.8 million. That compared with net income
of $53.9 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier. Excluding the
impairment expenses, earnings of 38 cents topped the 33-cent
average of estimates.  Sales declined 8.9 percent to $1.77 billion, compared with
 projections  of $1.79 billion.  GameStop fell less than 1 percent to $23.34 at 9:42 a.m.
 New York  time. The  stock  had fallen 2.7 percent this year
through yesterday.  The video-game industry is entering the U.S. holiday season
amid an extended drop in sales. Existing consoles, which include
Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox 360 and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation 3, are
aging, while mobile and online options attract players. Last
year, the fourth quarter accounted for 51 percent of GameStop’s
annual profit.  The company said on Oct. 26 it will open about 80 GameStop
Kids stores featuring products including toys and collectibles
for children under age 13 in time for holiday shopping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
