The United Nations body overseeing
civil aviation will choose a market-based plan to cut climate
emissions from flights at its next general assembly in October.  The  International Civil Aviation Organization  set up a
group on Nov. 9 to provide recommendations and a feasibility
study into a so-called market-based measure aimed at cutting
discharges, according to an e-mailed statement from ICAO. The
membership and terms of reference for the group will be
finalized this week, ICAO said.  The prospect of a move by the ICAO to establish a global
vehicle to curb aviation emissions prompted the EU this week to
announce plans to freeze the implementation of carbon curbs on
flights into and out of the bloc for 2012, deferring the
emissions trading obligation by a year.  The ICAO assembly in 2010 instructed its leadership “to
prepare and deliver both the MBM Framework and Feasibility
Report for consideration by its next triennial Assembly in
October 2013,” the group said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
