Ross Asset Management Ltd., a
closely held New Zealand-based share investor, owes clients
about NZ$450 million ($365 million) after collapsing, according
to receivers PricewaterhouseCoopers.  About NZ$10.2 million of investments have been identified,
and about 1,720 customers are affected, John Fisk and David
Bridgman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said in an e-mailed
statement. The pair were appointed as receivers and managers
last week by the Financial Markets Authority after complaints
from investors.  “There is a significant gap between the identified market
value of the group’s investments as against the amounts in
investors’ portfolios,” the receivers said. “Analysis to date
indicates it is likely historical returns advised to investors
are exaggerated and may possibly be fictitious.”  Investigations are hampered because many of the investment
decisions were made by sole director  David Ross , who is
hospitalized and unable to assist, they said. His group is
insolvent, and an urgent recovery strategy is needed to maximize
investor interests, they said.  A lawyer who represented Ross in court last week didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
