Public Power Corp. (PPC)  SA,  Greece ’s
biggest electricity company, each month has been cutting off
power supply to about 30,000 clients for failing to pay their
bills, Chief Executive Officer Arthouros Zervos said.  That represents a minority of the power company’s clients
that are “inconsistent” with payments, Zervos said in response
to questions in Parliament today.  Austerity measures imposed by the government in exchange
for loans from the International Monetary Fund and the European
Union have led the country into its fifth year of recession with
an unemployment rate of 25.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
