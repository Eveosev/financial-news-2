San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh missed practice today because of an irregular
heartbeat, and the team said he is expected back tomorrow.  “Coach Harbaugh is not at the facility today under
doctor’s orders,” the 49ers said in an e-mailed statement. “He
is having a minor procedure done at Stanford Hospital today for
an irregular heartbeat.”  It didn’t give details.  Harbaugh, 48, is in his second year with the 49ers after
coaching at Stanford University for four seasons. He is a former
National Football League quarterback.  “We didn’t know he was having that done until just a
second ago,” San Francisco linebacker Patrick Willis told
reporters at practice. “He’ll be all right, we know he will
be.”  The 49ers (6-2-1), who lost to the  New York  Giants in the
National Football Conference championship game in January, host
the Chicago Bears on Nov. 19.  Harbaugh and his older brother, Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh, are the first siblings to serve as NFL head coaches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
