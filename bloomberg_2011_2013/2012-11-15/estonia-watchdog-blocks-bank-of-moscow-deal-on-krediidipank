Estonia ’s financial watchdog blocked
the  Bank of Moscow  and four smaller shareholders of AS Eesti
Krediidipank from selling stakes in Estonia’s fifth-largest
lender, saying the Swiss-registered buyer wasn’t transparent.  Under agreements signed last November, RLS Finance SA would
become the bank’s biggest shareholder with a 44 percent stake
after acquiring the shareholdings from Bank of Moscow, Lazuron
Investments Ltd., Olix Holding Ltd., Firmex Investeeringud and
Genovia Invest. This would end a dispute over the sale of
 Krediidipank  shares by the former president of the Bank of
Moscow, Andrei Borodin, the bank said then.  “The Financial Supervision Authority blocked the
acquisition of a dominant share as the supervisor hasn’t
established the origin of monetary and non-monetary assets that
were intended to be used for the purchase of a significant part
of Krediidipank shares,” the supervisor’s spokeswoman Malle
Aleksius said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg questions,
confirming an earlier report by the Aeripaeev newspaper.  The watchdog also didn’t consider the finances of RLS
Finance SA “strong enough to guarantee stable and reliable
activities of Krediidipank,” she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
