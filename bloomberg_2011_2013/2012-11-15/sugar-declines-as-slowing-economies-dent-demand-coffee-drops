Cotton futures gained the most in
four weeks on speculation that demand will increase for supplies
from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Coffee, cocoa and
orange juice climbed, while sugar dropped.  In the week ended Nov. 1,  sales  of upland cotton from the
U.S. more than doubled from a week earlier with increases posted
to  Turkey ,  Vietnam , Mexico and China, the world’s top user, the
Department of Agriculture said on Nov. 8. The agency will
release the latest figures tomorrow.  “Many analysts and traders are expecting the report to
show robust sales,”  Andy Ryan , a senior risk manager at INTL
FCStone in Nashville,  Tennessee , said in a report.  Cotton for March delivery climbed 1.4 percent to settle at
72.24 cents a pound at 2:33 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest advance for a most-active contract since Oct.
17.  “There is a lot of business being done with Turkey and
Pakistan,” Jordan Lea, the chairman of Eastern Trading Co., an
exporter in Greenville,  South Carolina , said in an e-mail.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery gained 0.8
percent to $1.54 a pound in New York. Earlier, the price touched
$1.4945, the lowest since June 15, 2010.  Cocoa futures for March delivery advanced 1.1 percent to
$2,483 a metric ton. The price climbed for the fifth straight
session, the longest rally since late August.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery climbed 3.1
percent to $1.1625 a pound. Earlier, the price reached $1.18,
the highest since Oct. 11.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 1 percent to
