Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  raised
$1.75 billion in a sale of fixed- and floating-rate notes after
relative yields on bank bonds declined by more than half this
year.  The lender issued $1.25 billion of 1.6 percent debt
maturing in November 2015 that yields 130 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $500 million of two-year
floating-rate securities that pay 100 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds are expected to be rated A3 by
Moody’s Investors Service, Bloomberg data show.  Yields on Goldman Sachs’s $2.25 billion of 3.3 percent
securities maturing in May 2015 have declined about 178 basis
points to 1.41 percent yesterday since the New York-based lender
issued the notes six months ago, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The yields of those debentures traded yesterday at
107.9 basis points more than Treasuries. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The extra yield investors demand to hold debt of Goldman
Sachs instead of  government securities  has dropped by about half
this year to 213 basis points yesterday, from 421 at year-end,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The
average spread on bank debt in the U.S. has tightened 207 basis
points to 177 in the same period. The measure reached 164 basis
points on Oct. 17, the tightest since 2007, the index data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
