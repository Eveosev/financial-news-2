Azerbaijan’s economy slowed in the
year through October as oil output in the former  Soviet Union ’s
third-largest crude producer shrank.  Gross domestic product advanced 1 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 1.1 percent increase in the first nine
months, according to data published today on the  website  of the
State Statistics Committee, based in the capital, Baku.  While GDP related to the oil industry shrank 7.4 percent,
output in the rest of the economy surged 10.4 percent, the
committee said.  Azerbaijan’s economy expanded 0.1 percent last year as
growth in industries such as construction compensated for
declining oil output. Oil output, which trails only Russia and
 Kazakhstan  among ex-Soviet nations, fell 7.7 percent to 36
million metric tons in the first 10 months, while production of
marketable natural gas increased 6.8 percent to 14.4 billion
cubic meters, according to the committee.  Consumer prices advanced 1.3 percent as food, and services
costs rose, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
