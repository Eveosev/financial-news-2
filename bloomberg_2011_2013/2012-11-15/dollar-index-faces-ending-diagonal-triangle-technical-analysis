An Ending Diagonal Triangle trading
pattern suggests that the two-month rally in the U.S. Dollar
Index is poised to end, according to  MacNeil Curry , head of
foreign-exchange and interest-rates technical strategy at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’ Dollar Index, used to track
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trade
partners, has rallied 2.7 percent since Sept. 14 to 81.03. The
Ending Diagonal Triangle, a pattern indicating a weakening trend
that is on the verge of reversal, signals the gauge may be set
to resume its fall from 84.1 in July, the New York-based Curry
said today in a research report.  “This downtrend is on the verge of resumption,” Curry
wrote.  The index’s break below 81.01 is a sign the gauge will fall
and a trading-day close below 80.63 confirms the trend,
according to the unit of Bank of America Corp. The Dollar Index
has longer-term support at about 78.41 to 78.09.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
