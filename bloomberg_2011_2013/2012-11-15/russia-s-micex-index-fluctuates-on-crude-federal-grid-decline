Russian (INDEXCF)  equities moved between gains
and losses as crude oil, the country’s main export earner,
traded near a one-week high, while Federal Grid Co. sank.  The Micex Index traded down 0.2 percent at 1,369.10 by
12:20 p.m. in Moscow.  Oil companies  climbed as OAO Rosneft,
 Russia ’s biggest producer, added 1 percent. Federal Grid, the
nation’s monopoly for high-voltage power transmission, slid as
its adjusted net income dropped in the first half.  Oil rose 0.1 percent to $86.39 in  New York , trading near
the highest level in more than a week after  Israel  attacked the
 Gaza Strip . Russia receives about 50 percent of its budget
revenue from oil and natural gas sales. In  China , the official
Xinhua News Agency announced Xi Jinping had replaced  Hu Jintao 
as head of the Chinese Communist Party.  The number of shares traded on the Micex was 23 percent
above its 10-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  MSCI Inc. lifted OAO Sberbank’s weighting 2.5 percentage
points to 14.4 percent in the semi-annual rebalancing of its
Russia Index, according to a report on its website.  The increase may trigger inflows of about $213 million in
passive fund inflows, according to a VTB Capital note. MSCI made
no additions or deletions from its Russia Index, it said. All
changes will come into effect on Dec. 3, according to MSCI.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times  estimated earnings  after
falling 2.1 percent this year. That compares with a multiple of
10 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which has added
7.2 percent.  VTB, $3 Billion  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  VTB Group, Russia’s second-biggest bank, plans to raise as
much as $3 billion selling new shares in the first half of 2013,
Chairman  Andrei Kostin  said yesterday in an interview. The
shares rose 0.1 percent to 5.08 kopeks in Moscow.  The lender will probably choose advisers for the sale by
the end of this year and will “definitely” include U.S. banks,
Kostin said.  RTS dollar-denominated Index rose less than 0.1 percent to
1,368.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
