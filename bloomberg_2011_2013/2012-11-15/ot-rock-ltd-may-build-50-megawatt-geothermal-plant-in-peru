Hot Rock Ltd. (HRL) , a geothermal
developer, may build a 50-megawatt power plant in  Peru  within
five years, a company official said.  Hot Rock, based in Brisbane, Australia, is exploring the
Quella Apacheta property in a joint venture with the
Philippines’  Energy Development Corp. (EDC)  and the Achumani project
on its own.  Hot Rock may invest $10 million in exploration work in each
property, Peru Project Manager Adriana Lituma said. The company
will drill three wells down to depths of 1,500 meters once it
completes chemical sampling at  Achumani , she said.  “We’re looking for a partner for Achumani, which will be
easy to finance once we define resources,” Lituma said today in
an interview in  Lima . “We have very good projects which should
lead to construction of a power plant.”  Peru, which generates 52 percent of its electricity from
fossil fuels and 48 percent from hydroelectric plants, has
awarded geothermal, wind, solar, biomass and hydroelectric
concessions in the past year as its seeks to diversify its power
supply. The country’s power grid will need to grow 6 percent a
year to meet demand that may reach 10.5 gigawatts in 10 years,
according to the Energy & Mines Ministry.  Hot Rock, which is also exploring in Chile, traded
unchanged at 1.6 cents in Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
