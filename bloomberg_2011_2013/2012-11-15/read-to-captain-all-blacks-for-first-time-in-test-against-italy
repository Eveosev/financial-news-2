No. 8 Kieran Read will captain New
Zealand’s top-ranked rugby team for the first time against  Italy 
in two days as the All Blacks made 14 starting changes.  The 27-year-old Read, who’s played 45 Tests, replaces the
rested Richie McCaw as skipper for the match in  Rome , while Sam
Cane takes over McCaw’s spot at open-side flanker.  Winger Julian Savea was the only starter retained from the
world champion’s 51-22 win against Scotland in its tour opener
four days ago. Backs Ben Smith, Tamati Ellison and Israel Dagg
weren’t considered because of injuries, the New Zealand Rugby
Union said.  NEW ZEALAND: Beauden Barrett, Hosea Gear, Conrad Smith,
Ma’a Nonu, Julian Savea, Aaron Cruden, Aaron Smith, Kieran Read
(captain), Sam Cane, Liam Messam, Brodie Retallick, Ali
Williams, Charlie Faumuina, Keven Mealamu, Tony Woodcock.  Replacements: Dane Coles,  Wyatt Crockett , Ben Franks, Sam
Whitelock, Victor Vito, Tawera Kerr-Barlow, Dan Carter, Cory
Jane.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
