Brazilian investor German Efromovich, the sole bidder for Portuguese state-airline TAP SA,
is seeking Polish citizenship to comply with rules capping
outside ownership of European Union airlines at 49 percent.  “I’m currently regularizing the documentation,” Efromovich
said at a press conference in Lisbon today, adding that his
parents and grandparents were from the East European country.
“I have the right to be Polish.”  Synergy, which made the only binding offer for Lisbon-based
TAP, faces a deadline of Dec. 7 to submit a final bid for the
carrier, the Portuguese Finance Ministry said in a statement
yesterday in the country’s official government gazette.  Efromovich, who holds Brazilian and Colombian citizenship,
said Synergy would make a final offer through its Luxembourg-
based Synergy Europa unit. The company could also partner with
European investors, including Portuguese airline Euro Atlantic
Airways, in its attempt to make a purchase, he said.  “The possibility of Synergy not making a binding offer is
zero,” Efromovich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
