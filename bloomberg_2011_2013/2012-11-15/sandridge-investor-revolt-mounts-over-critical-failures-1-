SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) , the oil
producer that lost more than one-third of its market value this
year, faces rising shareholder mistrust amid calls for new
leadership and a clearer company strategy.  SandRidge ought to fire Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Tom Ward, appoint new directors and consider selling the
entire company, Mount Kellett Capital Management LP said in a
letter to the board today. Mount Kellett, holder of 4.5 percent
of SandRidge’s stock, also said a plan to sell reserves in the
Permian Basin announced by the company on Nov. 8 should be
delayed until a new management team and board are in place.  Ward, who founded the company in 2006, ought to be replaced
“with a seasoned executive who can restore the company’s
credibility,” Jonathon Fiorello, chief operating officer at New
York-based Mount Kellett, said in the letter. A slate of new
directors chosen by the Oklahoma City-based energy company’s
largest investors should be added to the board, Fiorello wrote.  Mount Kellett, a $7 billion asset manager co-founded by two
former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  bankers, is the second major
SandRidge investor in a week to call for Ward’s ouster and a
sale of the corporation.  Permian Sale  TPG-Axon Capital Management LP CEO  Dinakar Singh  demanded
Ward’s firing on Nov. 8, just hours before SandRidge announced
plans to sell oilfields in the Permian Basin, a move panned by
shareholders and analysts because it would increase the
company’s reliance on lower-profit natural gas.  Singh said on Nov. 8 that SandRidge stock should be trading
at $12 to $14. The shares rose 2.5 percent to $5.32 at the close
in New York. SandRidge has fallen 35 percent this year.  Today, Mount Kellett’s Fiorello said the shares should be
worth $20.  “Unfortunately, all we see now are critical failures of
management and board oversight,” Mount Kellett said in the
letter. “SandRidge has not merely failed to even remotely
maximize the potential of its assets but it has destroyed
stockholder value.”  In his Nov. 8 letter to SandRidge, Singh criticized the
company for overspending and having an incoherent strategy. TPG-
Axon reported it owns 6.2 percent of SandRidge, according to a
Nov. 13 filing.  Kevin R. White, a spokesman for SandRidge, didn’t return a
telephone message seeking comment.  Well Paid  Ward, 53, was paid $25.3 million in salary, bonus, stock
awards and other compensation last year, exceeding that of
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  CEO John S. Watson, who heads a company with a
market value 76 times larger than SandRidge.  Ward has defended SandRidge’s strategy, including the
Permian Basin auction. Selling the reserves will allow SandRidge
to concentrate on the Mississippian formation in Oklahoma and
 Kansas , where rates of return are higher, Ward said. Analysts
have said the Mississippian is worth less because it produces
more natural gas than the company’s Permian fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
