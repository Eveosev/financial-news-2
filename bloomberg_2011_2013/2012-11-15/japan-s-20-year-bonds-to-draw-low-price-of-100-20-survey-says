Japan ’s sale of 1.2 trillion yen
($15 billion) in 20-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted price
of 100.20, according to the median forecast of 14 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 1.7 percent
debt ranged from 100.20 to 100.15, according to the survey.
Eight traders said 100.20, and six reported 100.15.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
