China  cut gasoline and diesel prices
for the first time since July, threatening to reduce processing
margins for refiners in the world’s second-biggest oil-consuming
nation.  The maximum at which gasoline can be sold to motorists
falls by 310  yuan  ($50) a metric ton and diesel by 300 yuan
starting today, the National Development and Reform Commission
said on its website yesterday. The pump price of 90-RON, China
III gasoline in Beijing will decline 3.1 percent to 9,730 yuan a
ton, or $4.46 a U.S. gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from the NDRC. The China III specification is similar
to the Euro III fuel standard. Brent crude has dropped 6.5
percent since fuel prices were last revised Sept. 11.  The cut, which follows increases in August and September,
may hinder efforts by China’s oil companies to curb losses from
selling fuel at state-controlled prices. PetroChina Co., the
nation’s second-biggest refiner, reduced its processing loss in
the first nine months of this year by 11.5 billion yuan from the
same period in 2011 to 30 billion yuan, it said Oct. 30.  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , Asia’s biggest refiner known as
Sinopec, didn’t give a figure for its refining unit as it posted
a total third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  “Sinopec will still be able to make a profit from refining
after the price cut, though the margin will be close to its
break-even point,” Shi Yan, a Shanghai-based energy analyst at
UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone. “The price cut is within
market expectations.”  Share Prices  Sinopec fell 10 cents, or 1.3 percent, to HK$7.75 at 10:04
a.m. in Hong Kong, while PetroChina gained 0.2 percent to
HK$10.12. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng index gained 0.2
percent.  Brent crude, the benchmark price for more than half the
world’s oil, was at $107.89 a barrel, down 12 cents, on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange today. Prices have
dropped 16 percent since reaching a high this year of $128.40 on
March 1.  Gasoline and diesel costs are set by the NDRC under a
system that tracks the 22-day moving average of a basket of
crudes comprising Brent, Dubai and  Indonesia ’s Cinta. The
government may revise fuel rates when the measure changes more
than 4 percent from the last adjustment. That figure was reached
Nov. 14, the NDRC said in a separate statement yesterday.  C1 Energy reported the price cut after the Hong Kong stock
market closed and before the official announcement, citing
information from two unidentified oil companies. The Shanghai-
based commodity researcher, which has previously reported fuel-
price adjustments before the government statement, had predicted
the revision would happen Nov. 14. It may have been postponed
because of the Chinese Communist Party congress, C1 said.  The 82 million-member party that has run China since 1949
yesterday announced its fifth generation of leaders, headed by
Xi Jinping, who replaces Hu Jintao as general secretary.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
