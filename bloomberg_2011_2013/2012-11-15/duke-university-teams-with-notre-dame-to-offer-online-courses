Duke University, Brandeis University
and the University of Notre Dame are among a group of 10 U.S.
colleges that will offer Internet-based courses next year as
part of a new program called Semester Online.  Beginning in fall of 2013, undergraduate students will be
able to take online courses for credit from the consortium
through a so-called virtual classroom, according to a statement
today.  Semester Online will give students the chance to take
classes for credit at any of the universities in the group,
which also include Emory University, Northwestern University and
 Vanderbilt University . The courses will offer the same faculty
and curricula as regular classes.  U.S. colleges, including  Harvard University  and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have been teaming up to
offer online courses as they search for cost-efficient ways to
deliver education.  Coursera Inc., a company started last year by two Stanford
University professors, has contracts with 33 schools including
Stanford and Princeton University.  Semester Online will be operated by 2U Inc., an education-
technology startup. Washington University in St. Louis and the
University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, University of
Rochester and Wake Forest University are also in the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
