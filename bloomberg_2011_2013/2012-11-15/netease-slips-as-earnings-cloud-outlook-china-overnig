Chinese equities  sank for a third
day in New York, led by  NetEase Inc. (NTES)  and  E-House China Holdings
Ltd. (EJ) , as disappointing third-quarter earnings revived concerns
over the Chinese economic slowdown.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. retreated 0.5 percent to 89.17
yesterday for its longest stretch of declines since September.
NetEase tumbled to a 10-month low as third-quarter profit coming
in below the analysts’ estimates spurred at least seven to cut
the stock’s price target. Property company E-House slumped to a
record low after reducing its revenue goal and  Sina (SINA)  Corp.
dropped after markets closed as its fourth-quarter revenue
forecast fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The 39 companies in the China-US gauge that have  reported
earnings  over the past month missed their median analyst
estimate by an average 7.2 percent, while sales were short by
1.5 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A measure of 30-
day  volatility  in the index rose to a three-week high yesterday,
after  China ’s ruling Communist party named a new generation of
leaders to shepherd an economy forecast by economists to grow at
the slowest pace in more than a decade.  “Third-quarter earnings turned out to be worse than the
previous quarter in general, which is in line with the slowing
trend in the Chinese economy as well as the global economy,”
Jingyi Li, an analyst at Harding Loevner LP, which manages about
$20 billion in global assets, including emerging market
equities, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in
 New York  yesterday. “Even though China has announced a new
generation of leaders we have no idea yet what they will do for
the economy.”  ETF Declines  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slipped 0.1 percent to a one-
month low of $35.71. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined
0.2 percent after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. forecast earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates and as U.S. lawmakers prepared for
budget discussions.  American depositary receipts of NetEase, operator of
China’s second-largest online games website, tumbled 5.9 percent
to $47.31, the lowest since January.  The Beijing-based company said third-quarter net income
declined 2 percent from a year earlier to $129.2 million, or 98
cents per ADR. That missed nine analysts’ average estimate of
$1.08. The company also announced a cash dividend of $1 for each
ADR and a $100 million share repurchase in a statement dated
Nov. 14.  At least seven analysts have reduced the stock’s  price
target  following NetEase’s report. Citigroup Inc. slashed its
estimate by 7.8 percent to $56.8 while Morgan Stanley cut its
estimate to $62.6 from $68.  NetEase’s Margins  NetEase’s operating margin fell to the lowest in 10 years
as a result of more marketing activities and higher research
expenses in the quarter, Citigroup analysts led by Muzhi Li
wrote in a report yesterday. “We anticipate similar margin
trends in the fourth quarter due to both new game launches and
research and development in mobile game initiatives,” the
report said.  E-House dropped 6.6 percent to $3.42, the lowest price
since its August 2007 initial offering.  The Shanghai-based company revised down its 2012 sales
forecast to as much as $460 million yesterday, from a previous
 outlook  of $510 million on expectation that “growth in online
advertising will be softer than expected in the fourth quarter
amid challenging overall macroeconomic environment.” The mean
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for revenue
of $476 million this year.  E-House narrowed its net loss during the period to $20.1
million, from a loss of $425.6 million a year ago, it said in a
statement yesterday. Sales for the period were $136.6 million,
missing analysts’ forecast of $143.3 million.  Sina Retreats  Shares of Sina, owner of the Twitter-like Weibo service in
China, dropped as much as 11 percent to $47 in after-hours
trading as its fourth-quarter revenue forecast of as little as
$132 million, released yesterday, fell short of the $152.4
million average projection of nine analysts.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  the country’s biggest online
book seller, known as Dangdang, surged 14 percent to $4.19, the
biggest gain in five months.  Dangdang’s 20-cent loss per ADR for the third quarter was
smaller than the mean estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg of 24 cents. Sales at the Beijing-based company
increased 42 percent from a year ago to $204.9 million, more
than the $200.9 million mean forecast by 10 analysts.  Solars Slump  The company said it expects fourth-quarter sales to be $265
million in a statement yesterday, beating analysts’ projection
of $262.6 million.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  led declines in Chinese  solar makers .
Trina plunged 7.2 percent to a record low of $2.44 in a third
day of slump. Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. lost 5.3 percent
to $1.44, also the lowest on record. Suntech Power Holdings Co.
dropped 3.7 percent to 81 cents.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards on the  yuan  dropped
0.19 percent to 6.3340 a dollar in New York, retreating the most
since Oct. 18, after the currency weakened 0.13 percent to
6.2334 a dollar in  Shanghai  yesterday.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of Chinese domestic shares
slid 1.2 percent to 2,030.29, while the  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of companies traded in  Hong Kong  declined 2
percent to 10,199.6, the lowest level since Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
