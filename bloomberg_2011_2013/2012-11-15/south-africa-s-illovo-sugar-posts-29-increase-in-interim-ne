Illovo Sugar Ltd. (ILV) , Africa’s largest
sugar producer, said fiscal first-half profit rose 29 percent as
higher rainfall boosted output and as sales increased.  Net income climbed to 777.7 million rand ($87 million) in
the six months through September from 604.1 million rand a year
earlier, the Mt. Edgecombe, South Africa-based company said
today in a statement. Sugar output expanded 17 percent and sales
volumes added almost 10 percent, it said.  Harvests have recovered as heavier rains during the season
boosted yields after a drought in 2011 reduced output in South
Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga provinces.  “This pleasing performance is on the back of an
anticipated group cane-production record for the season with a
notable recovery in South  Africa  following excellent rainfall,”
Managing Director Graham Clark said in the statement.  Illovo fell 1.8 percent to 30.20 rand by the close in
Johannesburg, reversing an earlier 3.5 percent gain.  Milling has improved in South Africa, Swaziland, Malawi and
Zambia after the company invested in increasing efficiency at
its factories, Clark said in an interview. Illovo is looking to
add a project or acquisition to expand capacity and has “a
number under consideration,” he said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
