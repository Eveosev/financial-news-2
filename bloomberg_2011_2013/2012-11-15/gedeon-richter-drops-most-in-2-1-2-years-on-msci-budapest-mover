Gedeon  Richter Nyrt .,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, plunged the most in 14 months as  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) 
said it will drop the company from its Hungarian index at the
end of this month after a semi-annual  review  of the gauge’s
members.  The shares slumped as much as 8.7 percent and last traded
5.5 percent lower at 38,400 forint by the close in Budapest, the
biggest drop since September 2011. The benchmark BUX stock index
in which Richter has a 19 percent  weighting  slid 1.8 percent.  Richter was the only Hungarian stock to be removed from the
MSCI Hungary Index, effective Nov. 30, according to a statement
on MSCI’s website. Investment funds which follow MSCI indexes
will probably sell Richter shares, according to Akos Kuti, a
Budapest-based analyst at broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt.  “The exclusion will lead to selling pressure on the stock
over the next few days until the exclusion date,” Carsten Hesse, a London-based analyst at Wood & Co., wrote in a research
report today. Hesse said Richter’s deletion was a “major
surprise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
