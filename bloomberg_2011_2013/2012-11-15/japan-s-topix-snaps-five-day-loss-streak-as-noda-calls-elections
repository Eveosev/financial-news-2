Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX)  advanced the
most in two months, rebounding from a five-day slide, amid
speculation newly announced elections may put in power a party
pushing for more central bank easing and stimulus spending.  Builders  Kajima Corp. (1812)  and  Shimizu Corp. (1803)  rose more than 6
percent after Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda yesterday called for
elections that polls show the opposition party is likely to win.
 Honda Motor Co. (7267)  jumped 5.1 percent as the yen weakened, boosting
the earnings outlook for the exporter.  Sony Corp. (6758)  plunged 8.9
percent after offering its first convertible bonds in almost a
decade.  The Topix rose 2.1 percent, the most since Sept. 7, to
737.51 at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, with more than five shares
advancing for each that fell. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
gained 1.9 percent to 8,829.72. Volume on the measure was 33
percent above the 30-day average after the ruling party called
for elections on Dec. 16.  “A government led by the Liberal Democratic Party is
expected to win,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$600 million at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo.
“Investors believe that will add pressure on the Bank of Japan
to ease policy, and the government will adopt strong policies to
get the economy out of deflation.”  The Topix has fallen 21 percent since the Democratic Party
of Japan took power on Sept. 16, 2009. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of U.S. shares advanced 27 percent in the same period.  Inflation Target  Japanese shares added to gains and the yen weakened to a
six-month low after opposition leader Shinzo Abe repeated a call
for a central-bank inflation target of up to 3 percent. The Bank
of  Japan  should cut its benchmark interest rate to zero or
below, he said.  The next government will get a chance to reshape the
central bank’s leadership, with Governor Masaaki Shirakawa’s
term scheduled to end in April.  Honda Motor, a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of its
sales abroad, jumped 5.1 percent to 2,465 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest camera maker, climbed 4.6 percent to 2,549 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 80.92 per dollar today in
Tokyo, compared with 79.53 at the close of stock trading
yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 103.18
from 101.16. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  Kajima, Japan’s top construction company by revenue, soared
6.4 percent to 232 yen. Shimizu surged 7.9 percent to 245 yen,
while  Obayashi Corp. (1802)  jumped 6 percent to 369 yen.  “There’s speculation that a government led by the Liberal
Democratic Party will increase public works and investment,”
said Koji Toda, chief fund manager at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo,
which oversees about $75 billion. “That’s boosting construction
and property companies.”  Developers Gain  Mitsubishi Estate Co., the country’s biggest developer by
market value, advanced 3.3 percent to 1,612 yen. Mitsui Fudosan
Co., the second-largest, increased 4.2 percent to 1,717 yen.  Futures on the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent today. The gauge
lost 1.4 percent yesterday amid negotiations in  Washington  on a
budget agreement needed to avoid the so-called “fiscal cliff.”
More than $600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending
cuts go into effect next year if Congress can’t strike a deal to
cut debt.  Toho Zinc Co. (5707)  surged 12 percent to 287 yen, the most in the
Nikkei 225, after Mizuho Securities Co. recommended buying the
shares. The opening of a new mine will help drive a “V-shaped”
recovery in earnings, Mizuho said.  Sony lost the most in the Nikkei 225, falling 8.9 percent
to 793 yen, the lowest since 1980, the year after introducing
its Walkman. The electronics maker offered 150 billion yen ($1.9
billion) of zero-coupon convertible bonds maturing in five years
with a conversion price of 957 yen. The proceeds will be used to
fund acquisitions and expand imaging-sensor facilities, the
company said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
