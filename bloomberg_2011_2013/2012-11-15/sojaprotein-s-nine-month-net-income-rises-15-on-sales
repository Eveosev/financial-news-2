Sojaprotein AD (SJPT) , the biggest soy bean
processor in the Balkans, said its net income in the first nine
months increased 15 percent as sales expanded with higher value
products.  The Novi Becej, Serbia-based company reported the net
income of 1 billion dinars ($12.1 million), compared with 925
million dinars a year earlier, based on a 25 percent increase in
sales to 10.85 billion dinars, according to a filing to the
Belgrade Stock Exchange. Operating costs rose by 15 percent to
9.16 billion dinars, as drought led to higher soy bean prices.  The company “increased sales as well as profitability, due
to new products such as soy protein concentrates,” said Milos
Bijanic, an analyst at the Belgrade-based brokerage Sinteza
Invest Group. Sojaprotein, controlled by Victoria Group AD,
opened a concentrates production unit in the third quarter, with
annual output of as much as 70,000 tons, based on the processing
capacity of as much as 250,000 tons of soy beans a year.  Investments more than doubled Sojaprotein’s long-term
liabilities to 6.2 billion dinars, while short-term liabilities
decreased 12 percent to 2.6 billion dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
