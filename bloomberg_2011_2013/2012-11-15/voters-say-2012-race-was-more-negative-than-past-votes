Voters said the just-concluded U.S.
election was more negative and less focused on issues than
previous campaigns, and they don’t expect a change in
 Washington ’s partisan bickering, according to a poll released
today.  In the survey by the Pew Research Center, 68 percent of
voters said the political faceoff between President  Barack Obama 
and Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  was more negative than usual,
and 51 percent said there was less discussion of policy than
usual.  Advertising data underscore the campaign’s nasty tone -- 87
percent of the 1,233,522 presidential campaign commercials on
television were negative, according to New York-based Kantar
Media’s CMAG.  A 2008 poll by Washington-based Pew showed 54 percent said
that year’s presidential race between Obama and Republican  John McCain  was more negative than usual, even as 57 percent said it
was marked by a greater discussion of the issues than usual.  Voters in the new poll gave Obama a grade of C+ for his
2012 campaign, down from B+ in 2008. Romney received a grade of
C; McCain was given a C+ four years ago.  Political Cooperation  Obama was urged to work with the Republican congressional
leadership by 72 percent in the new poll, and 67 percent said
those leaders should work with the president. Still, a partisan
divide emerged on this question: 54 percent of Democrats said
Obama should work with the other party, while 50 percent of
Republicans said their leaders should stand up to the president.  Republicans retained control of the House in the Nov. 6
election, and the party, though the minority in the Senate, has
enough members to block votes by that chamber on various issues.  The Pew poll showed that 52 percent expect relations
between Democrats and Republicans in Washington to remain the
same, with 31 percent saying they anticipate improvement and 14
percent saying the situation will worsen.  An immediate conflict facing the two sides concerns Obama’s
push to extend tax cuts for the first $200,000 of annual income
for individuals and $250,000 for married couples, while allowing
rates to rise for those who make more.  If Congress doesn’t act by the end of this year, $607
billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases are
scheduled to take effect starting in January. Taxes on ordinary
income,  capital gains , dividends and estates will increase,
pushing the top  tax rate  to 39.6 percent from 35 percent.  Pew’s telephone poll of 1,206 voters was conducted Nov. 8-
11 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage
points. The subgroups of 442 Democrats and 343 Republicans have
margins of error of plus or minus 5.7 and 6.5 points,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
