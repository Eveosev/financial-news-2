Ethanol production in the U.S. fell
0.4 percent to 824,000 barrels a day last week, the lowest since
Oct. 19.  Output snapped a three week streak of gains while
 stockpiles  tumbled 1.6 percent to 17.9 million barrels, the
lowest since the week ended Dec. 23, an Energy Department report
showed today. Imports fell 1.7 percent to 59,000 barrels a day,
the agency said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 90 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, down from 92 percent in the week ended
Nov. 2, and the lowest level in four weeks.  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 0.4 cent to
$2.339 a gallon at 10:13 a.m. local time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The futures have dropped 13 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
