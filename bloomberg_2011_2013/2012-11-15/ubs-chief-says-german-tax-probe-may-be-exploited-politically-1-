German probes of  UBS AG (UBSN)  clients in
the country have the potential to be exploited politically as a
 tax treaty  with Switzerland comes to a vote, UBS Chief Executive
Officer  Sergio Ermotti  said today.  “Many of these issues have the potential to be totally
instrumentalized for political reasons,” Ermotti said at a
banking conference in Zurich. “We’re trying to resolve the
issues of the past. But we also have to realize that if you’re
the largest and the biggest, you are a target.”  The planned tax treaty, due to enter into force in 2013, is
threatened by a veto in the upper house of Germany’s parliament,
dominated by parties opposed to  Angela Merkel ’s ruling
coalition. Wrangling over the treaty has centered on provisions
for taxing assets previously hidden by Germans in Swiss bank
accounts. The opposition says proposed terms are too lenient.  So far the German states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and North
Rhine-Westphalia have said they will reject the accord in next
week’s upper-house vote.  A tax agreement with  Germany  would be a “win-win
situation” for governments, clients, banks and employees,
Ermotti said. “What you see coming out is clearly unfortunate.
We’re in the middle of the final mile of this long process.”  German authorities this week raided homes and offices of
about 100 UBS clients to examine allegations they may have
hidden money in Swiss accounts. German investigators have in
recent years bought compact discs holding account data of bank
clients with money in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, leading to
probes of thousands of potential German tax cheats.  ‘Very Committed’  Ermotti said he doesn’t want to speculate on what may
happen if Germany’s parliament rejects the agreement. “We’ll
work through whatever needs to be done,” he said. “We’ll
address the situation when we’re there.”  UBS is “very committed” to business in Germany and has no
intention of scaling it back, Ermotti said. “We shouldn’t let
these last miles and last minutes of difficulties hamper the
strategic rationale.”  As well as pursuing the treaty with Germany, which will
impose a withholding tax on funds held by Germans in
 Switzerland , the Swiss government has struck similar deals with
 Austria  and the U.K. An agreement with Italy could be reached by
the end of the year, Martin Maurer, head of the Association of
Foreign Banks in Switzerland, said on Nov. 1.  While next week’s vote is “a very important date, there is
potentially still room for other solutions,” Ermotti said,
adding that UBS fully supports the Swiss government’s strategy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
