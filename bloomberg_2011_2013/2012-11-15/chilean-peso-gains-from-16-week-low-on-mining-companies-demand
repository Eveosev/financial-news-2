Chile ’s peso climbed from a 16-week
low as mining companies bought the local currency to meet
payroll commitments.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 483.9 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Santiago. It closed yesterday at 484.78 per
dollar, the weakest since July 26, as concern that growth in
 Europe  and the U.S. is weakening further sapped demand for
emerging-market currencies.  Chile’s peso led gains today among major Latin American
currencies. The peso generally outperforms on Thursdays, when
mining companies sell dollars to obtain local currency for
paychecks. On average over the past four years, the peso has
appreciated 0.2 percent on Thursdays and weakened or remained
little changed on the other days of the week.  “The dollar has been gathering strength in response to
market noise,” said Alejandro Araya, a trader at Banco
Santander Chile in Santiago. “Today’s super-Thursday, so
there’s a chance of peso appreciation if the markets accompany
us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
