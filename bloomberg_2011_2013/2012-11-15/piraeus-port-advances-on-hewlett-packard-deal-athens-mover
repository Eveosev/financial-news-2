Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA) , the
operator of Greece’s biggest harbor, gained the most in four
years after computer maker  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  said it plans to
use the Greek port as its European hub.  Piraeus shares gained as much as 15 percent to 14.36 euros
in Athens, its biggest intraday gain in four years. It was
trading 11 percent higher at 13.90 euros by 12:35 p.m.  Hewlett-Packard plans to use the Piraeus pier run by Hong
Kong-based  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199)  to move goods manufactured in Asia
into Europe, the Athens-based Development Ministry said in a
statement late yesterday.  The deal will probably boost local cargo business by 50
percent and create hundreds of new jobs, the ministry said.
Piraeus Port, majority-owned by the Greek state, has been placed
on a list of companies that could be sold to raise cash as the
country struggles to reduce debt.  The deal with Hewlett-Packard, based in  Palo Alto ,
California, “shows that when all the prerequisites are in
place, investments will follow,” said Vassilis Kararizos,
deputy head of equities at  Proton Bank SA. (PRO)   Cosco won a contract in 2009 to run container operations at
Pier II, which started the following year, and to build Pier
III. The two facilities will have total container handling
capacity of 3.7 million 20-foot equivalent units when the third
pier is operational, scheduled for 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
