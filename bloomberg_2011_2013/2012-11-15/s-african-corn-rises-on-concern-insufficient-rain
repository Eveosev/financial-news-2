South African corn reached the
highest in more than a week on continued concern about a lack of
rain in the growing areas of North West and Free State
provinces. The rand weakened, making imports more expensive.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 1.3 percent to 2,524 rand ($289) a metric ton by
the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg, the highest since Nov. 5. The white variety
increased 1.1 percent to 2,474 rand a ton.  “The absence of rain in the main growing areas like the
western parts of North West and the Free State is a concern,”
Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based
Senwes Ltd., said by phone. “The exchange rate also plays a
very important role in pricing of grains.”  South Africa’s Free State province, which produces 40
percent of the nation’s corn, is partly cloudy and warm with
isolated thundershowers, while North West is partly cloudy and
warm with isolated showers and thundershowers today, the  South
African Weather Service  said on its website.  The rand gained 0.1 percent to 8.9144 a dollar, rebounding
from a 0.4 percent decline to a low of 8.9576 earlier in the
day.  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from white corn is one of the country’s staple foods and
the yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December also rose, by 0.5 percent to
3,710 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
