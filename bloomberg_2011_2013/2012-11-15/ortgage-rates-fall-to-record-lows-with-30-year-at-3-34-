U.S.  mortgage rates  declined to
record lows, dropping borrowing costs after applications for
refinancing rose for the first time in six weeks.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to an
all-time low of 3.34 percent in the week ended today from 3.4
percent, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a statement.
The average 15-year rate slipped to 2.65 percent, also a record,
from 2.69 percent.  Mortgage rates at record lows have made refinancing more
appealing and have helped the housing market recover by making
purchases more affordable.  Home prices  are rising, in part
because reduced  interest rates  help buyers afford more expensive
properties, said  Patrick Newport , an economist at IHS Global
Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.  Low rates “are playing an important role in stabilizing
prices,” Newport said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“They also help refinancing and it means you can manage to cut
down on your mortgage payments, and one thing you can do is
spend money. You can use that money to buy Christmas gifts.”  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  of home-loan
applications climbed 12.6 percent in the week ended Nov. 9. The
 refinancing  gauge jumped 13.1 percent, while the  purchase  gauge
rose 11 percent. Applications rebounded in East Coast states
after dropping two weeks ago when  Hurricane Sandy  hit, the
Washington-based group said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
