Amlin Plc (AML) , the second-biggest
Lloyd’s of  London  insurer by market value, said revenue rose 11
percent and said it’s “well placed” to absorb claims from
Hurricane Sandy.  Revenue in the 10 months to Oct. 31 climbed to 2.28 billion
pounds ($3.6 billion) from 2.05 billion pounds, London-based
Amlin said today in a statement.  Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York and New Jersey Oct.
29, barreling through the most populous region of the U.S. Sandy
caused as much as $50 billion in economic damage, according to
Eqecat Inc., a provider of catastrophic risk models. The storm
killed more than 100 people, displaced thousands and knocked out
power to millions.  “While the complexity surrounding  Hurricane Sandy  means
that it will take time to establish a meaningful estimate of
loss, we believe it will be readily absorbed and that it will
help continue the improvement in U.S. property insurance rates
that has been evident so far this year,” Chief Executive
Officer Charles Philipps said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
