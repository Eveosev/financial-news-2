Burundi’s coffee regulator is
planning to almost double output to 30,000 metric tons a year by
2016 by educating farmers who are turning away from the beans
about increasing demand in Asia and elsewhere.  Growers in the East African nation are abandoning coffee
for other crops and the government is organizing a campaign to
urge them to stay with the commodity, said Pascal Girukwishaka,
technical director of Arfic, as the regulator is known by its
French acronym. The country produces an average of 17,000 tons
annually, he said.  “Before, our coffee was appreciated only in countries like
the US,  France ,  Belgium , Germany,  Italy  and the U.K.,” he said
in an interview on Nov. 13. “But today,  Egypt , India, and
recently Japan, Indochina, Singapore, China and other Asian
countries are asking Burundi to deliver an important quantity of
coffee.”  One element of the four-year campaign may require every
district and all Burundians living in coffee-growing areas to
maintain a farm for the beans, Girukwishaka said. The board may
also pay bonuses for higher-quality beans while giving farmers’
fertilizer and supervision in its application, he said.  Burundi’s government has been unable to support the
campaign, so it has signed agreements with international
organizations, Girukwishaka said. He declined to name them or
specify how much the campaign will cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
