Keikichi Miyakawa says he earned
about $50,000 a month selling golf club memberships during
 Japan ’s bubble economy in the late 1980s.  Now on a pension, the 65-year-old Tokyo resident shops at
Seiyu, the discount chain owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  He
recently bought packs of bean sprouts for 29 yen (36 cents), and
croquettes for 49 yen (60 cents), sold as part of the store’s
Mainichi Kakaku Yasuku strategy. That’s the Japanese translation
of Wal-Mart’s “every day low prices” slogan.  With Japan’s economy on the cusp of a third recession since
2008 and household incomes falling for the last three years, the
country’s famously picky and brand-enamored shoppers are in a
bargain-hunting mood. Discount stores are gaining and Wal-Mart,
after years of mixed results and a 20.9 billion-yen loss for
Seiyu in 2007, is expanding for the first time since 2008.  Wal-Mart’s Japan business saw  net sales  rise 2 percent
during the second quarter. Its Seiyu unit, which it has owned
outright since 2008, will open seven new stores this year and
three more in 2013. Wal-Mart’s head of international business,
Doug McMillon, has said the company will even consider
acquisitions to increase its presence in Japan.  Low-Price Operation  Wal-Mart faces hurdles in other parts of  Asia : In China
it’s adding fewer stores than previously planned, and its
strategy in India has been stymied by regulations that until
September banned foreign companies from investing in
supermarkets.  The American retailer is far more enthusiastic about Japan
even as European rivals give up. In June, Britain’s  Tesco Plc (TSCO) 
agreed to sell its business to Japan’s  Aeon Co. (8267)  France’s
 Carrefour SA (CA)  left in 2005.  With Japanese family budgets under stress, Wal-Mart’s
“every day low-price operation is taking root,” says Takayuki
Kito, a consultant in Tokyo with Munich-based Roland Berger
Strategy Consultants.  Price Battles  By spending less on promotional fliers, Seiyu cut the
chain’s advertising expenses by 45 percent from 2008 to 2011,
according to Ryo Kanayama, an executive at Wal-Mart Japan.
“They have gotten rid of a lot of the middlemen and managed to
go more direct to consumers,” says  David Strasser , an analyst
for Janney Montgomery Scott.  Other foreign retailers such as  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB)  and
Ikea Group are also expanding in Japan. Local retailers are
catching the discounting wave, too. Supermarket chain Aeon said
in June that it will lower the price of 1,000 items, while rival
 Daiei Inc. (8263)  will reduce prices for an additional 2,000 items
beginning Nov. 17.  Seiyu has pledged to cut the price of 2,300 items by the
end of December. All this is great news for Japanese consumers.
“Our monthly budget is now 70,000 yen for the expense for food
and eating out. It was about 100,000 yen a couple of years
ago,” says Aki Yamada, a 29-year-old housewife shopping at a
Seiyu store in southern  Tokyo . “The cheaper, the better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
