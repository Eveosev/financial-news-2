The Killers return to  London  ready
to fire off an arsenal of new stadium-rock songs.  The Las Vegas band is blasting out “Battle Born,” an
album of arena-friendly anthems for mass sing-alongs and torch
waving.  The Killers, supported by  Tegan and Sara , play on Nov. 16-
17 at O2, Peninsula Sq., SE10 0DX. Information: +44-20-8463-2000
or  http://www.theo2.co.uk ,  http://www.battleborn.fm .  If you like jazz, Sonny Rollins -- the unstoppable master
of tenor sax, now in his 80s -- performs at the Barbican on
Friday night, followed on Saturday night by  Chick Corea , the
pianist-keyboardist of Sicilian-Spanish descent. There are
plenty more first-class gigs on the closing weekend of the
London Jazz Festival.  Information:  http://www.londonjazzfestival.org.uk .  Saturday  Greed is bad.  That’s the message you take away from “The Misers” (1548-
51), a painting in the  Queen’s collection  that’s been cleaned
for exhibition in “The Northern Renaissance: Durer to
Holbein.”  It pictures a couple of rich tax collectors, one jotting on
a ledger while the other wears an ugly scowl. The burning candle
above them warns that life is short and wealth is pointless.  On the opposite wall is a censored masterpiece by Peter
Bruegel the Elder, “Massacre of the Innocents” (1565-7). A
Biblical story transposed to the Spanish-occupied Netherlands,
it shows soldiers in Spanish uniform killing people. The babies
originally depicted have been replaced with animals or bundles.  At the Queen’s Gallery,  Buckingham Palace , through April
14, 2013. Information:  http://www.royalcollection.org.uk  or +44-
20-7766-7301.  Saturday Night  A bunch of country bumpkins get a little spice in their
life when their elderly relative weds a younger woman.  Yelena (Anna Friel) is beautiful and bored as she roams the
creaking estate in Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya.” Yet her passage
stirs unexpected passions, including in Uncle Vanya, whose
sister was the estate’s owner.  Vanya grits his teeth as his brother-in-law, a pompous art
historian, shows off his young wife and calls all the shots.  Chekhov’s tragicomic exposition of life’s drudgery is
bolstered by Ken Stott’s first-rate performance as Uncle Vanya.
He’s so taken by the role that, by the curtain call, his tears
have still not dried up. Friel is fine as Yelena, though she and
the rest of the cast suffer from a static staging.  “Uncle Vanya” is at the Vaudeville Theatre. Information:

oldest restaurants. It’s also one of the best if you like a
historic setting and fine, traditional cooking. There’s also a
discreet cocktail bar upstairs if you’re looking for somewhere
quiet. Information:  http://www.rules.co.uk/  or +44-20-7836-5314.  Sunday  A handsome Courbet landscape goes on sale at  Sotheby’s (BID) 
London soon for an estimated 200,000 pounds ($317,000) to
300,000 pounds. That’s a fraction of the $40.4 million paid for
a  Jackson Pollock  at Sotheby’s  New York  on Nov. 13.  Never offered before on the market, the 1864 “Le Ruisseau
de Plaisir-Fontaine” shows a dense green gorge with a stream
running through. You can see it and other highlights from the
Nov. 20 day auction of 19th-century European paintings this
weekend at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New  Bond Street , W1A 2AA.  Information:  http://www.sothebys.com .  Hakkasan Mayfair is a very good place to stop for lunch.
The luxury Chinese restaurant can be as expensive as it is
stylish. If you’re on a budget, the dim sum selection is good
value. Information:  http://www.hakkasan.com/mayfair/  or +44-20-
7907-1888.  Rock fans who have had their ears blasted by the Killers
Friday and Motorhead at  Brixton Academy  Saturday may wish to end
the weekend in mellow mood.  Rufus Wainwright  is at  HMV
Hammersmith  with his reflective ballads.  (Farah Nayeri writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
