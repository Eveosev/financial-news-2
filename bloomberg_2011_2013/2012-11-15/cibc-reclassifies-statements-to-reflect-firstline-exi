Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-biggest lender, reclassified data in its
third-quarter financial statements to reflect the company’s exit
from the FirstLine Mortgages broker business.  CIBC had revenue of C$364msg ch million ($363 million) from
FirstLine in fiscal 2011 and C$302 million for the first nine
months of fiscal 2012, the Toronto-based bank said in its
 reclassified  results. The lender said it had C$46.3 million of
FirstLine mortgages as of July 31.  CIBC reorganized its retail-banking business to shift away
from using mortgage brokers in favor of selling home loans and
other financial products through branches. The bank stopped
accepting new mortgage applications through FirstLine on July
31, and decided to close the origination business after failing
to sell the brand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
