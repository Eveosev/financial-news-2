Dole Food Co. (DOLE) , the world’s largest
producer of fresh fruit and vegetables, was accused of
misleading consumers about the environmental practices on a
contractor’s banana plantation in Guatemala.  “Dole markets and sells its bananas as though they were
farmed in an ecologically friendly and otherwise sustainable
manner,” Clayton Laderer, a California resident, said in a
complaint filed Nov. 13 in federal court in  Los Angeles .  “In fact, some of Dole’s bananas, including bananas grown
in impoverished areas of Guatemala, are produced in a way that
destroys natural ecosystems, contaminates the drinking water of
affected communities, and poisons local residents.”  Laderer said he wouldn’t have bought Dole’s bananas had the
company disclosed the alleged environmental harm caused by the
Guatemala plantation. He seeks to represent other Dole banana
buyers in a class-action lawsuit.  Marty Ordman, a spokesman for  Westlake Village , California-
based Dole, didn’t immediately return a call for comment on the
allegations.  The case is Laderer v. Dole Food, 12-9715, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
