OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, extended the longest streak of gains in a month after
third-quarter profit beat analysts’ expectations and the lender
said bad loans will expand at a slower pace in 2013.  The shares rose 1.9 percent to 4,246 forint, the highest
since Oct. 17, bringing its advance in the past four days to 4.6
percent. The benchmark BUX stock  index , in which OTP has a 30
percent weighting, fell 1 percent today.  Net income totaled 42.5 billion forint ($190 million) in
the third quarter, OTP said in a statement to the Budapest Stock
Exchange. That compares with a median estimate of a 40.7
billion-forint profit in a Bloomberg poll of eight analysts. The
bank will have “low single-digit” growth in lending next year
as bad loan provisions decline and the economies in central and
eastern  Europe  “marginally” improve, Chief Financial Officer
Laszlo Bencsik said in an interview.  “The earnings report is definitely positive and shows a
better picture than expected on all key numbers,” Zoltan Reczey, a Budapest-based analyst at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt.,
wrote in a research report. “The most important development is
the substantial slowdown in the deterioration of portfolio
quality.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
