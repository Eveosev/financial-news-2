The European Energy Exchange AG will
start publishing data on power plant outages in  Bulgaria  in the
first quarter of next year to comply with European Union
transparency rules.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest utility, and Windkraft
Simonsfeld will be the first companies to start publishing data
covering approximately 1,300 megawatts of power capacity,
Leipzig, Germany-based EEX said today in an e-mail. Earlier this
year, CEZ started publishing data on outages of its facilities
in its home market on EEX.  The EU’s Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and
Transparency, known as REMIT, limits market abuse in power and
as markets and requires companies to publish data on planned and
unplanned outages of plants generating more than 100 megawatts.  EEX publishes power plant outage data from more than 40
German, Austrian and Czech companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
