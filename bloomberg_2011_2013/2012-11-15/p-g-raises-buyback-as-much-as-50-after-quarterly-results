Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the worldâ€™s
largest consumer-products maker, increased its share buyback
plan for the year by as much as 50 percent after generating more
cash than expected in the first quarter.  The repurchase range for the year will be $4 billion to $6
billion, up from a previous forecast of $4 billion, Cincinnati-
based P&G said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald is working to reduce
costs and introduce new products to regain market share. That
helped first-quarter operating cash flow increase 28 percent to
$2.77 billion. The company bought back $2.6 billion in shares in
the quarter and  had  $5.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the
end of the period.  P&G rose 0.7 percent to $66.97 at 9:32 a.m. in  New York .
The shares fell 0.3 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
