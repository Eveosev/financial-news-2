Yields on  Japan ’s benchmark 10-year
bonds fell, matching the lowest level since July, on prospects
the nation’s elections next month will hand power to the
opposition party that advocates more aggressive monetary easing.  Longer-dated Japanese government bonds, more sensitive to
the inflation outlook, declined, pushing the  yield spread 
between 10- and 20-year securities to the widest since 1999.
Liberal Democratic Party head Shinzo Abe, leading in polls to
become prime minister in the next election, reiterated his call
for the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to continue easing until 3 percent
inflation is achieved and said the bank should cut benchmark
interest rates to zero or lower.  “Abe’s comments on negative interest rates sparked buying
of medium-term JGBs,” said Tadashi Matsukawa, who oversees the
equivalent of $1.7 billion as head of fixed-income securities at
PineBridge Investments Japan Co.  The yield on the 10-year note fell 1 1/2 basis points to
0.735 percent as of 4:25 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
rate earlier touched 0.73 percent, matching the lowest level
since July 26. Ten-year bond futures for December delivery
advanced as much as 0.19 to 144.66, the most since June 2003.  The 20-year yield added one basis point to 1.675 percent,
bringing the gap with 10-year rate to 94 basis points, the most
since 1999. The yield on 30-year notes gained two basis points
to 1.935 percent.  A sale of 20-year debt saw bids worth 3.67 times the 1.2
trillion yen ($14.8 billion) of securities on offer today,
compared with the so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.81 in the
last sale in October.  Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said yesterday he
will dissolve parliament, triggering an election that polls
indicate his ruling Democratic Party of Japan may lose. The vote
for the lower house will be held Dec. 16, acting DPJ secretary-
general Jun Azumi said last night.  To contact the reporters on this story:
