Chris Ashton returns to the starting
lineup for  England ’s Test match against  Australia  in two days at
Twickenham, the  Rugby Football Union  said in a statement.  Ashton was suspended for last week’s 54-12 win over  Fiji 
and takes over on right wing for Charlie Sharples, who switches
to the left side in place of Ugo Monye. It’s the only change
made by coach Stuart Lancaster.  Australia made four changes from the team which lost 33-6
to  France  last week in Paris.  Berrick Barnes replaces Mike Harris at fullback, Digby Ioane takes over for Pat McCabe on right wing, Sitaleki Timani
moves into the second in place of Kane Douglas and Ben Alexander
starts at tighthead prop ahead of Sekope Kapu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
