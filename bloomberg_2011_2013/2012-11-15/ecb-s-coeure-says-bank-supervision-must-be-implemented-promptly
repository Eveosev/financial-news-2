European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said a single banking supervisor for
the euro area should be set up promptly.  “The single supervisory mechanism should be promptly
implemented to restore the singleness of euro-area banks’
liabilities,” Coeure said in a speech in Budapest today. It
should then be “complemented by a unified mechanism to wind
down failed banks,” he said.  European leaders in June agreed to hand the ECB powers to
oversee all 6,000 euro-area banks as part of a so-called banking
union that would unlock joint recapitalization funds for the
region’s ailing lenders. While leaders set a start date of Jan.
1, 2013, ECB Vice President  Vitor Constancio  is pushing for more
time, saying the ECB may not operationally start to supervise
banks before 2014.  Referring to the ECB’s unlimited bond-buying program,
dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions, Coeure said it will
“ease concerns of a euro-area breakup, provided countries make
the necessary adjustments.”  “Let me be frank: in some places, trust in the euro as a
standard of value has been undermined” by fears of a breakup,
Coeure said. “Responses are now in place or taking shape.”  The OMT will not stop the ECB from fulfilling “its primary
mandate of medium-term price stability,” he said. “Medium-term
inflation expectations are very firmly anchored and the ECB can
be trusted to act decisively whenever risks to  price stability 
materialize.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
