Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760)  Chief
Executive Officer Kim Joong Kyum will resign from the country’s
monopoly power distributor today, two years before the end of
his tenure.  Kim “will work as usual until today,” according to a text
message from the Seoul-based utility, known as  Kepco . The
message didn’t give a reason for Kim’s departure and there will
be no company event for him.  Kim, 62, the former president of Hyundai Engineering &
Construction Co., followed his predecessor Kim Ssang Su, who
also quit ahead of term, in moving from the private sector to
run the state-run company. As Kepco’s CEO he sought government
approval to pass rising fuel costs to customers since he took
over on Sept. 17 last year. Kim, who was unsuccessful in his
attempts, offered to resign earlier this month.  Kepco shares have advanced 25 percent since Kim took
office, outperforming a 1.5 percent increase in  Korea ’s
benchmark Kospi index. The stock rose 1.7 percent to 27,550 won
as of 1:49 p.m. in  Seoul .  The utility,  51 percent  owned by the government, began a
search for a new CEO on Nov. 10, according to a statement on the
company’s website. A committee will shortlist candidates and
President  Lee Myung Bak  will take a final decision. The company
will hold a shareholder’s meeting on Dec. 17 to appoint a new
CEO.  Possible candidates include Cho Hwan Eik, former vice
commerce minister, and former Vice Knowledge Economy Minister
Kim Young Hak, Digital Times reported yesterday, citing
government officials it didn’t name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
