  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, said it may sell more assets than
previously planned if the government doesn’t allow it raise fuel
prices to international norms.  “There’s no projection of when the price adjustment will
happen,” Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa told reporters
at an event in  New York  today. “But the company’s policy that
we will have an average fuel price in Brazil in line with
international levels still holds.”  If Petrobras can’t adjust fuel prices until it reviews its
investment plans, one of the company’s options is to increase
divestments, Barbassa said.  Petrobras plans to generate $14.8 billion from the sale and
restructuring of assets, according to its 2012-2016 business
plan. The company is seeking to focus on the development of the
so-called pre-salt oil reserves under the Atlantic Ocean seabed.  The company said third-quarter profit slid 12 percent to
5.57 billion reais ($2.7 billion) on Oct. 26 after fuel imports
pushed up costs and crude output fell. Fuel imports curb profit
as imported gasoline and diesel prices exceed those in  Brazil .  Petrobras increased prices for gasoline and diesel by 7.8
percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, on June 25, and then
lifted diesel prices an additional 6 percent on July 12 to
reduce the discount with international prices. Still, Petrobras
sells imported fuel at a loss and strong demand from farmers
during Brazil’s harvest season increased third-quarter imports,
Jose Consenza, the head of refining at Petrobras, said Oct. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
