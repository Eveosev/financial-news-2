Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA (TL5) ,
 Spain ’s biggest commercial television station operator, predicts
the Spanish TV advertising market may start to improve in the
second half of next year.  “The ad market has been and remains very difficult this
year,” Chief Financial Officer Javier Uria said in an interview
at a conference organized by Morgan Stanley in Barcelona. “The
first half of next year will be tough, but there might be an
improvement in the second half, or at least a change in trends,
which is usually anticipated by the ad market.”  Mediaset Espana has 45.4 percent of Spain’s advertising
market and expects that figure to remain stable next year, Uria
said. “Unless you are able grab market share from smaller
stations or there’s a big sports event, which isn’t the case,”
he said.  As Spanish businesses deal with the country’s economic
crisis and overall consumption slumps, commercial television
station profits are tumbling. Mediaset Espana and  Antena 3 de
Television SA  led consolidation in the industry by merging with
channels Cuatro and La Sexta, respectively, in order to gain
market share and boost savings.  Antena 3 expects to have more than 43 percent of the
Spanish TV advertising market at the end of the year, CFO
Antonio Manso said in an interview yesterday. The value of the
market will be about 20 percent less this year than in 2011, and
may shrink 5 percent next year, he said.  The shares added 0.8 percent to 4.18 euros at 11:17 a.m. in
 Madrid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
