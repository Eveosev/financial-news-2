The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s general economic  index  decreased to minus 10.7 in
November from 5.7 a month earlier. A reading of zero is the
dividing line between expansion and contraction in the area
covering eastern  Pennsylvania , southern New Jersey and  Delaware .  Economists forecast the gauge would decline to 2, according
to the median projection in a Bloomberg survey. Estimates ranged
from minus 10 to 8.  Another report showed manufacturing in the New York region
contracted for a fourth straight month in November as superstorm
Sandy knocked out electrical power and limited activity.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  general economic 
index was minus 5.2 this month after minus 6.2 in October.
Readings of less than zero signal contraction in New York,
northern  New Jersey  and southern Connecticut.  Sandy also wreaked havoc on the job market. Applications
for jobless benefits surged by 78,000 to 439,000 in the week
ended Nov. 10, the most since April 2011, the Labor Department
said today in Washington. Several states said the increase was
due to the storm that hit the Northeastern part of the U.S. in
late October, a Labor Department spokesman said as the data were
released to the press.  The storm failed to damp sentiment. The Bloomberg Consumer
Comfort Index improved to minus 33.1 in the week ended Nov. 11
from minus 34.4 the week prior.  To contact the reporter on this story:
