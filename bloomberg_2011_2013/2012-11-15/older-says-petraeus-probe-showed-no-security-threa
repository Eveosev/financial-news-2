U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
said the Justice Department “felt very secure” that there was
no national security threat uncovered by the investigation that
led to the resignation of ex-CIA Director David Petraeus.  “We made the determination as we were going through the
matter that there was not a threat to national security,”
Holder said today at an unrelated press conference in New
Orleans.  “Had we made the determination that a threat to national
security existed, we would have, of course, made that known to
the president and to the appropriate members on Capitol Hill,”
Holder said.  The Central Intelligence Agency has started what officials
call an exploratory probe of Petraeus’s conduct while he was the
agency’s director. While the administration has said the Federal
Bureau of Investigation concluded that Petraeus didn’t
improperly share classified information, it said the CIA
inspector general and other officials routinely conduct such
internal inquiries.  “At the CIA we are constantly reviewing our performance,”
agency spokesman Preston Golson said in an e-mailed statement.
“If there are lessons to be learned from this case we’ll use
them to improve. But we’re not getting ahead of ourselves; an
investigation is exploratory and doesn’t presuppose any
particular outcome.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
