Ukrainian government officials will
meet with grain traders by the end of this month to discuss
cereal exports, the European Business Association said.  Exportable wheat volumes rose to 5.5 million metric tons
for the current marketing year begun July 1 after the
Agriculture Ministry and leading grain shippers signed an
addendum to a memorandum of understanding, the Kiev-based
association said today in an e-mailed statement. The exporters
are members of its Grain and Oilseed Committee, the group said.  “Having analyzed the current state of grain export in
terms of ensuring national food security, the parties agreed
that exportable volumes for wheat and mix of wheat and rye will
not exceed the above-mentioned level,” the association said.
“Further perspectives of grain export will be reviewed at a
joint meeting of the parties to be take place before the
beginning of December 2012.”  Ukraine’s wheat harvest fell 29 percent from a year earlier
to 16.4 million tons as of November, official statistics showed
yesterday. The government may decide to introduce temporary
limits on wheat exports by the end of this month to avoid
domestic shortages, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk
said today in an interview with the Unian news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
