day below the previous weekâ€™s average. Refineries operated at
86.0 percent of their operable capacity last week. Gasoline
production increased last week, averaging 9.1 million barrels
per day. Distillate fuel production increased slightly last
week, averaging about 4.6 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged about 7.9 million barrels per
day last week, down by 141 thousand barrels per day from the
previous week. Over the last four weeks, crude oil imports have
