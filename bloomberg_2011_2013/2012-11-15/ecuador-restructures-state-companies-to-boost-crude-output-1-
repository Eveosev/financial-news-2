PetroEcuador, the country’s state-
owned  oil company , is transferring exploration and production
assets worth about $2 billion to a unit to boost the OPEC-member
nation’s output, the chief executive officer said.  PetroEcuador will hand over assets including eight  oil
fields  in the country’s Amazon region to unit PetroAmazonas and
expects daily output to climb to about 546,000 barrels within
two years because of greater efficiencies, CEO Marco Calvopina
told reporters today in Quito, without elaborating.  President  Rafael Correa , who led Ecuador’s push to
nationalize its oil reserves in 2008, is trying to increase
crude production, which has dropped 2.1 percent since he took
office five years ago. State-owned  oil companies  account for
about 73 percent of all oil produced in the country, up from
half in January 2007, according to central bank data.  “This is a milestone in the modernization of the state oil
sector,” Calvopina said. “It will help the oil industry, which
is the foundation of the national economy, to improve
significantly for the benefit of Ecuadoreans.”  PetroEcuador will hand over operations that currently
produce about 216,000 barrels of crude and 60 million cubic feet
of natural gas a day, Calvopina said. The fields to be
transferred have reserves of 1.52 billion barrels of oil and 1.7
trillion cubic feet of gas, he said.  Ecuador  is the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
