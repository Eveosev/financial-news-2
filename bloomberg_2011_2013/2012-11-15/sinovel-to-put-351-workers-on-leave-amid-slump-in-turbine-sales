Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) , the world’s
biggest wind-turbine marker by market value, will put 351
workers on leave from Nov. 19 because of an industrywide slump
in sales.  The company will pay workers normal wages for the first 30
days of leave and then 80 percent of the Beijing minimum wage
for an indefinate period after that, Chen Zheng, a media manager
for the company, said by phone. Beijing’s mininum wage is 1,260
 yuan  ($202) per month.  The number of workers accounts for 12 percent of Sinovel’s
employees last year. The Chinese company joined Gamesa Corp.
Tecnologica SA of Spain and Denmark’s  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  to
scale back the workforce as competition gutted margins across
the industry and subsidy cuts in the U.S. and  Europe  slowed
sales.  Sinovel said in April it had 2,873 workers as of the end of
2011.  The Beijing-based company last month posted its biggest
quarterly loss since its initial public offering in January
2011. It also expects a loss this year as “macroeconomics” and
government policies curtail orders, Sinovel said Oct. 29.
Delayed payments from customers may push up financial costs and
bad-debt provisions, it said.  Gamesa said Oct. 25 that it will cut 20 percent of its
workforce, while Vestas fired 2,335 in January and reduced
manufacturing to contain widening losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
