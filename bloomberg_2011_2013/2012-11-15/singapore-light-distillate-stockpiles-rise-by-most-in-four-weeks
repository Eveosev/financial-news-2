Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed 10 percent the past week, the most in a month, according
to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate rose 933,000 barrels to 10.1 million barrels in the
seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest gain since
the week ended Oct. 17.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene dropped 362,000 barrels, or 3.2 percent, to
11 million barrels, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the
second decline in three weeks.  Residual-fuel inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen increased 324,000 barrels, or
1.5 percent, to 21.2 million, according to the data. Supplies
were the highest in three weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
