Italian 10-year bonds rose for a
third day after a report showed the nation’s economy contracted
less last quarter than analysts forecast.  Italy ’s government securities led gains in euro-area debt
even as the data indicated the nation’s fourth recession since
2001 entered its second year. Spain’s notes fell, with  two-year 
yields approaching the highest in five weeks, after a separate
report showed the country’s gross domestic product shrank for a
fifth quarter.  France ’s 10-year bonds gained after the nation
auctioned 8.8 billion euros ($11.3 billion) of securities,
including two- and five-year debt at record-low yields.  “We have seen slightly better numbers than expected in
Italy,” said Michael Markovich, head of global interest-rates
research at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “Italy has
benefited whereas the Spanish numbers were not as nice.”  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 4.90 percent at 4:41 p.m. London time,
after reaching 4.89 percent, the lowest since Nov. 7. The 5.5
percent security due in November 2022 rose 0.49, or 4.90 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 105.165. The two-year rate
declined four basis points to 2.28 percent.  Italian GDP fell 0.2 percent from the second quarter, when
it decreased a revised 0.7 percent, the National Statistics
Institute said in a preliminary report. The decline was less
than the 0.5 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of 21 economists. The Spanish economy shrank by 0.3 percent, a
separate report showed.  Budget Cuts  Europe ’s economic malaise is deepening as the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis that pushed Spanish and Italian bond
yields to record highs forces governments to impose budget cuts
to narrow their fiscal deficits. Spain and Cyprus this year
joined the list of countries seeking external aid, following
 Greece , Portugal and Ireland.  Spain’s  two-year yield  climbed one basis point to 3.25
percent after rising to 3.29 percent on Nov. 13, the highest
level since Oct. 12.  France sold 7.5 billion euros of notes maturing between
2014 and 2017 and a combined 1.3 billion euros of inflation-
linked securities due from 2016 to 2027.  The two-year securities were sold at a record-low yield of
0.1 percent, down from 0.19 percent at the previous auction on
Oct. 18. The five-year notes were sold at 0.76 percent, also an
all-time low, versus 0.92 percent in October.  French 10-year bond yields declined two basis points to
2.08 percent.  German Yields  Germany ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 1.34 percent.
It dropped to 1.31 percent on Nov. 13, matching the lowest since
Aug. 31. Two-year notes yielded minus 0.029 percent. A negative
yield means investors who hold the security until it matures
will receive less than they paid to buy it.  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by those of Greece, according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  Irish bonds were little changed after Fitch Ratings
yesterday raised its outlook on the nation’s debt to stable from
negative and affirmed its BBB+ stance on the nation. The Irish
bond maturing in October 2020 yielded 4.74 percent.  Ireland sold 500 million euros of 91-day bills at an
average yield of 0.55 percent today, with investors bidding for
4.1 times the amount of securities allotted.  Inflation Data  A report showed consumer-price inflation in the euro area
slowed in October. The annual inflation rate in the region fell
to 2.5 percent, in line with a first estimate on Oct. 31, from
2.6 percent in September, the European Union’s  statistics office 
in Luxembourg said.  The so-called 10-year German  break-even  rate, the
difference between yields on bunds and index-linked securities
used as a measure of inflation expectations, narrowed one basis
point to 1.63 percent, after reaching 1.62 percent, the least
since July 26.  German bonds returned 4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
debt rose 1.9 percent and French securities gained 9.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
