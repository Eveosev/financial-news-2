TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ,  Sweden ’s biggest
phone operator, isn’t in a rush to sell Spanish wireless carrier
Yoigo, Chief Executive Officer Lars Nyberg said.  “I don’t want to sell too cheap, so let’s see if we can
reach a position in which we have a buyer and a seller,” Nyberg
said today in an interview in  Barcelona , where he’s attending a
conference organized by Morgan Stanley. “We are not in a hurry.”  TeliaSonera, which is cutting 2,000 jobs after third-
quarter sales dropped, is also selling assets in Russia and
Kazakhstan as the Stockholm-based company copes with slowing
growth. Yoigo’s sales rose 21 percent in local currency to the
equivalent of 2.3 billion kronor ($340 million) last quarter,
defying Spain’s economic turmoil as customers switched to the
discounter.  “Spain is a difficult market and the economy is a real
problem, but actually that has helped Yoigo,” Nyberg said.
“People are more careful with money and so we get more
customers. I think this is the right time for this provided we
get the right price.”  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  France Telecom SA (FTE) , which both
already offer mobile-phone services there, were both expected to
show interest in Yoigo. Nyberg declined to comment on the
process, saying any deal may not be ready by the end of the
year. Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao said yesterday he would
explore acquisitions in Spain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
