Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , the third-
largest maker of solar panels, fell to a record low after third-
quarter sales slumped and the company reduced its shipment
forecast for 2012.  Canadian Solar declined 14 percent to $2.03 at the close in
 New York , the lowest since the shares began trading in November
2006.  The company reported today third-quarter revenue of $326
million, down 35 percent from a year earlier. The net loss was
$43.7 million, or $1.01 a share.  Canadian Solar expects to ship 1.5 gigawatts to 1.6
gigawatts of panels this year, down from an earlier forecast of
1.8 gigawatts to 2 gigawatts.  The solar company, which is based in Kitchener, Ontario,
and manufactures most of its products in China, shipped 384
megawatts in the third quarter, compared with 355 megawatts a
year earlier and 412 megawatts in the second quarter of 2012.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. and  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  were the
largest solar-panel makers based on 2011 production capacity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
