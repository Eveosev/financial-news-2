Star Atlantic Waste Holdings LP’s
$1.9 billion acquisition of a U.S. unit of  Veolia Environnement
SA (VIE)  was approved by the U.S. Justice Department on the condition
that it sell waste collection and disposal assets in two states.  In a proposed settlement filed today in federal court in
 Washington , the department said the companies must sell three
transfer stations in northern New Jersey, a landfill and two
transfer stations in central  Georgia  and three waste-collection
routes in Macon, Georgia. The settlement needs approval by a
federal judge.  “Without the divestitures required by the department,
consumers in northern New Jersey, central Georgia and the Macon
metropolitan area would have been harmed by a reduction in
competition for commercial solid waste collection or disposal,”
 Joseph Wayland , who heads the department’s antitrust division,
said in an e-mailed statement.  In a July 18 announcement of the takeover, New York-based
Star Atlantic said the purchase of Veolia ES Solid Waste Inc.
would create the largest closely held environmental services
business in the U.S.  Star Atlantic is a portfolio company of Highstar Capital,
the infrastructure-focused private equity firm once affiliated
with American International Group Inc.  The case is U.S. v. Star Atlantic Waste Holdings LP, 12-cv-
01847, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
