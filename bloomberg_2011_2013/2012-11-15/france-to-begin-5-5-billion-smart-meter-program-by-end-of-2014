France  will initiate by the end of
2014 a 4.3 billion-euro ($5.5 billion) plan to deploy 35 million
electronic power meters, the country’s energy minister said.  The announcement today by Delphine Batho comes after the
proposal, approved in 2011, was delayed over financing
difficulties, questions about consumer benefits and a dispute
between local authorities that own the grid and Electricite de
France SA’s ERDF distribution unit, which will install the
devices, said Albert Cheung, an analyst with Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  The previous French government initially planned to begin
installation next year, “but since then various factors have
stymied the project,” Cheung said in an e-mail today. “This is
the biggest smart-meter roll-out so far by a single utility
outside of  China , so the complexities are understandable.”  The decision to implement the plan came after 300,000
meters were tested in homes near Lyon and Tours in a pilot
project called “Linky.” The devices track power consumption
and are read remotely to save energy and to make repairs.  What Batho said today “confirms the new government’s
support for the program,” Cheung said. “Political will counts
for a lot in the smart-metering industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
