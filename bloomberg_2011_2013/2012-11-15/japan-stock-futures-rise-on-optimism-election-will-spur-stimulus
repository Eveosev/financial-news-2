Japanese stock futures rose,
indicating the Nikkei 225 Stock Average will extend yesterday’s
surge, amid speculation elections next month will hand power to
an opposition party that advocates more aggressive monetary
easing.  American Depositary Receipts  of Honda Motor Co. jumped 1.8
percent as the yen weakened, boosting the earnings outlook for
the exporter.  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  shares may be active after the
beverage maker formed part of a takeover bid led by Singapore’s
Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd. for Fraser & Neave Ltd. Buru
Energy Ltd. surged 5.9 percent in Sydney after the oil and gas
explorer said drilling results at its Ungani well are
encouraging.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring next
month closed at 8,875 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,820 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,860 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  fell 0.2
percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index retreated 0.1 percent in
Wellington.  “The opposition  Liberal Democratic Party  is likely to win
the upcoming election and implement more aggressive monetary and
fiscal action, including implementing negative  interest rates ,
to boost the contracting economy,” said Matthew Sherwood,
Perpetual Investment’s head of markets research in Sydney.
Perpetual manages about $25 billion.  Election Called  Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  will dissolve parliament
today, triggering an election on Dec. 16 that polls suggest his
Democratic Party of Japan will lose. Shinzo Abe, the leader of
the main opposition LDP, called yesterday for the central bank
to pursue unlimited monetary stimulus to end deflation and
revive an economy that shrank last quarter at the fastest pace
since the 2011 earthquake. The yen slumped yesterday to the
lowest level in more than six months against the dollar amid the
speculation, dropping 1.2 percent to 81.19 per dollar.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent yesterday as Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. forecast earnings that missed estimates and
lawmakers prepared for budget talks.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index gained 9.5 percent through
yesterday from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks added
stimulus to spur economic growth and data showed a slowdown in
China may be ending. The measure traded at 13.2 times estimated
earnings, compared with 13 for the S&P 500 and 11.9 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The gauge has fallen every day this week.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. retreated 0.5 percent to 89.17
yesterday in New York, its longest stretch of declines since
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
