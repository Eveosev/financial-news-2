Global sugar prices, which fell 18
percent this year, may remain “under bearish pressure” until
the end of the season that started last month because of a
rising surplus, according to the  International Sugar
Organization .  Global supplies will be 6.2 million metric tons higher than
demand in 2012-13, up from a previous forecast of 5.9 million
tons, the London-based sugar group said in a quarterly report e-
mailed today. That follows a surplus of about 7 million tons a
year earlier, according to the report. Global production will
climb to a record 177.6 million tons this season as output
expands in top producer Brazil, the ISO said.  “In 2012-13, a record high global total can be largely
attributed to a projected recovery in the world’s leading
producer,” the ISO said in the report. “World market prices
could remain under bearish pressure until the end of the current
October-to-September crop cycle.”  Global sugar consumption will be 171.4 million tons in
2012-13. That is higher than 168.1 million tons in 2011-12 and
lower that the group’s August forecast of 171.5 million tons.
Stockpiles at the end of the season will be 5.3 percent higher
than previously estimated at 66.3 million tons, the ISO
estimates. Inventories were 65.3 million tons in 2011-12.  “Assuming that most of the projected trade surplus well in
excess of 5 million tons is added to stocks at the end of the
season, the stocks-to-consumption ratio would rise above 40
percent,” the ISO said. “The period of low stocks environment,
one of the main market characteristics for four seasons from
2008-09 to 2011-12, is likely to be over.”  Sugar output in  Brazil  will climb to 38.5 million tons in
the 2013-14 season that starts there in April, the group
forecast. That compares with 36.1 million tons a year earlier.
The sugar-cane crop will be 617 million tons, “in line with the
previous record output of two years ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
