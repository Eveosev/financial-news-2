Woolworths Holdings Ltd. (WHL) , a South
African food and clothing retailer, rose by the most in a week
after saying sales increased 16 percent in the 20 weeks through
Nov. 11 compared with the same period a year ago.  The shares gained as much as 2 percent, the most on an
intraday basis since Nov. 8, and traded 1.6 percent higher at
70.91 rand at 10:15 a.m. in Johannesburg. The stock has gained
75 percent over the past 12 months.  Clothing sales in  South Africa  rose 14 percent while food
sales gained 11 percent, the Cape Town-based company said today
in a stock exchange filing.  The company’s revenue in Australia and New Zealand surged
37 percent in Australian dollar terms, boosted by its takeover
of the Witchery Group fashion retailer from Sept. 30.  Woolworths expects to release first-half results about Feb.
14. The retailer isn’t related to London-based Woolworths Group
Plc, which collapsed in 2008, or Woolworths Ltd., located in
Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
