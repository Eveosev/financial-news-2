(Corrects GDP forecast for 2013, 2014, number of
economists in second paragraph, 2014 inflation in final.)  Switzerland ’s economic growth will
slow more than expected this year before expanding less than
previously forecast in 2013 and 2014, according to economists in
a Bloomberg survey.  Gross domestic product is seen rising 0.9 percent this
year, 1.1 percent in 2013 and 1.6 percent in 2014, according to
the median forecast of 21 analysts in Bloomberg’s quarterly
survey on the Swiss economy, which was carried out Nov. 9-14. In
an August survey, economists saw GDP growing 1.3 percent in
2012, 1.5 percent next year and 1.8 percent in 2014.  Switzerland’s export-led economy, which expanded 1.9
percent in 2011, is cooling as the euro area’s fiscal crisis and
waning global growth erode demand, forcing companies to lower
costs. GDP unexpectedly declined in the three months through
June and Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said on Nov. 6
that “growth in the third quarter probably disappointed.”  In the survey, the economists forecast GDP rose 0.2 percent
in the three months through September, unchanged from the
previous survey. The Swiss government will release third-quarter
GDP on Nov. 29.  Consumer prices, which have fallen on an annual basis for
the past 13 months, are forecast to decline 0.6 percent this
year, more than the 0.5 percent decrease predicted in August,
according to the survey. Inflation will probably average 0.5
percent in 2013 and 0.9 percent in 2014, the economists said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
