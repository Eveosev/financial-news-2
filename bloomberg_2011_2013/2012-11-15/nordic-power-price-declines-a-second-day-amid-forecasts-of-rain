Nordic electricity for delivery in
January through March declined a second day as forecasts of
increasing rainfall indicated more water for hydropower
production.  The latest  weather forecasts  are wetter than yesterday’s,
and show a 1.8 percent increase in surplus hydropower assets
compared with the seasonal average during the next two weeks to
9.6 terawatt-hours, Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg show.  Electricity for delivery in the next quarter lost 0.4
percent to 40.70 euros ($51.97) a megawatt-hour as of 3:11 p.m
on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. Power for
December lost 0.9 percent to 38.65 euros, while the contract for
2013 dropped 0.3 percent to 37.30 euros.  The Nordic region meets more than half its power needs by
running  water through turbines , which is why rain affects
electricity prices.  Estonian state-owned utility Eesti Energia AS will become a
market maker when the Nasdaq OMX Group starts offering contracts
for difference in the Baltic country on Nov. 26, the exchange
said in an e-mailed statement today. The contracts are used as
insurance against differences in regional price and the average
Nordic price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
