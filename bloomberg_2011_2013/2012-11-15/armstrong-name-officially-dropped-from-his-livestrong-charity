Lance Armstrong , who was stripped of
his seven  Tour de France  titles because of a doping scandal, has
had his name deleted from the cancer-fighting charity he founded
15 years ago.  The charity’s official name has been changed from the Lance
Armstrong Foundation to the Livestrong Foundation.  “For many years, our organization has been known primarily
for its powerful brand, Livestrong,” Katherine McLane, vice
president of communications and external affairs, said in an e-
mail. “The organization formalized that change on Oct. 30.”  Armstrong resigned from the board of the foundation Nov. 4,
three weeks after he stepped down as the group’s chairman. He
began the charity, which is based in Austin,  Texas , to raise
money for  cancer research  after surviving testicular cancer.  Armstrong refused to fight charges by the U.S. Anti-Doping
Agency that he used banned substances throughout his cycling
career. USADA released a 202-page summary Oct. 11 that said the
cyclist forced teammates to engage in doping under the threat of
dismissal from his squad.  Armstrong used the banned drugs erythropoietin, or EPO, and
testosterone, according to Colorado Springs, Colorado-based
USADA, and provided EPO to teammates and administered
testosterone on at least one occasion. Armstrong transfused
blood in every Tour de  France  from 2001 through 2005, his former
teammate George Hincapie told USADA. He won all those races.  To contact the reporter on this story:
