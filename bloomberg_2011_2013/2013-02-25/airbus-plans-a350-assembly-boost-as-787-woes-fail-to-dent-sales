Airbus SAS (EAD)  said it’s looking to add
another assembly line for the new  A350  wide-body jet, a
competitor to  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s troubled 787 Dreamliner, to meet
rising demand for the plane’s largest version.  With more than 600 orders placed for the A350, due for its
first flight this summer before deliveries begin in the second
half of 2014, Airbus is looking at adding capacity for the -1000
variant, Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said.  “I would like to believe that sometime this year we’ll be
able to make a decision to do that,” Leahy said yesterday in an
interview in Singapore. Production of the baseline A350-900
began in October, with the smaller -800 due to enter service in
2016 followed by the -1000 in 2017.  Airlines’ quest to cut fuel bills will keep driving sales
of more-efficient models such as the A350 and the Dreamliner,
said Leahy, who predicted that Boeing will find a fix for the
787’s battery faults. Airbus said Feb. 15 it would revert to
traditional batteries on the A350, dropping the lighter lithium-
ion cells tied to the 787’s grounding, to help stay on schedule.  “It’s unfortunate that these things happen but safety is
the most important thing,” Leahy said. “When incidents happen
like what they had with the battery we have to put the fleet on
ground till you get it fixed. We’re talking about going back to
a proven nickel cadmium battery technology that would be about
60 kilograms heavier. Why take a risk for 60 kilograms?”  Stronger Sales  Boeing is offering a battery redesign for the 787 to answer
safety concerns after the jet’s grounding on Jan. 16 as a result
of incidents in which  lithium batteries  smoldered and emitted
smoke, people with knowledge of the plan said. The U.S.  Federal
Aviation Administration  is reviewing the proposed redesign.  Leahy, who is also Airbus’s chief salesman, said the A350
has been “very popular” in the  Asia . Chief Executive Officer
Fabrice Bregier said Oct. 23 he was confident Airbus could sell
70 or 80 -1000 variants a year as customers upgrade to bigger
jets, compared with a previous planning assumption of 40 or 50.  The 350-seat -1000, which has a list price of $332 million,
broke a four-year sales drought on July 11 as Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd. of  Hong Kong  placed an order for 10 aircraft. The
model has accrued 105 firm commitments in total.  Toulouse, France-based Airbus is also in talks with several
airlines regarding further sales of the A380, Leahy said
yesterday, reiterating the company’s target of securing 25 new
orders for the superjumbo this year.  “I would like to believe that almost everyone who has it
will place orders for more because it’s a very cost-effective
airplane,” he said. “We also see some new customers. One of
the reasons why you will see new customers is that airlines are
discovering that it takes an A380 to compete with an A380.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
