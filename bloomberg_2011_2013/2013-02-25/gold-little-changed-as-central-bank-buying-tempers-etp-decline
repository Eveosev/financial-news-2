Gold climbed the most in three weeks
as the central banks of Russia and Kazakhstan increased bullion
reserves last month.  The countries expanded their gold reserves for a fourth
straight month in January, data on the International Monetary
Fund’s website show. Buying out of  China  was “impressive” last
week and is continuing, Joni Teves, an analyst at UBS AG in
London, wrote today in a report.  “Central bank buying remains a feature and is providing
some support,” Steve Scacalossi, a New York-based vice
president at TD Securities Inc., said in an e-mail. “We are
also hearing of strong Chinese demand at lower levels.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.9 percent to settle
at $1,586.60 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since Jan. 30.  Bullion retreated in the previous three weeks as global
economic concerns eased and minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting
showed some policy makers said the central bank should be ready
to vary the pace of its monthly bond purchases.  Hedge funds and other money managers cut their gold  net-
long position , or bets on higher prices, by 40 percent to 42,318
futures and options in the week to Feb. 19, the lowest since
2008, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  Silver futures for May delivery increased 1.8 percent to
$29.047 an ounce in New York. Futures trading volume was 75
percent more than the average in the past 100 days for this time
of day.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for April
delivery gained 0.8 percent to $1,620.70 an ounce, the first
advance in four sessions.  Palladium for March delivery jumped 1.9 percent to $749.05
an ounce, the biggest gain in four weeks. Futures trading volume
was more than triple the average in the past 100 days for this
time of day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
