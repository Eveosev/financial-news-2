Mexico’s peso advanced amid signs
President Enrique Pena Nieto is moving toward passing
legislation to bolster economic growth.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 12.6966 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:36 a.m. in Mexico City, extending its rally this year to 1.2
percent. The peso climbed 8.4 percent in 2012.  “The political operation has been very strong, and the
party remains united,” said  Eduardo Suarez , a currency
strategist at Bank of  Nova Scotia  in Toronto. “The president is
strong within his party and willing to move forward.”  Local representatives of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party have agreed to bylaws changes to allow Pena
Nieto to expand items covered by the nation’s value-added tax,
Martin Takagui, a PRI deputy secretary for state relations, said
by phone on Feb. 23. The party will consider final approval of
the changes next month, Takagui said. Boosting tax collection is
part of the president’s reform agenda that also includes opening
the state-controlled oil industry to more private investment.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 were little changed at
5.06 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
