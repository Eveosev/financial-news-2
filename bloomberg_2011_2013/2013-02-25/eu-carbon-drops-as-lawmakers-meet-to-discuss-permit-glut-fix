Carbon permits had their biggest
one-day drop in a month after the chairman of the European
Union’s environment panel abandoned seeking fast-track talks on
a plan to reduce a surplus of allowances.  EU carbon for December declined 12 percent to close at 4.57
euros ($6.02) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the biggest decline since Jan. 23. February United
Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits were unchanged at
14 euro cents a ton.  The EU contracts have surged 63 percent from a record-low
2.81 euros on Jan. 24 as politicians debate a European
Commission proposal to support prices by holding back 900
million tons of new permits in a strategy known as backloading.  The European Parliament’s environment committee backed a
version of the proposed law change on Feb. 19. The panel’s
Chairman Matthias Groote said today that he won’t pursue talks
with  member states  on the measure before a plenary session of
parliament votes on it in April, delaying any implementation.  “We will vote in plenary,” Groote said in a text message.
“I’ll stick to the timetable and we will get backloading.”  The delay probably means carbon will drop below 4 euros a
ton, according to Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst in London for
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
