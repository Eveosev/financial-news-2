Sugar climbed to the highest level
in almost two weeks in New York as investors bought the futures
after bets on lower prices reached a record just as port strikes
in top-grower  Brazil  threaten to delay shipments. Coffee
advanced.  Large and small speculators excluding index funds were net-
short, or betting on lower prices, by about 103,000 contracts in
the week ended Feb. 19, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Dock workers in
Brazil are considering a strike that would disrupt commodity
shipments. A record 192 vessels were waiting to load 10.8
million metric tons of soybeans, corn, wheat and rice at the end
of last week, compared with 90 ships waiting to load 4.1 million
tons a year earlier, according to SA Commodities in Santos,
Brazil.  “Speculators are net short over 100,000 lots, which is
massive,” Julien Benichou, an agriculture derivatives broker at
Starsupply Renewables SA in Nyon, Switzerland, said today by e-
mail. “We think we can test the 18.45 cents to 18.65 cents if
we have a big short-covering rally. On top of that grains
logistical delay and potential strikes are not helping.”  Raw sugar for May delivery gained 1.6 percent to 18.43
cents a pound by 6:01 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching 18.44 cents a pound, the highest since Feb. 12.
Trading volume was more than double the average of the past 100
days for this time of the day, according to figures compiled by
Bloomberg. White sugar for May delivery advanced 1.1 percent to
$510.80 a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Brazil’s government is weighing a proposed port investment
bill to avert a strike that could hurt trade in Latin America’s
largest economy, Ports Minister Leonidas Cristino said last
week. Union leaders agreed to cancel a second six-hour stoppage
scheduled for tomorrow and a meeting was slated for March 1,
Cristino said.  Price Difference  Raw sugar for March delivery was 0.05 cent a pound more
expensive than the sweetener for May. The price difference
between the two futures contracts is down from 0.26 cent a pound
on Feb. 19, data on Bloomberg showed. The March futures expire
on Feb. 28 and ICE will announce the delivery on March 1.  Cocoa for delivery in May fell 0.2 percent to $2,134 a ton
in New York. Cocoa for delivery in March gained 0.5 percent to
1,431 pounds ($2,168) a ton in London.  Arabica coffee for delivery in May rose 0.4 percent to
$1.4435 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in May
climbed 0.3 percent to $2,094 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
