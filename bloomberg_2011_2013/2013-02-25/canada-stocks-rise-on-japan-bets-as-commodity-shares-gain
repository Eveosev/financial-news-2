Canadian  stocks  fell, reversing
earlier gains in the final hour of trading, as partial voting
results spurred concern about prospects for a stable government
in Italy and a worsening of Europe’s debt crisis.  Royal Bank of Canada , the nation’s largest lender, slumped
1 percent and Manulife Financial Corp., the largest insurer,
tumbled 2.1 percent.  Suncor (SU)  Energy Inc. lost 1.8 percent as
crude slipped.  Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN)  slid 2.8 percent after
reaching an agreement with Petaquilla Minerals Ltd. over their
Panamanian mines. Eldorado Gold Corp. added 6.3 percent and
Goldcorp Inc. climbed 1.3 percent.  Cineplex Inc. (CGX)  rose 1 percent
after analysts predicted it would hit record highs.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 50.76
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,650.87 in Toronto, erasing earlier
gains of as much as 1 percent. The benchmark gauge is up 1.8
percent in 2013. Trading on Canadian exchanges was 3.5 percent
higher than the 30-day average today.  “No matter what people say they’re looking over their
shoulders at the Dow and I was surprised the Canadian market
hung in as long as it did before people lost their nerve,”
 David Cockfield , managing director and  fund manager  with
Northland Wealth Management, said from Toronto. His firm manages
about C$200 million ($195 million). “We haven’t worried about
Europe for a while, so it’s about time. The fact Berlusconi is
making a big comeback just discourages everybody.”  Italy Vote  Italy may require another vote after the four-way race that
ended today was poised to result in a divided parliament.
Forecasts by IPR Marketing and state broadcaster RAI showed Pier Luigi Bersani winning the lower chamber and  Silvio Berlusconi ,
former prime minister of Italy, with a blocking minority in the
Senate. Bersani, who led in opinion polls throughout the two-
month race, campaigned to maintain the
budget rigor of outgoing Prime Minister  Mario Monti .  Banks fell 0.6 percent as a  group  in the S&P/TSX, erasing
earlier gains of as much as 1.2 percent. Royal Bank dropped 67
Canadian cents to C$63.59 and  National Bank of Canada  declined 1
percent to C$77.30. Manulife dropped 31 Canadian cents to
C$14.84, its lowest close since Feb. 8.  Financial companies are scheduled to begin reporting
earnings tomorrow, including results from Bank of Montreal,
followed by  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , Toronto-Dominion and National
Bank of  Canada  on Feb. 27.  Suncor, Canada’s largest energy company by market value,
lost 58 Canadian cents to C$31.37 and Cenovus Energy Inc.
slipped 1.2 percent to C$32.40. Crude for April delivery slumped
1 percent to $92.18 a barrel in electronic trading at 5:18 p.m.
in  New York , the lowest level since Dec. 28.  Panamanian Mines  Inmet fell C$1.89 to C$65.52. The developer of the $6.2
billion Cobre Panama copper project said it agreed with
Petaquilla to settle certain claims relating to their adjacent
Panamanian projects. Inmet will purchase from Petaquilla as much
as $100 million a year of aggregates over three years for use at
Cobre Panama, the companies said in a statement.  Petaquilla gained 2 percent to 51 Canadian cents.  Eldorado jumped 62 Canadian cents to C$10.42 and Goldcorp
added 42 Canadian cents to C$33.64.  The  S&P/TSX Gold index  climbed 2.4 percent, its biggest
gain since Jan. 10, as 29 of 31 members advanced. Gold futures
for April delivery rose 0.9 percent, the most in three weeks, to
settle at $1,586.60 an ounce in New York as  Russia  and
Kazakhstan’s central banks increased bullion reserves last
month.  Cineplex rose 34 Canadian cents to C$33.44. The operator of
70 percent of Canadian movie theaters is forecast by analysts to
advance beyond a record as acquisitions and the addition of in-
seat liquor service increases revenue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
