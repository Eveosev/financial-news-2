Wheat prices in  Russia , the world’s
third-biggest  wheat exporter  in 2011-12, fell last week as the
state sold grain from stockpiles and farmers prepared for the
spring sowing campaign, according to the country’s  Grain
Producers Union .  Third-grain milling wheat dropped as much as 6.5 percent to
11,500 rubles ($379) a metric ton in the Southern and North
Caucasus federal districts, the biggest declines among wheat
varieties across the country. The grade fell as much as 2.5
percent in the prior week, according to the union’s data.  Russia sold more than 1.9 million tons of grains from state
inventories from Oct. 23, when sales began, through Feb. 20,
according to National Mercantile Exchange  data . That included
about 1.6 million tons of third-grade milling wheat, the data
showed. Total stockpiles, including state holdings, were almost
30 percent lower at 22.6 million tons as of Feb. 1 compared with
a year earlier, according to state statistics data.  Farmers accelerated sales because they need funds for
seeds, fertilizer and fuel before the spring sowing campaign,
which also pushed prices down last week, the union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
