Illinois  plans to sell a postponed
$500 million general-obligation issue after Governor Pat Quinn
releases his fiscal 2014 budget proposal next week.  Illinois may bring back the bond sale, which will price
through competitive bid, as soon as late March to raise cash for
construction, John Sinsheimer, the state’s director of capital
markets, said in a telephone interview. Quinn, a Democrat, is
set to deliver his budget address March 6.  “No date has been set at this point, but we do want to
come back to market as quickly as we can after the budget
speech,” Sinsheimer said of the planned sale.  The state Jan. 30 pushed off the deal after Standard &
Poor’s cut Illinois’s rating to A-, its seventh-highest grade,
and threatened to lower the mark further. The company cited the
state’s $9 billion of unpaid bills and lawmakers’ “poor track
record” on repairing a pension deficit. S&P rates Illinois the
lowest among U.S. states.  Illinois’s retirement system is the worst-funded in the
U.S. It has 39 percent of assets needed to meet projected
obligations for five major groups of public employees, according
to the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based nonprofit research
group.  Illinois general-obligation bonds maturing in August 2019
traded Feb. 22 with an average yield of 2.52 percent, or 1.38
percentage points above benchmark municipals, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That yield difference was 1.28 percentage points
Jan. 24, one day before the S&P rating cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
