New World Resources Plc (NWR) , a supplier
of coal to ArcelorMittal, said it will seek to appoint a woman
to its all-male board this year.  “We are in the process of addressing that at the moment;
it’s a priority for me,” Chairman Gareth Penny said in an
interview. “Within the course of this year I would like to see
at least one woman on our board.”  Mining lags behind every other industry, including oil and
gas, in terms of gender diversity, with women occupying just 5
percent of board positions. Of the seven companies in the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 Index with all-male boards, five are miners.  NWR, a London-listed coal producer operating in central
 Europe , has a 13-member board. The government of U.K. Prime
Minister  David Cameron , which has urged companies to do more to
promote women to board level, has ruled out imposing quotas. A
2011 report by former banker  Mervyn Davies  called for a target
of 25 percent female representation at the biggest businesses.  “It’s something that we are very conscious of,” Penny
said Feb. 22. The chairman, who joined NWR in October, is a
former chief executive officer of diamond producer  De Beers .  Mixed boards can lead to better performance, according to a
2012 report by Credit Suisse Group AG. In the past six years,
companies with a market value of more than $10 billion, with at
least one woman on the board, outperformed those with all-male
boards in terms of share-price performance, the report showed.
They also had a higher return on equity, lower gearing and
better average growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
