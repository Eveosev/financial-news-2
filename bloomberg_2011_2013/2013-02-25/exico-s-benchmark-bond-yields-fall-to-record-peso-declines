Mexico ’s benchmark peso bond yields
fell to record lows as traders solidified bets that the Latin
American country’s policy makers will cut  benchmark  borrowing
costs for the first time in three years.  Yields on local-currency bonds due in 2024 declined less
than 0.01 percentage point, to 5.056 percent, the lowest yield
on a closing basis since the debt was issued in 2005. The price
on the debt rose 0.03 centavo to 143.90 centavos per peso at 4
p.m. in Mexico City. The peso declined 0.7 percent to 12.7992
per  U.S. dollar .  Interbank futures contracts show that traders are betting
central bank board members led by Governor Agustin Carstens will
probably announce a cut to the 4.5 percent benchmark rate after
their next meeting on March 8. Mounting speculation for a rate
cut since inflation peaked in September has spurred inflows from
global investors who are seeking to benefit from a bond rally.  “A rate cut is already discounted,” Jose Carreno, a bond
trader at Banco Base SA, said in a phone interview from San
Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico. “Now it’s just confirming this
movement.”  Banco de Mexico  reiterated on Feb. 13 it may cut the target
rate after inflation in January slowed to 3.25 percent, the
lowest since October 2011.  Foreign investment in the $147 billion market for fixed-
rate peso bonds, known as Mbonos, was 54.7 percent on Feb. 14,
compared with 44 percent a year earlier, according to the most
recent data from the  central bank .  The central bank said today in a report that portfolio
investment rose to $73.4 billion last year from $45.9 billion in
2011.  Most of the 25 major emerging market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg declined today. The peso reversed an earlier drop,
following U.S. stocks lower, as partial election results spurred
concern about prospects for a stable government in  Italy  and a
worsening of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
