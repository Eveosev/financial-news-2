The Oklahoma City Thunder signed
five-time National Basketball Association champion  Derek Fisher ,
General Manager Sam Presti announced today in an e-mailed
release.  Presti didn’t disclose financial terms or the length of the
deal. Yahoo! reported that the contract will last the remainder
of the season, without giving financial details.  Fisher, 38, hasn’t played an NBA game since his release by
the Dallas Mavericks in December. He played in 40 games for the
Thunder last season, including the team’s run to the NBA Finals.  President of the NBA players union, Fisher called last year
for an investigation of the organization’s business and hiring
practices, which led to the firing of Executive Director  Billy Hunter  this month. Fisher retained his title under the National
Basketball Players Association’s new executive committee after
some players, including Jerry Stackhouse of the Brooklyn Nets,
said he should also be replaced.  A member of five title-winning teams with the  Los Angeles
Lakers , Fisher has averaged 8.6 points and 2.5 assists in 229
playoff games.  The Thunder are 41-15, the second-best record in the
Western Conference, behind the San Antonio Spurs (45-13).  To contact the reporter on this story:
