Tom Brady  agreed on a three-year
contract extension that will save the New England Patriots about
$15 million against the National Football League’s salary cap
over the next two years, Sports Illustrated reported.  Brady agreed on a deal worth $27 million, less than half
the market worth of the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player and
three-time Super Bowl winner,  the magazine said  on its website,
citing a person in the league it didn’t identify.  The extension keeps Brady under contract through the 2017
season, when he’ll be 40 years old, and gives the Patriots
additional payroll flexibility as they seek to re-sign free
agents such as wide receiver  Wes Welker , cornerback Aqib Talib
and offensive tackle Sebastian Vollmer.  Brady will receive a $3 million signing bonus, with
salaries of $7 million in 2015, $8 million in 2016 and $9
million in 2017, according to SI.com.  Patriots spokesman Stacey James declined to comment on the
report in an e-mail.  While Brady ranks 28th on Forbes’ list of the top-earning
athletes, his wife,  Gisele Bundchen , is the highest-paid model
in the world and made $45 million last year, according to the
magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
