Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  agreed to buy
the Tulsa World newspaper from the Lorton family as billionaire
 Warren Buffett ’s company extends its bet on print journalism.  The Oklahoma paper has a daily circulation of about 95,000
and 133,000 on Sundays, according to an e-mailed statement today
from Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire.  Buffett, 82, has been expanding Berkshire’s media operations
as he wagers that publications focused on local communities can
withstand the shift of readers and advertisers to the Internet.
The billionaire’s firm bought the publisher of his hometown
paper, the Omaha World-Herald Co., in 2011, and acquired 63 daily
and weekly newspapers from Media General Inc. for about $140
million last year.  “The newspaper business has become a difficult business
model within a changing society and in particular for local
family-owned newspapers,” Robert E. Lorton Jr., chairman of
World Publishing Co., said in the statement. Berkshire “presents
the best opportunity to continue a local paper that will serve
this community, our friends and neighbors.”  The Lorton family has been affiliated with the Tulsa World
for more than a century, according to the statement. The deal is
expected to be completed next month according to the statement,
which didn’t disclose terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
