Italy ’s borrowing costs rose at an
auction of zero-coupon bonds today as investors await the
outcome of an election that may produce a fragmented parliament.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 2.82 billion euros ($3.73
billion) of two-year zero-coupon bonds, near the 3 billion-euro
maximum target, to yield 1.682 percent, up from 1.434 percent at
the last auction of the same securities on Jan. 28. Investors
bid for 1.65 times the amount offered, compared with 1.45 last
month.  Final polls published before a ban kicked in Feb. 9 showed
Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani’s lead over media-
magnate and former premier  Silvio Berlusconi  had narrowed to
about 6 percentage points. While Bersani’s center-left bloc is
expected to win a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, he may
fall short of seats in the Senate and may be forced to seek an
alliance with Prime Minister  Mario Monti .  Berlusconi’s gains in the polls have added uncertainty to
the country’s elections and rattled investors, pushing the yield
on Italy’s benchmark 10-year bond up by 32 basis points from a
two-year low of 4.124 percent on Jan. 25. Investors are
concerned that a new unstable government might not be able to
carry on the reforms of outgoing premier Monti, who faced a
euro-era record yield of 7.261 percent when he took office in
November 2011.  Italy also sold 941 million euros of 2.1 percent inflation-
linked 2021 bonds and 309 million euros of 3.1 percent
inflation-linked bonds due in 2026. The 2021 bond was priced to
yield 2.79 percent while the 2026 bond was sold at a yield of
3.23 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
