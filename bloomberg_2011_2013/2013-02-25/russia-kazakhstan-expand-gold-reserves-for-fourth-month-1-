Russia and  Kazakhstan  expanded  gold
reserves  for a fourth straight month in January, while
Azerbaijan acquired bullion for the first time in more than
three years, as central banks sought to diversify their assets.  Russian holdings climbed 12.2 metric tons to 970 tons last
month after gaining 8.5 percent over 2012, according to
International Monetary Fund data. Kazakhstan’s hoard grew 1.5
tons to 116.8 tons, following last year’s 41 percent expansion,
data on the IMF website showed. Azerbaijan’s holdings rose 1
ton, the first gain since May 2009, when it held 64 ounces.  Gold fell for a fourth month in January, with analysts from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Credit Suisse Group AG calling an
end to the metal’s 12-year bull run as data showed the global
economy improving. Gold slumped to a seven-month low last week
as investors cut holdings in  exchange-traded products . Central
banks will again be strong buyers this year after they boosted
purchases 17 percent to 534.6 tons last year, the most since
1964, according to the London-based World Gold Council.  “Central-bank buying remains one of the bullish factors
for gold,” Jiang Yangjing, an analyst at China International
Capital Corp., said by phone from Beijing. “Prices at the
moment are driven largely by macroeconomic data.”  Federal Reserve  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,593.45 an ounce at
11:49 a.m. in  London , down 4.9 percent this year. The price
dropped to $1,555.55 on Feb. 21, the lowest since July 12, as
some U.S.  Federal Reserve  policy makers advocated more
flexibility in economic stimulus. A fifth straight monthly loss
in February would be the worst run since 1997.  Azerbaijan held 218 ounces in February 2001 and reported no
holdings from March that year to April 2009, the IMF data show.  Turkey ’s holdings, which rose 10.3 tons last month, jumped
84 percent in 2012 as it accepted gold in its  reserve
requirements  from commercial banks. Belarus’s reserves expanded
0.5 ton in January, while Tajikistan acquired 0.1 ton the same
month, according to the IMF data, which are updated as countries
report. Serbia bought 0.3 ton in December, and  Venezuela  added
1.9 tons in November, the data showed.  Billionaire investors  George Soros  and Louis Moore Bacon
cut their stakes in gold ETPs in the last quarter of 2012, while
 John Paulson  maintained his share, filings showed this month.
Total investor holdings in ETPs stood at 2,560.097 tons on Feb.
22, down 2.8 percent from a record reached on Dec. 20.  An “inevitable unwind of the 12-year gold bull market has
begun,” Ric Deverell and  Tom Kendall , analysts at Credit
Suisse, wrote in a Feb. 21 report. Gold will probably peak in
2013 and keep declining the following year as U.S. growth
accelerates, Goldman Sachs said in a report on Dec. 5.
Immediate-delivery metal reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce in
September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
