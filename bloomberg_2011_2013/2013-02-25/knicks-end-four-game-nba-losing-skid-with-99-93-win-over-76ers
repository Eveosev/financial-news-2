The New York Knicks ended a season-
high four-game losing streak with a 99-93 win over the
Philadelphia 76ers, who dropped their fifth National Basketball
Association game in a row.  Carmelo Anthony scored 29 points for the Knicks, who opened
a 17-point first-half advantage and cruised to victory yesterday
at Madison Square Garden in New York.  Amar’e Stoudemire added a season-best 22 points for the
Knicks (33-20), who extended their division lead over the
Brooklyn Nets to two games.  The Nets (33-24) were beaten 76-72 at home by a Memphis
Grizzlies team that’s won seven in a row to improve to 37-18,
the fourth-best record in the Western Conference. Zach Randolph
had 16 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Grizzlies yesterday.  Kobe Bryant became the fifth player in NBA history to reach
the 31,000-point milestone, pouring in 38 points to help the Los
Angeles Lakers to a 103-99 road win over the Dallas Mavericks.
At the age of 34, Bryant is the youngest NBA player to score
more than 31,000 points, surpassing Wilt Chamberlain, who was 36
when he reached the milestone.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the all-time leading scorer in
league history with 38,387 points.  The Miami Heat pushed their winning streak to 11 games with
a 109-105 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Dwyane Wade
scored 15 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter while LeBron James had a game-high 28 points and eight assists.  The Oklahoma City Thunder won their second straight
following a three-game losing skid, routing the Chicago Bulls
102-72 behind a 19-point, 16-rebound effort by Kevin Durant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
