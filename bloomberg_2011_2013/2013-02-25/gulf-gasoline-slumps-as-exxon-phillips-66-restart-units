U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened as
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Phillips 66 (PSX)  restarted units at two Texas
refineries.  The No. 3 fluid catalytic cracker at Exxon’s Baytown
refinery returned to normal operations yesterday after an upset
on Feb. 22, according to Nicholas Scinta, a company spokesman
based in Houston.  Phillips 66’s Sweeny refinery, which began scheduled
maintenance on Jan. 7, was restarting production units including
a pipestill and sulfur recovery unit, according to two people
familiar with the operations who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public. Rich Johnson, a Phillips
66 spokesman, said maintenance is still under way.  The Sweeny and Baytown refineries can process as much as
831,000 barrels a day, or 9.5 percent of capacity on the Gulf
Coast, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol on the
Gulf slipped 1.5 cents to trade at a discount of 1.5 cents a
gallon below futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:29
p.m. Conventional, 87-octane gasoline dropped 1.75 cents to 3
cents below futures.  Refineries in the region processed 7.14 million barrels of
crude and other feedstock in the week ended Feb. 15, compared
with 7.4 million barrels in the week-earlier period, Energy
Information Administration data show. Operators used 81.8
percent of capacity, the  lowest level  since Sept. 7.  Utilization Rate  “Refinery utilization rates are at their lowest level
since the beginning of maintenance season some three weeks
ago,” said Tom Finlon, Jupiter, Florida-based director of
Energy Analytics Group LLC.  The 3-2-1 crack spread, or a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , dropped 89 cents to $36.75 a barrel. The same spread
for Light Louisiana Sweet oil gained 96 cents to $15.60 a
barrel. Gulf Coast reformulated gasoline traded  1 cent  above the
same fuel in the New York Harbor.  Refiners in New York profited $16.05 a barrel based on
Brent oil prices in  Europe . That’s up 52 cents from Feb. 22.
Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline in the region dropped 0.25 cent
to 2.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
