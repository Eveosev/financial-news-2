the biggest weekly decline in more than a year, as manufacturing
in the U.S. probably expanded for a third month in February.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed as much as 0.8 percent to $7,861.25 a metric
ton, before trading at $7,858 at 2:08 p.m. in  Shanghai . It
declined 4.9 percent last week, the biggest drop since December
2011. On the LME, lead and tin also climbed, while nickel and
aluminum fell.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold gained for a third day after data showed that central
banks in Russia and  Kazakhstan  added the metal to reserves in
January, countering a decline in bullion-backed exchange-traded
products as haven demand wanes.  Spot gold rallied as much as 0.5 percent to $1,589.27 an
ounce, and was at $1,589.22 at 4:22 p.m. in Singapore,
rebounding from a seven-month low of $1,555.55 on Feb. 21.
Gold’s so-called relative strength index was below 30 from Feb.
15 to Feb. 22, the level that indicates to some analysts who
study technical charts that a rebound in prices may be imminent.  Cash silver gained 0.6 percent to $28.9144 an ounce, paring
a monthly loss. Spot platinum added 0.8 percent to $1,621.50 an
ounce, 3.4 percent lower this month. Palladium was rose 0.2
percent to $739.85 an ounce, set to snap a three-month increase.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans swung between gains and losses as investors
weighed the impact of a potential record U.S. crop in 2013
against signs that Chinese demand is switching away from  Brazil 
because of shipping delays.  The oilseed for May delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent to
$14.3525 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, swinging from a
0.6 percent advance. It traded little changed at $14.4325 at
3:19 p.m. in Singapore on a trading volume that was more than
double the 100-day average. Futures fell 2.6 percent last week.  Corn for May delivery fell 0.3 percent to $6.8225 a bushel
in Chicago. That put the price of soybeans at about 2.1 times
the cost of corn compared with a 10-year average of 2.43 times.
Wheat for May delivery slipped 0.5 percent to $7.15 a
bushel.  Rubber declined for a fifth day and traded near a two-month
low as stockpiles increased in  China , the largest consumer, and
a survey showed the country’s manufacturing is expanding at the
slowest pace in four months.  The contract for July delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell as much as 0.8 percent to 294.6 yen a kilogram
($3,132 a metric ton), approaching the two-month low of 292.7
yen reached Feb. 21. Futures settled at 295.3 yen, extending
this year’s drop to 2.4 percent.  Palm oil  fell the most since November as forecast for a
record U.S. soybean crop next year deepened concern that global
cooking oil supplies may increase and a tax on exports will curb
demand for Malaysian supplies.  The contract for delivery in May dropped as much as 2.8
percent to 2,463 ringgit ($794) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the biggest drop for the most-active
contract since Nov. 12, and ended the morning session at 2,479
ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures gained 2.1 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
