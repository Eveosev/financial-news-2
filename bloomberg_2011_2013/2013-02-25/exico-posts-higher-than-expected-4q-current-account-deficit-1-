Mexico  reported current account
deficits for the fourth quarter and for the whole of 2012 that
were greater than expected by economists and policy makers.  The current account deficit, the broadest measure of trade
in goods and services, was $6.49 billion in the fourth quarter
and $9.25 billion for last year, according to a report posted by
the central bank on its website today.  Economists had forecast a fourth-quarter deficit of $4.35
billion, according to the median estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank had estimated in a Feb.
13 report that the current account deficit for 2012 would be $7
billion, or 0.6 percent of gross domestic product, and swell to
$17.3 billion this year, saying future deficits will be
“moderate” and “completely financeable.”  While 2012 foreign direct investment figures fell to $12.7
billion from $21.5 billion in 2011, portfolio inflows rose to
$80.2 billion last year from $40.6 billion in 2011, according to
today’s report.  “The nation’s receiving an extremely large quantity of
external resources both due to global liquidity conditions and
because of conditions in Mexico,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist
at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB, said in a telephone
interview from Mexico City. “There’s a great confidence on the
part of investors in the financial market to buy Mexican bonds
and stocks.”  Portfolio inflows in the fourth quarter were at record
highs of $19.8 billion,  Alberto Ramos , an economist at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a research note today.  Mexicans invested $25.6 billion abroad, more than double
the $12.1 billion they invested in 2011, and investment abroad
exceeded FDI in  Latin America ’s second-largest economy for the
first time since at least 2001.  The fourth quarter’s current account deficit widened from a
revised $941 million shortfall in the third quarter and resulted
from deficits of $5.63 billion in goods and services and $6.03
billion in royalties. These deficits were partially offset by a
$5.17 billion surplus in the balance of transfers, according to
today’s report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
