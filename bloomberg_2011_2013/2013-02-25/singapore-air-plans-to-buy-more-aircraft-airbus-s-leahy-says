Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , Southeast
Asia’s biggest carrier, plans to buy more aircraft, Airbus SAS
said, as the region’s economic growth spurs air travel demand.  Airbus will suggest its A350 model to  Singapore  Air,  John Leahy , the planemaker’s chief operating officer, said in an
interview in Singapore today.  “We’re in discussions with them,” Leahy said. “They are
also looking at other aircraft. They issued a request for
proposal on that to Airbus, to Boeing, to engine manufacturers.
Anything else, I can’t comment.”  Singapore Air, the first carrier to fly the Airbus A380, in
October agreed to order five more of the superjumbos and 20
A350-900s as it adds fuel-efficient planes amid competition from
Gulf airlines. Asia-Pacific will lead the demand for new
aircraft as economic growth helps boost the number of middle
class population by almost five-times in 20 years, Leahy said.  “We discuss fleet requirements with manufacturers on a
regular basis, in line with our longstanding policy to maintain
a young and modern fleet,” said  Nicholas Ionides , a spokesman
for the carrier. He declined to elaborate, saying discussions
are confidential.  The A350 is Airbus’s biggest twin-engine model, with
seating for about 314 passengers on the A350-900 variant, which
has a list price of $287.7 million. The larger A350-1000 can
hold 350 passengers and has a published price of $332.1 million.
Buyers typically get a discount from list prices.  Maiden Flight  The A350 is set for its maiden flight in the middle of this
year. The aircraft’s small and mid-sized variants compete with
the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, while the large model is positioned
against the popular 777.  Airbus would acquire Singapore Air’s five A340-500s as part
of the October order. These planes will leave the carrier’s
fleet in the fourth quarter of this year, forcing the end of
non-stop services to  Los Angeles  as well as  Newark , the world’s
longest commercial flight.  The carrier transferred its 20 on-order  Boeing (BA)  787s, due to
start arriving in 2014, to low-cost arm Scoot from the main
Singapore Air unit. Scoot began services using 777s in June.
Singapore Air’s regional unit SilkAir separately signed a
provisional agreement for 54 Boeing 737 planes in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
