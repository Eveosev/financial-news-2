Devro Plc (DVO)  fell 6.7 percent in six
days, trailing a 1.3 percent gain in the FTSE 250 Index, on
concern that earnings at Britain’s biggest maker of collagen
sausage casings won’t improve much as raw material costs rise.  Devro, which is scheduled to report full-year earnings
tomorrow, declined as much as 0.3 percent and was down 0.1
percent at 354.7 pence at 12:36 p.m., the longest streak without
a gain in more than three months. The six-day drop gave the
Chryston, Scotland-based company a market value of 588 million
pounds ($891 million).  “Input cost pressures are likely to offset the scope for
its capital expenditure program to meaningfully improve its
margin outlook for 2013,” Damian McNeela and Graham Jones,
London-based analysts at Panmure Gordon & Co., wrote in a note
on Feb. 19.  Devro said in October that currency movements, higher raw
material costs and extended plant commissioning periods will
mean “full-year operating profits are expected to be slightly
below our original expectations.” The company said it expected
raw material prices to continue rising, though a 35 million-
pound investment program in 2012 would increase capacity and
help boost productivity in 2013 and 2014.  “Devro’s shares look susceptible to short-term weakness,”
the Panmure  analysts  said. The stock rose 23 percent from the
start of the year through Feb. 15, when it closed at the highest
price in more than 14 years.  Analysts are split on the stock, with Numis Securities
saying Devro may fall 15 percent and Goldman Sachs predicting a
gain of more than 30 percent from today’s price, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Panmure has a 320-pence target.  The shares are trading at a premium to rival  Viscofan (VIS)  SA,
McNeela and Jones said in the note. “We believe that in the
short term this premium is undeserved.”  Viscofan, based in Pamplona, Spain, said in October it
expected to exceed its full-year profit target. The stock has
fallen almost 6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
