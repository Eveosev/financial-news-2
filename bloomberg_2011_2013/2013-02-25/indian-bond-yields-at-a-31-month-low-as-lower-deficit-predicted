The yield on  India ’s bonds due 2022
held near a 31-month low amid optimism the government will
announce plans to rein in the  budget deficit  this week.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, who will present
his annual budget to parliament on Feb. 28, will seek to narrow
the  shortfall  to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in the
year starting April, from this year’s goal of 5.3 percent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts and investors. That
would be the least since the 12 months through March 2008. India
has scaled back energy subsidies since September, acting to
shore up public finances and avoid a sovereign downgrade.  “The government’s ongoing push for fiscal consolidation is
likely to limit bond sales next year,” said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a
Singapore-based fixed-income strategist at Standard Chartered
Plc. “That would be perceived positively by the markets and our
recommendation is that investors buy 10-year  government bonds .”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 was
little changed at 7.80 percent in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. It touched 7.78 percent earlier,
the lowest level since July 2010.  Chidambaram, who has vowed to reduce the deficit to 3
percent by 2017, will aim for the smallest increase in annual
debt sales in three years in the budget, according to the
Bloomberg survey. The government’s borrowing target for the year
starting April 1 will be set at a record 5.8 trillion rupees
($107 billion), up 4 percent from the preceding period,
according to the median estimate of 16 analysts and investors.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.64 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
