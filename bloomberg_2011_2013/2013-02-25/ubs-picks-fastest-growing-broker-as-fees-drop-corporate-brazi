Link Investimentos, the Brazilian
brokerage bought by  UBS (UBSN)  AG, is gaining the most market share in
cash equity trading as fees fall amid growing competition.  Link traded 316.9 billion reais ($161 billion) in equity
and equity options on the  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3)  last year, boosting its
market share to 8.9 percent from 7.4 percent in 2011, according
to data compiled by the exchange. Sao Paulo-based Link overtook
Morgan Stanley as No. 2 in equity trading, narrowing the gap
with Credit Suisse Group AG, which had 12.9 percent in 2012 and
has been ranked No. 1 since at least 2007.  UBS completed its takeover of Link today, seeking to
benefit as Brazilian equity trading surges to a record, luring
competitors including New York-based  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
Barclays Plc and private-equity funds Actis LLP and General
Atlantic LLC. Average fees in equity trading have declined to
0.09 percent from about 0.2 percent in 2002, according to Credit
Suisse.  “New foreign competitors invested in Brazil, fueling the
war to gain market,” Link Chief Executive Officer Daniel
Cardoso Mendonça de Barros said in an interview at his office in
Sao Paulo. “Fees for brokerage firms are falling about 20
percent a year for the last couple of years and today only about
10 brokerage firms are making money out of the 96 in
BM&FBovespa.”  Global banks including UBS are under pressure to boost
equities-trading market share and pare costs after industrywide
revenue from that business fell 5 percent last year, the third
straight annual drop, according to analytics firm Coalition Ltd.
UBS’s revenue from equities climbed 35 percent to 777 million
Swiss francs ($836 million) in 2012.  Equity Trading  Daily equity trading in Brazil, the world’s biggest
emerging market after  China , surged 12 percent to a record 7.25
billion reais in 2012, according to BM&FBovespa. Trading by
foreign investors increased to 40 percent of total volume last
year from 35 percent, helping offset the impact of a 32 percent
decline in equity issuance to a seven-year low of $8.21 billion.  Revenue for equity brokerages in Brazil will grow in 2013
as trading volume may increase about 10 percent and fees could
stop falling, said Mauro Oliveira, managing director of equity
sales trading at  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  in Brazil.  Equity issuance will rise from 2012, fueling trading
because of portfolio reallocations and growing international
investment flow, Oliveira said. Central bank reductions in
interest rates to a record low will also encourage more equity
trading as pension funds, asset-management firms and private
banking move away from fixed income, he said.  Link Acquisition  UBS, Switzerland’s biggest lender, obtained central bank
approval to buy Link on Jan. 31 after announcing the 195 million
real acquisition in April 2010. The Zurich-based company plans
to rebrand Link as UBS, and will keep Link’s 170 employees,
Mendonca de Barros told reporters today. That will bring UBS’s
headcount in Brazil to 310, according to the bank.  Link surged from No. 10 in 2007 ranking by volume, when it
handled 2.5 percent of equity trading. The firm ranks No. 1 in
derivatives trading at the BM&FBovespa.  Credit Suisse, whose market share in Brazilian equities has
ranged from 11 percent to 13.7 percent since 2007, is merging
its brokerage with Hedging-Griffo, a Sao Paulo-based asset
manager that it also owns.  As business grows, valuations are increasing. Actis, based
in  London , bought a 20.5 percent stake in XP Investimentos CCTVM
SA in November 2010 for 100 million reais, valuing the Rio de
Janeiro-based brokerage at about 500 million reais.  General Atlantic  Actis sold half its stake in XP in December for 136 million
reais, almost three times the purchase price, to Greenwich,
Connecticut-based General Atlantic, which built a 31 percent
stake for 420 million reais.  “We’re very optimistic about the prospects for XP, a very
profitable investment we’ve made,” said  Patrick Ledoux , partner
and the Actis co-head for Latin America. “XP has a strong
retail presence, it’s growing market share, and is becoming a
Brazilian Charles Schwab.”  XP, which wasn’t among the top 10 brokerages in equities
trading as recently as 2008, surged to the fourth position in
2011 and kept it in 2012, with 7 percent of the market,
according to BM&FBovespa data.  Goldman Sachs, which began trading equities in  Brazil  in
2009, ranked seventh on the BM&FBovespa in 2012. Barclays, which
started its Brazil brokerage business in April 2010, wasn’t
among the 10 biggest by volume last year. This month, the
London-based bank closed its Brazil research unit and reduced
staff in equity trading.  ICAP Jobs  ICAP Plc, the world’s largest broker of trades between
banks, opened a business in Brazil in 2008. In October 2011, the
firm cut about 50 jobs.  “After the adjustments needed, we are having our first
profit in Brazil this first quarter,” said Paulo Levy,
executive director at ICAP in Brazil. “We, as a lot of players
did, had prepared ourselves and invested in Brazil expecting a
larger market than the one that has happened.”  ICAP, with about 220 staff in the South American country,
ranked 10th in equity trading in 2012.  Mendonça de Barros of Link said the decline in fees,
increased competition and investment in technology will lead to
consolidation or drive smaller brokerages out of business.
Smaller firms are surviving only because of profits from the
2007 initial public offering of Bovespa and BM&F, he said. All
local brokerages had stakes in Bovespa and BM&F.  The practice of allowing independent brokers to work
without full-employment benefits generates labor liabilities
that become obstacles to acquisitions, he said. Link doesn’t
employ brokers on that basis, he said.  “Consolidation in this market is necessary because it
simply isn’t big enough for all these firms,” Mendonça de
Barros said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
