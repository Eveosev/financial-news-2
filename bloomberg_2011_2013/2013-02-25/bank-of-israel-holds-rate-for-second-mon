The Bank of  Israel  kept its
benchmark interest rate unchanged at its lowest in more than two
years as rising house prices balanced slowing growth and
inflation.  Governor Stanley Fischer and the monetary policy panel held
the rate at 1.75 percent, the Jerusalem-based bank said on its
website today. Ten of the 22 economists  surveyed by Bloomberg 
forecast the decision, while the remainder predicted a quarter-
point reduction.  The Bank of Israel has gradually reduced the borrowing rate
from 3.25 percent in 2011 in an effort to shore up the economy
amid the  European debt crisis . The monetary expansion has helped
fuel a surge in housing credit and home prices, which have
increased by about 70 percent in the past five years.  “The housing prices situation is definitely worrying,”
Yaniv Pagot, chief strategist at the Ramat Gan-based Ayalon
Group Ltd., said prior to the announcement. “We are at a rate
of increase that we haven’t seen since the end of 2011.”  The Bank of Israel imposed tighter regulations on home
loans last week, requiring banks to set aside more capital and
provisions.  Economic growth  slowed to an annualized 2.5 percent in the
fourth quarter, the slowest in more than three years, as exports
and investment declined. Inflation slowed to 1.5 percent in
January, remaining below the midpoint of the government’s 1
percent to 3 percent target for a fourth month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
