Libyan border guards demanding back
pay for the past year occupied the Tripoli office of Prime
Minister Ali Zaidan, a spokesman for his office said.  “There are about 20 of them, they are unarmed,” Essam
Zubar said in a telephone interview. “They did not find the
prime minister there, he is in Geneva.”  The protesters were allowed into the building by security
staff at the heavily-guarded office early today, Zubar said.
Occupation by protestors of official buildings has been a
frequent occurrence in Libya since the 2011 uprising that led to
the ouster and death of Muammar Qaddafi.  Gunmen broke into the prime ministers office, then occupied
by former premier Abdurahim El-Keib, on May 8 opening fire on
security forces before later agreeing to leave. The chamber of
the general national congress was taken over by wounded fighters
on Feb. 3, who claimed their war pensions were unpaid. They
finally agreed to leave peacefully this weekend.  Both the prime minister’s office and Congress are guarded
by armed militia and police units, backed by pick-up trucks
mounting anti-aircraft guns, though they have been reluctant to
block protestors attempting to gain access.  To contact the reporters on this story:
