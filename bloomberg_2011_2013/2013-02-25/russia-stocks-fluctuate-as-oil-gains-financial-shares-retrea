Russian (INDEXCF)  equities rose for a second
day as oil,  Russia ’s chief export, climbed and OAO Gazprom, the
nation’s biggest company by market capitalization, advanced
after Renaissance Capital raised its price estimate.  The Micex Index added 0.5 percent to 1,503.66 by the close
in Moscow. Of 50 shares, 33 increased and 17 fell. Industrial
and health-care stocks led the gains, rising at least 1.4
percent. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  jumped 0.9 percent to
1,565.07.  Oil surged as much as 1.4 percent to $94.46 per barrel in
New York and pared its advance to $93.10 per barrel before
international talks with  Iran  on its nuclear program. Crude and
natural gas account for about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue. Gazprom, which has the second-biggest weighting on the
Micex at 14 percent, jumped 1 percent to its highest level in
more than two weeks as Renaissance increased the estimate to $14
and reiterated its buy recommendation.  Renaissance expects Gazprom “to become leaner and start
focusing on efficiency as a result of sector reforms,” analysts
said in an e-mailed note today.  Gazprom may see $45 million in fund inflows as its
weighting in  MSCI Inc.’s Russia (MXRU)  10/40 Index was lifted to 9
percent from 8.7 percent, according to an e-mailed note from
Sberbank CIB. The stock has fallen 4 percent this year.  MTS Dividends  OAO Mobile TeleSystems added 0.6 percent to 263.70 rubles.
MTS and AFK Sistema depositary receipts retained their fourth
spot on the MSCI Russia 10/40 Index, according to an e-mailed
note from VTB Capital, which forecast OAO Surgutneftegas
preferred and ordinary shares may outperform MTS and Sistema.
Surgutneftegas rose 0.8 percent to 29.316 rubles, while the
company’s preferred shares were the biggest gainers on the Micex
index, up 2.9 percent.  MTS, Russia’s biggest mobile provider by market value,
climbed 2 percent Feb. 22 in New York, extending its advance in
February to 4.6 percent, the steepest gain on the Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian stocks in the
U.S.  MTS will calculate dividends based on cash flow, rather
than net income, as it’s “more transparent” amid ruble
volatility, Chief Executive Officer Andrei Dubovskov said in
November.  Ten-day price swings  on the Micex increased to 15.884, the
highest since Jan. 18, while the number of shares traded on the
gauge was 54 percent below the measure’s 10-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The ruble strengthened 0.4 percent
against the dollar to 30.3065.  Mostotrest Gains  The Micex trades at about 5.7 times  estimated earnings  and
has added 2 percent this year. That compares with a multiple of
10.5 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which has added
0.1 percent over the same period.  OAO  Mostotrest (MSTT) , the Russian construction company, rallied
as much as 2.2 percent after dropping 10 percent last week, the
most on the Micex. The shares closed up 1.9 percent at 159.96
rubles, the second-biggest advancer. Alfa Bank reiterated its
overweight recommendation, while cutting its price estimate to
235 rubles. The company is a “compelling” investment and
provides “unique exposure” to Russian transport infrastructure
construction, Alfa analysts wrote in an e-mailed note.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index increased 0.6 percent to
662.16. The  Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD)  added 1.2 percent, led by
VTB Group’s depositary receipts rising 2.8 percent and Gazprom’s
depositary receipts gaining 2.2 percent.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, gained 0.6 percent to $29.38 on
Feb. 22. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian stocks in the U.S. climbed 0.9 percent on Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
