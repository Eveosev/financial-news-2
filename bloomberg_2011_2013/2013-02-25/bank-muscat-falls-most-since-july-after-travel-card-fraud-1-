Bank Muscat SAOG (BKMB)  dropped the most in
seven months as Oman’s biggest lender reported fraudulent
transactions totaling $39 million on travel cards.  The shares slid 4.3 percent, the most since July 11, to
0.607 rial at the close in Muscat. They tumbled as much as 6.9
percent. About 6.1 million shares were traded, almost five times
the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The benchmark  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  fell 0.5 percent.  Twelve prepaid travel cards were “compromised” on Feb. 20
outside Oman, the bank  said in a statement  to the bourse today.
“No customers have suffered any financial loss and no other
credit or debit cards issued by Bank Muscat have been
affected.”  Losses from loan defaults at banks have risen across the
Persian Gulf since the credit crisis as slowing economic growth
led to thousands of job losses. Bank Muscat reported last month
an  18 percent increase  in annual profit to 139.2 million rials
($362 million), meeting analysts’ estimates. The lender’s
impairment charges for bad loans rose 3.2 percent last year to
57.9 million rials.  The central bank in the neighboring United Arab Emirates in
2009 said it would ask banks to replace magnetic strips on
credit cards with the “chip and pin” technology, to help
combat credit card fraud. The move followed a review of the
country’s cash-machine network and incidents of credit-card
fraud.  Bank Muscat’s profit in 2013 is  forecast to rise  10 percent
to 153 million rials, according to the mean estimate of nine
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The shares are rated a buy by 11
analysts and a hold by two.  To contact the reporters on this story:
