Romania is inviting preliminary bids
for a majority stake in its state-owned postal monopoly,  Posta
Romana SA , by April 11, according to an official document
published by the government in  Ziarul Financiar .  The Bucharest-based Cabinet, which wants to sell a 51
percent stake in Posta Romana through a capital increase, will
hold an auction on the sale after talks with potential investors
based on their non-binding bids, according to the statement.  For submitting a bid, an investor must prove its solvency
and show it has the financial resources for a capital increase
in Posta Romana of at least 150 million euros ($198 million).  The date of the auction will be announced after the
Communication Ministry selects a short list of investors,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
