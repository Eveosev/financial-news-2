Gedeon Richter Nyrt. (RICHT) , Hungary’s
biggest drugmaker, advanced for the first time in four days
after announcing a joint venture to expand sales in China.  Richter shares rose 1.1 percent to 35,125 forint by the end
of trading in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock fell 0.2
percent.  Richter signed agreements with the owners of its marketing
partner Rxmidas Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. to create a joint
venture, according to a  statement  to the Budapest Stock Exchange
today. The deal, which will give Richter seven regional offices
and more than 200 staff in China, will help expand the company’s
2013 revenue by 7.3 billion forint ($33 million), according to
 KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s broker unit.  “We welcome the expansion and diversification plan as
China is one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in
the world,” Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst at KBC
Securities, wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
