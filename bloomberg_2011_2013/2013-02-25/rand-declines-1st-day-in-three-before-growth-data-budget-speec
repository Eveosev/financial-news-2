The rand rose to its strongest level
in more than a week as investors gauged the currency’s slump
this year, the worst amongst emerging-market currencies, is
overdone. Bonds gained, driving two-year yields to record lows.  The rand appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 8.8098 per
dollar, its strongest level since Feb. 15. It traded at 8.8115
as of 4:44 p.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on 13.5 percent bonds
due September 2015 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 5.25 percent.  The currency has declined 3.7 percent this year as  South
Africa  struggles to recover from three credit-rating downgrades
and the worst labor unrest since apartheid ended in 1994. Data
tomorrow may show fourth-quarter growth accelerating as the
effects of mining strikes wear off. Finance Minister  Pravin
Gordhan  delivers his annual budget speech on Feb. 27.  “I consider the recent depreciation to be excessive,” Thu Lan Nguyen, a Frankfurt-based foreign-exchange strategist at
Commerzbank AG, said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“Since the negative consequences of the strike wave and
political risks are likely to fade, I see room for a
correction.”  South Africa’s gross domestic product probably expanded 1.7
percent in the three months through December, from 1.2 percent
in the previous quarter, according to the median estimate of 20
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We’ve seen some good dollar selling interest on any sign
of weakness,” William van Rijn, a currency trader at Nedbank
Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by phone. “The rand has
performed well, given that there is a lot of data due this
week.”  The currency appreciated after failing to breach the 8.95
level in the past week, and could advance to 8.70 if it closes
below 8.75 per dollar,  Van Rijn  added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
