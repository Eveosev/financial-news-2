QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE) ,
 Australia ’s biggest insurer, said full-year profit missed
forecasts as it wrote down the value of its U.S. units and costs
swelled for prior year claims.  Net income  in the full-year to Dec. 31 rose 8 percent to
$761 million from $704 million a year earlier, Sydney-based QBE
said in a statement today. That compared with a median forecast
of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a profit of $884
million and QBE’s guidance of more than $820 million.  While catastrophe claims declined and returns on
investments rose, QBE said this was offset by $464 million of
adverse prior accident year claims and increased risk margins.
The company wrote down brands, distribution channels and
licenses on restructured businesses in the U.S. and said it took
a “more cautious view on future cash flows for recent
acquisitions.”  The company forecast premium rates to increase by 5 percent
on average in 2013 and said that it expects an underlying
insurance profit margin of 11 percent. Cash profit for 2012 rose
32 percent to $1.04 billion and QBE declared a final dividend of
10 Australian cents a share.  QBE shares have surged 20 percent this year, compared with
an 8.8 percent rise for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
