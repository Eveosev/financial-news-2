PostNL NV (PNL)  surged the most in nine
months in Amsterdam trading after the biggest Dutch postal
operator raised its target for cost reductions.  PostNL  gained  as much as 10 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since May 22, and was up 8.7 percent at 2.01 euros as of
11:41 a.m., valuing the company at 882 million euros ($1.17
billion). The company increased its cost-saving target to 400
million euros from 330 million euros, of which 110 million euros
was achieved over the past two years.  The postal operator, based in The Hague, postponed part of
its restructuring plans last year to avoid harming the quality
of mail service. PostNL now aims to save 290 million euros in
costs until 2017 by restarting “the roll-out of the operational
restructuring” and by implementing additional measures,
including job cuts at headquarters and among support staff.  “Key is that the savings target has been raised by 70
million euros, more than expected, and limited additional
provisions will be needed to reach that target,” Marc Zwartsenburg, an Amsterdam-based  analyst  at ING Groep NV, wrote
in a note to investors. He recommends buying the stock and
predicts it will rise to 2.90 euros in 12 months.  The company expects to cut as many as 3,500 jobs in total,
it said in an e-mailed statement. “Clearly we stimulate
voluntary leave as much as possible,” with firings among
production staff “strongly reduced” from an earlier
expectation of 2,800, the postal operator said.  PostNL will increase prices to balance expected mail
delivery volume declines of as much as 10 percent to 2015 in the
Netherlands, it also said. The company repeated its 2015
forecast that underlying cash operating profit will rise to 300
million euros to 370 million euros, from 130 million euros last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
