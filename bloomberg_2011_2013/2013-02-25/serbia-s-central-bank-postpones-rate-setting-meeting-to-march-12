Serbia ’s central bank postponed its
rate-setting meeting to March 12 from March 7, the bank said in
a statement today on its website, without explaining the delay.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije has raised its  one-
week repurchase rate  eight times since June by a cumulative 225
basis points, or 2.25 percentage points, to 11.75 percent as it
battles to bring Europe’s second-highest inflation rate back to
its target band.  To contact the reporter on this story:
