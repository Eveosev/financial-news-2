Ecopetrol (ECOPETL)  SA,  Colombia ’s state-
controlled oil company, jumped the most in three months after
proposing a cut in the dividend for 2012 that was less than the
drop in last year’s net income.  Shares gained 1.5 percent to 5,320 pesos at 11:51 a.m. in
Bogota, the biggest increase on a closing basis since Nov. 15.
Ecopetrol contributed the  most  to a 0.4 percent increase in the
benchmark Colombian Colcap index.  The Bogota-based company’s board proposed a 291 peso per
share  dividend  for 2012, down 3 percent from 300 pesos for 2011,
Ecopetrol said in a Feb. 22 regulatory filing after the market
closed. Net income fell 4.4 percent last year.  “The company tried to maintain a dividend very close to
the one before it,” Sebastian Gallego, an analyst at Corredores
Asociados SA, said in a telephone interview. “They decided to
increase the payout to not disappoint the market.”  Ecopetrol will propose the dividend at a shareholder
meeting on March 21, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
