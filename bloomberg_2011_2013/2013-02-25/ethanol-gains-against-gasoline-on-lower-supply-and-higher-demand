Ethanol gained against gasoline on
speculation that lower imports and higher demand will drain
stockpiles of the fuel alternative.  The spread narrowed 2.65 cents to 69.01 cents a gallon.
Imports were down 83 percent to 21,000 barrels a day in the week
ended Feb. 15 from the 2012 high in October, according to the
Energy Information Administration, while inventories are lower
than year-ago levels.  “Relative to the discount to gasoline, there’s no reason
blenders shouldn’t be using as much as they possibly can,” said
 Terry Reilly , senior commodity analyst at Futures International
LLC in Chicago. “We’re importing less. That’s another reason we
should see a drawdown in stocks.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery rose 0.8 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $2.371 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have advanced 8.3 percent this year.  Gasoline for March delivery decreased 1.85 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0611 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Reilly said better returns have given companies an
incentive to raise ethanol  production .  Production Up  Output rose a third consecutive week in the period ended
Feb. 15, the Energy Department’s statistical arm said in a Feb.
21 report. Production is down 17 percent from the record 963,000
barrels a day in December 2011 as companies slashed operations
because of higher corn prices caused by the worst drought since
the 1930s.  Corn for March delivery advanced 3.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $6.935 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 15 cents,
unchanged from Feb. 22. The amount doesn’t include revenue from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production, which can be fed to livestock.  Joseph Glauber, the Agriculture Department’s chief
economist, said Feb. 21 that corn to be used for ethanol in the
2013-2014 growing season will be below 5 billion bushels for a
second year.  RINs Reserves  U.S. oil refiners may draw from a reserve of Renewable
Identification Numbers that they’ve banked in previous years to
help meet federal requirements, Bloomberg New Energy Finance
said in a report today. RINs help the government track whether
refiners are meeting biofuel mandates.  The value of  RINs for corn-based ethanol  fell 4.4 percent
to 43 cents on Feb. 22. They’ve surged from 7.1 cents on Jan. 7,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and sugarcane-based
Brazilian grade ethanol, were unchanged at 59.5 cents, the
highest price this year.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 90 percent of the
total gasoline pool, up from 89 percent the previous week, EIA
said.  Higher domestic consumption will be needed to help lift
prices and fill a void that may be created from lower export
demand after the European Union this month imposed a five-year
tariff on U.S. supply to curb competition for German, British
and EU makers of the fuel, Reilly said.  Ethanol Exports  Exports  of the fuel in November, the most recent month for
which data is available, totaled 965,000 barrels, the smallest
amount since November 2010, EIA data show.  Spot prices in Sao Paulo  were $2.43 a gallon last week, the
highest since April 13 and about 2.5 percent more expensive than
today’s futures price.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.48 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.37 and in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.42, data compiled by Bloomberg show. On the West Coast, the
most expensive hub in the nation, prices gained 1 cent to $2.53
a gallon.  Chicago’s discount to New York was unchanged at 11 cents,
wider than the 8.6-cent average of the past year. The West
Coast’s premium to the Gulf expanded to 11 cents from 10. It’s
averaged 9.8 cents since Feb. 27, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
