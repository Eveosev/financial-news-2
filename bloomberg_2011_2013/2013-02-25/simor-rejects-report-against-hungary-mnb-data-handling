Hungarian central bank president
Andras Simor rejects Audit Office report findings that the
Magyar Nemzeti Bank broke the law by supplying breakdown of
commercial-bank data to IMF as part of 2008 bailout request.
Simor speaks at parliamentary committee hearing today.
* MNB sending commercial-bank data to IMF was legal and was
aimed at making sure that bailout funds don’t leave country via
foreign-owned banks, Simor says
* Simor says MNB at the time failed to get written permission
from commercial banks for sharing data with IMF though MNB last
year received these and commercial banks had no complaints
* NOTE: Simor’s six-year term ends March 3
