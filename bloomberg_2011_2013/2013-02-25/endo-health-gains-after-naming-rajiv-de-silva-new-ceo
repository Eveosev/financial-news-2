Endo Health Solutions Inc. (ENDP) , the
maker of the painkiller Percocet, rose the most in almost a
month after naming Rajiv De Silva as the company’s new chief
executive officer.  Endo’s shares gained 7.7 percent to $30.21 at 1:05 p.m. New
York time, after reaching $30.47 in the largest intraday
increase since Jan. 30. De Silva, 46, previously served as
president of  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)  and will
take over on March 18. David Holveck, the current CEO of  Chadds
Ford , Pennsylvania-based Endo, said in December that he would
retire.  “Today’s announcement is another key step forward that
will enable us to build on Endo’s strong foundation,” Endo
Chairman Roger Kimmel said in a statement announcing the
appointment.  De Silva takes over as the company has reportedly been in
talks to sell itself. In December, Endo said fourth-quarter
results would be “at or below” the low end of its forecast of
$5 a share to $5.10 a share and it “no longer expects to
achieve” revenue of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in 2013. Endo is
scheduled to report earnings on Feb. 28.  The company had disruptions in its supply of the Opana ER
painkiller, Endo’s second-biggest product, reducing its sales in
the third quarter. Endo also is preparing for generic
competition to its top-seller Lidoderm in September 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
