Distell Group Ltd. (DST) ,  South Africa ’s
biggest wine and spirit producer, said first-half earnings rose
on higher sales of pre-mixed ready-to-drink brands and cider.  Net income advanced 13 percent to 877 million rand ($99
million) in the six months through December, the Stellenbosch,
South Africa-based company said in a statement today. Sales
increased 9 percent to 8.7 billion rand.  “Distell’s cider and ready-to-drink brands maintained
their strong performance,” the winemaker said. “The company’s
wine and spirits portfolios both showed a decrease in sales
volumes.”  The economic climate made it “difficult to predict
consumer spending trends” while drinkers’ “disposable income
remains under severe pressure,” Distell added. Weaker  consumer
confidence  has prompted several South African retailers to warn
trading may come under pressure in the first half of 2013.  Distell, which sells Klipdrift brandy and Nederburg wines,
said in January its farming operations weren’t disrupted by
violent labor unrest in the Western Cape. Strikers demanded the
minimum wage for farmworkers be increased to 150 rand a day from
69 rand. The government raised the wage to 105 rand earlier this
month.  The company increased its interim  dividend  6.3 percent to
1.52 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
