Ben Affleck ’s “Argo,” about the
rescue of American hostages from Iran more than 30 years ago,
captured the Academy Award for best picture, winning out over
eight other films including “Lincoln.”  “Zero Dark Thirty,” about the hunt for  Osama Bin Laden ,
was largely overlooked, gaining only a split win for sound
editing today at the Academy Awards in Hollywood.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
