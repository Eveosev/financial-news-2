Italian stock s erased earlier gains,
after projections showed  Silvio Berlusconi ’s coalition led in
the election for the Italian Senate, spurring concerns about the
prospects of a stable government.  The  FTSE MIB Index (FTSEMIB)  rose 0.6 percent, reducing earlier gains
of as much as 4 percent, to 16,332.41 as of 5:25 p.m.  “Preliminary results are leading to the worse scenario for
investors, an unstable government,” said Vincenzo Longo, a
Milan-based strategist at IG Markets. “Projections show
Berlusconi is winning the Senate, while polls indicate Bersani
will win the lower house. That means un-governability.”  Berlusconi’s bloc probably captured 31.3 percent votes in
Senate, compared with a 30.1 percent of Pierluigi Bersani’s PD
coalition, according to projections of RAI. Previous polls
showed Pier Luigi Bersani’s center-left alliance probably
captured a majority of 340 seats in the lower house, the Chamber
of Deputies, according to a SkyTG24 poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
