Chile ’s peso ended a seven-session
stretch of losses, its longest since June 2010, as copper rose
and the dollar weakened against emerging-market counterparts.  The currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 473.09 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:22 a.m. in Santiago. Copper for May delivery
climbed 0.5 percent to $3.5670 a pound on the Comex in  New York .
The dollar weakened against 19 of 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  “Commodities are rising and the dollar is weaker against
most currencies,” said Cristian Donoso, a currency trader at
Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.  Refined-copper  imports  by  China , the biggest buyer of
Chile’s principal export, climbed 1.8 percent in January,
China’s General Administration of Customs said today.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks the
greenback against the currencies of major U.S. trading partners,
fell today the most since January.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
more than doubled net bets against the Andean currency to $2.5
billion on Feb. 21, according to data published today by the
central bank. The $1.4 billion increase was the most since the
central bank started publishing daily data in October 2008 and
came a day after U.S. Federal Reserve minutes indicated that
policy makers were divided over the strategy of buying bonds to
support the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
