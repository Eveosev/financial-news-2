The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is considering a loan and equity investment in
Axereal, a French agro-industrial cooperative that plans to buy
grain silos in  Serbia ,  Romania , Hungary and Croatia.  The 28 million-euro ($37 million) loan would boost
Axereal’s working capital and an equity investment of 10 million
euro would help it purchase the silos, the London-based lender
said in an e-mailed statement. It will also provide advance
financing to farmers for quality seeds and fertilizers, the
lender said.  The project requires the EBRD’s board approval on March 26.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
