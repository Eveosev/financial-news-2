Hungarian retail trade dropped less
than economists expected in December as Internet-based and
parcel-delivery sales jumped.  Retail sales fell 2.1 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics office in Budapest said today in an e-mailed report.
The median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a 3.9 percent drop.  Hungary entered its second recession in four years in 2012,
with gross domestic product expected to shrink 0.1 percent this
year, the European Commission said on Feb. 22. Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban ’s government has said that 2013 will be marked by a
“growth turnaround.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
