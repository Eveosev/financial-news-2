(Corrects price direction in second paragraph.)  Hedge funds  and other money managers
cut bullish bets on Brent crude by 1,453 contracts in the week
ended Feb. 19, according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered long positions by 190,701 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculatorsâ€™ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact  Bloomberg News  for this story:
