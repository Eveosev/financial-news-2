OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT)  is trading at
a premium versus its emerging-market peers for the first time
since 2007 on prospects a new approach to dividends for the
Russian phone company will deliver a more consistent payout.  The company known as MTS, Russia’s biggest mobile provider
by market value, climbed 2 percent Feb. 22 in New York,
extending its advance in February to 4.6 percent, the steepest
gain on the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian stocks in the U.S. MTS trades at 12.8 times estimated
earnings, a 33 percent premium to the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Telecommunication Services Index (MXEF0TC) , from a discount of as much as
27 percent in November.  MTS will calculate dividends based on cash flow, rather
than net income, as it’s “more transparent” amid ruble
volatility, Chief Executive Officer Andrei Dubovskov said in
November. The company’s 12-month gross  dividend yield  is 4.38
percent, versus 3.93 percent for OAO Rostelecom, Russia’s main
fixed-line phone company.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , which delayed its 2011
payout amid a shareholder conflict, yields 6.6 percent.  “MTS is the least risky and the most reliable dividend
play in Russian telecoms,” Elina Kulieva, an analyst at OAO
Alfa Bank who rates MTS hold, said by phone Feb. 22. “This new
method is even more attractive for investors. It protects them
from the risk of any decline in net income.”  The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge rose 0.9 percent to 101.76
Feb. 22, trimming its weekly drop to 1.1 percent. It was the
index’s third consecutive weekly drop, the longest stretch of
declines since August. Futures expiring next month on Russia’s
RTS index rose less than 0.1 percent to 154,950 in U.S. hours.  Volatility Abates  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose 0.6 percent
to $29.38 Feb. 22, cutting the weekly drop to 2 percent. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures swings in the index futures,
retreated 1.4 percent to 19.06.  American depositary receipts of MTS rose to $20.56 in New
York Feb. 22, capping the fifth week of gains in the past six to
rally 1.9 percent. MTS’ valuation last exceeded that for the
MSCI telecommunications index, which includes companies such as
Mexico’s America Movil SAB and China Telecom Corp., in December
2007, when the premium was as much as 75 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  MTS’  Moscow-listed stock  rose 1.2 percent to 262.24 rubles,
or $8.61, Feb. 22, to trim the shares’ first drop in 11 weeks.
One ADR is equal to two ordinary shares. The company is
scheduled to report fourth-quarter results March 19.  No Decision  The Moscow-based company, which has paid dividends of more
than 10 rubles a share (33 cents) since 2008, has seen free cash
flow increase to $1.7 billion in the past 12 months, from $1.6
billion in fiscal 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Net
income declined to $853.4 million in the past year, from 1.4
billion in 2011.  MTS hasn’t made a final decision on linking dividends to
cash flow instead of profit, Nikolai Minashin, the company’s
investment relations manager, said by e-mail from Moscow Feb.
22.  VimpelCom, Russia’s biggest mobile provider by subscribers
in the fourth quarter, rose 2.9 percent to $12.13 in New York
Feb. 22, trimming its drop last week to 1.1 percent. The
Amsterdam-based company traded at 11.5 times estimated earnings,
a 20 percent premium to the  MSCI telecommunications gauge .  Russia’s anti-monopoly service barred VimpelCom from paying
2011 dividends in May amid disagreement over shareholder Telenor
ASA, based in Fornebu, Norway, increasing its stake. The
conflict was settled when Altimo Cooperatief U.A.’s billionaire
owner Mikhail Fridman increased his holding of voting shares to
47.85 percent in October.  Adding Customers  VimpelCom, which got 40 percent of its revenue from Russia
as of Sept. 30, plans to cut net debt by 17 percent by 2015 and
shave $2 billion off spending, Chief Executive Officer Jo Lunder
said in a Jan. 16 presentation.  MTS, which has 97 percent of its subscribers in Russia,
Ukraine and Belarus, added mobile users at a faster pace than
competitors in the fourth quarter, according to data from
Advanced Communications and Media in Moscow. MTS gained 1.9
percent more subscribers in the quarter than in the July to
September period, while Vimpelcom’s growth rate was 1.8 percent.  “MTS is a defensive play,” Ilya Balakirev, an analyst at
UFS-Finance Investment Co. in Moscow, who rates MTS shares hold,
said by phone Feb. 22. “The stock benefits from the company’s
history of sustainable growth and guaranteed dividends.”  Oil Outlook  Concern the price of oil may fall from current levels and
become more volatile makes MTS an attractive investment at the
moment, according to Balakirev. Oil is Russia’s biggest export
earner and along with natural gas makes up about 50 percent of
budget revenue. Energy companies constitute almost 50 percent of
stocks on the nation’s benchmark Micex Index.  Crude oil fell in New York for the second time in three
weeks. Oil for April delivery rose 0.3 percent to $93.13 the New
York Mercantile Exchange Feb. 22, reducing the weekly drop to
2.8 percent, the most since the seven days ended Dec. 7.  Brent oil for April settlement climbed 0.5 percent to
$114.10 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, paring the weekly drop to 3 percent. Urals crude,
Russia’s chief export blend, slipped 3.5 percent last week, the
most since December.  Oil prices in New York will probably fall this week,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Twenty of 30 analysts and
traders, or 67 percent, estimate crude will drop through March
1. Five respondents, or 17 percent, predicted a gain. Five said
there would be little change.  Ruble Swings  The ruble strengthened 0.2 percent to 30.4225 per dollar
Feb. 22 and gained 0.2 percent to 34.7749 against the dollar-
euro basket used for minimizing swings that hurt exporter
competitiveness. Ruble  futures  showed the currency little
changed at 30.521 per dollar.  Three-month implied volatility on the ruble averaged 12
percent in 2012, up from 4.6 percent in 2007, when the central
bank exercised greater control over the currency. Bank Rossii,
which still intervenes in the ruble, is targeting a free float
of the currency by 2015, according to its  website .  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
lost 0.2 percent to HK$4.51 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:05
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
