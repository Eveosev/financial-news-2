General Motors Co. (GM) , the world’s
second-largest automaker, said it hired a  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
executive to lead marketing efforts for  Chevrolet , GM’s mass-
market brand.  GM named Tim Mahoney as chief marketing officer responsible
for Chevrolet and global GM marketing operations leader,
effective April 1, according to a statement on the carmaker’s
website. Mahoney has been chief product and marketing officer of
the Volkswagen brand in the U.S.  Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson is revamping the
Detroit-based automaker’s marketing efforts and wants to make
Chevrolet and Cadillac its worldwide brands. In October, GM
named Robert Ferguson, who had been vice president of global
public policy, as Cadillac’s global brand chief.  GM said last month it was ditching its “Chevy Runs Deep”
slogan for the new global theme of “Find New Roads.” The
company said today that Mahoney will be in charge of that
approach and will also oversee coordination of the automaker’s
global marketing operations. He will report to Alan Batey, the
interim GM global chief marketing officer.  Joel Ewanick , who had held the position of chief marketing
officer, left GM in July. His resignation stemmed from a
controversy related to a Chevy sponsorship deal with the
Manchester United soccer team, people familiar with the matter
said at the time.  Toyota Motor Corp. is the world’s largest automaker,
followed by GM and Volkswagen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
