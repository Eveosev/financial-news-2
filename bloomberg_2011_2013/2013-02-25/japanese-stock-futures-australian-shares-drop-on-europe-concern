Japanese stock futures and
Australian  equities  fell, tracking a slump in U.S. shares, amid
concern that a divided parliament in  Italy  may reignite  Europe ’s
debt crisis.  American Depositary Receipts of Sony Corp., which gets two-
thirds of its sales offshore, fell 5.2 percent after the yen
rose as Italy’s election renewed the traditional refuge appeal
of the Japanese currency, weakening the earnings outlook for
exporters. Transfield Services Ltd. declined 11 percent in
Sydney after the engineering and maintenance company reported a
first-half loss.  QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE)  slumped 6.1 percent as
Australia’s biggest insurer said profit missed forecasts.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring next
month closed at 11,185 in  Chicago  yesterday, down from 11,650 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
11,330 in  Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  dropped 1.2 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell
0.3 percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures were little
changed.  “Uncertainty about the Italian election result has sparked
fears that they may abandon their austerity drive, possibly
sparking another bout of volatility in Europe,” said Matthew Sherwood, head of investment market research in Sydney at
Perpetual Investments, which manages about $25 billion. This may
“make governing and implementing much-needed economic reforms
almost impossible.”  Hung Parliament  Italy’s election may end Prime Minister Mario Monti’s
government. The country may be left with a hung parliament as
partial results suggested former Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi may have built a blocking minority in the Senate.
Prime ministers require control of both houses of parliament.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded yesterday at 14.8 times average estimated
earnings compared with 13.5 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
and 12.4 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The MSCI Asia Pacific index gained 10 percent from the
start of November through yesterday as Japanese shares rallied
on speculation a new government led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will press for more stimulus to beat deflation.  Japan’s currency dropped 0.4 percent to 120.42 per euro as
of 7:16 a.m. in Tokyo after climbing 2.7 percent yesterday. The
yen fell 0.3 percent to 92.09 per dollar following a 1.7 percent
jump yesterday. A higher yen reduces the value of overseas
earnings for Japanese exporters when repatriated.  The S&P 500 slumped 1.8 percent yesterday, the most since
Nov. 7, to close at the lowest in more than a month.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 1.4 percent to 92.86 in New
York yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
