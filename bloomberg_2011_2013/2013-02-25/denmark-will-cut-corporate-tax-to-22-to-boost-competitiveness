Denmark ’s government plans to lower
corporate tax to 22 percent from 25 percent to improve
competitiveness and pull the Nordic country out of a recession.  The tax cut and other measures to boost growth and
employment will be presented today in Copenhagen by Prime
Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Sofie Carsten Nielsen, a
spokeswoman for financial affairs at government coalition party
the Social Liberals, said by phone.  The Danish  economy  is struggling to emerge from a burst
property bubble in 2008 that triggered a local banking crisis
and wiped out more than a dozen lenders. Gross domestic product
probably contracted 0.4 percent last year, matching a decline in
the 17-member euro area, the government has estimated.  “We’ve been challenged by losing 170,000 jobs in recent
years,”  Nielsen said in a phone interview yesterday. “We’re
launching this to create jobs and growth. For years we’ve only
discussed how to fund welfare spending, while now we’ve set out
to create prosperity.”  Denmark, which ties its krone to the euro, had in December
the lowest trade surplus in four years as exporters suffer from
the sting of a strong euro via Denmark’s currency peg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
