Italy’s bonds fell, erasing an
advance that saw 10-year yields decline by the most in six
months, as polls indicated the euro area’s third-largest economy
may be left with a hung parliament.  Italian  two-year  yields reversed the biggest slide in six
weeks as partial results of the country’s election suggested
former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  may have built a
blocking minority in the Senate to deny outright victory to Pier Luigi Bersani. Stefano Fassina, an aide to Bersani, said the
nation may need a second election. German bunds rose as concern
the results will derail austerity measures introduced by
outgoing premier  Mario Monti  boosted demand for safer assets.  “The lower house is probably going to end in the center-
left but the senate is a close call and what we are seeing in
the latest polls is that Berlusconi is doing better,” said
Nicola Marinelli, who oversees $180 million at Glendevon King
Asset Management in London. “With no one having a majority
there is going to be a lot of negotiations and it is not going
to be a stable and strong government. When the first exit polls
came out, Italian bonds pushed higher, but with the latest
numbers everything is reversing rapidly.”  Italy’s 10-year yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.49 percent as of 5 p.m.  London  time,
after falling as much as 28 basis points, the most since Aug. 3.
The 5.5 percent bond due in November 2022 declined 0.355, or
3.55 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,316) face amount, to 108.245.  Steepest Slide  The rate on nation’s two-year note climbed four basis
points to 1.71 percent, after declining 14 basis points, the
steepest intraday slide since Jan. 10. Still, the yield has
fallen from a euro-era high of 8.12 percent in November 2011,
the month Monti was appointed to replace Berlusconi as unelected
leader to push through austerity measures.  Berlusconi may have won the Senate race in the key swing
regions of Sicily, Campania and Lombardy, according to an IPR
projection based on partial vote counts released by polling
stations.  That contrasts with an instant poll published earlier by
SkyTG24 Tecne that gave Sicily and Campania and a possible
majority in the Senate to Bersani. The poll said Lombardy was
too close to call.  The Rome-based Treasury today sold 2.82 billion euros of
zero-coupon notes maturing in December 2014 at an average yield
of 1.68 percent, up from 1.43 percent at a previous auction on
Jan. 28. Investors bid for 1.65 times the amount of securities
allotted, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.45 last month.  Bunds Gain  German 10-year yields fell one basis point to 1.56 percent,
after dropping to 1.55 percent, the  least  since Jan. 24.  Germany  sold 1.94 billion euros of 12-month securities at
an average yield of 0.035 percent today.  France  auctioned 7.5
billion euros of three-, six- and 12-month bills.  Italian  government bonds  handed investors a return of 11
percent in the past year through Feb. 22, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Spanish securities gained 6.3 percent, while
German bunds rose 3.5 percent, the indexes show.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of Germany and  Belgium , according to
measures of 10-year debt, the spread between two-year and 10-
year securities and credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
