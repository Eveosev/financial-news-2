Frontline Ltd. (FRO) , an oil-tanker
company led by billionaire  John Fredriksen , fell to an almost
14-year low in Oslo on concern it will lack funds to repay debt
and stockholders would lose out in the event of a restructuring.  The Hamilton, Bermuda-based company tumbled as much as 14
percent, the biggest drop since 2011, to the lowest intraday
level since May 1999. That adds to the 6.8 percent slide on Feb.
22 after Frontline said there was a risk it wouldn’t have money
to repay a $225 million convertible bond loan due April 2015.
The company has lost 31 percent of its value this month.  “We struggle to see that there will be any meaningful
value left for current  shareholders ,” said ABG Sundal Collier
Holding ASA in a note today, cutting its price estimate to zero.  Frontline fell 12 percent to 13.20 kroner by 11:40 a.m. in
Oslo, valuing the company at 1 billion kroner ($178 million).  Frontline said Feb. 22 that if the tanker market doesn’t
recover before 2015, and the company can’t raise additional
equity or sell assets, there’s a risk it won’t have enough cash
to repay the convertible bond loan. That may force the tanker
company into a restructuring that includes modifying charter
lease obligations and debt agreements, Frontline said.  The company, split in two in December 2011 to avoid running
out of cash, has said its fleet of very-large-crude-carriers, or
VLCCs, needs on average $24,200 a day per ship to break even.  Crude tankers are going through one of the “worst winters
ever,” with VLCC rates near zero, a limited number of shipments
and high availability of  vessels , Frontline said on Feb. 22.  Whole Industry  Should this continue, it’ll probably to lead to significant
financial problems for the whole tanker industry, the company
said. The tanker market won’t “experience sustained recovery
until overcapacity is removed,” it added.  Supertankers shipping 2 million-barrel cargoes of crude are
earning $7,518 a day, near the lowest level on record, according
to data stretching back to 1997 from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the largest
shipbroker. Tanker demand will grow 5.9 percent in 2013, beating
fleet capacity growth of 5.3 percent, according to Clarkson.  Benchmark freight swaps that traders use to bet on future
shipping prices show earnings no higher than about $15,000 a day
by 2015, according to data from Marex Spectron Group, a broker.  Inger Klemp, chief financial officer of Frontline’s
management unit, wasn’t immediately available when  Bloomberg
News  called seeking comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
