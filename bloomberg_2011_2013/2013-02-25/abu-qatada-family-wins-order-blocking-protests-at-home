The family of  Abu Qatada , an Islamic
cleric the British government wants to deport to Jordan on
terrorism charges, won a court order stopping English
nationalist groups protesting outside their London home.  Judge Stephen Silber extended an injunction stopping the
English National Resistance and others from demonstrating within
500 meters of the house, or publishing details of the family’s
address and children’s schools. The order won’t breach the
protesters’ human rights, he said today.  Abu Qatada, who isn’t involved in the protest case, won’t
be deported to Jordan after a special immigration tribunal ruled
in November it was uncertain whether evidence against him was
obtained by torture. British Prime Minister  David Cameron  has
said he was frustrated by the decision. A U.K. Court of Appeal
hearing on the government’s effort to deport the cleric, whose
real name is Omar Othman, is set for March 11.  Demonstrators gathered outside the family’s home in
December, shouting “murdering scumbag” and “Muslims are
terrorists,” after the English National Resistance and Britain
First groups sent out e-mails calling for protests, Silber said.
Abu Qatada has a wife and five children as young as 11.  An e-mail to a contact address on Britain First’s website
didn’t get an immediate response. Contact information for the
English National Resistance wasn’t immediately available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
