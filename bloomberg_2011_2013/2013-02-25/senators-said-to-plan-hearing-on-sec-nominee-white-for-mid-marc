The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is
aiming to hold a hearing on the nomination of Mary Jo White to
lead the Securities and Exchange Commission in mid-March.  The panel is looking at holding a hearing for White during
the week of March 11, according a Senate aide who asked not to
be identified because a final date has not been set.  Obama nominated White for SEC chairman on Jan. 24. She is a
former U.S. prosecutor and retiring as a partner in the law firm
of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
