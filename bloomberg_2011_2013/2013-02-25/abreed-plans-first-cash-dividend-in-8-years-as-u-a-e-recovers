National Central Cooling Co., (TABREED)  the
United Arab Emirates utility with the best-performing shares in
Dubai last year, plans to pay its first cash dividend in eight
years as profit climbs amid a recovery in the  property market .  Tabreed, as National Central Cooling is known, will pay 5
fils a share for 2012, it  said in a statement  to the Dubai stock
market today. The company last paid a cash dividend in 2004,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and confirmed by an
external spokesman for Tabreed, who asked not to be identified
in line with company policy. Tabreed paid a 7 percent stock
dividend in 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The utility is benefiting from a recovery in the U.A.E.
property market as demand for housing and related services climb
after Dubai witnessed one of the steepest real-estate industry
crashes following the 2008 world financial crisis. Tabreed
shares surged 144 percent last year. The stock so far has gained
40 percent this year, the second-best return in Dubai after
 Emaar Properties PJSC. (EMAAR)   Mubadala Development Co., the Abu Dhabi state-controlled
investment company that holds about a 15 percent stake in
Tabreed, will receive a 5-fil dividend as a common shareholder,
the external spokesman said. It will also be entitled to an
equivalent payment under the terms of mandatory convertible
bonds issued in April 2011 and December 2012. Mubadala has
“agreed to accept this payment in the form of equivalent non-
coupon bearing mandatory convertible bonds, which can be
converted into Tabreed shares by April 2019,” Tabreed said.  Profit Climbs  Mubadala in 2011 agreed to provide Tabreed long-term
capital of 1.7 billion dirhams ($463 million) in mandatory
convertible notes due 2019 and a loan facility of as much as 1.4
billion dirhams. Tabreed said in December it will convert 1.13
billion dirhams of loans from Mubadala into mandatory
convertible bonds.  Tabreed  reported a 29 percent  increase in 2012 profit as
revenue advanced and finance costs declined. The company
operates 59 plants in the U.A.E. and six facilities in Bahrain,
Oman, Qatar and  Saudi Arabia , according to its financial
statements for last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
