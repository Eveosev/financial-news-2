The ruble pared gains against the
central bank’s dollar-euro basket as the Russian tax period
wound down, easing demand for the local currency.  The ruble was little changed against the basket at 34.7701
as of 2.38 p.m. in Moscow after rising as much as 0.2 percent to
34.7063. It strengthened 0.3 percent against the dollar to
30.3205 and weakened 0.3 percent against the euro to 40.2060.  The monthly tax period, when exporters sell a part of their
foreign currency revenue to buy rubles, ends with company income
taxes on Feb. 28. Oil,  Russia ’s main export, rose 1 percent in
 London  to $115.20 per barrel of  Brent crude .  “After the payment of the mineral extraction tax today
exporters’ activity will decline substantially,” OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) 
analysts led by Vladimir Kolychev said in an e-mailed note.  With tax payments out of the way, the ruble will “likely
slide” to 34.75 rubles to 35 rubles against the basket, Rosbank
analysts said.  The yield on OFZ bonds due 2028 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage points, from a record high of 7.31 percent on
Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
