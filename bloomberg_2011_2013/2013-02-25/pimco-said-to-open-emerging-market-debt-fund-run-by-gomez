Pacific Investment Management Co.,
the world’s largest active bond manager, plans to open a fixed-
income fund today that will allocate money across a range of
emerging-market debt, according to a person briefed on the plan.  Pimco Emerging Markets Full Spectrum Bond Fund, set to
begin trading under the ticker symbol PFSIX, will invest in
local-currency government debt as well as dollar-denominated
sovereign and corporate bonds, according to a prospectus. The
fund will be managed by  Michael Gomez , co-head of Pimco’s global
emerging-markets portfolio management team, and charge 0.99
percent for its institutional shares.  Mark Porterfield , a spokesman for  Newport Beach ,
California-based Pimco, declined to comment on the new fund. The
person asked not to be identified because the fund wasn’t yet
public.  Pimco has said it will pursue strategies with a global
focus, in line with its “new normal” philosophy adopted in May
2009 to describe an era of lower returns, heightened government
regulation, diminishing U.S. clout in the world economy and a
bigger role for developing nations. Earlier this month,  Bill
Gross , Pimco’s founder and co-chief investment officer, called
the peso a “great currency” and lauded Mexico for its low debt
levels in a Feb. 5 Twitter post.  Emerging-market bond funds attracted  $21.6 billion  in net
deposits in 2012 for an organic growth rate of 47 percent,
according to research firm  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  Organic growth rate
is the ratio of deposits over the period to beginning net
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
