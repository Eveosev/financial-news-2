3D Systems Corp. (DDD) , a maker of three-
dimensional printers, dropped after reporting quarterly revenue
that missed analysts’ estimates.  The stock  fell  9 percent to $34.55 at the close in New
York. The Rock Hill, South Carolina-based company’s shares had
almost tripled in the 12 months through Feb. 22, as the Standard
& Poor’s 600 Smallcap Index gained 13 percent.  Today’s earnings announcement marked only the fourth time
the company has reported quarterly revenue that trailed
analysts’ estimates,  according  to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
was also the first trading day following a 3-for-2 stock split
Feb. 22 for the maker of machines that manufacture 3-D objects
such as jewelry.  “The number was a mild disappointment, but where these
stock movements are concerned there’s never anything mild,”
said Holden Lewis, an analyst for BB&T Capital Markets. “It was
a knee-jerk reaction,” said Lewis, who rates the shares buy.  The company reported fourth-quarter  revenue  of $101.6
million, a 45 percent increase from $69.9 million a year
earlier, according to a statement today. The average of seven
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $103.9 million.  Profit excluding items such as stock-based compensation and
acquisition and severance costs rose to 39 cents a share from 27
cents a year earlier, topping the 26-cent average estimate.  3D Systems’ stock, adjusted for the split, closed at $37.97
on Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
