The U.K. faces further downgrades
after its AAA rating was cut by Moody’s Investors Service, and
such a move would be unlikely to cause investors to sell gilts,
according to Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Michael Amey.  “I wouldn’t be at all surprised if we get a second
downgrade and if it comes reasonably soon,” Amey said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Francine Lacqua . “I’d be surprised if there’s a lot of forced selling on
a further move.”  Amey also said the Bank of England is likely to resume
purchases of government bonds, probably starting with a 25
billion-pound increase in its Asset Purchase Facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
