Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the hedge
fund founded by ex-central banker  Arminio Fraga , will return to
investors the 1 billion reais ($507 million) it raised last
month for a high-yield credit fund.  Gavea closed the fund because Jose de Menezes Berenguer
Neto, who had joined the firm in March as head of private
credit, is leaving to head JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Brazilian
unit, Gavea Chief Executive Officer Amaury Bier said by
telephone from Rio de Janeiro. Gavea is a unit of JPMorgan.  Gavea won’t have another asset-backed receivables fund
investing in high-yield credit until it finds someone to replace
Berenguer, Bier said.  Valor Economico newspaper reported Gavea’s closure of the
fund earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
