The Daytona 500 drew a 30 percent
increase in preliminary television ratings for Fox as Danica Patrick became the first female driver to lead a lap of Nascar’s
biggest race and Jimmie Johnson won for the second time.  With Patrick starting from the pole position, the race was
seen in 10 percent of homes in the top 56 U.S. television
markets,  News Corp. (NWSA)  network spokesman Dan Bell said on Twitter.
That was 30 percent higher than the 7.7 rating last year’s race
drew, which was run on a Monday because of rain, and the best
big-market rating for the event since 2006, when Johnson also
won.  The results from yesterday’s race in Daytona Beach,
Florida, marked the best year-to-year big-market ratings
improvement in the competition’s history, Eddie Motl, a Fox
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Patrick, the first woman to start from the pole position
for a race in Nascar’s top series, finished eighth to top the
best previous Daytona 500 finish for by a woman, Janet Guthrie,
who was 11th in 1980.  Johnson took the lead for good on Lap 191 of 200 and
withstood a challenge from runner-up Dale Earnhardt Jr.
following a restart with six laps left.  The race was held one day after more than 30 spectators
were injured at Daytona International Speedway when Kyle
Larson’s car crashed through a barrier and sent debris into the
crowd during a race in the Nationwide Series, Nascar’s second
tier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
