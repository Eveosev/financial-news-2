Romania’s leu gained for the first
time in three days, extending its appreciation this year.  The currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 4.373 per euro by
4:45 p.m. in Bucharest. It has advanced 1.7 percent this year,
the most among emerging  Europe ,  Middle East  and Africa
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as foreign investors piled into
the nation’s local debt.  “With no local debt tenders this week, the international
climate will probably weigh more than usual on the local market
mood,” Mihai Tantaru, a Bucharest-based economist at ING Bank
Romania SA, wrote in a note today.  The euro strengthened for a second day against the dollar
as a poll showed Pier Luigi Bersani, the ex-communist who
campaigned to maintain budget rigor, was on track to win Italy’s
parliamentary elections.  European stocks  gained as Italians
voted for the first time since Europe’s financial crisis ushered
in unelected leaders who imposed an austerity program and amid
speculation  Japan  may appoint a central bank chief who favors
stimulus.  Romania’s debt has rallied as select fixed-income
securities are eligible for entry to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s emerging-market bond indexes from March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
