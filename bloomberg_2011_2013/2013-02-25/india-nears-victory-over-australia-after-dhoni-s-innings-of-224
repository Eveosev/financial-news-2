India  neared victory in the first
cricket Test after  Australia  ended day four with a lead of 40
runs and one wicket remaining.  Spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took 5-90 as Australia reached
232-9 at the close in Chennai, India. Moises Henriques is on 75
after an unbeaten last-wicket stand of 57 with Nathan Lyon, on
8, as the visitors avoided an innings defeat.  Home captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni struck 224 as his team
made 572 in reply to Australia’s first-innings 380.  Dhoni’s 265-ball innings, which included 24 fours and six
sixes, was the third-highest score by a wicketkeeper in elite
Tests. It ended when he gloved a catch behind off a delivery
from  James Pattinson , who finished as Australia’s best bowler
with 5-96. Spin bowler Lyon took 3-215 in 47 overs.  India added 57 runs in about an hour after resuming day
four on 515-8.  The teams are scheduled to play four Tests, with matches
following in Hyderabad, Mohali and Delhi.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
