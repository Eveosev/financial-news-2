Nigeria’s naira depreciated to its
lowest in more than two months on speculation the central bank
won’t sell enough dollars to meet demand at auctions this week.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.2 percent to 157.70 per dollar as of 3:02 p.m. in Lagos, its
weakest on a closing basis since Dec. 19, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $150 million at an auction
today, with lenders buying the entire amount on sale, it said in
e-mailed statement. The regulator sold $240 million at its two
auctions last week, the lowest in five weeks. The naira gained
as much as 0.2 percent on Feb. 22 after an oil company was said
to sell $100 million. Oil producers, which sell dollars
periodically to meet local spending needs, are the second major
supplier after the central bank.  “Dollar demand increased as dealers speculate the oil
industry finished sales of the U.S currency and the central bank
won’t supply enough to meet demand at interbank trading,” Tunde
Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain
Investment Ltd., said by phone today. “Dealers needed more than
was supplied at today’s auction.”  The central bank held the benchmark interest rate at a
record high 12 percent for an eighth straight time on Jan. 21 to
control inflation and stabilize the naira.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose eight basis points to 10.56 percent, according
to Feb. 22 data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell six basis points to 4.374 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi depreciated for the sixth day by 0.1 percent
to 1.9150 per dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
