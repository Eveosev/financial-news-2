Crude options volatility rose as oil
fell after U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said a diplomatic
solution to the standoff on  Iranâ€™s nuclear program  was possible.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.73 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 3:55 p.m., up from 22.11 on Feb. 22.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery fell 2
cents to settle at $93.11 a barrel on the Nymex. Futures
extended the decline after the 2:30 p.m. close of floor trading
as the euro slipped 0.9 percent against the dollar, making
commodities priced in the U.S. currency less attractive.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $70 puts, which gained 1 cent to 9 cents on volume of 2,869
contracts at 4:09 p.m. in  New York . April $90 puts were the
second-most active with 2,636 lots. They rose 20 cents to $1.18
a barrel.  Puts accounted for 58 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the previous session, bearish bets made up 60 percent of the
111,650 contracts traded.  April $85 puts were the most active options traded Feb. 22,
with 6,098 contracts changing hands. They were down 19 cents to
27 cents a barrel. April $100 calls fell 2 cents to 13 cents on
4,467 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
34,763 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 34,431 and June
$90 puts at 32,311.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
