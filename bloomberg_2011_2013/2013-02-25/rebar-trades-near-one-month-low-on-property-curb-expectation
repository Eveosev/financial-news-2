Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near a one-month low in  Shanghai  as investors cut their
exposure to the building material amid signs of tighter control
on property investment.  Rebar for October delivery dropped by as much as 0.9
percent to 3,998  yuan  ($641) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange, the lowest since Jan. 22, before trading at
4,028 yuan at 10:32 a.m. local time. The contract lost 5.6
percent last week.  Chinese ministries and local governments may announce
detailed rules to tighten control of the  property market 
“soon,” China Securities Journal reported today, citing an
unidentified person. Premier  Wen Jiabao  last week told cities
that have had “excessively fast” price gains to impose home-
purchase restrictions.  “Expectations for more measures to curb property price
gains had an impact on rebar market sentiment,” Dang Man,
analyst at Maike Futures Co., said in a report today. “Prices
may decline in the short-term.”  Some of the measures will probably be announced before the
National People’s Congress and the  Chinese People’s Political
Consultative Conference , which begin next week, according to the
China Securities Journal report.  The average spot  price  for rebar fell 0.4 percent to 3,866
yuan a ton on Feb. 22, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery fell
1.7 percent to $153.60 a ton on Feb. 22, according to data
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
