Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., owner of
Africa’s biggest iron-ore operation, will go to court to
overturn a planned strike at its Kolomela mine.  The company wants a permit to strike on Feb. 27 that was
granted to the National Union of Mineworkers by the Commission
for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration to be reversed, Gert Schoeman, a spokesman, said by e-mail.  Kumba, a unit of  Anglo American Plc (AGL) , will ask the South
African Labour Court tomorrow to stop the planned strike,
according to Schoeman.  The union known as the NUM is disputing changes to service
conditions, specifically working hours.  “There’s no room for change of service,” said  Lesiba Seshoka , an NUM spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
