based chief investment officer of Allianz Global Investors  Japan 
Co., part of Allianz Global Investors that oversees about 302
billion euros ($398 billion). “Things are positive for Japanese
stocks, but you want to bear in mind that you may see overseas
uncertainty increase depending on the outcome of the Italian
election.”  Japan Policy  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 9.5 percent from the end
of October through Feb. 22 as Japanese shares rallied on
speculation the new government led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe

Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX) , the country’s broadest equity measure,

percent for its highest close since September 2008.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.8 percent and New

according to a statement from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today. That compares with the 52.3 final reading for
January and the 52.2 median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by

level in almost three years against the dollar, touching 94.77
before trading at 94.32. Japan’s central bank has “substantial
room” for further loosening and additional measures could be
justified this year, Kuroda said in a Feb. 11 interview.  JFE surged 8.6 percent to 2,105 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,

elections today, the first polls since there since Europe’s
financial crisis ushered in unelected leaders who imposed an
austerity program.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  dropped 5.2 percent to 294 yen in Tokyo after
two people familiar with talks for Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology
Group to invest in the television maker said they’ll probably
end March 26 without an agreement.  Property Tax  Hong Kong developers fell as residential property sales in
the city dropped, according to Midland Holdings Ltd., the city’s

property costing more than HK$2 million ($258,000) and loan
