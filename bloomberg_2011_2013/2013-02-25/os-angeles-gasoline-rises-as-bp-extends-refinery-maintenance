Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  widened
its premium to futures after  BP Plc (BP/)  extended maintenance on a
fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation unit at the second-
largest refinery in  Southern California .  BP expects to start the units at its Carson refinery
between Feb. 25 and March 8, a person familiar with operations
at the plant said. The refinery had previously planned to
restart the units between Feb. 18 and Feb. 25.  The 266,000-barrel-a-day refinery has 152,605 barrels a day
of catalytic cracking capacity. Catalytic crackers convert
heavier hydrocarbons into more valuable, lighter products like
gasoline and diesel.  California-blend gasoline in Los Angeles strengthened by
2.5 cents to 10.5 cents a gallon above futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 1:01 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The premium narrowed by 23.5 cents
in the three previous trading days.  California-blend gasoline in  San Francisco  strengthened by
1.5 cents, narrowing its discount to futures to 7.5 cents a
gallon. Conventional, 84-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
strengthened by 1 cent to a premium of 11.5 cents a gallon.  Diesel in all three markets remained unchanged from Feb.
22, the most recent trading day. California-blend diesel in Los
Angeles was 14.75 cents a gallon above heating oil futures on
the Nymex. In San Francisco, the premium was 12.75 cents. In
Portland, the premium of low-sulfur diesel was 7.75 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
