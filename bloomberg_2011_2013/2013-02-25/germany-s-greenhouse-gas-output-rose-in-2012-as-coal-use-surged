Germany ’s greenhouse gas emissions
rose 1.6 percent last year as more coal was burned to generate
power, according to the  Environment Ministry .  Carbon dioxide emissions led the increase with a 2 percent
jump, the ministry said today, citing preliminary data from the
Federal Environment Agency. Germany emitted 931 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalents last year as the use of
lignite rose 5.1 percent, it said.  “We must make sure that this was an exception and that it
doesn’t become a trend that’s repeated,” Environment Minister
Peter Altmaier said at a press conference today in Berlin.
Germany needs the right incentives so that companies develop and
use carbon-efficient technologies and turn to gas rather than
coal to generate power, he said.  Month-ahead  profit  at coal-fired power stations in Germany
averaged 8.57 euros a megawatt-hour last year, compared with
minus 9.02 euros at gas-fed plants, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Germany,  Europe ’s biggest economy, reduced its greenhouse
gas output 25.5 percent since 1990, exceeding its commitments
under the Kyoto Protocol, according to the ministry. The
European Union should set more ambitious climate protection
targets to reduce a surplus of permits in the emissions trading
system and curb a trend toward increased coal use, Jochen Flasbarth, president of Germany’s Federal Environment Agency,
said at the press conference.  View this version of the story  To contact the reporter on this story:
