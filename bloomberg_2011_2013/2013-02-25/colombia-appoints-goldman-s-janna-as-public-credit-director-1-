Colombian Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas named Michel Janna of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , as the
country’s new Director of Public Credit.  Janna, who has a doctorate in economics from Northwestern
University in  Illinois , was Goldman’s head of sovereign risk for
the Americas, the Finance Ministry said today in an e-mailed
statement.  He has also worked for Citibank in New York, and as a
specialist on financial stability at Colombia’s central bank,
according to the Finance Ministry.  Janna did not return a call requesting comment.  Departing Public Credit Director Maria Fernanda Suarez said

for “strictly personal reasons.”  Before joining the Finance Ministry, Suarez, 38, was Chief
Investment Officer at AFP Porvenir,  Grupo Aval Acciones y
Valores (AVAL)  SA’s pension fund. She has also worked in the fixed
