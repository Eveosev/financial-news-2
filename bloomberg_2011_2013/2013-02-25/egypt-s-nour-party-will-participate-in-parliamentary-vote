Egypt ’s Salafi Nour Party said it
would participate in parliamentary elections slated to begin in
April, and called on other political groups to follow its lead.  The announcement came hours after President Mohamed Mursi
invited political groups to meet and discuss their concerns
about the four-stage vote set to begin April 22. The largely
secular and youth activist opposition has said the call for the
vote will only inflame the country’s current political crisis
and has so far rejected his invitations to talk in a bid to
bridge differences.  The ultraconservative Nour had backed the opposition in
calls for a national unity government to replace Prime Minister
Hisham Qandil’s, which critics say has failed to revive the
economy or bring stability to the Arab world’s most populous
nation.  Nour, which saw one of its members pushed out of the post
of presidential adviser, supports the vote to “complete the
building of state institutions to solve the country’s
problems,” Bassam El-Zarqa, an official with the party, said in
a televised press conference aired on Al-Jazeera Mubashir Misr,
the local branch of the pan-Arab satellite channel. El-Zarqa had
quit his post as an aide to Mursi in solidarity to the dismissal
of the other Nour official.  “We urge all political parties to participate in the
upcoming elections,” he said, adding that they demanded
“guarantees” over the vote’s integrity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
