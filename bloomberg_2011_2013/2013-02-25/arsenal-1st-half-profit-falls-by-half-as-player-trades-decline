Arsenal said its first-half profit
declined by more than 50 percent as the London soccer team made
less from player sales and its property development costs rose.  Net income fell to 14.9 million pounds ($22.5 million), or
239.52 pounds a share, in the six months ended Nov. 30, compared
with 38 million pounds, or 611.55 pounds a share, in the year-
earlier period, the Premier League club said today on its
website.  Arsenal’s profit from player sales declined 20.5 million
pounds to 42.5 million pounds in the period after it sold
captain Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona in 2011. The team’s operating
costs from the redevelopment of its old Highbury Stadium jumped
to 30.4 million pounds, from 2.7 million in the 2011 period.
Total operating expenses rose 27 percent to 157.1 million
pounds.  “Whilst we have our sights set on a 16th straight season
in the Champions League, our aims are higher,” Chairman Peter Hill-Wood said in the statement. “Our ambition is to win
trophies.”  The team is in fifth place in the Premier League, one spot
out of the positions for Europe’s elite Champions League
competition.  Arsenal had 123.4 million pounds in cash and deposits at
the end of November 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
