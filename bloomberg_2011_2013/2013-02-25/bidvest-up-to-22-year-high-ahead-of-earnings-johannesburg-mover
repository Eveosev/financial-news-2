Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT) , a diversified
South African company specializing in food manufacturing and
packaging, rose to a 22-year high ahead of an expected earnings
report for the half year through December.  The  stock  gained as much as 3.1 percent, the biggest
intraday gain in almost two months, and traded 2.2 percent
higher at 241.6 rand by 1:20 p.m., in Johannesburg. The shares
are at their highest since at least August 1990, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bidvest said on Feb. 19 it sees headline earnings per share
excluding a 399 million rand ($45 million) one-time profit to be
between 17 percent and 19 percent higher for the six months
through December, compared with the same period in 2011. It
expects to report the official figures on or about March 4.  “Their trading statement has been a big actor in the
recent week,” said Mark Hodgson, an analyst at Cape Town-based
Avior Research Pty Ltd., in a phone interview. “There is a lot
of feel good factor.”  Bidvest shares have gained 12 percent this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with a 2 percent rise in
the 165-member FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share index.  “I am pretty confident that their earnings for the second
half will be at a slower pace,” Hodgson said. “It depends on
the South African economy. About 60 percent of their earnings
are from the country.”  South African GDP probably grew at an annualized rate of
1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to a median
estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The continent’s
biggest economy is expected to expand 2.5 percent this year,
down from a 3 percent estimate in Finance Minister’s Pravin Gordhan’s Oct. 25 mid-term budget.  Bidvest stock is trading at a relative strength index above
70 for a fifth straight day. A reading above 70 usually means
that the stock is overbought.  “It’s certainly going to consolidate with investors
reassessing,” Hodgson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
