Pier Luigi Bersani’s potential
Italian election victory, forecast in an initial poll as ballot
boxes closed, was placed in doubt by a rival pollster as the
 Interior Ministry  began counting votes.  Italian bonds pared gains after an IPR projection of
partial results from the ministry suggested Bersani may have
lost Senate races in Sicily and Campania to former Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi . A SkyTG24 Tecne poll earlier gave
those two battleground regions to Bersani.  Italy’s pollsters are crunching data as it comes in from
the ministry to project the winner in both houses of parliament
in the four-way race. Berlusconi, a three-time premier, garnered
34 percent of the vote in Sicily, compared with 26.4 percent for
Bersani, according to IPR. State-broadcaster RAI projected
Berlusconi got 32 percent of votes cast for the Senate, compared
with 29 percent for Bersani.  Italian 10-year bond yields fell 10 basis points to 4.34
percent after falling to as low as 4.17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
