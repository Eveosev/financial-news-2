Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South
African bank controlled by  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , said full-year profit
climbed 20 percent after winning more than half a million new
customers.  Net income rose to 7.8 billion rand ($878 million), from
6.5 billion rand in 2011, the Johannesburg-based lender said in
a statement today. Earnings per share excluding one-time items
climbed 21 percent to 16.46 rand, beating the 16.21-rand mean
 estimate  of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “This was a solid set of results in a difficult trading
environment,” Nedbank Chief Executive Officer  Mike Brown  said
in an interview. Bad debts fell 2.5 percent to 5.2 billion rand
after an improvement in the credit-loss ratio, he said.  Nedbank,  South Africa ’s fourth-largest lender by assets,
combined its private banking operations into one unit and
introduced mobile-banking applications to attract customers. The
bank also expanded outside South Africa’s biggest cities to
increase its share of the low-income market, which helped create
450 jobs and attract 655,000 new clients last year.  The lender, which will ensure executive bonuses are
“appropriately restrained,” plans to exercise its right to
take a 20 percent stake in Togo’s  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  in
November, according to Brown. Ecobank has operations in more
African countries than any other lender.  Nedbank rose 0.8 percent to 189.50 rand in Johannesburg.
The bank boosted its full-year dividend more than 24 percent to
7.52 rand a share.  Nedbank will “probably” sell bonds this year to help meet
stricter Basel III capital rules, said Brown, without giving
further details. The lender will continue to issue senior
unsecured debt to lengthen its funding profile, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
