ITT Educational Services Inc. (ESI) , a
for-profit college that focuses on technology, tumbled as much
as 14 percent after disclosing that U.S. regulators subpoenaed
documents related to private loan programs for its students.  The Securities and Exchange Commission demanded documents
relating to “actions and accounting” for the programs, which
helped students pay for education costs that weren’t covered by
state, federal and other funding sources, Carmel, Indiana-based
ITT said Feb. 22 in a filing.  ITT fell  13 percent to $16.17 at 10:59 a.m. in  New York 
trading. Earlier the shares slid as low as $16.05, the most in
almost four weeks. The stock had lost three-quarters of its
value in the past year before today.  Congress, along with state and federal investigators, has
been probing for-profit colleges’ recruitment practices and
students’ debt loads after leaving school. The SEC’s subpoena
asked for documents related to agreements ITT made with outside
entities to loan funds to students, according to the filing.  ITT Educational said in the filing that it’s cooperating
with the SEC. Lauren Littlefield, a spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
