Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225  Stock Average closing at its highest in nearly four
and a half years, as the yen fell amid speculation Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s likely nominee for the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s
governorship is supportive of more monetary stimulus.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, rose 1.4
percent. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd.,  Japan ’s third-largest
shipping line, jumped 12 percent after industry leader A.P.
Moeller-Maersk A/S said growth in global container demand will
accelerate. Sharp Corp. led declines on the Nikkei 225 after two
people familiar with the matter said talks with Taiwan’s Foxconn
Technology Group to invest in the television maker will probably
end without an agreement,  The Nikkei 225 increased 2.4 percent to 11,662.52 in Tokyo,
closing at its highest since Sept. 29, 2008, after a government
official with knowledge of the discussions said Abe is preparing
to present Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda as a
candidate to replace BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa. The Topix
Index rose 1.8 percent to 980.70, with all but one of the
gauge’s 33  industry groups  advancing.  “Kuroda as chief would be the perfect line-up to implement
more monetary stimulus measures as desired by the prime
minister,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , senior strategist at Okasan
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “That’s going to be good for the
market.”  The Topix surged 36 percent since Nov. 14, when elections
were announced, amid optimism Abe and the central bank will lead
the country out of deflation. The measure is trading at 1.15
times  book value , compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Kuroda as Chief  Kuroda, speaking in a Feb. 11 interview, said Japan’s
central bank has “really substantial room” for further
loosening and that additional measures could be justified this
year. He also advocated an inflation target more than a decade
before the BOJ adopted the policy in January.  Exporters rose as the yen dropped to its lowest in almost
three years against the dollar. The Japanese currency has
dropped almost 7 percent this year against a basket of
currencies, the biggest decliner among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Toyota rose 1.4 percent to 4,795 yen. Honda Motor Co.,
which counts  North America  as its biggest market for sales,
gained 1.6 percent to 3,525 yen. Sony Corp., which gets nearly
70 percent of its revenue outside of Japan, advanced 3.4 percent
to 1,340 yen.  Stocks also rose on optimism Japan may join the Trans-
Pacific Partnership trade agreement. Abe told reporters in
 Washington  that he wanted to decide on whether to enter the
talks as soon as possible after he met with U.S. President
 Barack Obama .  Trade Deal  Should Japan join the TPP agreement, the Nikkei 225 may
rise to 14,500 by the end of this year as it may result in
significant economic growth, Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a
report today.  Shipping companies jumped, with the  Marine Transport index 
gaining the most among the 33 industry Topix groups. Kawasaki
Kisen surged 12 percent to 203 yen.  Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s
biggest shipping line, advanced 5.5 percent to 232 yen. Mitsui
O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the No. 2, increased 4.6 percent to 322 yen.  Shipping Lines  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the world’s largest shipping
company, forecast higher earnings this year as global container
demand growth accelerates.  Among stocks that dropped, Sharp slumped 5.2 percent to 294
yen, declining the most on the Nikkei 225. The company’s talks
with Foxconn Technology about investment in the Japanese company
will probably end March 26 without an agreement, two people
familiar with the discussions said.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index climbed 2 percent
to 27.98, indicating traders expect a swing of about 8 percent
of the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on the
measure was about 8.3 percent below its 30-day intraday average
at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
