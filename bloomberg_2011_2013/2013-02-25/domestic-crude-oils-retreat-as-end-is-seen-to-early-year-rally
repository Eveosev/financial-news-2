Nine different U.S. crudes lost more
than $1 a barrel relative to U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate.  On the  Gulf Coast , Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI
shrank $1.85 to $21.15 a barrel at 3:24 p.m. New York time while
Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium was cut $1.10 a barrel to
$22.15. The discount of  WTI to Brent crude  in  London  widened by
36 cents, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re down two bucks across the board here, everything
from Bakken to light sweet to heavy sour,”  Stephen Schork , the
president of Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said
by phone. “The whole complex has turned the corner. It’s had a
hell of a ride the first two months of this year.”  The premium for Mars Blend  dropped $1.90 to $18.60 over
WTI, while  Thunder Horse  slipped $1.15 to $20.25 a barrel over
the benchmark. Poseidon’s premium to WTI lost $3.95 to $16.80 a
barrel.  Bakken crude lost $1.75 a barrel to a discount of $2.50 a
barrel to WTI.  Bitumen-based blend Western Canada Select crude narrowed
its discount to WTI $1.50 to $24.50 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude, a synthetic light, sweet oil
upgraded from bitumen, gained $1.50 a barrel to a $2.50 premium
to WTI.  Pipeline nominations for domestic crude shipments end three
trading days after the expiration of the Nymex futures contract,
and the period is characterized by light volumes and volatile
price changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
