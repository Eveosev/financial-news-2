Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , the third-
largest solar-panel maker, invested in 15 solar-energy projects
in North Carolina that are expected to be completed by the end
of this year.  The portfolio will total 85 megawatts of generating
capacity, mainly consisting of 6-megawatt systems, Canadian
Solar said today in a statement. The first project will be
completed in February, a 6.4-megawatt system in Wake County
named Fuquay Farm. Terms of the investment and project costs
weren’t disclosed.  Canadian Solar will supply all of the modules needed, David
Pasquale, a spokesman, said today by telephone.  Canadian Solar, based in Guelph, Ontario, makes its
photovoltaic products in China. The projects are being developed
jointly with Strata Solar LLC, a closely held company based in
Chapel Hill,  North Carolina .  Strata  said  Feb. 11 that it plans to complete a 100-
megawatt solar farm in North Carolina next year, which would be
the largest on the U.S. East Coast.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. and  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  are the two
largest solar-panel makers by module capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
