Brazil may pass a law next year
requiring power utilities to install electric-vehicle charging
stations as the nation seeks to spur investments by carmakers in
local factories, according to a lawmaker.  Utilities including  Eletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade
de Sao Paulo SA (ELPL4)  and  Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina SA  will
have to develop the charging infrastructure in urban areas and
along public roads, according to Onofre Santo Agostini, a member
of the lower house who represents the  Social Democratic Party ,
known as PSD, in Santa Catarina state. Agostini co-authored the
 bill  with Heuler Cruvinel, also of the PSD.  Carmakers will only develop new production lines for
electric cars if the infrastructure is in place to support the
vehicles, Agostini said in a telephone interview today from
Brasilia.  “No one’s going to invest if there isn’t a law in place
mandating the creation of this infrastructure,” he said.  The law also requires the government to promote the
installation of recharge points in residential areas and
garages, according to the bill.  The legislation needs to be approved by three lower-house
commissions before it moves to the Senate for a vote, which may
happen by the end of the year, he said.  Europe  has more than 1,500 charging stations for electric
vehicles and is installing more, according to the bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
