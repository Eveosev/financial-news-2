Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-
largest gold producer by market value, is looking for further
acquisitions as many projects face higher-than-expected
operating costs.  “We are very good at acquiring a lot of high-quality
projects and we continue to look for them,” Chief Executive
Officer Chuck Jeannes said today in an interview with Bloomberg
Television’s Alix Steel from Hollywood,  Florida .  Goldcorp sees more projects becoming available because
their developers underestimated rising costs, Jeannes said today
in a separate interview from the BMO Capital Markets mining
conference. Goldcorp’s average cost to produce and sell gold
rose 17 percent to $621 per ounce in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier, the Vancouver-based company said on Feb. 14.  “There’s been a lot of projects out there that have had a
very unrealistic view of the world in terms of capital costs and
operating costs and as those views are updated the market is
responding accordingly,” he said.  Goldcorp rose 1.3 percent to C$33.64 at the close in
Toronto.  To contact the reporters on this story:
