PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  plans to sell bonds in
a benchmark offering that may include floating-rate debt.  The worldâ€™s largest snack-food maker may issue three-year
notes with a coupon linked to the London interbank offered rate,
fixed-rate debt with a similar maturity, or a combination of the
two, according to a person familiar with the transaction. The
offering may also include 10-year bonds, said the person, who
asked not to be identified, citing lack of authorization to
speak publicly.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, the
Purchase, New York-based company said today in a regulatory
filing. Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from
one another, is the standard for about $360 trillion of
financial products. Benchmark offerings are typically at least
$500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
