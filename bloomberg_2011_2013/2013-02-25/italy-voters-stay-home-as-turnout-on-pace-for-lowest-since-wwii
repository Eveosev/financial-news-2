Italian voter turnout fell in the
first day of parliamentary elections, setting a pace for a post-
World War II low, as rain and snow slowed the trek to ballot
boxes.  Turnout fell to  55 percent  of voters as of 10 p.m.
yesterday in Rome from 63 percent at a comparable point during
elections in 2008, according to the  Interior Ministry . The four-
way race for the premiership ends today at 3 p.m.  “I’m not voting, there’s no one to vote for,” said Titti
Palumbo, a retired grandmother of two who was at a polling
station in Rome accompanying a friend. “I hope abstention sends
a message. I want different candidates.”  Voter participation has declined from more than 90 percent
in the 1970s to 81 percent five years ago when  Silvio Berlusconi 
won his third election. This year, voters are picking a new
leader after the 15-month caretaker administration of  Mario Monti , the  euro zone ’s only unelected head of government. The
February vote is unusual for Italy, which usually holds ballots
between April and June.  Italian 10-year bond yields fell 3 basis points to 4.41
percent at 11:40 a.m. in Rome today.  Pier Luigi Bersani, the front-runner, is seeking to hold
onto a lead he had in opinion surveys two weeks ago when a
polling blackout began. Berlusconi, Monti and populist Beppe Grillo are challenging for votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
