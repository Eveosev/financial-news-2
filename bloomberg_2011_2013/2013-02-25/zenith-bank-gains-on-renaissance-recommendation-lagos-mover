 Renaissance Capital  recommended buying the stock.  The shares climbed 2.8 percent to 21.08 naira at the close

25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company has
rallied 8.2 percent this year, compared with a 21 percent

part of a sub-saharan share portfolio which includes African
lenders including  Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) , analysts led by Herman Van Papendorp wrote in a note today. “Nigerian banks have cheaper
valuations.”  Nigeria implemented banking reforms after bank loans to
stock market speculators triggered a debt crisis in 2008 and
2009. The central bank fired eight chief executives of the
country’s 24 banks and set up a company to buy lenders’ bad
debts and stabilize the industry.  Zenith Bank, valued at about 661.8 billion naira ($4.2
