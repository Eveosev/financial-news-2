Gasoline rose a second consecutive
day in New York on concern refinery shutdowns will tighten
supply as demand picks up in April.  Futures advanced as much as 2.1 percent. Gasoline is the
top performer this year on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI  index  of
24 commodities. The April  crack spread , or premium of gasoline
over West Texas Intermediate crude on Nymex, gained 18 cents to
$44.21 a barrel and touched a record $45.19. The spread versus
Brent crude on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in  London  slipped
36 cents to $22.70 a barrel.  “Gas has come back really strong,” said  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “The main driver is worries about all the offline
refinery production as we get near the usual seasonal step-up in
demand.”  March-delivery gasoline rose 1.11 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$3.0907 a gallon at 10:10 a.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on volume that was 34 percent above the five-year
average for the time of day. The fuel has gained 9.9 percent
this year.  Seasonal plant maintenance typically peaks in March and
April. Refineries used 82.9 percent of capacity in the week
ended Feb. 5, the lowest level in 11 months, according to data
from the Energy Information Administration.  Gasoline Imports  Gasoline imports slipped to a four-week low. Hess Corp. is
scheduled to permanently close its Port Reading, New Jersey,
plant this week, increasing the East Coast’s reliance on
imports. The refinery represents 7.7 percent of East Coast
gasoline-making capacity, estimated  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  “The big question for the Northeast will be if they can
get enough summer-grade gasoline from Europe and other import
locations,” Lipow said.  Retail gasoline, averaged nationwide, was unchanged at
$3.777 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. The fuel has
jumped 15 percent this year to within 15.9 cents of last year’s
high of $3.936, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for March delivery rose 2.96 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.1338 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
