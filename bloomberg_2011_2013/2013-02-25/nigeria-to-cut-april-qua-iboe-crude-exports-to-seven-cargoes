Nigeria plans to load seven Qua Iboe
crude cargoes in April, down from nine in March, according to a
preliminary loading plan. The programs exclude shipments that
were deferred.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities. Each cargo is of 950,000
barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
