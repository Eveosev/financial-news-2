Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the U.K.’s largest
grocer, said it plans to create 1,900 jobs at two new
distribution sites in Reading and Dagenham, and close three
existing sites.  “We’ve been reviewing our distribution network, and have
today confirmed plans to close some of our current distribution
centers and open new ones that will give our customers a better
service and improve working conditions for our colleagues,”
according to an e-mailed statement from a Tesco spokeswoman.  At the same time, the Cheshunt, U.K.-based retailer will
close centers in Harlow, Weybridge and Chesterfield with a
combined workforce of 1,850.  “Colleagues who are affected will be offered jobs at other
Tesco sites, including at the two new distribution sites,” the
spokeswoman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
