India’s (SENSEX)  benchmark stock index held
around the year’s lowest level before the  federal budget  later
this week. Software exporters advanced as  Reliance Industries (RIL) 
Ltd. and Oil &  Natural Gas  Corp. declined.  The 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex index increased less than 0.1
percent to 19,331.69 at the close in Mumbai. The measure last
week closed at its lowest since Dec. 24, capping four straight
weeks of losses.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  and  Infosys
Ltd. (INFO) , the biggest software makers, added more than 1 percent.
Reliance Industries, owner of the world’s largest refining
complex, lost 1 percent. Oil & Natural Gas tumbled 1.9 percent.  Foreigners have bought a net $8.2 billion of local shares
since Jan. 1, adding to last year’s purchases of $24.5 billion,
even as the statistics office on Feb. 7 said economic expansion
this year will be the weakest in a decade and data on Feb. 12
showed factory output fell for a second month in December. The
Sensex has lost 0.5 percent this year, the worst-performing
benchmark gauge in Asia after  Malaysia .  “The market looks a bit tired at the moment, perhaps it is
waiting for the budget,” Tarun Kataria, chief executive officer
at Religare Capital Markets, said on Bloomberg TV  India  today.
“The trajectory should continue to be higher because there’s a
lot of money out there.” The Sensex may reach 23,000 by the
year-end “on inflows, not fundamentals,” he said.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, due to present
the budget on Feb. 28, is under pressure to limit spending and
keep his pledge to cut the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in four
years, from a targeted 5.3 percent for the fiscal year ending
March. The economy will grow 5 percent this year, the least
since the 4 percent gain in the 2002 to 2003 period, according
to the statistics office.  Technology Stocks  Infosys jumped 2.7 percent to 2,917.8 rupees, extending
this year’s rally to 26 percent, the most among the 30 Sensex
companies. Larger rival Tata Consultancy added 1.3 percent to
1,473.7 rupees, a record.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest, rose
0.7 percent to 419.1 rupees.  Reliance Industries lost 1 percent to 854.35 rupees. Oil &
Natural Gas tumbled 1.9 percent to 317.9 rupees, paring this
year’s advance to 19 percent.  The Sensex has fallen 3.8 percent from a two-year high
reached on Jan. 25 as profits from  State Bank  of India to Tata
Motors Ltd. missed  estimates  and as local mutual funds saw net
outflows for the eighth month in January, data and the industry
trade body show. Profits at 43 percent of the Sensex companies
trailed estimates in the three months through Dec. 31, compared
with 40 percent in the previous two quarters, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  ‘Investor Friendly’  “The market has been driven by foreigners and domestic
investors have been using the rally to sell, and unless there is
something very investor-friendly in the budget we are likely to
continue the same way,” Sajiv Dhawan, managing director of
brokerage JV Capital Services, told Bloomberg TV India today.
“It really depends on what the finance minister says.”  The Sensex index trades at 13.7 times  projected 12-month
profits , compared with 10.2 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Volumes on the Sensex
were 20 percent less than the 30-day average at the close. The
CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index of the National Stock Exchange of India added
less than 0.1 percent to 5,854.75. India VIX, which measures the
cost of protection against declines in the Nifty, fell 0.4
percent to 16.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
