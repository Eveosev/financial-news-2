Airbus SAS expects airlines in Asia
Pacific to buy 9,870 aircraft worth $1.6 trillion in the next
two decades fueled by travel growth in the region.  Wide-body aircraft, or planes with twin aisles, will lead
the demand, Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy said in
Singapore today.  Asia-Pacific will lead demand for new aircraft as economic
growth in the region will help boost the number of middle class
population by almost five-times by 2031, according to Airbus.
Global demand for new passenger and cargo planes are expected to
reach 28,200 by 2031, worth $4 trillion, Airbus said in
September.  About 50 low-fare airlines are competing with full-service
carriers to boost their share of traffic in Asia-Pacific.
 Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) ’s Scoot and  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) ’s
Jetstar Airways Pty are among those that have ordered aircraft
worth about $47 billion from Boeing and Airbus for delivery over
the next 10 years.  The region will account for 33 percent of global passengers
in 2016, according to the International Air Transport
Association. Budget carriers’ market share in the Asia-Pacific
region rose to 24 percent last year from 1.1 percent in 2001,
according to the CAPA Centre for Aviation, an industry
consultancy.  Travel within Asia Pacific overtook intra-North America as
the world’s biggest aviation market in 2009, according to IATA.
The region’s passenger growth, both domestic and international,
is expected to add about 380 million travelers between 2012 and
2016 to 1.2 billion, IATA forecast in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
