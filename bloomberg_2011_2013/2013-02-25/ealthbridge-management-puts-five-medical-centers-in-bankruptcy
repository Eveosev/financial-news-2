HealthBridge Management LLC put five
Connecticut nursing homes into bankruptcy, citing burdensome
union costs. HealthBridge itself didn’t file.  The centers are Long Ridge of Stamford, and the Westport,
Newington, West River and Danbury Health Care Centers, listing
as much as $50 million in assets and debts, according to papers
filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Newark,  New Jersey .  “The centers have a bright future if they can operate
under labor agreements that reflect today’s financial
realities,” Lisa Crutchfield, HealthBridge labor relations vice
president, said in a company statement today.  She said the filings won’t affect patient care or the
operation of other nursing facilities. Without court protection
from creditors, the centers would be losing $1.3 million a month
faced with “the crushing burden of unsustainable labor costs,”
she said.  The case is In re 710 Long Ridge Road Operating Co. II LLC,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporters on this story:
