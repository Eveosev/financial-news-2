Japan ’s government will sell a stake
in  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  for about $10.3 billion to help cover
reconstruction costs of the 2011 earthquake in the country’s
largest share offering in three years.  The Ministry of Finance owns about 1 billion shares, or 50
percent, of the cigarette maker and will offer as many as 333.3
million shares next month, it said yesterday in a regulatory
filing. Based on yesterday’s closing price of 2,901 yen a share,
the stake is worth about 967 billion yen ($10.3 billion).  Japan Tobacco gained about 34 percent in  Tokyo  trading
since mid-November, when the yen started weakening, boosting the
value of the overseas earnings that account for more than half
of operating income. The slumping Japanese currency spurred a 35
percent rally in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average in the
same period.  “The timing for the sale is really good,” said  Mitsushige Akino ,  executive director  at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co.
“Japan Tobacco could pass as a good defensive stock, or a
growth stock for its overseas business.”  The maker of Winston, Camel and Mild Seven brand cigarettes
plans to buy back as many as 118 million of the shares for as
much as 250 billion yen, it said yesterday in a statement.  The stock fell as much as 3.3 percent to 2,805 yen before
trading at 2,863 yen at 10:38 a.m. in Tokyo today.  At the top price for the maximum number of shares, the
company will pay 2,119 yen a share, about 27 percent below
yesterday’s closing price. The buyback will be between Feb. 27
and March 8, according to the statement.  March Pricing  The share sale may be priced as early as March 11,
according to the filing. The transaction would be the largest in
the country since Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co.’s $11 billion
initial public offering in February 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Daiwa Securities Group Inc.
are joint global coordinators for the sale, while JPMorgan Chase
& Co., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Nomura
Holdings Inc., Mizuho International Plc and UBS Investment Bank
AG are among those managing the transaction, according to an e-
mailed prospectus.  The  finance ministry  delayed a sale initially targeted for
last year amid an economic slump. Under a law passed in 2011,
the government can sell its stake down to about 33 percent of
the company.  Share sales announced in Japan last year jumped 33 percent
by value to 1.82 trillion yen, led by Japan Airlines Co.’s 663
billion yen initial public offering, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. About 133 billion yen in share sales have been
announced so far this year in the country, excluding Japan
Tobacco, the data show.  Quake Budget  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month increased the
budget for rebuilding after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami by 6
trillion yen to 25 trillion yen.  The government said the spending would be partly financed
by sales of stakes the government holds, including Japan
Tobacco. The budget for the fiscal year ending March 31 includes
an estimated 500.3 billion from the Japan Tobacco share sale, an
amount that would rise given the increase in the market price.  Japan Tobacco last month raised its net income forecast to
330 billion yen for the year ending March 31, citing the effect
of the weaker yen, compared with a previous outlook for 318
billion yen. The shares have gained 19 percent this year.  The yen has lost about 15 percent against the  U.S. dollar 
since mid-November, raising the value of overseas proceeds for
companies from Japan Tobacco to Toyota Motor Corp.  Japan is rebuilding northeastern coastal areas damaged by
the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. A record 9.0-magnitude
earthquake struck March 11 that year causing a tsunami that left
about 19,000 dead or missing and forced the evacuation of
160,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
