Netia SA (NET)  rose to its highest level
in two weeks after a newspaper reported Poland’s second-largest
phone company hired Morgan Stanley to look for an investor to
replace stakes owned by two private equity funds.  The  stock  advanced 4.2 percent to 4.23 zloty, its highest
level since Feb. 11, in Warsaw. Shares traded were 30 percent of
the three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Morgan Stanley will look for an industry or financial
investor interested in buying Netia’s shares held by private
equity funds Third Avenue Management LLC and Sisu Capital Ltd.,
Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reported today, citing people with
knowledge of the deal. Third Avenue owns an 18 percent  stake  in
the phone operator while Sisu has a 11.5 percent holding, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The market has been speculating for years that Netia
could be taken over by a new strategic shareholder, while the
media have constantly discussed the never-ending interest of
such parties,” Piotr Owdziej, an analyst at KBC Securities SA
in Warsaw, said in a research note today. “It now seems that
Netia’s management has decided to help this speculation come
true.”  Malgorzata Babik, a spokeswoman for the company, declined
to comment when contacted by phone by Bloomberg News today.
Michael Wang, a spokesman for  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in  London , also
declined to comment when reached by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
