Iranian parliamentarians are working
on a plan that would require the government to ensure a
sustained supply of “essential goods” to needy Iranians,
 Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported.  Members of parliament yesterday approved the outline of a
plan to distribute rice, cooking oil, meat and other foods to
poor Iranians every three months, the Tehran-based newspaper
said. It didn’t specify the quantities.  Since the plan doesn’t involve cash distribution it will
not have inflationary effects on the economy, said lawmaker
Hossein Garousi, one of 144 deputies backing the plan, according
to Donya.  Iran  is battling a currency decline, partly as a result of
U.S. and European Union economic sanctions, that has pushed
inflation to about 30 percent, according to official figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
