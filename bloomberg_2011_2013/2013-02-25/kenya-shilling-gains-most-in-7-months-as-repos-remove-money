Kenya ’s shilling appreciated the
most in almost seven months as the central bank removed the
highest amount of the currency from the market this year and
investors paid for treasury bonds.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy advanced as
much as 0.6 percent to 86.95 per dollar, the biggest gain on a
closing basis since July 30. The currency traded 0.3 percent
stronger at 87.15 by 4:41 p.m. in Nairobi.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 16 billion shillings
($184 million) of bids for nine-day repurchase agreements today,
according to a central bank official, who asked not to be
identified in line with policy. It sold the nine-day repos
rather than the usual seven-day securities due to elections
being held on March 4, the official said. The bank uses the
repos to reduce money supply and support the shilling.  “The shilling has received support from the removal of
more money from the market by the central bank and investors
settling their successful bids of treasury bonds,” Duncan Kinuthia, head of trading at Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd.
“There is an increase of dollar inflows from non-governmental
organizations for their end-of-the-month bills”.  Investors paid today for the 25.5 billion shillings of two-
year and 15-year treasury bonds sold at an auction on Feb. 20,
according to the bank website.  Kenya will hold its presidential vote next week, the first
since a disputed 2007 ballot sparked two months of violence in
which more than 1,100 people died.  Uganda’s currency climbed for a second day, rising 0.9
percent to 2,647, the biggest gain since Dec 24, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Tanzanian shilling rallied 0.6
percent to 1,627 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
