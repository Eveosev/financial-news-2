Hiscox Ltd. (HSX) , the second-biggest
Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value, plans to return 200
million pounds ($303 million) to shareholders after pretax
profit surged more than 12-fold. The shares jumped.  Hiscox will pay shareholders 38 pence a share in special
dividends, worth about 150 million pounds, in addition to its 12
pence-a-share final dividend, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based
insurer said today in a statement. Pretax profit rose to 217
million pounds in 2012 from 17.3 million pounds in the previous
year, beating the 197.3 million-pound average estimate of 15
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The 2012 results, the positive outlook statement and the
return of capital should be received well by the market this
morning,”  Eamonn Flanagan , a Liverpool, England-based analyst
at  Shore Capital Group Ltd. (SGR)  with a buy rating on the stock,
wrote in a note to clients.  Commercial insurers, including Hiscox,  Beazley Plc (BEZ)  and
 Lancashire Holdings Plc (LRE) , are paying special dividends to
shareholders after premium rates rose following 2011, the most
costly year for natural disasters on record. The increased
premiums helped insurers make profits in spite of Hurricane
Sandy, which struck New Jersey and New York last year and is
forecast to cost insurers $20 billion to $25 billion by Risk
Management Solutions.  The shares rose as much as 4.7 percent, the biggest gain
since Nov. 28, 2011, and closed at 514.50 pence in London, up
3.2 percent.  “We’ve had the three most expensive years on record in the
last eight years starting in 2005” with  Hurricane Katrina ,
Chief Executive Officer Bronek Masojada said in an interview.
“Insurance pricing has adjusted to the fact that we’re living
in a more volatile world in terms of natural catastrophes.”  Hiscox’s board decided to return capital to shareholders
after achieving 16.9 percent return on equity in 2012. “I can
see growth but not at 17 percent” in 2013, Masojada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
