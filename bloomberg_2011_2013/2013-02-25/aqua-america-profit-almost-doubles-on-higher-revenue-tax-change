  Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , the second-
biggest U.S. water utility by market value, said profit almost
doubled in the fourth quarter, helped by higher sales and a tax
accounting change.  Net income jumped to $66.6 million from $34 million a year
earlier,  Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania-based Aqua America said in a
statement, citing a 12 percent increase in revenue to $187.5
million and a tax deduction for 2012 infrastructure investments.  Aqua America is undertaking infrastructure improvements
including replacing pipes and upgrading water plants. In late
2011, the utility started a venture with Penn Virginia Resource
Partners LP to supply water to natural-gas drillers in the
Marcellus Shale. That business is already profitable, with
pipelines pumping 120 million gallons of water to date,
eliminating 24,000 water-truck trips on roads, it said today.  Aqua America, whose biggest publicly traded competitor in
the U.S. is  American Water Works Co. (AWK) , has risen 14 percent this
year in New York. The utility acquired 18 water companies and
wastewater systems last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
