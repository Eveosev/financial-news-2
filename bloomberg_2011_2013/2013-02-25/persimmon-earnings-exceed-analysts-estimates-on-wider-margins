Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s largest
homebuilder by market value, said annual profit rose 56 percent
as the company sold more homes at higher prices.  Net income increased to 170.2 million pounds ($258
million), or 55.7 pence a share, from 109 million pounds, or
35.9 pence, a year ago, the company said today in a statement.
Analysts expected earnings of about 52 pence a share, the
average of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s all about mortgages and I’m encouraged to see the
improvement that there’s been,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Farley said in an interview. The Bank of  England ’s Funding for
Lending Scheme has helped and “we’re seeing lower rates as a
result. There is a greater appetite from lenders,” he said.  Farley, who has been chief executive of the York, England-
based company for seven years, is stepping down after leading
Persimmon through a housing-market collapse in 2008 that
prompted companies to reduce costs and write down land values as
property demand slumped. The homebuilder is widening margins and
last year said it would return 1.9 billion pounds to
shareholders by 2021.  Home completions climbed to 9,903 from 9,360 a year ago and
the average selling price of Persimmon’s properties rose about 6
percent to 175,640 pounds. Revenue rose 12 percent to 1.72
billion pounds.  Persimmon fell 1.2 percent, or 11 pence, to 898.5 pence in
 London  trading, giving the company a market value of 2.7 billion
pounds. The shares earlier climbed as much as 2.5 percent to 932
pence in London trading, the highest since November 2007.  Operating Margin  While the operating margin, excluding exceptional items and
goodwill impairments, widened to 13 percent from 10 percent,
margin growth is likely to slow, according to Farley.  “Last year, we made good strides with a 3 percent increase
in the operating margin,” he said by phone. “It’s not going to
be possible to repeat that again because as you get closer and
closer to those targets, you’re getting to the natural run rate
of the business.”  Persimmon said it expects its underlying operating margin
to reach as much as 17 percent within the next 18 months.
Forward sales increased 9 percent to 1.01 billion pounds.  The company has about 16,100 acres (6,515 hectares) in its
 land bank  and around 59 percent of that is in the southern
England. Jeff Fairburn will replace Farley, the company said
last month.  Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS) , another U.K. homebuilder, said net
income rose 75 percent to 40.9 million pounds last year. The
company’s revenue gained 17 percent to about 426 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
