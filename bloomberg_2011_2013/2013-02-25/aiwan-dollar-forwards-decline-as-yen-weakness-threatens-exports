Taiwan dollar  forwards weakened on
concern the yen’s slide to a 33-month low will hurt the island’s
exports.  Government bonds  gained.  The yen reached its weakest level since May 2010 on
speculation Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will name Asian
Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda as governor of the
 Bank of Japan. (8301)  Kuroda said this month the central bank has
“really substantial room” for further policy loosening. Taiwan
and Japan compete in the global market for electronics. Overseas
funds sold $95 million more local stocks than they bought today,
taking net purchases in 2013 to $1.8 billion, exchange data show.  “The Taiwan dollar will continue to weaken in line with
the yen’s decline,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based foreign-
exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “The pace of
depreciation should be steady, as it’s countered by stock
inflows.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent to
NT$29.645 per dollar as of 4:53 p.m. local time, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. In the  spot market , the currency weakened 0.2
percent to NT$29.702, according to prices from Taipei Forex Inc.
It has lost 1.9 percent in the past three months, the second-
worst performer in Asia after the yen. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, rose 20 basis points to 5.15 percent.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  Abe is likely to present Kuroda to the Japanese Diet in the
middle of this week,  Kyodo News  reported, citing unidentified
government sources.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 dropped
one basis point to 1.22 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
