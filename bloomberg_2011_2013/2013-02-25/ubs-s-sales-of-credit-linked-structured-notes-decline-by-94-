UBS AG (UBSN) ’s sales of credit-linked
notes plunged 94 percent in 2013 after the Swiss bank sold more
than twice as many securities as any other issuer last year.  Switzerland’s biggest lender has raised $26.1 million from
issuing two credit-linked notes this year, down from $401.7
million and 57 notes during the same period in 2012, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stephanie Aneto, a spokeswoman
for UBS in London, declined to comment.  UBS sold $25 million of 10-year securities tied to South
Korean government debt on Jan. 7, as well as $1.1 million of
five-year notes tied to  Peugeot SA (UG)  Jan. 30, Bloomberg data show.  The Zurich-based bank’s sales are the least since 2009.
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  also sold the least securities in four years, while
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  issued the smallest amount since 2000.
Germany’s biggest bank raised $71.5 million from the sale of 10
notes, 78 percent less than the $322.5 million of volume a year
earlier, Bloomberg data show.  London-based Barclays issued $143.7 million of the
securities, down 21 percent from $181.6 million a year earlier,
Bloomberg data show.  Nick Bone, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in London, and
Jodie Gray, a London-based spokeswoman for Barclays, declined to
comment.  UBS also arranged $105.2 million of credit-linked notes for
Luxembourg-incorporated special purpose vehicle VIS Finance SA,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Germany’s DZ Bank AG and Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg
together with UBS led sales of $43 billion of credit-linked
notes in Europe and Asia in 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compared with $40.4 billion the previous year,
and was the most since $55.2 billion of issuance in 2008.  DZ Bank  is the leading issuer of the securities in 2013,
having sold $2.81 billion of the notes, more than twice its
$1.12 billion total at this time last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
