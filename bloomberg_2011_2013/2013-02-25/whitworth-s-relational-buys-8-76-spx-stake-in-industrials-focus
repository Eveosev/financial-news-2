Ralph Whitworth’s Relational
Investors LLC disclosed a stake in  SPX Corp. (SPW) , adding another
investment in an industrial company, and urged it to sell assets
and hone its acquisition strategy.  Relational reported an 8.76 percent stake in Charlotte,
North Carolina-based SPX, according to a filing today, making it
the second-largest  shareholder  behind BlackRock Inc.  “Despite the company’s attractive business mix, total
shareholder returns and profitability have lagged peers’ due
primarily to excessive prices paid for acquisitions,”
Relational said.  Since January 2012, Relational has taken a stake in  Timken
Co. (TKR)  to urge the bearings maker to spin off its steel unit and
used shareholdings in  Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW)  to push for
change.  SPX  rose  2 percent to $81.76 at 12:49 p.m. in  New York . The
stock had advanced 14 percent this year through Feb. 22 compared
with a 6.3 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  SPX, which produces industrial equipment for a variety of
industries, ended talks in December to by rival Gardner Denver
Inc. after shareholders balked at the deal. Relational said
today that SPX should abandon its “growth-at-any-cost
strategy,” boost profit margins to the level of peers and link
executive pay more to value creation.  If it fails to achieve this, “the company should explore
strategic alternatives for better achieving the long-term
intrinsic value of the assets,” Relational said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
