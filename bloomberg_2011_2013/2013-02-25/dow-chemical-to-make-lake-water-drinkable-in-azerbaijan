Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical producer, is helping build the world’s biggest surface
water ultrafiltration plant in  Azerbaijan  with HidroLotus LLC.  The facility in Baku, where work began in June and will be
completed this year, will turn water from Ceyranbatan Lake into
one of the main clean-drinking sources for the city’s 3 million
residents, Midland, Michigan-based Dow  said  in a statement.  Dow Water & Process Solutions and HidroLotus, a venture
between Azeri Hidro Group and Turkish Lotus Group, gave no terms
for the contract. The plant’s ultrafiltration technology will
use double-walled, hollow-fiber membranes that cut the energy
needed to filter water for drinking, remove particulates and
reduce operating costs, according to the Feb. 20 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
