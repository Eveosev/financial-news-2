Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. auto-rental chain, rose after
projecting full-year profit and sales that exceeded analysts’
estimates as it benefits from its acquisition of Dollar Thrifty
Automotive Group Inc.  Hertz  gained  1.7 percent to $19.04 at the close in  New
York . The shares have advanced 17 percent this year compared
with a 4.3 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Adjusted earnings per share for 2013 will rise to $1.82 to
$1.92, on sales of as much as $10.95 billion, the  Park Ridge ,
 New Jersey  based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected $1.73 a share on revenue of $10.6 billion, the
averages of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Hertz  acquired  Dollar Thrifty last year for about $2.6
billion.  “Our operating strengths and strategic investments are
expected to help yield breakout results from 2013 through 2015
in the forms of further margin expansion and accelerated cash
flow generation,” Mark Frissora, Hertz’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement.  Hertz posted a fourth-quarter loss of $36.4 million, or 9
cents a share, compared with a  profit  of $47.1 million, or 11
cents, a year earlier, the company said today. Excluding $144.1
million, or 24 cents a share, in costs related to the
acquisition of  Dollar Thrifty , profit totaled 33 cents a share.
Analysts anticipated profit of 31 cents, on average.  Sales rose 15 percent to $2.32 billion, compared with the
$2.24 billion average of  analysts’ estimates .  To contact the reporters on this story:
