National Central Cooling Co. (TABREED)  headed
for the biggest drop in almost 10 months on concern minority
shareholders may have their positions diluted by a dividend
payout to Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Co.  The United Arab Emirates utility known as Tabreed slumped
5.9 percent, set for the largest decline since May 6, to 1.59
dirhams as of 1:04 p.m. in Dubai, on volume of 2.3 times the
three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
stock was the biggest decliner on the  benchmark DFM General
Index , which was little changed.  Tabreed, whose shares rallied the most in Dubai last year,
said today it planned to pay its first cash dividend in eight
years of 5 fils a share for 2012, as a recovery in the U.A.E.
property market boosts demand for its air-conditioning systems.
Mubadala, which owns almost  15 percent  of Tabreed, is entitled
to an equivalent payment as a bondholder, which it will accept
as notes that can be converted into shares by April 2019.  “The stock is falling on further dilution concerns, as
Mubadala is also entitled to the dividend,” said Marwan Shurrab, vice-president at Dubai-based Gulfmena Investments Ltd.  Mubadala in 2011 agreed to provide Tabreed long-term
capital of 1.7 billion dirhams ($463 million) in mandatory
convertible notes due 2019 and a loan facility of as much as 1.4
billion dirhams. Tabreed said in December it will convert 1.13
billion dirhams of loans from Mubadala into mandatory
convertible bonds.  Shares of Tabreed have rallied another 31 percent this year
after last year’s 144 percent jump. The company is benefiting
from an increase in demand for air-conditioners as Gulf
Cooperation Council countries, which have yearlong sunshine,
pursue infrastructure expansion.  The company, whose 2012 profit jumped 29 percent, operates
59 plants in the U.A.E. and six in other Gulf countries,
according to its financial statements. It last paid a cash
dividend in 2004 and paid a seven percent stock dividend in
2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
