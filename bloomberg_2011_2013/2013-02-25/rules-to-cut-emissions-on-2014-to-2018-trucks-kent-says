Canada  is introducing new rules to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from heavy trucks built in 2104
to 2018, Environment Minister Peter Kent said in a statement.  The new rules, which will apply to full-size pick-ups,
semi-trucks, garbage trucks and buses, will cut emissions by 19
megatons over the life of the vehicles and bring Canadian
standards closer into line with the U.S.â€™s, Kent said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
